<title>Abstract</title><p>The α-arrestins form a large family of evolutionally conserved modulators that control diverse signaling pathways, including both G-protein-coupled receptor- (GPCR-) mediated and non-GPCR mediated pathways, across eukaryotes. However, unlike β-arrestins, only a few α-arrestin targets and functions have been characterized. Here, using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we constructed interactomes for six human and twelve <italic>Drosophila</italic> α- arrestins. The resulting high-confidence interactomes comprised 307 and 467 prey proteins in human and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, respectively. A comparative analysis of these interactomes predicted not only conserved binding partners, such as motor proteins, proteases, ubiquitin ligases, RNA splicing factors, and GTPase-activating proteins, but also those specific to mammals, such as histone modifiers and the subunits of V-type ATPase. Given the manifestation of the interaction between the human α-arrestin, TXNIP, and the histone-modifying enzymes, including HDAC2, we undertook a global analysis of transcription signals and chromatin structures that were affected by TXNIP knockdown. We found that TXNIP activated targets by blocking HDAC2 recruitment to targets, a result that was validated by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Additionally, the interactome for an uncharacterized human α-arrestin ARRDC5 uncovered multiple components in the V-type ATPase, which plays a key role in bone resorption by osteoclasts. Our study presents conserved and species-specific protein-protein interaction maps for α-arrestins, which provide a valuable resource for interrogating their cellular functions for both basic and clinical research.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The discovery of first arrestin protein in retinal rods contributed to a deeper understanding of photoreceptor signaling mediated by rhodopsin, which is one of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) class, and after its ability to arrest the GPCR signaling pathway, the protein was first named as “arrestin” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Kuhn, Hall, &amp; Wilden, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Wilden, Wust, Weyand, &amp; Kuhn, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Zuckerman &amp; Cheasty, 1986</xref>). Shortly after this discovery of the first arrestin protein in the retina, another arrestin protein that specifically turns off β-adrenergic signaling, another type of GPCR, through “receptor desensitization” was identified and named “β-arrestin” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Benovic, DeBlasi, Stone, Caron, &amp; Lefkowitz, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Lohse, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Shenoy &amp; Lefkowitz, 2011</xref>). Further studies have revealed that β-arrestins regulate the receptor desensitization of other signaling pathways through ubiquitination and regulation of trafficking of various cargo molecules (Y. M. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Kim &amp; Benovic, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Malik &amp; Marchese, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Puca &amp; Brou, 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Another class of arrestin, α-arrestin, was first studied in fungi and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Andoh, Hirata, &amp; Kikuchi, 2002</xref>) and subsequently recognized as new class of arrestins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Boase &amp; Kelly, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Herranz et al., 2005</xref>). They contain characteristic arrestin domains, arrestin_N and arrestin_C, and PPXY motifs, which are unique to the α-arrestin clan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Puca &amp; Brou, 2014</xref>). A phylogenetic study of arrestin proteins showed that α-arrestins are the ancestral class of the arrestin family and conserved from yeast to human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Alvarez, 2008</xref>). To date, six α-arrestins, arrestin domain containing protein 1 (ARRDC1), ARRDC2, ARRDC3, ARRDC4, ARRDC5, and thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), have been found to be in the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Zbieralski &amp; Wawrzycka, 2022</xref>). These human α-arrestins were first studied in conjunction with β-arrestins in the regulation of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) in human cells. ARRDC3 and ARRDC4 works as an adaptor protein for the ubiquitination of β2AR by recruiting the NEDD4 protein, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, through its conserved PPXY motifs (S. O. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Han, Kommaddi, &amp; Shenoy, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Nabhan, Pan, &amp; Lu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Shea, Rowell, Li, Chang, &amp; Alvarez, 2012</xref>). In addition to their β2AR-associated roles, α-arrestins are involved in trafficking and sorting of other GPCRs and signaling molecules through post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination. For example, ARRDC1 and ARRDC3 were reported to play roles in the degradation of the Notch receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Puca, Chastagner, Meas-Yedid, Israel, &amp; Brou, 2013</xref>) and in the ubiquitination of ALG-2-interacting protein X (ALIX) (Dores, Lin, N, Mendez, &amp; Trejo, 2015). Uniquely, ARRDC1 have been reported to mediate microvesicle budding by recruiting E3 ligases, such as WW domain-containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase2 (WWP2). This recruitment leads to its own ubiquitination. Additionally, ARRDC1 possesses a PSPA motif that binds the tumor susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101) protein, an essential component of an endosomal sorting complex that is also required for this ARRDC1 mediated microvesicle budding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Nabhan, Hu, Oh, Cohen, &amp; Lu, 2012</xref>). Another well-known α-arrestin, TXNIP, was first named as vitamin D3-upregulated protein 1 (VDUP1) after verification that its gene is a vitamin D3 target in cancer cells (K. S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chen &amp; DeLuca, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Qayyum, Haseeb, Kim, &amp; Choi, 2021</xref>). Since then, TXNIP had been reported to directly interact with thioredoxin, which is an essential component of the cellular redox system, to inhibit its activity as an antioxidant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Junn et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Nishiyama et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Patwari, Higgins, Chutkow, Yoshioka, &amp; Lee, 2006</xref>). TXNIP was also reported to inhibit glucose uptake by inducing the internalization of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) through clathrin-mediated endocytosis and by indirectly reducing GLUT1 RNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). Although the TXNIP is known to be localized in both cytoplasm and nucleus, biological functions of TXNIP have been mostly explored in cytoplasm but remained poorly characterized in nucleus.</p>
<p>A few α-arrestins appear to have evolutionarily conserved functions in both human and invertebrates. For instance, the Hippo signaling pathway, which impacts a variety of cellular processes such as metabolism, development, and tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Mo, Park, &amp; Guan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Pei et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Schutte et al., 2014</xref>; Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Zhi, Zhao, Zhou, Liu, &amp; Chen, 2012</xref>), was shown to be regulated by α-arrestin in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kwon et al., 2013</xref>) and human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Xiao et al., 2018</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the protein Leash was identified as an α-arrestin and shown to down-regulate Yki by promoting its lysosomal degradation, leading to a restriction in growth (Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kwon et al., 2013</xref>). In human cells, ARRDC1 and ARRDC3 were shown to induce degradation of the mammalian homolog of Yki, YAP1, by recruiting the E3 ubiquitin ligase ITCH in renal cell carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Xiao et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting functional homology between human and <italic>Drosophila</italic>. However, because the α-arrestins interact with multiple targets, an unbiased, comparative analysis of interactome is required to determine whether other α-arrestin from human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> have common and specific interacting partners, which will determine their functional homology and diversification.</p>
<p>A comprehensive understanding of their protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and interactomes will shed light on the underlying molecular mechanisms, reveal novel regulatory axes, and enable the identification of previously unrecognized roles of α-arrestin in cellular processes. Furthermore, extensive characterization of the α-arrestin interactomes may help uncover potential therapeutic targets and provide valuable insights into the treatment of diseases associated with dysregulated signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Diaz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Lu, Simin, Khan, &amp; Mercurio, 2008</xref>; Q. Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Zhou, Tardivel, Thorens, Choi, &amp; Tschopp, 2010</xref>). However, to date, no comprehensive and comparative analysis of PPIs associated with α- arrestins has been conducted.</p>
<p>In this study, we conducted affinity purification/mass spectrometry (AP/MS) of six human and twelve <italic>Drosophila</italic> α-arrestins. A high-confidence PPI network was constructed by selecting a cut-off for receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of Significance Analysis of INTeractome express (SAINTexpress) scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Teo et al., 2014</xref>). The constructed interactomes were validated using known affinities between domains of prey proteins and the short linear motifs of α-arrestins. We also investigated orthologous relationships between binding partners from human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> and found that many proteins with both known and novel functions could be conserved between two species. Finally, we performed experiments to provide new insights into the functions of TXNIP and ARRDC5 that were revealed in our study. Together, our results provide a valuable resource that describes the PPI network for α-arrestins in both human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> and suggest novel regulatory axes of α-arrestins.</p>

<p>Genome-scale sets of prey proteins interacting with α-arrestins (referred to herein as ‘interactomes’) were compiled by conducting AP/MS for six human and twelve <italic>Drosophila</italic> α- arrestin proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>; Table S1). Proteins possibly interacting with α-arrestins were pulled down from total cell lysates of human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) and S2R+ cells stably expressing GFP-tagged α-arrestins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>; Figure S1). All α-arrestin experiments were replicated twice, and negative control experiments were conducted multiple times. In total, 3,243 and 2,889 prey proteins involved in 9,908 and 13,073 PPIs with human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> α-arrestins, respectively, were initially detected through AP/MS.</p>

<p>To build high-confidence interactomes of α-arrestin family proteins, a probabilistic score for individual PPIs was estimated using SAINTexpress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Teo et al., 2014</xref>) and an optimal cutoff for the scores was set using positive and negative PPIs of α-arrestin from public databases and the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Colland et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dotimas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Draheim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Mellacheruvu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Nabhan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Nishinaka et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Puca &amp; Brou, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Szklarczyk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Warde-Farley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Wu et al., 2013</xref>) (Tables S2). The resulting ROC curves showed high area under curve (AUC) values and the SAINTexpress scores at which the false discovery rate (FDR) was 0.01 were selected as cutoffs (0.85 for human and 0.88 for <italic>Drosophila,</italic> <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Given the cutoffs, 1,306 and 1,732 PPIs involving 902 and 1,732 proteins were selected for human and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, respectively. Because proteins of low abundance (low spectral counts) are easily affected by a stochastic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Lundgren, Hwang, Wu, &amp; Han, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Old et al., 2005</xref>), the minimum spectral count of PPIs was set at 6, allowing us to select PPIs with higher confidence. In fact, the spectral counts of the filtered PPIs were highly reproducible between replicates (Figure S2A; Pearson’s correlations, 0.91 for human; 0.89 for <italic>Drosophila</italic>) and principal component analysis based on log<sub>2</sub> spectral counts also confirmed a high reproducibility between replicates (Figure S2B). As a result, we successfully identified many known interaction partners of α-arrestins such as NEDD4, WWP2, WWP1, ITCH and TSG101, previously documented in both literatures and PPI databases (Figure S2C-F) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Colland et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dotimas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Draheim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Mellacheruvu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Nabhan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Nishinaka et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Puca &amp; Brou, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Szklarczyk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Warde-Farley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, we greatly expanded repertoire of PPIs associated with α-arrestins in human and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, resulting in 390 PPIs between six α-arrestins and 307 prey proteins in human, and 740 PPIs between twelve α-arrestins and 467 prey proteins in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Figure S2E). These are subsequently referred to as ‘high-confidence PPIs’ (Table S3).</p>

<title>Short-linear motifs and protein domains enriched in α-arrestins and their interactomes</title>
<p>To validify our high-confidence PPIs, we sought to analyze known short-linear motifs in α-arrestins, which are commonly 3-15 stretches of amino acids that are known to participate in interactions with other protein domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dinkel et al., 2015</xref>). Utilizing the known affinities between short linear motifs in α-arrestins and protein domains in interactomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">El-Gebali et al., 2019</xref>; UniProt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Consortium, 2018</xref>) from eukaryotic linear motif (ELM) database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dinkel et al., 2015</xref>), we evaluated whether our high-confidence PPIs could be explained by the known affinities between them (Table S4). The fractions of our high-confidence PPIs (green, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> top), supported by the known affinities were significantly greater than those of all raw PPIs (red, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> top) in both species (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 9.37 × 10<sup>-11</sup> for human and <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0012 for <italic>Drosophila</italic>, one-sided Fisher’s exact test, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> top). One of the most well-known short-linear motifs in α-arrestin is PPxY, which is reported to bind with high affinity to the WW domain found in various proteins, including ubiquitin ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ingham, Gish, &amp; Pawson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Macias et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Sudol, Chen, Bougeret, Einbond, &amp; Bork, 1995</xref>). Our analysis revealed the specific enrichment of WW domain-containing proteins in the interactomes of α-arrestins with at least one PPxY motif but not in that of the human α-arrestin (ARRDC5) without a PPxY motif (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, bottom-left). The interactomes of five out of the eight <italic>Drosophila</italic> α-arrestins with a PPxY motif were enriched for WW domain-containing proteins, but there was no such enrichment for any of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> α-arrestins without a PPxY motif (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, bottom-right). In conclusion, a considerable portion of the high-confidence PPIs identified in this study can be evident by known affinities between short-linear motifs and protein domains.</p>
<p>Next, we conducted enrichment analyses of Pfam proteins domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">El-Gebali et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Huang da, Sherman, &amp; Lempicki, 2009b</xref>) among interactome of each α-arrestin to investigate known and novel protein domains commonly or specifically associated (Figure S3A; Table S5). The most prominent interacting domains in both species were the Homologous to E6AP C-terminus (HECT), WW, and C2 domains (FigureS3A; Table S5). HECT and C2 domains are well known to be embedded in the E3 ubiquitin ligases such as NEDD4, HECW2, and ITCH along with WW domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ingham et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Melino et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Rotin &amp; Kumar, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Scheffner, Nuber, &amp; Huibregtse, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Weber, Polo, &amp; Maspero, 2019</xref>) and as we observed strong preference of WW domains to PPxY containing proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), these domains were significantly enriched in binding proteins of α-arrestins with PPxY motif in human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (FDR &lt; 0.033 ∼ 1.23 × 10<sup>-11</sup> for human; FDR &lt; 0.045 ∼ 4.10 × 10<sup>-6</sup> for <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Figure S3A ; Table S5). Other common protein domains involved in the protein degradation process, such as proteasome domains, were also significantly enriched in the interactomes (of ARRDC4 in human and Leash in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) in both species (FDR &lt; 6.41 × 10<sup>-4</sup> for human and FDR &lt; 1.30 × 10<sup>-5</sup> for <italic>Drosophila,</italic> Figure S3A; Table S5). Interestingly, some α-arrestins (ARRDC3 in human and Vdup1, Leash, and CG18746 in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) appeared to interact in common with RNA binding domains, such as DEAD box, helicase, WD40, and RNA recognition motif, but others did not. In addition, the cargo and motor protein domains IBN_N (FDR &lt; 0.0076 for human and FDR &lt; 2.50 × 10<sup>-4</sup> ∼ 2.11 × 10<sup>-6</sup> for <italic>Drosophila</italic>) and myosin_head (FDR &lt; 0.033 for human and FDR &lt; 2.11 × 10<sup>-6</sup> for <italic>Drosophila</italic>) also interacted with several α-arrestins in common (ARRDC4 in human and CG1105, CG18745, and CG18748 in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> Figure S3A; Table S5). These enriched domains explain the conserved interactomes associated with RNA splicing and protein transport in both species. In addition, human α-arrestins seem to interact with human-specific domains, such as PDZ, Rho-GEF, MCM, laminin, zinc finger, and BAG6 domains, providing an expanded interactomes of human α-arrestins (Figure S3A; domains in black), indicating the presence of both conserved and specific protein domains interacting with α-arrestins.</p>

<title>Expanded functional signatures of α-arrestin interactomes</title>
<p>Because the functions of α-arrestins can be inferred based on their binding partners, the prey proteins were grouped based on their interactions with α-arrestins, which revealed specialized functions of the respective α-arrestins with some redundancy as well as both known and novel functions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). The analysis of protein class enrichment by the PANTHER classification system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Thomas et al., 2003</xref>) revealed previously reported functions, such as ‘Ubiquitin ligase’ (FDR &lt; 0.0019 and 5.01 × 10<sup>-7</sup> for human; Benjamini-Hochberg correction) and ‘Protease’ (FDR &lt; 1.93 × 10<sup>-6</sup> for human and 5.02 × 10<sup>-6</sup> for <italic>Drosophila</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dores et al., 2015</xref>; Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kwon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Nabhan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Puca et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Rauch &amp; Martin-Serrano, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Shea et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Xiao et al., 2018</xref>). In fact, the known binding partners, NEDD4, WWP2, WWP1, and ITCH in human and CG42797, Su(dx), Nedd4, Yki, Smurf, and HERC2 in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, that were detected in our data are related to ubiquitin ligases and protein degradation (C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen &amp; Matesic, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ingham et al., 2004</xref>; Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kwon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Marin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Melino et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Rotin &amp; Kumar, 2009</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>; Figure S2F). In addition, novel biological functions of α-arrestins were uncovered. For instance, in human, prey proteins interacting with ARRDC3 displayed enrichment of ‘RNA splicing factor and helicase’ functions as well as ‘GTPase-activating proteins’, those of ARRDC4 were enriched with ‘Apolipoprotein’, and those of ARRDC5 with ‘ATP synthase’ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, up). Motor protein, protease, ubiquitin ligase, RNA splicing factor, and helicase were functions that were also enriched in <italic>Drosophila</italic> prey proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, bottom). Among them, the motor protein and RNA splicing, and helicase functions seemed to be novel conserved functions between human and <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The functional compositions of the interacting proteins summarized the common or highly specialized functions of α-arrestins well (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, right panel). For example, in human, proteins that interacted with TXNIP, ARRDC2, and ARRDC4 showed similar ubiquitination and protease-related functions, whereas ARRDC3 and ARRDC5 displayed unique interactomes associated with other functions. For <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the interactomes of the [Vdup1, CG10086 and CG18744], [CG18748 and CG18747], and [CG1105 and CG14696] α-arrestin subsets each exhibited similar functional compositions, but the Leash interactome showed a distinct enrichment of ubiquitination-related and protease functions, consistent with prior reports highlighting Leash’s role in the lysosomal degradation of hippo signaling pathway component, Yki (Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kwon et al., 2013</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that the resulting high-confidence PPIs of α-arrestins expanded the functional interactome maps of α-arrestins in both human and <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p>

<title>Subcellular localizations of α-arrestin interactomes</title>
<p>Cellular localizations of proteins often provide valuable information of their functions and activity, but only a small number of α-arrestins are known for their preferential subcellular localization. We thus examined the subcellular localizations of the interacting proteins using the cellular component feature in Gene Ontology (GO) using DAVID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Huang da, Sherman, &amp; Lempicki, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Huang da et al., 2009b</xref>) (Figure S3B; Table S6). Prey proteins (246 for human and 245 for <italic>Drosophila</italic>) that were localized in at least one cellular compartment were examined. We found that prey proteins of ARRDC5 were preferentially localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and at the plasma membrane but were less often localized in the nucleus, compared to those of other human α-arrestins (Figure S3B, top). Similarly, the prey proteins of ARRDC1 and 4 were less often localized in the nucleus, instead being preferentially localized in the cytoplasm (ARRDC4) or extracellular space (ARRDC1), in agreement with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Nabhan et al., 2012</xref>; Q. Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). TXNIP seemed to preferentially interact with prey proteins in cytoplasm and nucleus (Figure S3B, bottom), consistent with a previous report (S. K. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kim, Choe, &amp; Park, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Saxena, Chen, &amp; Shalev, 2010</xref>). ARRDC3, which was suggested to be localized in cytoplasm in previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Nabhan et al., 2010</xref>), appeared to interact with proteins preferentially localized in nucleus in addition to the ones in cytoplasm, implying novel functions of ARRDC3 in the nucleus. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the localization of interacting proteins is often uncharacterized compared to human, but a preference for a localization for part of the interactomes can be observed (Figure S3B, bottom). Some of them are preferentially localized at the plasma membrane (CG18747), mitochondria (CG14696), peroxisome (CG14696), lysosome (CG2641), or cytoskeleton (CG18748), compared to others. However, interactomes of Leash, Vdup1, CG2641, CG18745, CG18746, and CG10086 are preferentially localized in the nucleus. Taken together, these data about the preferential localizations of interacting proteins provide evidence about the functions and activity of α-arrestins in cells.</p>

<title>Functional complexes in α-arrestin interactomes</title>
<p>The fact that protein functions are often realized in complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hartwell, Hopfield, Leibler, &amp; Murray, 1999</xref>) urged us to search for functional complexes that extensively interact with α-arrestins. For this analysis, protein complexes that are significantly connected with each α-arrestin were examined using the COMPlex Enrichment Analysis Tool (COMPLEAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Vinayagam et al., 2013</xref>), resulting in the detection of 99 and 18 protein complexes for human and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, respectively (Table S7). The complexes were iteratively combined with cellular components from GO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Huang da et al., 2009b</xref>) (Table S7) based on the overlap coefficients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Vijaymeena &amp; Kavitha, 2016</xref>). The significance of the resulting combined complexes was then tested with the connectivity to each α-arrestin using the interquartile means (IQMs) of SAINTexpress scores compared to those from 1000 random cohorts. This approach showed that 33 clustered complexes comprising 335 protein subunits were significantly interacting with six human α-arrestins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>; Figure S4A, FDR &lt; 0.2) and 20 clustered complexes comprising 220 subunits were significantly interacting with <italic>Drosophila</italic> α- arrestins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>; Figure S4B, FDR &lt; 0.2).</p>

<p>The two largest complexes found to interact with α-arrestins were related to protein degradation (proteasome and ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis) and RNA splicing and processing in both species (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>; Figure S4). ARRDC1, 2, and 4 and TXNIP in human and Leash and CG2993 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> were found to interact with protein degradation complexes. While the association of ARRDC3 with these ubiquitination-dependent proteolysis complexes is statistically insignificant, ARRDC3 does interact with individual components of these complexes such as NEDD4, NEDD4L, WWP1, and ITCH (Figure S4A). This suggest their functional relevance in this context, as previously reported in both literatures and databases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Nabhan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Shea et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Szklarczyk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Warde-Farley et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Puca &amp; Brou, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Xiao et al., 2018</xref>). On the other hand, ARRDC2 and 3 in human and Leash, CG18746, Vdup1, CG10086, and CG18744 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> were found to interact with RNA splicing and processing complexes. Although the above-mentioned α-arrestins interacted in common with the two complexes described above, they were also found to bind to distinct complexes. For instance, TXNIP specifically binds to transcriptional and histone deacetylase (HDAC) complexes, ARRDC1 to endosomal sorting and laminin complexes, ARRDC2 to the Set1C/COMPASS complex, ARRDC3 to transcription elongation factors (TEFs) and spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) and cell polarity complexes, and ARRDC4 to clathrin-coated pit and BAT3 complexes in human. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Leash specifically binds to AP-2 adaptor and WASH complexes and CG18746 to the UTP B complex. ARRDC5 is specifically associated with V-type ATPase and vacuolar protein sorting complexes in human. CG18748 is associated with motor protein complexes including actin, myosin, and microtubule-associated complexes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Taken together, the results from this analysis provide a glimpse of underexplored roles for α-arrestins in diverse cellular processes.</p>

<title>Conserved interactomes of α-arrestins</title>

For this analysis, we searched for orthologous relationships in the α-arrestin interactomes using the DRSC Integrative Ortholog Prediction Tool (DIOPT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hu et al., 2011</xref>). Among high-confidence prey proteins, 68 in human and 64 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> were reciprocally predicted to have ortholog relationships, defining 58 orthologous prey groups (DIOPT score ≥ 2; Table S8). α-arrestins were then hierarchically clustered based on the log<sub>2</sub>-transforemd mean spectral counts of these orthologous interactome, defining seven groups of α-arrestins. Orthologous prey proteins were grouped according to their shared biological function, defining nine functional groups and others of diverse functions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). The resulting clusters revealed PPIs that were functionally conserved. For instance, ARRDC3 in human and CG18746 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> actively interact with proteins in RNA binding and splicing groups. Leash in <italic>Drosophila</italic> appeared to interact with proteins in similar functional groups as ARRDC3 but, like ARRDC1, it also extensively interacts with members of ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis groups. In addition, ARRDC4 interacts with proteins in the motor protein and trafficking group, similar to CG18748 in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and binds to proteins in the ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis group, similar to TXNIP. Similarly, CG10086 and Vdup1, CG14696 and ARRDC5, and CG2993 and ARRDC2 appeared to have conserved interactomes between human and <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p>

<p>The most prominent functional modules shared across both species were the ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, endosomal trafficking, and small GTPase binding modules, which are in agreement with the well-described functions of α-arrestins in membrane receptor degradation through ubiquitination and vesicle trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dores et al., 2015</xref>; S.

In contrast, the functional modules involving cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinase, casein kinase complex, and laminin seemed to be conserved between relatively specific sets of α-arrestins, whereas those related to motor proteins and RNA binding and splicing were more generally conserved. Taken together, the comparative analyses led us to identification of detailed, orthologous interactome maps of α-arrestins, which extend beyond the limited insights provided by sequence-based comparative analysis alone (Figure S5). Conserved roles of α-arrestins in both established and previously uncharacterized signaling pathways expand our understanding of the diverse roles of α-arrestins in cellular signaling.</p>

<title>Chromatin accessibility is globally decreased under TXNIP depletion</title>
<p>TXNIP is one of the most well-studied α-arrestins. Previous studies reported that TXNIP interacts with transcriptional repressors, such as FAZF, PLZF, and HDAC1 or HDAC3, to exert antitumor activity (S. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Han et al., 2003</xref>) or repress NF-kB activation (H. J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Kwon et al., 2010</xref>). However, although such studies provided information about interactions with a few transcriptional repressors, they barely provided a systematic view of the roles of TXNIP in controlling the chromatin landscape and gene expression. In that sense, our PPI analysis first revealed that TXNIP extensively binds to chromatin remodeling complexes, such as the HDAC and histone H2B ubiquitination complexes, as well as to transcriptional complexes, such as the RNA polymerase II and transcription factor IIIc complexes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>; Figure S4A). Such PPIs indicate that TXNIP could control transcriptional and epigenetic regulators. To examine how the global epigenetic landscape is remodeled by TXNIP, we knocked down its expression in HeLa cells with a small interfering RNA (siTXNIP) and confirmed a decrease at both the RNA and protein levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A and B</xref>). We then produced two biological replicates of ATAC- and RNA-seq experiments in HeLa cells with TXNIP depletion (Table S9) to detect differentially accessible chromatin regions (dACRs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>; Table S10). The replicated samples of both ATAC- and RNA-seq were well grouped in principle component spaces (Figure S6A and B). The normalized ATAC-seq signal and the RNA level of expressed genes clearly showed the enrichment of open chromatin signals around the transcription start sites (TSSs) of genes that are actively transcribed (Figure S6C). We detected 70,746 high-confidence accessible chromatin regions (ACRs) across all samples, most of which were located in gene bodies (38.74%), followed by intergenic regions (32.03%) and promoter regions (29.23%, Figure S7A). TXNIP knockdown appeared to induce a global decrease in chromatin accessibility in many genomic regions including promoters (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Of the high-confidence ACRs, 7.38% were dACRs under TXNIP depletion; most dACRs showed reduced chromatin accessibility under this condition (dACRs(-), <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>; Figure S7B). dACRs(-) were preferentially localized in gene bodies, whereas dACRs(+) were more often observed in promoter regions (Figure S7C).</p>

<p>The global chromatin changes induced by TXNIP knockdown could impact gene expression at corresponding loci. In fact, our gene expression analysis showed that 956 genes were downregulated, and 295 genes were upregulated by TXNIP knockdown compared to the control (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>), suggesting that the global decrease in chromatin accessibility induced by TXNIP depletion would mediate the repression of gene expression. To confirm this phenomenon, we first selected sets of differentially (“Up” and “Down” in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>) and non-differentially expressed genes (“None” in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>) with at least one detectable ACR in promoter or gene body. Next, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of changes in chromatin accessibilities demonstrated that the genes with decreased RNA level (“Down”) showed significantly reduced chromatin accessibilities at promoters compared to those with no changes in the RNA level (“None”) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 7.24 × 10<sup>-20</sup> for max changes; Figure S7D; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 2.60 × 10<sup>-24</sup> for mean changes, Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test). In contrast, genes with increased RNA expression (“Up”) exhibited no changes in chromatin accessibilities at the promoter (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.68 for max changes; Figure S7D; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.49 for mean changes, KS test), indicating that chromatin opening at promoters is necessary but not sufficient to induce gene expression.

We then used GO analysis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Raudvere et al., 2019</xref>) to examine the biological functions of genes that exhibited decreased chromatin accessibility at their promoter and decreased RNA expression upon TXNIP knockdown (Table S11). In general, genes associated with developmental process, signaling receptor binding, cell adhesion and migration, immune response and extracellular matrix constituents appeared to be repressed upon TXNIP depletion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>).</p>

<title>TXNIP represses the recruitment of HDAC2 to target loci</title>
<p>Given that TXNIP knockdown led to a global reduction in chromatin accessibility with decreased transcription, we focused on identifying the potential role of the epigenetic silencer HDAC2, one of the strong binding partners of TXNIP in the AP/MS analysis, in mediating the TXNIP-dependent epigenetic and transcriptional modulation. Consistent with the AP/MS data, immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments showed that the two proteins indeed interact with each other. Furthermore, TXNIP knockdown reduced the amount of TXNIP-interacting HDAC2 protein but did not affect the HDAC2 expression level (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). To find out how the TXNIP-HDAC2 interaction impacts the epigenetic and transcriptional reprogramming of target loci, we first checked whether the TXNIP-HDAC2 interaction causes cytosolic retention of HDAC2 to inhibit nuclear HDAC2-mediated global histone deacetylation. However, both the expression level and subcellular localization of HDAC2 were unaffected by a reduction in TXNIP, as confirmed by western blot analysis using cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions as well as by an immunofluorescence assay (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>; Figure S8A), indicating that TXNIP might modulate HDAC2 activity in a different way.</p>

<p>We next asked if the transcriptional suppression of TXNIP-target genes was mediated by changes in HDAC2 recruitment to and histone acetylation of chromatin. To address this question, genes that were significantly downregulated by TXNIP knockdown and that contained at least one dACR in the promoter were selected by the following additional criteria: 1) the RNA level in normal HeLa cells is ≥ 10 TPM and 2) the total ATAC-seq read count at the promoter in siTXNIP-treated HeLa cells is reduced ≥ 1.5-fold compared to that in normal cells. Among the four TXNIP-target genes selected by the above-mentioned criteria, the expression levels of CD22 and L1CAM were significantly reduced (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, Student’s t-test, Figure S8B). The two genes were further examined to determine whether the levels of HDAC2-binding signal and histone acetylation in their promoter regions were changed upon TXNIP knockdown (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). We observed that RNA- and ATAC-seq coverages in exonic and promoter region of CD22 and L1CAM genes were clearly reduced upon TXNIP depletion (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> top) and an analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) signals for HDAC2 and histone H3 acetylation at each dACR(-) detected in the L1CAM and CD22 promoters revealed that TXNIP knockdown increased the recruitment of HDAC2 to TXNIP-target loci, accompanied by decreased histone H3 acetylation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> bottom). Therefore, these results suggest that the TXNIP interaction with HDAC2 inhibits the chromatin occupancy of HDAC2 and subsequently reduces histone deacetylation to facilitate global chromatin accessibility.</p>
<p>HDAC2 typically operates within the mammalian nucleus as part of co-repressor complexes as it lacks ability to bind to DNA directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hassig, Fleischer, Billin, Schreiber, &amp; Ayer, 1997</xref>). The nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation (NuRD) complex is one of the well-recognized co-repressor complexes that contains HDAC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kelly &amp; Cowley, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Seto &amp; Yoshida, 2014</xref>) and we sought to determine if depletion of TXNIP affects interaction between HDAC2 and other components in this NuRD complex. While HDAC2 interacted with MBD3 and MTA1 under normal condition, the interaction between HDAC2 and MBD3 or MTA1 was not affected upon TXNIP depletion (Figure S8C). Next, given that HDAC2 phosphorylation is known to influence its enzymatic activity and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adenuga &amp; Rahman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Adenuga, Yao, March, Seagrave, &amp; Rahman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bahl &amp; Seto, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Tsai &amp; Seto, 2002</xref>), we tested if TXNIP depletion alters phosphorylation status of HDAC2. The result indicated, however, that phosphorylation status of HDAC2 does not change upon TXNIP depletion (Figure S8D). In summary, our findings suggest a model where TXNIP plays a role in transcriptional regulation independent of these factors (Figure S8E). When TXNIP is present, it directly interacts with HDAC2, a key component of transcriptional co-repressor complex. This interaction suppresses the HDAC2 ‘s recruitment to target genomic regions, leading to the histone acetylation of target loci possibly through active complex including histone acetyltransferase (HAT). As a result, transcriptional activation of target gene occurs. In contrast, when TXNIP expression is diminished, the interaction between TXNIP and HDAC2 weakens. This restores histone deacetylating activity of HDAC2 in the co-repressor complex, leading to subsequent repression of target gene transcription.</p>

<title>ARRDC5 plays a role in osteoclast differentiation and function</title>
<p>Given that various subunits of the V-type ATPase interact with ARRDC5, we speculated that ARRDC5 might be involved in the function of this complex (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). V-type ATPase plays an important role in the differentiation and function of osteoclasts, which are multinucleated cells responsible for bone resorption in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Feng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Qin et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that ARRDC5 might be also important for osteoclast differentiation and function. To determine whether ARRDC5 affects osteoclast function, we prepared osteoclasts by infecting bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) with lentivirus expressing either GFP-GFP or GFP-ARRDC5 and differentiating the cells into mature osteoclasts. After five days of differentiation, ectopic expression of GFP-ARRDC5 had significantly increased the total number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive multinucleated cells compared to GFP-GFP overexpression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). In particular, the number of TRAP-positive osteoclasts with a diameter larger than 200 μm was significantly increased by GFP-ARRDC5 overexpression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>), suggesting that ARRDC5 expression increased osteoclast differentiation. Depletion of ARRDC5 using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) impaired osteoclast differentiation, further affirming its crucial role in this differentiation process (Figure S9A and B). Additionally, the area of resorption pits produced by GFP-ARRDC5-expressing osteoclasts in a bone resorption pit assay was approximately 4-fold greater than that of GFP-GFP-expressing osteoclasts (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). These results imply that ARRDC5 promotes osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption activity.</p>

<p>The V-type ATPase is localized at the osteoclast plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Toyomura et al., 2003</xref>) and its localization is important for cell fusion, maturation, and function during osteoclast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Feng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Qin et al., 2012</xref>).

We analyzed changes in the expression level and localization of V-type ATPase, especially V-type ATPase V1 domain subunit (ATP6V1), in GFP-GFP and GFP-ARRDC5 overexpressing osteoclasts. The level of V-type ATPase expression did not change in osteoclasts regardless of ARRDC5 expression levels (Figure S9C). GFP signals were detected at the cell membrane when GFP-ARRDC5 was overexpressed, indicating that ARRDC5 might also localize to the osteoclast plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>; Figure S9D). In addition, we detected more V-type ATPase signals at the cell membrane in the GFP-ARRDC5 overexpressing osteoclasts, and ARRDC5 and V-type ATPase were co-localized at the osteoclast membrane (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>; Figure S9D). Notably, bafilomycin A1 treatment reduced not only the V-type ATPase signals detected at the cell membrane but also the GFP-ARRDC5 signals (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). These results indicate that ARRDC5 might control the plasma membrane localization of the V-type ATPase during osteoclast differentiation and function.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we constructed high-confidence interactomes of α-arrestins from human and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, comprising 307 and 467 interacting proteins, respectively. The resulting interactomes greatly expanded previously known PPIs involving α-arrestins and the majority of interactomes were first reported in this study, which needs to be validated experimentally. However, some known PPIs were missed in our interactomes due to low spectral counts and SAINTexpress scores, probably resulting from different cellular contexts, experimental conditions, or other factors (Figure S2F). According to a phylogenetic analysis of arrestin family proteins, α-arrestins were shown to be ubiquitously conserved from yeast to human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Alvarez, 2008</xref>). However, compared to the more established visual/ β-arrestin proteins, α- arrestins have been discovered more recently and much of their molecular mechanisms and functions remain mostly unexplored except for budding yeast model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Zbieralski &amp; Wawrzycka, 2022</xref>). Based on the high-confidence interactomes of α-arrestins from human and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we identified conserved and specific functions of these α-arrestins. Furthermore, we uncovered molecular functions of newly discovered function of human specific α-arrestins, TXNIP and ARRDC5. We anticipate that the discovery made here will enhance current understanding of α-arrestins.</p>
<p>Integrative map of protein complexes that interact with α-arrestins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>; Figure S4) hint towards many aspects of α-arrestins’s biology that remain uncharacterized. For example, role of α-arrestins in the regulation of β2AR in human remained controversial. One study proposed that α-arrestins might act coordinately with β-arrestins at the early step of endocytosis, promoting ubiquitination, internalization, endosomal sorting and lysosomal degradation of activated GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Shea et al., 2012</xref>). The another study, however, proposed different hypothesis suggesting that α-arrestins might act as secondary adaptor localized at endosomes to mediate endosomal sorting of cargo molecules (S. O. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Han et al., 2013</xref>). Among the protein complexes that interact with α-arrestins, we identified those related with clathrin-coated pit in human (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>; Figure S4A) and AP-2 adaptor complex in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>; Figure S4B). They are multimeric proteins to induce internalization of cargo molecules to mediate clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which suggests involvement of α-arrestins in early step of endocytosis.</p>
<p>The integrative map of protein complexes also highlighted both conserved and unique relationships between α-arrestins and diverse functional protein complexes. For instance, protein complexes involved in ubiquitination-dependent proteolysis, proteasome, RNA splicing, and intracellular transport (motor proteins) were prevalently linked with α-arrestins in both human and <italic>Drosophila</italic>. To more precisely identify conserved PPIs associated with α-arrestins, we undertook ortholog predictions within the α-arrestins’ interactomes. This revealed 58 orthologous interaction groups that were observed to be conserved between human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Among conserved proteins, proteins known to interact with human α- arrestins, such as NEDD4, WWP2, WWP1, and ITCH, were identified along with its orthologs in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which are Su(dx), Nedd4, and Smurf, implying that regulatory pathway of ubiquitination-dependent proteolysis by α-arrestins is also present in invertebrate species. Besides the known conserved functions, the novel conserved functions of α-arrestins interactomes were also identified, such as RNA splicing (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Because our protocol did not include treatment with RNase before the AP/MS, it is possible that RNA binding proteins could co-precipitate with other proteins that directly bind to α-arrestins through RNAs, and thus could be indirect binding partners. Nevertheless, other RNA binding proteins except for RNA splicing and processing factors were not enriched in our interactomes, indicating that this possibility may be not the case. Thus, it might be of interest to explore how α-arrestins are linked to RNA processing in future. Additionally, interaction between α-arrestins and entities like motor proteins, small GTPase, ATP binding proteins, and endosomal trafficking components were identified to be conserved. Further validation of these interactions could unveil molecular mechanisms consistently associated with these cellular functions.</p>
<p>Some protein complexes and functional modules were found to be involved in specific cellular processes discovered in only human, suggesting that some functional roles of α- arrestins have diverged through evolution. As examples of specific cellular functions of α- arrestins, we explored the biological relevance of two interacting protein complexes: 1) the interaction between TXNIP and chromatin remodelers and 2) the interaction between ARRDC5 and the V-type ATPase complex. Given that TXNIP interacts with chromatin remodelers, such as the HDAC, we speculated that chromatin structures could be affected by the interactions. Although we showed that siTXNIP treatment directed a global decrease in chromatin accessibilities and gene expression by inhibiting the binding of HDAC2 to targets, histones themselves could be also controlled by the interaction between TXNIP and the H2B ubiquitination complex. An impact of TXNIP on histone ubiquitination could strengthen the negative regulation of target loci by siTXNIP treatment. In addition, TXNIP interacts with the proteasome, which induces the degradation of binding partners (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>; Figure S4A). However, we observed that the cellular level and localization of HDAC2 were not affected by TXNIP reduction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A and B</xref>; Figure S8A), meaning that the proteasome seems not to be involved in TXNIP’s influence on HDAC2; rather, TXNIP directly hinders HDAC2 recruitment to target loci.</p>
<p>Because the V-type ATPase plays a key role in osteoclast differentiation and physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Feng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Qin et al., 2012</xref>), we investigated a possible role for the ARRDC5-V-type ATPase interaction in this cell type. We demonstrated that the ectopic expression of ARRDC5 enhances both the differentiation of osteoclasts into their mature form and their bone reabsorption activity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B and C</xref>). Conversely, depletion of ARRDC5 reduces osteoclast maturation, underscoring the pivotal role of ARRDC5 in osteoclast development and function (Figure S9A and B). Additionally, ARRDC5 co-localized with the V-type ATPase at the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>; Figure S9D). Thus, further characterization of ARRDC5 and its interactome in osteoclasts might clarify how ARRDC5 regulates the V-type ATPase to play a role in osteoclast differentiation and function. With the results, the discovery of new binding partners and their functions of TXNIP and ARRDC5 will facilitate the further investigations to explore the novel PPIs of α-arrestins.</p>
<p>Given the plethora of PPIs uncovered in this study, we also anticipate that our study could provide insight into many disease models. In fact, despite a limited knowledge of their biology, α-arrestins have already been linked to a range of cellular processes and several major health disorders, such as diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Batista et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Wondafrash et al., 2020</xref>), cardiovascular diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Domingues, Jolibois, Marquet de Rouge, &amp; Nivet-Antoine, 2021</xref>), neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Tsubaki, Tooyama, &amp; Walker, 2020</xref>), and tumor progression (Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Mohankumar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Oka et al., 2006</xref>), making them potential therapeutic targets. We further explored association between α-arrestins’ interactomes and disease pathways (Figure S10). Notably, the interactomes of α-arrestins in human showed clear links to specific diseases. For instance, ARRDC5 is closely associated with disease resulting from viral infection and cardiovascular conditions. ARRDC2, ARRDC4, and TXNIP share common association with certain neurodegenerative diseases, while ARRDC1 is implicated in cancer. Lastly, to assist the research community, we have made comprehensive α-arrestin interactome maps on our website (<underline>big.hanyang.ac.kr/alphaArrestin_PPIN</underline>). Researchers can search and download their interactomes of interest as well as access information on potential cellular functions and protein class associated with these interactomes.</p>

<title>SAINTexpress analysis</title>
<p>To identify high-confidence bait-prey PPIs, spectral counts of AP/MS data from S2R+ and HEK293 cells were subjected to the SAINTexpress algorithm (version 3.6.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Teo et al., 2014</xref>), which calculates the probability of authenticity for each bait-prey PPI. The program outputs the SAINTexpress scores and the Bayesian false discovery rates (BFDR) based on the spectral count distribution of true and false PPI sets. Before calculating the scores, bait-to-bait self-interactions were removed manually. SAINTexpress was run with the “-R 2” parameter, which specifies the number of replicates, and the “-L 3” parameter, which specifies the number of representative negative control experiments to be considered.</p>

To assess the integrity of the total RNA, samples are run on the TapeStation RNA screentape (#5067-5576, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Only high-quality RNA preparations, with RNA integrity number greater than 7.0, were used for RNA library construction. A library was independently prepared with 1ug of total RNA for each sample by Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Prep Kit (#RS-122-2101, Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The first step in the workflow involves purifying the poly-A containing mRNA molecules using poly-T-attached magnetic beads. Following purification, the mRNA is fragmented into small pieces using divalent cations under elevated temperature. The cleaved RNA fragments are copied into first strand cDNA using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (#18064014, Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and random primers. This is followed by second strand cDNA synthesis using DNA Polymerase I, RNase H and dUTP. These cDNA fragments then go through an end repair process, the addition of a single ‘A’ base, and then ligation of the adapters. The products are then purified and enriched with PCR to create the final cDNA library. The libraries were quantified using KAPA Library Quantification kits (#KK4854, KAPA BIOSYSTEMS, Wilmington, MA, USA) for Illumina Sequencing platforms according to the qPCR Quantification Protocol Guide and qualified using the TapeStation D1000 ScreenTape (#5067-5582, Agilent Technologies).

Lentivirus co-transfected media was prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions using the CRISPR &amp; MISSION® Lentiviral Packaging Mix (SHP002; Sigma Aldrich) and the lentiviral transfer vector. The lentiviral vector pHAGE-GFP-ARRDC5 was used to generate GFP-ARRDC5 overexpressing osteoclasts, and pHAGE-GFP-GFP served as the control vector. The pLKO.1-puro-CMV-tGFP vector (SHC003; Sigma Aldrich) was employed to generate ARRDC5 knockdown, which contains the target sequence 5’-CCACACCTTTGAACTTCCATTT-3’, and this vector was also used to generate its non-target control. After the incubation, the medium was replaced with fresh α-MEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. The medium was collected twice (after 24 and 48 hr), designated as lentiviral-containing medium, and stored in a deep freezer until used to infect BMMs.</p>

<title>TRAP staining and bone resorption pit assay</title>
<p>Osteoclast differentiation and activity were determined by TRAP staining and a bone resorption pit assay, respectively. TRAP staining was performed using a TRAP staining kit (PMC-AK04F-COS; Cosmo Bio Co., LTD., Tokyo, Japan) following the manufacturer’s instructions. TRAP-positive multinucleated cells with more than three nuclei were counted under a microscope using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). The bone resorption pit assay was performed using dentin discs (IDS AE-8050; Immunodiagnostic Systems, Tyne &amp; Wear, UK). Cells were differentiated to osteoclasts on the discs over a 4-day period, after which the discs were stained with 1% toluidine blue solution and the resorption pit area was quantified using ImageJ software.</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence staining of the V-type ATPase and visualization with GFP-ARRDC5</title>
<p>To inhibit V-type ATPase transport to the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Matsumoto &amp; Nakanishi-Matsui, 2019</xref>), osteoclasts on the fifth day of differentiation were incubated with 100 nM bafilomycin A1 (19-148; Sigma Aldrich) for 3 hr. Then, immunofluorescence staining was performed to visualize the localization of the V-type ATPase in bafilomycin A1-treated and untreated cells. The cells were fixed using a 4% paraformaldehyde solution (PC2031-100; Biosesang, Gyeonggi-do, Korea) and permeabilized using 0.05% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 5 min. The cells were incubated with anti-V-type ATPase antibody (SAB1402125-100UG; Sigma Aldrich) at room temperature for 1 hr, and then stained with the Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (A-21044; Invitrogen) at room temperature for 30 min. Finally, cells were mounted using Antifade Mountant with DAPI (P36962; Invitrogen). Fluorescence images were observed under a ZEISS confocal microscope (LSM5; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany).</p>

<p>The study provides a complete comparative interactome analysis of α-arrestin in both humans and drosophila. The authors have presented interactomes of six humans and twelve Drosophila α-arrestins using affinity purification/mass spectrometry (AP/MS). The constructed interactomes helped to find α-arrestins binding partners through common protein motifs. The authors have used bioinformatic tools and experimental data in human cells to identify the roles of TXNIP and ARRDC5: TXNIP-HADC2 interaction and ARRDC5-V-type ATPase interaction. The study reveals the PPI network for α-arrestins and examines the functions of α-arrestins in both humans and Drosophila. The authors have carried out the necessary changes that were suggested, and the manuscript can now be accepted.</p>
<p>Comments: I would like to congratulate the authors and the corresponding authors of this manuscript for bringing together such an elaborate study on α-arrestin and conducting a comparative study in drosophila and humans.</p>
<p>Introduction: The introduction provides a rationale behind why the comparison between humans and Drosophila is performed.</p>
<p>Results: The results cover all the necessary points concluded from the experiments and computational analysis. The images are elaborate and well-made. The authors have a rigorous amount of work added together for the success of this manuscript. The authors have provided a database of network of α-arrestins in both humans and Drosophila which can be used by other researchers working in the same subject to study the interacting genes.</p>
<p>Discussion: the authors have utilized and discussed the conclusion they draw from their study. But could highlight more on ARRDCs and why it was selected out of the other arrestins.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, the authors present a novel interactome focused on human and fly alpha-arrestin family proteins and demonstrate its application in understanding the functions of these proteins. Initially, the authors employed AP/MS analysis, a popular method for mapping protein-protein interactions (PPIs) by isolating protein complexes. Through rigorous statistical and manual quality control procedures, they established two robust interactomes, consisting of 6 baits and 307 prey proteins for humans, and 12 baits and 467 prey proteins for flies. To gain insights into the gene function, the authors investigated the interactors of alpha-arrestin proteins through various functional analyses, such as gene set enrichment. Furthermore, by comparing the interactors between humans and flies, the authors described both conserved and species-specific functions of the alpha-arrestin proteins. To validate their findings, the authors performed several experimental validations for TXNIP and ARRDC5 using ATAC-seq, siRNA knockdown, and tissue staining assays. The experimental results strongly support the predicted functions of the alpha-arrestin proteins and underscore their importance.</p>

<p>Lee, Kyungtae and colleagues have discovered and mapped out alpha-arrestin interactomes in both human and Drosophila through the affinity purification/mass spectrometry and the SAINTexpress method. Their work revealed highly confident interactomes, consisting of 390 protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between six human alpha-arrestins and 307 preproteins, as well as 740 PPIs between twelve Drosophila alpha-arrestins and 467 prey proteins.</p>
<p>To define and characterize these identified alpha-arrestin interactomes, the team employed a variety of widely recognized bioinformatics tools. These analyses included protein domain enrichment analysis, PANTHER for protein class enrichment, DAVID for subcellular localization analysis, COMPLEAT for the identification of functional complexes, and DIOPT to identify evolutionary conserved interactomes. Through these assessments, they not only confirmed the roles and associated functions of known alpha-arrestin interactors, such as ubiquitin ligase and protease, but also unearthed unexpected biological functions in the newly discovered interactomes. These included involvement in RNA splicing and helicase, GTPase-activating proteins, and ATP synthase.</p>
<p>The authors carried out further study into the role of human TXNIP in transcription and epigenetic regulation, as well as the role of ARRDC5 in osteoclast differentiation. It is particularly commendable that the authors conducted comprehensive testing of TXNIP's role in HDAC2 in gene expression and provided a compelling model while revised the manuscript. Additionally, the quantification of the immunocytochemistry data presented in Figure 6 convincingly supports the authors' hypothesis.</p>
<p>Overall, this study holds important value, as the newly identified alpha-arrestin interactomes are likely aiding functional studies of this protein group and advance alpha-arrestin research.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1</bold></p>
<p>The study provides a complete comparative interactome analysis of α-arrestin in both humans and drosophila. The authors have presented interactomes of six humans and twelve Drosophila α-arrestins using affinity purification/mass spectrometry (AP/MS). The constructed interactomes helped to find α-arrestins binding partners through common protein motifs. The authors have used bioinformatic tools and experimental data in human cells to identify the roles of TXNIP and ARRDC5: TXNIP-HADC2 interaction and ARRDC5-V-type ATPase interaction.

<p>Comments</p>
<p>I will like to congratulate the authors and the corresponding authors of this manuscript for bringing together such an elaborate study on α-arrestin and conducting a comparative study in drosophila and humans.</p>
<p>Introduction:</p>
<p>The introduction provides a rationale behind why the comparison between humans and Drosophila is carried out.</p>
<p>• Even though this is a research manuscript, including existing literature on similar comparison of α-arrestin from other articles will invite a wide readership.</p>
<p>Results:</p>
<p>The results cover all the necessary points concluded from the experiments and computational analysis.</p>
<p>1. The authors could point out the similarity of the α-arrestin in both humans and Drosophila. While comparing α-arrestin in both humans and Drosophila If percentage homology between α-arrestin of both Drosophila and humans needs to be calculated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your insightful feedback. As suggested by reviewer, we determined percentage homology of α-arrestin protein sequences from human and Drosophila using Clustal Omega. This homology is now illustrated as a heatmap in revised Figure S5. Please note that only the values with percentage homology of 40% or higher are selectively labeled.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Citing the direct connecting genes from the network in the text will invite citations and a wider readership.</p>
<p>Figures:</p>
<p>The images are elaborate and well-made.</p>
<p>1. The authors could use a direct connected gene-gene network that pointing interactions. This can be used by other readers working on the same topic and ensure reproducibility and citations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your valuable comment. Based on the reviewer’s suggestion, we have developed a new website in which one can navigate the gene-gene networks of α-arrestins. These direct connected gene-gene networks are housed in the network data exchange (NDEx) project. Additionally, we have included gene ontology and protein class details for α-arrestins’ interactors in these set of networks, offering a more comprehensive view of α-arrestins’ interactomes.</p>
<p>On page 24 lines 15-18, we have revised the manuscript to introduce the newly developed website, as follows.</p>
<p>“Lastly, to assist the research community, we have made  comprehensive α-arrestin interactome maps on our website (big.hanyang.ac.kr/alphaArrestin_PPIN). Researchers can search and download their interactomes of interest as well as access information on potential cellular functions and protein class associated with these interactomes.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>3-1) The co-expression interactions represented as figures should reveal interaction among the α-arrestin and other genes. Which are the sub-network genes does the α- arrestin interact to/ with from the sub-network? The arrows are only pointing at the sub-networks. The figures do not reveal their interaction. Kindly reveal the interaction in the figure with the proper nodes in the figure.</p>
<p>3-2) Figure 2: the network attached in both human and drosophila is well represented. The green lines from α-arrestin indicate the strength of the interaction. Several smaller expression networks are seen. But &quot;α-arrestin&quot; in both organisms seems highly disconnected from all the genes. Connected genes have edges, not arrows. If α-arrestin can be shown connected to these gene-gene networks will help in identifying which genes connect with which gene through α-arrestin. This can be used by other readers working on the same topic and ensure reproducibility and citations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable comment. In response to the reviewer’s recommendation, we’ve added supplementary figure, Figure S4, which illustrates direct interaction between α-arrestin and protein components of clustered complexes (or sub-networks) in addition to the associations shown between α-arrestins and the clustered complexes in Figure 2. We believe that this newly incorporated information regarding direct protein interactions will invite citations and wider readership as the reviewer pointed out.</p>
<p>On page 12 line 27 to page 13 line 5, we have revised the manuscript to cite the direction interactions between ARRDC3 and proteins involved in ubiquitination-dependent proteolysis, as follows.</p>
<p>“While the association of ARRDC3 with these ubiquitination-dependent proteolysis complexes is statistically insignificant, ARRDC3 does interact with individual components of these complexes such as NEDD4, NEDD4L, WWP1, and ITCH (Figure S4A). This suggest their functional relevance in this context, as previously reported in both literatures and databases (Nabhan et al., 2010; Shea et al., 2012; Szklarczyk et al., 2015; Warde-Farley et al., 2010) (Puca &amp; Brou, 2014; Xiao et al., 2018).”</p>
<p>Direct interaction between α-arrestins and protein components of clustered complexes are illustrated in the newly added figure, Figure S4.</p>

<p>We appreciate for valuable comment. Unfortunately, the protein blot image was scanned from the original film and the images we provided in the figure represent the highest resolution that we have obtained to date. Raw, uncropped images are shown in Author response image 1 and 2.</p>

<p>1. Figure: 5. A. - I see non-specific amplifications in the gel images. Are these blotting images? or the gel images that were changed to &quot;Grayscale&quot;? Non-specific amplification may imply that the experiment was not repeated and standardized. Was it gel images or blot images?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your insightful comment. The images in Figure 5A represent western blot bands from co-immunoprecipitation assay for analysis of the interaction between TXNIP and HDAC2 proteins. Since immunoblotting using immunoprecipitates can usually detect some non-specific bands from heavy (~ 50 kDa) and light (~25 kDa) chains of the target antibody or from multiple co-immunoprecipitated proteins, we assume that the vague non-specific bands in Figure 5A might be a heavy chain of TXNIP or HDAC2 antibody or an unclear non-specific band. Because target bands showed strong intensity and very clear pattern compared to the non-specific bands in the co-immunoprecipitation assay, we believe that this data is sufficient to support the interaction of TXNIP with HDAC2. Finally, In the revised Figure 5A, we’ve modified the labeling for different experimental conditions, namely siCon and siTXNIP treatments, and added expected size of proteins (kDa), as shown below.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Figure 5. A. RT-PCR analysis: What was your expected size of the amplifications? the ladder indicated is in KDa. Is that right?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your insightful questions. As mentioned above, Figure 5A shows the blotting images of co-immunoprecipitation analysis, and the ladder indicates the molecular weight (kDa) of protein markers. For clearer interpretation, the expected size of target proteins has been added in Figure 5A in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. How were the band intensities determined?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your question. For quantification of immunoblot results, the densities of target protein bands were analyzed with Image J, as we described in the Materials and Methods.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Discussion:</p>
<p>The authors have utilized and discussed the conclusion they draw from their study. But could highlight more on ARRDCs and why it was selected out of the other arrestins. The authors have provided future work directions associated with their work.</p>
<p>1. Why were only ARRDCs presented amongst all the arrestin in the main part of the manuscript?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We’re grateful for your valuable feedback. The reason we focused on α-arrestins was that α-arrestins have been discovered relatively recently, especially when compared to more established visual/ β-arrestin proteins in the same arrestin family but the biological functions of many α-arrestins remain largely unexplored, with notable exceptions in the budding yeast model and a few α-arrestins in mammals and invertebrate species. Most importantly, comparative study highlighting the shared or unique features of α-arrestins is yet to be undertaken. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of these unexplored α-arrestins across multiple species, we’ve centered our research on the ARRDCs within the arrestin protein family.</p>
<p>On page 21 lines 8-17, we’ve edited the manuscript to emphasize the importance of a comparative study on α-arrestins, as detailed below.</p>
<p>“According to a phylogenetic analysis of arrestin family proteins, α-arrestins were shown to be ubiquitously conserved from yeast to human (Alvarez, 2008). However, compared to the more established visual/ β-arrestin proteins, α-arrestins have been discovered more recently and much of their molecular mechanisms and functions remain mostly unexplored except for budding yeast model (Zbieralski &amp; Wawrzycka, 2022). Based on the high-confidence interactomes of α-arrestins from human and Drosophila, we identified conserved and specific functions of these α-arrestins. Furthermore, we uncovered molecular functions of newly discovered function of human specific α-arrestins, TXNIP and ARRDC5. We anticipate that the discovery made here will enhance current understanding of α-arrestins.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The discussion could be elaborated more by utilizing the data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your insightful feedback. Based on the reviewer’s suggestion, we’ve enhanced the discussion in the manuscript to provide a clearer interpretation of our results. First, we’ve added description of conserved protein complexes significantly associated with α-arrestins, stated on page 22 lines 5-12 and lines 23-26.</p>
<p>Page 22 lines 5-12:
“The integrative map of protein complexes also highlighted both conserved and unique relationships between α-arrestins and diverse functional protein complexes. For instance, protein complexes involved in ubiquitination-dependent proteolysis, proteasome, RNA splicing, and intracellular transport (motor proteins) were prevalently linked with α-arrestins in both human and Drosophila. To more precisely identify conserved PPIs associated with α-arrestins, we undertook ortholog predictions within the α-arrestins’ interactomes. This revealed 58 orthologous interaction groups that were observed to be conserved between human and Drosophila (Figure 3).”</p>
<p>Page 22 lines 23-26:
“Additionally, interaction between α-arrestins and entities like motor proteins, small GTPase, ATP binding proteins, and endosomal trafficking components were identified to be conserved. Further validation of these interactions could unveil molecular mechanisms consistently associated with these cellular functions.”</p>
<p>Secondly, we’ve added description of role of ARRDC5 in osteoclast maturation, as stated on page 23 lines 22-24.</p>
<p>“Conversely, depletion of ARRDC5 reduces osteoclast maturation, underscoring the pivotal role of ARRDC5 in osteoclast development and function (Figure S9A and B).”</p>
<p>Lastly, we examined the association between α-arrestins’ interactomes and human diseases, incorporating our findings into the discussion. The newly introduced figure based on the result is Figure S10.</p>
<p>On page 24 lines 10-14, we’ve added discussion on Figure S10 as follows.</p>
<p>“We further explored association between α-arrestins’ interactomes and disease pathways (Figure S10). Notably, the interactomes of α-arrestins in human showed clear links to specific diseases. For instance, ARRDC5 is closely associated with disease resulting from viral infection and cardiovascular conditions. ARRDC2, ARRDC4, and TXNIP share common association with certain neurodegenerative diseases, while ARRDC1 is implicated in cancer.”</p>

<p>In this manuscript, the authors present a novel interactome focused on human and fly alpha-arrestin family proteins and demonstrate its application in understanding the functions of these proteins. Initially, the authors employed AP/MS analysis, a popular method for mapping protein-protein interactions (PPIs) by isolating protein complexes. Through rigorous statistical and manual quality control procedures, they established two robust interactomes, consisting of 6 baits and 307 prey proteins for humans, and 12 baits and 467 prey proteins for flies. To gain insights into the gene function, the authors investigated the interactors of alpha-arrestin proteins through various functional analyses, such as gene set enrichment. Furthermore, by comparing the interactors between humans and flies, the authors described both conserved and species-specific functions of the alpha-arrestin proteins. To validate their findings, the authors performed several experimental validations for TXNIP and ARRDC5 using ATAC-seq, siRNA knockdown, and tissue staining assays. The experimental results strongly support the predicted functions of the alpha-arrestin proteins and underscore their importance. `</p>
<p>I would like to suggest the following analyses to further enhance the study:</p>
<p>1. It would be valuable if the authors could present a side-by-side comparison of the interactomes of alpha-arrestin proteins, both before and after this study. This visual summary network would demonstrate the extent to which this work expanded the existing interactome, emphasizing the overall contribution of this study to the investigation of the alpha-arrestin protein family.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate your insightful feedback. In response to the reviewer’s suggestion, we’ve depicted a network of known PPIs associated with α-arrestins (Figure S2C and D). Furthermore, by comparing our high-confidence PPIs to these known sets, we found that the overlaps are statistically significant and the high-confidence PPIs of α-arrestins broaden the existing interactome (Figure S2E).</p>
<p>From page 7 line 26 to page 8 line 8, we’ve detailed this side-by-side comparisons of existing interactome and newly discovered high-confidence PPIs of α-arrestins, as outline below.</p>
<p>“As a result, we successfully identified many known interaction partners of α-arrestins such as NEDD4, WWP2, WWP1, ITCH and TSG101, previously documented in both literatures and PPI databases (Figure S2C-F) (Colland et al., 2004; Dotimas et al., 2016; Draheim et al., 2010; Mellacheruvu et al., 2013; Nabhan et al., 2012; Nishinaka et al., 2004; Puca &amp; Brou, 2014; Szklarczyk et al., 2015; Warde-Farley et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2013). Additionally, we greatly expanded repertoire of PPIs associated with α-arrestins in human and Drosophila, resulting in 390 PPIs between six α-arrestins and 307 prey proteins in human, and 740 PPIs between twelve α-arrestins and 467 prey proteins in Drosophila (Figure S2E). These are subsequently referred to as ‘high-confidence PPIs’ (Table S3).”</p>

<p>1. While the authors conducted several analyses exploring protein function, there is a need to further explore the implications of the interactome in human diseases. For instance, it would be beneficial to investigate the association of the newly identified interactome members with specific human diseases. Including such investigations would strengthen the link between the interactome and human disease contexts.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable comment. As suggested by the reviewer, we examined the association between α-arrestins’ interactomes and human diseases, incorporating our findings into the discussion. The newly introduced figure based on the result is Figure S10.</p>
<p>On page 24 lines 10-14, we’ve added discussion on Figure S10 as follows.</p>
<p>“We further explored association between α-arrestins’ interactomes and disease pathways (Figure S10). Notably, the interactomes of α-arrestins in human showed clear links to specific diseases. For instance, ARRDC5 is closely associated with disease resulting from viral infection and cardiovascular conditions. ARRDC2, ARRDC4, and TXNIP share common association with certain neurodegenerative diseases, while ARRDC1 is implicated in cancer.”</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p>
<p>Lee, Kyungtae and colleagues have discovered and mapped out alpha-arrestin interactomes in both human and Drosophila through the affinity purification/mass spectrometry and the SAINTexpress method. They found the high confident interactomes, consisting of 390 protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between six human alpha-arrestins and 307 preproteins, as well as 740 PPIs between twelve Drosophila alpha-arrestins and 467 prey proteins. To define and characterize these identified alpha-arrestin interactomes, the team employed a variety of widely recognized bioinformatics tools. These included protein domain enrichment analysis, PANTHER for protein class enrichment, DAVID for subcellular localization analysis, COMPLEAT for the identification of functional complexes, and DIOPT to identify evolutionary conserved interactomes. Through these analyses, they confirmed known alpha-arrestin interactors' role and associated functions such as ubiquitin ligase and protease. Furthermore, they found unexpected biological functions in the newly discovered interactomes, including RNA splicing and helicase, GTPase-activating proteins, ATP synthase. The authors carried out further study into the role of human TXNIP in transcription and epigenetic regulation, as well as the role of ARRDC5 in osteoclast differentiation. This study holds important value as the newly identified alpha-arrestin interactomes are likely aiding functional studies of this group of proteins. Despite the overall support from data for the paper's conclusions, certain elements related to data quantification, interpretation, and presentation demand more detailed explanation and clarification.</p>
<p>1. In Figure 1B, it is shown that human alpha-arrestins were N-GFP tagged (N-terminal) and Drosophila alpha-arrestins were C-GFP (C-terminal). However, the rationale of why the authors used different tags for human and fly proteins was not explained in the main text and methods.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your valuable comment. Both N- and C-terminally tagged α-arrestins have been used previously. Given that our study aims to increase the repertoire of α-arrestin interacting proteins, where GFP is added might not be a concern. We note that GFP is a relatively bulky tag, and tagging a protein with GFP can potentially abolish the interaction with some of the binding proteins. Follow-up studies utilizing different approaches for detecting protein-protein interactions, such as BioID and yeast two-hybrid, will allow us to build more comprehensive α-arrestin interactomes.</p>

<p>1. In Figure 2A, there seems to be an error for labeling the GAL4p/GAL80p complex that includes NOTCH2, NOTCH1 and TSC2.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for comment. We double-checked COMPLEAT (protein COMPLex Enrichment Analysis Tool) database for the name of protein complex consisting of NOTCH1, NOTCH2, AND TSC2. The database indeed labeled this complex as the “GAL4p/GAL80p complex”. However, given the potential for mis-annotation (since we could not ascertain the relevance of these proteins to the “GAL4p/GAL80p complex”), we chose to exclude this protein complex from the network. The update protein complex network is illustrated in the revised Figure 2A.</p>

<p>1. In Figure 5, given that knockdown of TXNIP did not affect the levels and nuclear localization of HDAC2, the authors suggest that TXNIP might modulate HDAC2 activity. However, the ChiP assay suggest a different model - TXNIP-HDAC2 interaction might inhibit the chromatin occupancy of HDAC2, reducing histone deacetylation and increasing global chromatin accessibly. The authors need to propose a model consistent with these sets of all data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate your detailed feedback. Our data indicates a global decrease in chromatin accessibility (Figure 4C-G) and a diminished interaction between TXNIP and HDAC2 under depletion of TXNIP (Figure 5A). Additionally, we observed an increased occupancy of HDAC2 and subsequent histone deacetylation at TXNIP-target promoter regions (Figure 5C) without any changes in the HDAC2 expression level (Figure 5A) in TXNIP- knockdown cells. From these observations, we infer that the interaction between TXNIP-HDAC2 might suppress the function of HDAC2, a major gene silencer affecting the formation of condensed or accessible chromatin by deacetylating activity. Although we checked whether TXNIP could induce cytosolic retention of HDAC2 to inhibit nuclear function of HDAC2, TNXIP knockdown did not alter its subcellular localization (Figure 5B).</p>
<p>To elucidate the mechanism by which TXNIP inhibits the function of HDAC2, we further investigated the effect of TXNIP on the levels of HDAC2 phosphorylation, which is known to be crucial for its deacetylase activity and the formation of transcriptional repressive complex. However, as shown in the Figure S8C and D, the knockdown of TXNIP did not affect the HDAC2 phosphorylation status, as well as the interaction between HDAC2 and other components in NuRD complex in the immunoblotting and co-IP assays, respectively. The results suggest that TXNIP may inhibit the function of HDAC2 independently of these factors.</p>
<p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we carefully provided a proposed model describing the possible role of TXNIP in transcriptional regulation through interaction with HDAC2 and co-repressor complex in Figure S8E.</p>
<p>Description of these newly added figures can be found in the revised manuscript from page 18 line 7 to 27, as outlined below.</p>
<p>“HDAC2 typically operates within the mammalian nucleus as part of co-repressor complexes as it lacks ability to bind to DNA directly (Hassig, Fleischer, Billin, Schreiber, &amp; Ayer, 1997). The nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation (NuRD) complex is one of the well-recognized co-repressor complexes that contains HDAC2 (Kelly &amp; Cowley, 2013; Seto &amp; Yoshida, 2014) and we sought to determine if depletion of TXNIP affects interaction between HDAC2 and other components in this NuRD complex. While HDAC2 interacted with MBD3 and MTA1 under normal condition, the interaction between HDAC2 and MBD3 or MTA1 was not affected upon TXNIP depletion (Figure S8C). Next, given that HDAC2 phosphorylation is known to influence its enzymatic activity and stability (Adenuga &amp; Rahman, 2010; Adenuga, Yao, March, Seagrave, &amp; Rahman, 2009; Bahl &amp; Seto, 2021; Tsai &amp; Seto, 2002), we tested if TXNIP depletion alters phosphorylation status of HDAC2. The result indicated, however, that phosphorylation status of HDAC2 does not change upon TXNIP depletion (Figure S8D). In summary, our findings suggest a model where TXNIP plays a role in transcriptional regulation independent of these factors (Figure S8E). When TXNIP is present, it directly interacts with HDAC2, a key component of transcriptional co-repressor complex. This interaction suppresses the HDAC2 ‘s recruitment to target genomic regions, leading to the histone acetylation of target loci possibly through active complex including histone acetyltransferase (HAT). As a result, transcriptional activation of target gene occurs. In contrast, when TXNIP expression is diminished, the interaction between TXNIP and HDAC2 weakens. This restores histone deacetylating activity of HDAC2 in the co-repressor complex, leading to subsequent repression of target gene transcription.”</p>

<p>1. The authors showed that ectopic expression of ARRDC5 increased osteoclast differentiation and function. Does loss of ARDDC5 lead to defects in osteoclast function and fate determination?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your valuable comment. We have confirmed the endogenous expression of ARRDC5 in osteoclasts and conducted a loss-of-function study using shARRDC5. As determined by qPCR, ARRDC5 was endogenously expressed very low in osteoclasts. Even during RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation, the CT value (29-31) for ARRDC5 expression was high in osteoclasts compared to the CT value (17-24) for the expression of marker genes Cathepsin K, TRAP, and NFATc1. Even though its endogenous expression was very low, we generated ARRDC5 knockdown cells by infecting BMMs with lentivirus expressing shRNA of ARRDC5 and subsequently differentiated the cells into mature osteoclasts. After five days of differentiation, we observed a significant decrease in the total number of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells (No. of TRAP+ MNCs) in shARRDC5 cells compared to that in the control cells. This result indicates that the loss of ARRDC5 leads to defects in osteoclast differentiation. Result of this loss-of-function study using shARRDC5 is depicted in Figure S9A and B.</p>
<p>In the revised manuscript, following sentence explaining Figure S9A and B was added on page 19 lines 15-17 as follows.</p>
<p>“Depletion of ARRDC5 using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) impaired osteoclast differentiation, further affirming its crucial role in this differentiation process (Figure S9A and B).”</p>

<p>1. From Figure 6D, the authors argued that ARRDC5 overexpression resulted in more V-ATPase signals: however, there is no quantification. Quantification of the confocal images will foster the conclusion. Also, western blots for V-ATPase proteins will provide an alternative way to determine the effects of ARRDC5.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your insightful feedback. As suggested by the reviewer, we quantified V-type ATPase signals using confocal images, which were shown in Figure 6D. The ImageJ program was employed for integrated density measurements, and the integrated density of GFP-GFP overexpressing osteoclasts was set to 1 for relative comparison. The result in the revised Figure 6D revealed a significant increase in V-type ATPase signals in GFP-ARRDC5 overexpressing osteoclasts compared to that in GFP-GFP overexpressing osteoclasts, as outlined below.</p>
<p>We also agree with the reviewer’s comment that Western blot for V-ATPase proteins will be an alternative way to determine the effects of ARRDC5 in osteoclast differentiation. We have confirmed no different expression of V-type ATPase between GFP-GFP and GFP-ARRDC5 overexpressing osteoclasts using qPCR and western blot analysis. The corresponding western blot result is shown in the revised Figure S9C.</p>
<p>In addition, the corresponding qPCR that measures the expression level of V-type ATPase between GFP-GFP and GFP-ARRDC5 overexpressing osteoclasts is shown in Author response image 3.</p>

<p>Moreover, based on the references, the V-type ATPase is localized at the plasma membrane during osteoclast differentiation (Toyomura et al., 2003). Although mRNA and protein expression levels were similar in both cells, localization of V-ATPase in plasma membrane was significantly increased in GFP-ARRDC5 overexpressing osteoclasts compared to that in GFP-GFP osteoclasts, as shown in the revised Figure 6D above.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The results from Figure 6D did not support the authors' argument that ARRDC5 might control the membrane localization of the V-ATPase, as bafilomycin is the V-ATPase inhibitor. ARRDC5 knockdown experiments will help to determine whether ARRDC5 can control the membrane localization of the V-ATPase in osteoclast.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your insightful comment. V-type ATPase has been reported to play an important role in the differentiation and function of osteoclasts (Feng et al., 2009; Qin et al., 2012). Given that various subunits of the V-type ATPase interact with ARRDC5 (Figure 6A), we speculated that ARRDC5 might be involved in the function of this complex and play a role in osteoclast differentiation and function. As answered above, GFP-ARRDC5 overexpressing osteoclasts showed a similar expression level of V-type ATPase to GFP-GFP cells but exhibited increased V-type ATPase signals at the cell membrane compared to those in GFP-GFP cells (Figure 6D). Additionally, co-localization of ARRDC5 and V-type ATPase was observed in the osteoclast membrane (Figure 6D), as predicted by the human ARRDC5-centric PPI network. On the other side, bafilomycin A1, a V-type ATPase inhibitor, not only blocked localization of V-type ATPase to plasma membrane in GFP-ARRDC5 overexpressing osteoclasts, but also reduced ARRDC5 signals (Figure 6D). These results indicate that ARRDC5 plays a role in osteoclast differentiation and function by interacting with V-type ATPase and promoting the localization of V-type ATPase to plasma membrane in osteoclasts.</p>
<p>V-type ATPase present in osteoclast membrane is important to cell fusion, maturation, and function during osteoclast differentiation (Feng et al., 2009; Qin et al., 2012). GFP-ARRDC5 overexpressing osteoclasts showed a significant increase of V-type ATPase signals in the cell membrane compared to GFP-GFP cells (Figure 6D), and also significantly increased cell fusion (No. of TRAP+ MNCs in Figure 6B) and resorption activity (resorption pit formation in Figure 6C). However, ARRDC5 knockdown in osteoclasts (shARRDC5 cells) showed a significant decrease in No. of TRAP+ MNCs compared to that in the control cells, indicating that the loss of ARRDC5 leads to defects in cell fusion during osteoclast differentiation (Figure S9A and B). As described above, the endogenous expression of ARRDC5 was very low in osteoclasts and could be specifically expressed in a certain timepoint during the differentiation. Therefore, to better understand the interaction with V-type ATPase of ARRDC5 in osteoclasts, ARRDC5 overexpression is more suitable than its knockdown.</p>
<p>Part of the manuscript on page 19 line 21 to page 20 line 6 was edited to support our statement, as outlined below.</p>
<p>“The V-type ATPase is localized at the osteoclast plasma membrane (Toyomura et al., 2003) and its localization is important for cell fusion, maturation, and function during osteoclast differentiation (Feng et al., 2009; Qin et al., 2012). Furthermore, its localization is disrupted by bafilomycin A1, which is shown to attenuate the transport of the V-type ATPase to the membrane (Matsumoto &amp; Nakanishi-Matsui, 2019). We analyzed changes in the expression level and localization of V-type ATPase, especially V-type ATPase V1 domain subunit (ATP6V1), in GFP-GFP and GFP-ARRDC5 overexpressing osteoclasts. The level of V-type ATPase expression did not change in osteoclasts regardless of ARRDC5 expression levels (Figure S9C). GFP signals were detected at the cell membrane when GFP-ARRDC5 was overexpressed, indicating that ARRDC5 might also localize to the osteoclast plasma membrane (Figure 6D; Figure S9D). In addition, we detected more V-type ATPase signals at the cell membrane in the GFP-ARRDC5 overexpressing osteoclasts, and ARRDC5 and V-type ATPase were co-localized at the osteoclast membrane (Figure 6D; Figure S9D).”</p>
