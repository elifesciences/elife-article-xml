<title>Abstract</title><p>The target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway is highly conserved and plays a crucial role in diverse biological processes in eukaryotes. Despite its significance, the underlying mechanism of the TOR pathway in <italic>A. flavus</italic> remains elusive. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the TOR signaling pathway in <italic>A. flavus</italic> by identifying and characterizing nine genes that encode distinct components of this pathway. The FK506-binding protein Fkbp3 and its lysine succinylation are important for aflatoxin production and rapamycin resistance. The TorA kinase plays a pivotal role in the regulation of growth, spore production, aflatoxin biosynthesis, and responses to rapamycin and cell membrane stress. As a significant downstream effector molecule of the TorA kinase, the Sch9 kinase regulates aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> (AFB<sub>1</sub>) synthesis, osmotic and calcium stress response in <italic>A. flavus,</italic> and this regulation is mediated through its S_TKc, S_TK_X domains, and the ATP binding site at K340. We also showed that the Sch9 kinase may have a regulatory impact on the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) signaling pathway. TapA and TipA, the other downstream components of the TorA kinase, play a significant role in regulating cell wall stress response in <italic>A. flavus</italic>. Moreover, the members of the TapA-phosphatase complexes, SitA and Ppg1, are important for various biological processes in <italic>A. flavus</italic>, including vegetative growth, sclerotia formation, AFB<sub>1</sub> biosynthesis, and pathogenicity. We also demonstrated that SitA and Ppg1 are involved in regulating lipid droplets (LDs) biogenesis and cell wall integrity (CWI) signaling pathways. In addition, another phosphatase complex, Nem1/Spo7, plays critical roles in hyphal development, conidiation, aflatoxin production, and lipid droplets biogenesis. Collectively, our study has provided important insight into the regulatory network of the TOR signaling pathway and has elucidated the underlying molecular mechanisms of aflatoxin biosynthesis in <italic>A. flavus</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> is a highly significant phytopathogenic fungus that frequently contaminates a diverse array of agricultural crops, leading to substantial economic losses in the food and agriculture industry and posing considerable health risks, particularly in developing countries <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]</sup>. Moreover, <italic>A. flavus</italic> is recognized as an opportunistic human pathogenic fungus that can cause aspergillosis in immune-compromised patients <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]</sup>. The fungus is notorious for its production of aflatoxins (AFs), which are potent secondary metabolites with toxic and carcinogenic properties and are classified among the most powerful carcinogens known in nature, with established links to liver cancer in both humans and animals <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]</sup>. Aflatoxin biosynthesis is a multifaceted and intricate biochemical process encompassing a cascade of enzymatic reactions. Although the majority of the enzyme reactions and genes involved in aflatoxin biosynthesis have been elucidated <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]</sup>, the related signaling pathway network and specific regulatory mechanisms governing aflatoxin biosynthesis remain elusive. Therefore, exploring the regulatory mechanism of the aflatoxin biosynthesis signaling pathway would provide new insights for preventing <italic>A. flavus</italic> and aflatoxin contamination.</p>
<p>In eukaryotes, the target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway is highly conserved and plays essential roles in various significant biological processes, including ribosome biosynthesis, cell growth, and autophagy <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]</sup>. The serine/threonine-protein kinase Tor serves as a crucial protein component in the TOR signaling pathway, which interacts with other proteins to form multi-protein complexes <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]</sup>. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, TOR exists in two distinct multiprotein functional complexes, namely TORC1 and TORC2 <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]</sup>. TORC1-mediated signaling governs cellular growth by modulating various growth-related mechanisms and exhibits sensitivity to rapamycin. Conversely, TORC2-mediated signaling primarily regulates cytoskeletal remodeling but remains unaffected by rapamycin <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]</sup>. In yeast, there are two <italic>tor</italic> genes, <italic>tor1</italic> and <italic>tor2</italic>, whereas in higher eukaryotes such as plants, animals, and filamentous fungi, there is only one <italic>tor</italic> gene <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]</sup>.</p>
<p>In the fungal kingdom, the TOR signaling pathway has been extensively investigated in three prominent species: the budding yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]</sup>, the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]</sup>, and the human pathogen <italic>Candida albicans</italic> <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]</sup>. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the macrolide antibiotic rapamycin forms a complex with the cytosolic protein Fkbp12, which effectively inhibits the catalytic function of the Tor kinase by interacting with its FRB domain <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]</sup>. The Tap42 phosphatase complex serves as the primary target of the Tor kinase and plays a crucial role in the regulation of downstream effectors. Additionally, the Tap42 protein interacts with the Tip41 protein to collaboratively modulate the activities of phosphatases, including PP2A and Sit4 <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]</sup>. Among these, the Sit4 phosphatase is known to dephosphorylate the transcription factor Gln3, thereby regulating the nitrogen source metabolism pathway <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]</sup>. In addition, the AGC kinase Sch9, an immediate effector of TORC1, is involved in regulating various cellular functions processes, such as ribosome biosynthesis, translation initiation, and entry into the G<sub>0</sub> phase <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]</sup>. The TOR signaling pathway has been documented in various filamentous fungi, including <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]</sup>, <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]</sup>, <italic>Phanerochaete chrysosporium</italic> <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]</sup>, <italic>Podospora anserine</italic> <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]</sup>, <italic>A. nidulans</italic> <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]</sup>, <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]</sup>, <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]</sup>, <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]</sup>, <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]</sup>, and <italic>Mucor circinelloides</italic> <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]</sup>. However, the TOR signaling pathway in <italic>A. flavus</italic> remains unexplored.</p>
<p>In eukaryotic cells, the TOR signaling pathway and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways play an important role in regulating adaptive responses to extra- and intracellular conditions <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]</sup>. Several studies have demonstrated that the TOR signaling pathway interacts with various other signaling pathways, such as MAPK and cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway. These pathways are recognized to participate in crosstalk, forming a complex metabolic network that regulates cellular processes <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]</sup>. However, the underlying mechanisms of multiple crosstalks between the TOR and other signaling pathways in <italic>A. flavus</italic> remain largely unknown. Therefore, we intended to identify the genes associated with the TOR signaling pathway and elucidate their roles and contributions in regulating vegetative development and aflatoxin biosynthesis in <italic>A. flavus</italic>. Our results demonstrated that the TOR signaling pathway is involved in multiple cellular processes in <italic>A. flavus</italic>. Notably, our findings revealed a complex interplay between the TOR pathway and other signaling pathways (such as HOG and CWI) in <italic>A. flavus</italic>, which play a crucial role in regulating cellular growth and survival under environmental stress conditions.</p>

<title>Rapamycin exhibits inhibitory effects on the growth, sporulation, sclerotia formation, and aflatoxin production in <italic>A. flavus</italic></title>
<p>Rapamycin, a secondary metabolite synthesized by <italic>Streptomyces hygroscopicus</italic>, exhibits efficacy in suppressing specific filamentous fungi. In <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, rapamycin has a significant inhibitory impact on growth and asexual reproduction <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]</sup>. To investigate the effects of rapamycin on vegetative development, sclerotia formation, and secondary metabolism in <italic>A. flavus</italic>, we conducted an assay to determine the sensitivity of the wild-type (WT) strain to rapamycin. We observed that the WT strain exhibited a high sensitivity to rapamycin. We found that 100 ng/mL of rapamycin significantly inhibited mycelial growth and conidia formation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>). More importantly, the WT strain exhibited a significant reduction in sclerotia formation and aflatoxin synthesis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1G</xref>). Additionally, rapamycin resulted in a significant decrease in spore germination rate and sparser conidiophores (Fig. S1A, S1B). These results illustrated that the TOR signaling pathway may be involved in regulating the growth, development, and secondary metabolism of <italic>A. flavus.</italic> Calcofluor white is a chemifluorescent blue dye commonly employed for its nonspecific binding affinity to fungal chitin. Fluorescence microscopy analysis revealed a notable reduction in the blue fluorescence on the cell wall following treatment with rapamycin (Fig. S1C). The intracellular lipid droplets within the hyphae were labeled with BODIPY. We observed that the hyphae treated with rapamycin contained more lipid droplets compared to the control group (Fig. S1D). These findings suggest that the TOR pathway may play important roles in maintaining cell wall integrity and facilitating the biogenesis of lipid droplets.</p>

<p>To investigate the potential regulatory role of the TOR pathway in modulating the sporulation, sclerotia formation, and aflatoxin biosynthesis in <italic>A. flavus</italic>, we examined the expression levels of conidia-related, sclerotia formation-related, and aflatoxin-related genes after 3, 6, and 9 hours of treatment with rapamycin. To determine the effects of rapamycin on conidiation, qRT-PCR was conducted to assess the transcript levels of two conidia-related genes, <italic>abaA</italic> and <italic>brlA</italic>. We also conducted qRT-PCR to evaluate the expression levels of three regulators (<italic>nsdC</italic>, <italic>nsdD</italic>, and <italic>sclR</italic>) involved in sclerotia development, and genes involved in AFB<sub>1</sub> biosynthesis, such as the regulatory gene <italic>aflS</italic>, as well as several structural genes (<italic>aflC</italic> and <italic>aflQ</italic>). The strains treated with rapamycin exhibited a significant reduction in the expression levels of genes related to sporulation, sclerotia formation, and aflatoxin synthesis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1I</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1J</xref>). Overall, these results indicated that the TOR pathway plays a crucial role in regulating the growth, sporulation, sclerotia formation, and aflatoxin biosynthesis in <italic>A. flavu</italic>s by modulating the expression of these genes.</p>

<title>The impact of Fkbp3 and its lysine succinylation on AFB<sub>1</sub> biosynthesis and rapamycin resistance in <italic>A. flavus</italic></title>
<p>FK506-binding proteins (Fkbps) belong to a highly conserved immunophilin family, which are involved in various cellular functions, such as protein folding, immunosuppression, signaling transduction, and transcription <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]</sup>. Fkbps function as molecular switches by binding to target proteins and inducing conformational changes <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]</sup>. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, Fkbp12 and rapamycin interact to form a complex that exerts a negative regulatory effect on the activity of the Tor kinase <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]</sup>. The <italic>fkbp12</italic> gene homologue <italic>fprA</italic> in <italic>A. nidulans</italic> shares high levels of homology with that from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]</sup>. According to the protein sequence of FprA from <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, four genes encoding putative proteins with FK506 binding domain, named <italic>fkbp1</italic> (AFLA_126880), <italic>fkbp2</italic> (AFLA_087480), <italic>fkbp3</italic> (AFLA_010910), and <italic>fkbp4</italic> (AFLA_128200), have been identified from the <italic>A. flavus</italic> genome. We generated four <italic>fkbp</italic> knockout strains using homologous recombination, and all <italic>fkbp</italic> disruption strains were confirmed by PCR and sequencing analysis (Fig. S2). Phenotypic analyses showed that the mycelial growth and conidia formation of all the <italic>fkbp</italic> mutants were similar to the WT strain on the PDA medium (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), suggesting that Fkbps have minimal influence on the process of vegetative development. We evaluated AFB<sub>1</sub> synthesis utilizing thin layer chromatography (TLC), and the findings demonstrated a noteworthy reduction in AFB<sub>1</sub> synthesis upon deletion of Fkbp3, in comparison to the WT strain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). Additionally, the quantity of sclerotia exhibited a significant decrease in all <italic>fkbp</italic> mutants compared to the WT strain (Fig. S3A, S3B). The aforementioned data indicated that Fkbp3 plays a crucial role in sclerotia formation and aflatoxin biosynthesis in <italic>A. flavus</italic>.</p>

<p>To determine the specific Fkbp responsible for rapamycin sensitivity, all mutant strains were cultured on PDA solid plates amended with 100 ng/mL rapamycin. The strain with disrupted <italic>fkbp3</italic> showed significant resistance to rapamycin, while the deletion mutants of <italic>fkbp1</italic>, <italic>fkbp2</italic>, and <italic>fkbp4</italic> did not exhibit any alteration in resistance to rapamycin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, 2C). These results demonstrated that Fkbp3 serves as the principal target for rapamycin in <italic>A. flavu</italic>s. In the FK506-sensitivity analysis, we observed a significant suppression of mycelial growth and conidia formation in WT strain with the addition of 10 ng/mL FK506 to the PDA medium. Additionally, the deletion of <italic>fkbp3</italic> led to the heightened resistance to FK506 compared to the WT strain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). These findings suggested that Fkbp3 is mainly involved in the modulation of FK506 resistance in <italic>A. flavus</italic>.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that lysine succinylation plays a significant role in aflatoxin production and pathogenicity in <italic>A. flavus</italic> <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]</sup>. Based on the analysis of our succinylome data, we have identified six reliable succinylation sites (K5, K19, K40, K42, K55, and K65) on the Fkbp3 protein. To identify the function of Fkbp3 succinylation sites, site-directed mutations were constructed according to the homologous recombination strategy. Compared to the WT strain, all point mutants exhibited a similar phenotype in vegetative growth and conidiation. Interestingly, we observed that the K19A mutation resulted in increased resistance to rapamycin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>). Additionally, the K19A strain exhibited a significant reduction in the production of AFB<sub>1</sub> compared to the WT strain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2H</xref>). These findings suggested that the succinylation of Fkbp3 at K19 plays a crucial role in rapamycin resistance and aflatoxin biosynthesis. Furthermore, we found that various point mutants, including K40A, K42A, and K55A, exhibited reduced levels of AFB<sub>1</sub> production in comparison to the WT strain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2H</xref>), suggesting that the succinylation of Fkbp3 at other sites also contributes to AFB<sub>1</sub> biosynthesis in <italic>A. flavus</italic>. The above results indicated that the K19 site likely plays a more prominent role in Fkbp3 succinylation compared to other sites.</p>

<title>The TorA kinase plays a critical role in <italic>A. flavus</italic></title>
<p>In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the Tor kinase is known to interact with a diverse range of proteins, resulting in the formation of complex structures known as TORC1 and TORC2 <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]</sup>. TORC1 can detect various signals, including nutrients, growth factors, and environmental stress. It plays a crucial role in regulating cellular processes such as gene transcription, protein translation, ribosome synthesis, and autophagy <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]</sup>. To identify the ortholog of the Tor protein in <italic>A. flavus</italic>, the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Tor protein was utilized as search reference in the <italic>A. flavus</italic> genome database using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi">https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi</ext-link>). The genome of <italic>A. flavus</italic> contains a solitary ortholog of the <italic>tor</italic> gene (AFLA_044350), which encodes a protein exhibiting 48.91% similarity to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Tor2. To elucidate the role of <italic>torA</italic> in <italic>A. flavus</italic>, we attempted to obtain <italic>torA</italic> deletion strains by homologous recombination, but not successful. As an alternative approach, a mutant strain with a xylose promoter mutation, referred as <italic><sup>xylP</sup>torA</italic>, was constructed to validate the function of <italic>torA</italic>. Subsequent confirmation via PCR analysis ensured the integrity of the mutant strain. Xylan and xylose are highly effective inducers, whereas glucose strongly represses the activity of the promoter. To ascertain the impact of <italic>torA</italic> on <italic>A. flavus</italic>, we conducted a comparative analysis of <italic>torA</italic> transcript levels between the <italic><sup>xylP</sup>torA</italic> strain and the WT strain. Our findings revealed that the <italic>torA</italic> transcript levels in the <italic><sup>xylP</sup>torA</italic> strain were markedly reduced compared to the WT strain (Figure S4A). Both the WT strain and <italic><sup>xylP</sup>torA</italic> mutant were cultured in YXT medium supplemented with xylose and YGT medium devoid of xylose for a duration of 5 days at 37℃ under dark conditions. Remarkably, the <italic><sup>xylP</sup>torA</italic> strain exhibited complete inability to thrive in the absence of xylose, with only partial restoration of growth observed upon xylose supplementation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). Notably, the <italic><sup>xylP</sup>torA</italic> strain also demonstrated a markedly reduced growth rate on YXT compared to the WT strain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) assays indicated a noteworthy decrease in AFB<sub>1</sub> synthesis in the <italic><sup>xylP</sup>torA</italic> strain compared to the WT strain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>). Additionally, the <italic><sup>xylP</sup>torA</italic> strain produced fewer conidia and sclerotium formation was absent on YXT medium (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>, S5).

Collectively, these findings suggested that the TorA kinase plays a crucial role in various biological processes in <italic>A. flavus</italic>, including vegetative growth, asexual development, sclerotia formation, response to environmental stress, and biosynthesis of aflatoxins.</p>

<title>The Sch9 kinase is involved in aflatoxin biosynthesis and the HOG pathway</title>
<p>Sch9, a Ser/Thr kinase belonging to the AGC family, is directly phosphorylated by TORC1.

<p>In yeast, Sch9 plays an important role in the transcriptional activation of osmostress inducible genes <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]</sup>. To characterize the roles of Sch9 in stress response, we examined the sensitivity of the <italic>sch9</italic> deletion strain to various stresses including osmotic stress and calcium stress. Compared with the WT strain, the Δ<italic>sch9</italic> mutant significantly increased sensitivity to calcium stress (Fig. S6A, S6B), and decreased sensitivity to osmotic stress induced by NaCl and KCl (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4H</xref>). In <italic>A. flavus</italic>, the Sch9 kinase consists of several domains, including the protein kinase C conserved region 2 (C2), protein kinase (S_TKc), AGC-kinase C-terminal (S_TK_X) domain, and an ATP binding site (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). To explore the role of these domains and the ATP binding site in Sch9 kinase, we constructed deletion strains for both domains and a <italic>sch9</italic><sup>K340A</sup> mutant. The results revealed that the <italic>sch9</italic><sup>ΔS_TKc</sup> strain, <italic>sch9</italic><sup>ΔS_TK_X</sup> strain, and <italic>sch9</italic><sup>K340A</sup> mutant exhibited similar phenotypes in osmotic stress and AFB<sub>1</sub> production as the Δ<italic>sch9</italic> mutant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that the protein kinase domain, kinase C-terminal domain, and the ATP binding site at K340 play a crucial role in modulating the impact of Sch9 on aflatoxin biosynthesis and stress response in <italic>A. flavus</italic>.</p>
<p>To investigate the potential function of Sch9 in the HOG and TOR pathways in <italic>A. flavus</italic>, we conducted a sensitivity analysis of the Δ<italic>sch9</italic> strain to rapamycin. Compared to the WT strain, the <italic>sch9</italic> deletion strain exhibited a slightly higher sensitivity to rapamycin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>). The MAKP Hog1 is an element of the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway. To verify the connection between Sch9 and the HOG-MAPK pathway, the phosphorylation levels of Hog1 kinase were measured under osmotic stress (1M NaCl). Western blot analysis showed that the phosphorylation level of Hog1 increased significantly in the Δ<italic>sch9</italic> strain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). This finding suggested that Sch9 plays a pivotal role in modulating the response of Hog1 to osmotic stress.

<title>TapA and TipA participate in the regulation of cell wall stress response</title>
<p>Tap42, a protein that associates with phosphatase 2A, serves as the direct target of the Tor kinase in yeast. Tap42 plays a crucial role in various Tor functions, particularly in the regulation of transcriptional processes <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]</sup>. The genome of <italic>A. flavus</italic> contains a homolog of <italic>tap42</italic> named <italic>tapA</italic> (AFLA_092770), which is predicted to encode a 355 amino-acid protein (sharing 31.9% identity with <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Tap42). To further determine the function of the TapA regulator in the TOR signaling pathway of <italic>A. flavus</italic>, we used homologous recombination to replace the original promoter with the <italic>gpdA</italic> promoter, a well-characterized strong promoter, to construct an overexpression mutant (<italic>OE</italic>::<italic>tapA</italic>). The transformants of the mutant were verified using PCR. Quantitative expression analysis of the <italic>tapA</italic> gene in the overexpressed strains revealed a substantial upregulation compared to the WT strain (Fig. S4B).

<title>SitA and Ppg1 play crucial roles in aflatoxin biosynthesis and pathogenicity</title>
<p>We assayed AFB<sub>1</sub> biosynthesis in the Δ<italic>sitA</italic>, Δ<italic>ppg1</italic>, and Δ<italic>sitA</italic>/Δ<italic>ppg1</italic> mutants. TLC analyses revealed that the Δ<italic>sitA</italic> and Δ<italic>sitA</italic>/Δ<italic>ppg1</italic> strains exhibited a decrease in AFB<sub>1</sub> production, whereas the Δ<italic>ppg1</italic> strain showed a significant increase in AFB<sub>1</sub> production compared to the WT and complemented strains (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7F</xref>). The expression levels of genes related to aflatoxin synthesis, including structural genes (<italic>aflO</italic> and <italic>aflP</italic>) and regulatory genes (<italic>aflR</italic> and <italic>aflS</italic>), were determined by qRT-PCR in the Δ<italic>sitA</italic>, Δ<italic>ppg1</italic>, and Δ<italic>sitA</italic>/Δ<italic>ppg1</italic> mutants. The results revealed a significant downregulation of these genes in the Δ<italic>sitA</italic> and Δ<italic>sitA</italic>/Δ<italic>ppg1</italic> mutants, while upregulated in the Δ<italic>ppg1</italic> mutants, compared to the WT and complemented strains (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7I</xref>).

<p>We conducted pathogenicity tests on peanuts and maize to examine the pathogenicity of the phosphatases SitA and Ppg1 on crops.

In addition, the number of conidial productions in these mutants on the infected peanut seeds also dramatically decreased compared to those of the WT and complemented strains (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>). The thin-layer chromatography analyses revealed that the Δ<italic>ppg1</italic> mutant exhibited increased production of AFB<sub>1</sub> in peanuts and maize. Conversely, the levels of aflatoxin produced by the Δ<italic>sitA</italic> and Δ<italic>sitA</italic>/Δ<italic>ppg1</italic> mutants on peanut and maize were significantly reduced compared to the WT and complemented strains (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8D</xref>).

<title>The phosphatase complex Nem1/Spo7 is important for growth, aflatoxin biosynthesis, and LD biogenesis</title>
<p>Lipid droplets (LDs) are highly dynamic spherical organelles, which appear in the cytosol of most eukaryotic cell types<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]</sup>. Rapamycin treatment led to the accumulation of lipid droplets in various filamentous fungi <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]</sup>.

In this study, we observed that the treatment of hyphae with rapamycin resulted in the accumulation of LD biogenesis (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10A</xref>). This finding suggested that the TOR pathway may regulate the LD biogenesis. However, the underlying regulatory mechanism of LD biosynthesis remain largely unknown in <italic>A. flavu</italic>s. To investigate the regulatory mechanism of the TOR pathway in <italic>A. flavus</italic> that controls LD biogenesis, we examined LD accumulation in Δ<italic>sch9</italic>, Δ<italic>sitA</italic>, and Δ<italic>ppg1</italic> mutants. BODIPY staining assays revealed that LD biogenesis was not observed in the Δ<italic>sitA</italic> and Δ<italic>ppg1</italic> strains upon treatment with rapamycin, in contrast to the WT and Δ<italic>sch9</italic> strains (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10A</xref>, <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10B</xref>, <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10C</xref>, <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10D</xref>). These results indicated that LD biogenesis induced by rapamycin is predominantly reliant on the phosphatases SitA and Ppg1 in <italic>A. flavus</italic>. In <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, the phosphatase FgNem1/FgSpo7 complex was involved in the induction of LD biogenesis by rapamycin<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]</sup>.

<p>Based on the above results, we propose a hypothesis regarding the TOR signaling pathway model in <italic>A. flavus.</italic> Rapamycin forms a complex with Fkbp3, and this particular complex can bind to the TorA kinase, thereby impeding its regular functionality. Sch9, functioning as a downstream element of the TorA kinase, regulates aflatoxin biosynthesis and HOG signaling pathway. As another important target of the TorA kinase, TapA-phosphatase complex is involved in the regulation of growth, sporulation, sclerotia, aflatoxin production, CWI signaling pathway, lipid droplet synthesis, and other processes.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Aflatoxins (AFs) are a class of toxic secondary metabolites synthesized by <italic>A. flavus</italic>, including aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, G<sub>1</sub>, and G<sub>2</sub>, among which AFB<sub>1</sub> has been regarded as the most pathogenic and toxic aflatoxin<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]</sup>. Therefore, understanding the regulatory mechanisms involved in fungal secondary metabolites biosynthesis would be instrumental for effectively addressing aflatoxin control in <italic>A. flavus</italic>. In this study, we demonstrated that the target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in regulating growth, sporulation, sclerotia formation, aflatoxin production, and various stress responses in <italic>A. flavus</italic>. Through conducting functional studies on genes within the TOR signaling pathway, we explored the conservation and complexity exhibited by the TOR signaling pathway in <italic>A. flavu</italic>s. In addition, we constructed a crosstalk network between the TOR and other signaling pathways (HOG, CWI) and analyzed the specific regulatory process. We proposed that the TOR signaling pathway interacts with multiple signaling pathways, including HOG and CWI pathways, to modulate the cellular responses to diverse environmental stresses (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>).</p>
<p>Our findings indicated that the TOR signaling pathway is pivotal in <italic>A. flavus</italic>, we have observed that rapamycin has a significant impact on the growth and sporulation of <italic>A. flavus</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Additionally, it exhibits a strong inhibitory effect on sclerotia production and aflatoxin biosynthesis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). The inhibitory effect has been documented in various fungal species, including <italic>Candida albicans</italic> <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]</sup>, <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]</sup><italic>, Podospora anserine</italic> <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]</sup><italic>, A. nidulans</italic> <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]</sup><italic>, Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]</sup>, and <italic>F. graminearum</italic> <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]</sup>. This suggested that the TOR signaling pathway may have a conserved function in filamentous fungi. The number of FK506-binding proteins varies among different species: there are four Fkbps proteins in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and three Fkbps proteins in <italic>S. pombe</italic> <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]</sup>. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, rapamycin can bind to Fkbp protein, resulting in the irreversible inhibition of the G<sub>1</sub> phase of the cell cycle and the regulation of cell growth <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]</sup>. In <italic>A. nidulans,</italic> the <italic>fkbp12</italic> gene homologue <italic>fprA</italic> displays considerable sequence similarity with homologues identified in the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]</sup>. In this study, based on the homologous alignment of the protein sequence of FprA, it was observed that four <italic>fkbp</italic> genes are present in <italic>A. flavus</italic>. Among these, deletion of <italic>fkbp3</italic> exhibited enhanced tolerance to rapamycin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). So we speculated that rapamycin forms a complex with Fkbp3 in <italic>A. flavus</italic>, subsequently targeting downstream target genes to exert its biological function. We found that Fkbp3 is involved in sclerotia formation and aflatoxin biosynthesis in <italic>A. flavus</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, S3), and subsequent analysis revealed that the underlying mechanism may be associated with succinylation modification. The succinylation sites of Fkbp3 were identified through the utilization of succinylation proteomics data. By constructing point mutant strains and conducting phenotype experiments, we found that the succinylation of Fkbp3 at residue K19 is involved in rapamycin resistance and aflatoxin biosynthesis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>). Our results provided new insights to the understanding of post-translational modifications in the regulation of TOR pathway components. Previous studies have demonstrated that Fkbp12 has been identified as the receptor for FK506 and rapamycin, which inhibits calcineurin and target rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1), respectively <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]</sup>. The deletion of Fkbp12 confers the resistance to rapamycin in <italic>C. albicans</italic> <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]</sup> and <italic>C. neoformans</italic> <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]</sup>. The entomopathogenic fungus <italic>Beauveria bassiana</italic> contains three putative <italic>fkbp</italic> genes, and disruption of <italic>Bbfkbp12</italic> significantly increases the resistance to rapamycin and FK506 <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]</sup>. The plant pathogenic fungus <italic>F. graminearum</italic> harbors three Fkbps proteins, among which deletion of <italic>Fgfkbp12</italic> leads to resistance to rapamycin <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]</sup>. Thus, we propose that these Fkbps may exhibit analogous functionalities in conferring resistance to rapamycin. In <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic>, deletion of <italic>Bcfkbp12</italic> caused a reduction of the virulence of strain T4, while knockout of the <italic>fkbp12</italic> gene did not affect the pathogenic development of strain B05.10 <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]</sup>. These findings demonstrated that the <italic>fkbp12</italic> homologous genes exhibited conservation in terms of rapamycin resistance. However, there is significant variation in other biological functions among fungal species, which may be attributed to species or strain evolutionary divergence. Our study indicated the pivotal role of Fkbp3 in modulating the effects of rapamycin on <italic>A. flavus</italic>, Fkbp3 is also crucial for aflatoxin biosynthesis. Targeted inhibition of Fkbp3 could potentially suppress aflatoxin production, given its significance, Fkbp3 can be developed as a drug target to reduce aflatoxin biosynthesis, thereby reducing the risk of aflatoxin contamination in agricultural products.</p>
<p>The Tor kinase functions as a fundamental component of the TOR signaling pathway, which exhibits evolutionary conservation across fungi, plants, and mammals <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]</sup>. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the Tor kinase can interact with a diverse range of proteins, resulting in the formation of complex structures known as TORC1 and TORC2 <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]</sup>. TORC1 can detect various signals, including nutrients, growth factors, and environmental stress. It plays a crucial role in regulating cellular processes such as gene transcription, protein translation, ribosome synthesis, and autophagy <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]</sup>. A characteristic that distinguishes TORC1 is its interaction with KOG1 (Raptor in mammals) and its sensitivity to the rapamycin-FKBP12 complex <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]</sup>. The Tor kinase is widely conserved both in terms of its structural characteristics and its role as the target of Fkbp-rapamycin <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]</sup>. Typically, the Tor kinase exhibits similar structural characteristics, including the HEAT-like, FAT, FRB, kinase, and FATC domains <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]</sup>. The FRB domain is the binding region of the Fkbp-rapamycin complex, and rapamycin resistance is usually caused by the disruption of the FRB domain <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]</sup>. Homology analysis and phylogenetic studies have identified a single predicted <italic>torA</italic> gene within the <italic>A. flavus</italic> genome. To elucidate the functional role of <italic>torA</italic> in <italic>A. flavus</italic>, our initial approach involved an attempt to generate an <italic>torA</italic> deletion strain through homologous recombination. However, these efforts were unsuccessful. We speculated that the deletion of the <italic>torA</italic> gene may be lethal in <italic>A. flavus</italic>. This observation aligns with the situation observed in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]</sup>. Therefore, to investigate the function of TorA in <italic>A. flavus</italic>, we constructed a mutant strain (<italic><sup>xylP</sup>torA</italic>) using an xylose-inducible promoter, which allows for conditional induction with the addition of xylose. We observed that the <italic><sup>xylP</sup>torA</italic> mutant is completely unable to grow in YGT medium without xylose, whereas partial growth is restored in YXT medium with the addition of xylose (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). These results indicated that TorA is essential for the growth of <italic>A. flavus</italic>. We also discovered that the Tor kinase is involved in the vegetative growth, asexual development and aflatoxin production of <italic>A. flavus</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). In addition, the the <italic><sup>xylP</sup>torA</italic> mutant shows a high sensitivity to rapamycin and SDS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Our findings have demonstrated that the TorA kinase plays a crucial role in the processes of morphogenesis, aflatoxin biosynthesis, and multiple stress responses in <italic>A. flavus</italic>. Previous findings demonstrated that the Tor kinase could function as a molecular switch connecting an iron cue to defend against pathogen infection in <italic>C. elegans</italic> <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]</sup>. In <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>, the Tor kinase represents a central regulatory node controlling genes and proteins involved in nutrient sensing, stress response, cell cycle progression, protein biosynthesis, and degradation, as well as adaptation to low iron conditions<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]</sup>. In summary, the Tor kinase acts as a central regulator in the TOR signaling pathway, playing a crucial role in the regulation of the cell cycle, protein synthesis, and cellular energy metabolism. Its influence on key cellular processes makes it a promising target for future research to control fungal growth and aflatoxin production.</p>
<p>The serine/threonine protein kinase Sch9, a critical downstream effector of TORC1 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, has been extensively studied for its roles in stress resistance, longevity, and nutrient sensing <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]</sup>. In addition, the TORC1-Sch9 pathway is also recognized as crucial mediator of chronological lifespan <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]</sup>. In filamentous fungi, an intricate network of interactions exists between the TOR and HOG pathways. In <italic>F. graminearum</italic> <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]</sup>, FgSch9 and FgHog1 mutants displayed increased susceptibility to osmotic and oxidative stresses. The phosphorylation level of FgHog1 increased significantly in FgSch9 mutant. Additionally, the affinity capture-MS assay showed that the Tor kinase was among the proteins co-purifying with FgSch9. These results suggested that FgSch9 serves as an intermediary for the TOR and HOG signaling pathways <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]</sup>. Furthermore, FgSch9 plays a crucial role in the regulation of various biological processes such as hyphal differentiation, asexual development, virulence, and DON biosynthesis<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]</sup>. In <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>, the SchA mutant was sensitive to rapamycin, high concentrations of calcium and hyperosmotic stress, and SchA was involved in iron metabolism. The SchA mutant exhibited enhanced phosphorylation of SakA in response to osmotic stress <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]</sup>. In this study, we discovered that Sch9 is involved in regulating aflatoxin biosynthesis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>), and responses to osmotic and rapamycin stress (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>). The S_TKc domain deletion strain (<italic>sch9</italic><sup>ΔS_TKc</sup>), S_TK_X domain deletion strain (<italic>sch9</italic><sup>ΔS_TK_X</sup>), and <italic>sch9</italic><sup>K340A</sup> mutant displayed a similar phenotype to the Δ<italic>sch9</italic> strain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>). These findings revealed that Sch9 plays a significant role in the biological synthesis of aflatoxin and in responding to various stresses. This role is primarily mediated through its kinase domain, kinase-C domain, and ATP binding site K340. We also found that the phosphorylation level of Hog1 increased significantly in the Δ<italic>sch9</italic> strain under osmotic stress (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). Based on the above results, we hypothesized that Sch9 was involved in the osmotic stress response by modulating the HOG pathway in <italic>A. flavus</italic>.</p>
<p>The phosphorylation state of Tap42 is crucial for its interaction with PP2A subunits and is regulated by a balance between Tor-mediated phosphorylation and Cdc55/Tpd3-mediated dephosphorylation in yeast <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]</sup>. The genome of <italic>A. flavus</italic> contains a homolog of <italic>tap42</italic> named <italic>tapA</italic> (AFLA_092770), which is predicted to encode a 355 amino-acid protein (sharing 31.9% identity with <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Tap42). To further determine the function of the TapA regulator in the TOR signaling pathway of <italic>A. flavus</italic>, we conducted targeted gene deletion experiments on <italic>tapA</italic>. We failed to obtain a null mutant, we hypothesised that <italic>tapA</italic> knockout was lethal in <italic>A. flavus</italic>. To investigate the function of TapA, we employed homologous recombination, to replace the native promoter with the strong <italic>gpdA</italic> promoter, thereby constructing an overexpression strain (<italic>OE</italic>::<italic>tapA</italic>) with the enhanced promoter. Compared with WT strain, <italic>OE</italic>::<italic>tapA</italic> strain were more sensitive to rapamycin and SDS stress, indicating that <italic>tapA</italic> gene plays an important role in regulating cell wall stress (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5F</xref>). In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, the protein Tip41, which interacts with Tap42, plays a significant role in the cellular responses to nitrogen sources by regulating type 2A phosphatases <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>]</sup>. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, Tap42-phosphatase complexes associate with TORC1, whereas Tip41 functions to attenuate TORC1 signaling by stimulating the PP2A phosphatase <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]</sup>. Unlike its yeast counterpart Tip41, TIPRL, a mammalian Tip41-like protein, exerts a positive influence on mTORC1 signaling by interacting with PP2Ac <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>]</sup>. While some functions of Tap42 and its binding partners Tip41 may be conserved, the interaction between Tip41 and Tap42 was not observed in the filamentous fungi. The yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay showed that FgTip41 interacts with the phosphatase FgPpg1 rather than FgTap42, while the FgTap42 bind with phosphatases FgPp2A, implying that FgTap42, FgPpg1, and FgTip41 form a heterotrimer in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]</sup>. In the rice blast fungus <italic>M. oryzae</italic>, MoTip41 does not interact with MoTap42. However, MoTip41 can bind with the phosphatase MoPpe1, thereby facilitating crosstalk between the TOR pathway and the cell wall integrity pathway <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]</sup>. In <italic>A. flavus,</italic> the <italic>OE</italic>::<italic>tapA</italic> and Δ<italic>tipA</italic> strains showed increased sensitivity to cell wall stress compared with the WT strain(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6H</xref>). Based on the conserved roles of Tap42 and Tip41 in yeast and other filamentous fungi, we hypothesize that TapA and TipA in <italic>A. flavus</italic> also participate in cell wall integrity pathway. In summary, our study provided important insights into the role of TapA and TipA in the TOR signaling pathway of <italic>A. flavus</italic>, particularly in relation to cell wall stress. However, their interaction and implications for TOR and CWI signaling in <italic>A. flavus</italic> remain to be elucidated.</p>
<p>In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, Tap42 can bind and regulate various PP2A phosphatases, including Pph3, Pph21, Pph22, Sit4, and Ppg1. This interaction plays a crucial role in the TOR signaling pathway, particularly in response to rapamycin treatment or nutrient deprivation <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]</sup>. These phosphatases play important roles in other fungi and are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including growth, morphogenesis, and virulence. For example, the phosphatase Sit4 plays a crucial role in regulating cell growth, morphogenesis, and virulence in <italic>C. albicans</italic> <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>]</sup>. Similarly, FgSit4 and FgPpg1 are associated with various cellular processes, including mycelial growth, conidiation, DON biosynthesis, and virulence in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]</sup>. These findings indicated the conserved role of PP2A phosphatases in fungal biology. In addition to their roles in growth and development, FgSit4 and FgPpg1 are involved in the regulation of various signaling pathways, such as the CWI pathway and lipid droplets biogenesis regulation pathway <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]</sup>. In this study, we found that the phosphatase SitA and Ppg1 play critical role in vegetative growth, conidiation, sclerotia formation, and aflatoxin biosynthesis in <italic>A. flavus</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7C</xref>). Additionally, the phosphatase SitA and Ppg1 also affect pathogenicity and LD biogenesis (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>, <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10C</xref>, <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10D</xref>). This highlights the multifaceted influence of PP2A phosphatases on cellular signaling.</p>
<p>After the deletion of the <italic>sitA</italic> and <italic>ppg1</italic> genes, the expression level of genes related to cell wall synthesis has decreased significantly, resulting in damage to the cell wall and showing a higher sensitivity to cell wall integrity stress (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9C</xref>). Western blotting results showed that the phosphorylation level of MAPK kinase Slt2 has increased significantly in the Δ<italic>sitA</italic> and Δ<italic>ppg1</italic> strains under cell wall stress, indicating that SitA and Ppg1 exert a negative regulatory effect on the CWI pathway (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9D</xref>). In <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>, MoPpe1 and MoSap1 serve as an adaptor complex that connects the CWI and TOR signaling pathways. The activation of the TOR pathway leads to the inhibition of the CWI pathway, highlighting a critical regulatory interplay between these two pathways in fungal biology <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]</sup>. We speculated that SitA and Ppg1 might exhibit similar regulation within the CWI and TOR pathways across different fungal species. In addition, the phosphatase MoPpe1 interacts with the phosphatase-associated protein MoTip41, facilitating the exchange of information between the TOR and CWI signaling pathways <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]</sup>. These results suggested that the phosphatase Ppe1 engages in interactions with various proteins to effectively coordinate the TOR and CWI signaling pathways, thereby regulating the growth and pathogenicity of the rice blast fungus <italic>M. oryzae</italic> <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]</sup>. Given the conserved functions of PP2A phosphatases and the observed roles of SitA, Ppg1, TapA, and TipA in cell wall stress response, we hypothesized that TapA-phosphatase complexes may collaborate to regulate cell wall integrity processes in <italic>A. flavus</italic>. This hypothesis is supported by the similar functions exhibited by these proteins.</p>
<p>In <italic>F. graminearum,</italic> the phosphatase complex FgNem1/Spo7-FgPah1 cascade plays significant roles in fungal development, DON production, and lipid droplet (LD) biogenesis <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]</sup>. Our study explored the conservation and functional significance of Nem1 and Spo7 homologs in <italic>A. flavus</italic>, revealing their pivotal roles in vegetative growth and secondary metabolism (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11A</xref>, <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">11B</xref>). Our results indicated that lipid droplet biogenesis is facilitated by the Nem1/Spo7 and SitA/Ppg1 pathways in <italic>A. flavus</italic> (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10C</xref>, <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10D</xref>, <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10E</xref>). These observations suggested a conserved and central role for PP2A phosphatases as core regulators within the LD biogenesis signaling network, highlighting their importance in cellular lipid metabolism and energy storage. While our findings underscored the significance of phosphatases in LD biogenesis, it is also plausible that other kinases contribute to the regulation of this process. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the precise molecular mechanism, it is essential to investigate the interplay between phosphatases and other kinases.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we identified the complex regulatory network that provides important insight into the interplay between the TOR, HOG, and CWI signaling pathways, and how they collectively regulate the development, aflatoxin biosynthesis, and pathogenicity of <italic>A. flavus</italic>. By elucidating the functions of genes associated with the TOR signaling pathway, our research could establish a solid foundation for comprehending the molecular mechanism underlying the aflatoxin biosynthesis of <italic>A. flavus</italic>. Our results could also contribute to the development of targeted strategies to manage aflatoxin contamination and mitigate the impact of <italic>A. flavus</italic> infections.</p>

<title>Constructions of gene deletion and complemented mutants</title>
<p>The construction of gene deletion and complemented strains was carried out using the SOE-PCR strategy, following previously established protocols <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>]</sup>. To generate the <italic><sup>xylP</sup>torA</italic> mutant of <italic>A. flavus</italic>, an <italic>torA</italic> xylose promoter mutant cassette was synthesized via overlapping extension PCR. This cassette was designed to incorporate an upstream fragment of the <italic>torA</italic> gene, a selectable marker gene (<italic>pyrG</italic> from <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic>), the xyIP xylose-inducible promoter <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]</sup>, and a fragment of the <italic>torA</italic> coding sequence. Subsequently, this composite cassette was integrated into the <italic>A. flavus</italic> genome via homologous recombination, specifically replacing the native <italic>torA</italic> promoter with the inducible xylose promoter. To construct over-expression cassettes for the <italic>tapA</italic> gene, we utilized a molecular cloning strategy that entailed the fusion of PCR-amplified fragments from the <italic>pyrG</italic>-selectable marker and the <italic>gpdA</italic> promoter. Subsequently, employing a homologous recombination approach, we inserted this composite fragment upstream of the <italic>tapA</italic> gene, effectively replacing its native promoter with the stronger <italic>gpdA</italic> promoter. The primers utilized for the amplification of the flanking sequences of each gene can be found in Table S2. The putative gene deletion mutants were validated through PCR assays using the appropriate primers (Fig. S2), and their confirmation was subsequently obtained through sequencing analysis.</p>

<p>This paper reports the useful discovery of the roles and signaling components of the TOR pathway in vegetative growth, sexual development, stress response, and aflatoxin production in Aspergillus flavus.</p>
<p>While I acknowledge the authors' effort in conducting Southern blot analysis to address my prior concern regarding the presence of dual copies of torA and tapA, I find their current resolution inadequate. Specifically, the simple deletion of the respective result sections for torA and tapA significantly impacts the overall significance of this study. The repeated unsuccessful attempts to generate correct mutants only offer circumstantial evidence, as technical issues may have been a contributing factor. Therefore, instead of merely removing these sections, it is essential for the authors to present more compelling experimental data demonstrating that torA and tapA are indeed vital for the viability of A. flavus. Such data would enhance the overall significance of this study.</p>

<p>In this study, authors identified TOR, HOG and CWI signaling network genes as modulators of the development, aflatoxin biosynthesis and pathogenicity of A. flavus by gene deletions combined with phenotypic observation. They also analyzed the specific regulatory process and proposed that the TOR signaling pathway interacts with other signaling pathways (MAPK, CWI, calcineurin-CrzA pathway) to regulate the responses to various environmental stresses. Notably, they found that FKBP3 is involved in sclerotia and aflatoxin biosynthesis and rapamycin resistance in A. flavus, especially that the conserved site K19 of FKBP3 plays a key role in regulating aflatoxin biosynthesis. In general, the study involved a heavy workload and the findings are potentially interesting and important for understanding or controlling the aflatoxin biosynthesis. However, the findings have not been deeply explored and the conclusions mostly are based on parallel phenotypic observations.</p>

<p>We agree and appreciate reviewer's important comments on our manuscript. In this version, we address this issue by providing additional experimental data to further support the importance of <italic>torA</italic> and <italic>tapA</italic> in the viability of <italic>A. flavus</italic>. We conducted additional experiments to generate more compelling evidence regarding the essential role of <italic>torA</italic> and <italic>tapA</italic> in the growth and development of <italic>A. flavus</italic>. We constructed a mutant strain (<italic>xylPtorA</italic>) using an xylose-inducible promoter, which allows for conditional induction with the addition of xylose (Lines 204-238, page 10).</p>
<p>Due to the unsuccessful construction of TapA knockout strains and xylose promoter replacement strains, we used homologous recombination to replace the original promoter with the <italic>gpdA</italic> strong promoter for overexpression of <italic>tapA</italic> (<italic>OE</italic>::<italic>tapA</italic>). We thank reviewer for highlighting this important aspect, and we revise our manuscript accordingly to enhance its overall significance (Lines 277-297, page 13). We are grateful for the opportunity to enhance our manuscript and believe these revisions provide a more comprehensive understanding of the roles of <italic>torA</italic> and <italic>tapA</italic> in <italic>A. flavus</italic>.</p>

<p>Thank you for your constructive comments on our manuscript. In response to your comments, we have conducted additional experiments, including the construction of a xylose promoter mutant strain and an overexpression strain. We have also expanded the discussion section to provide a more comprehensive analysis of our findings in the context of existing literature. Thank you again for your insightful feedback, which has been instrumental in improving the quality of our work. (Lines 464-469, page 22).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Point 1: Our findings revealed that both the tor and tapA genes are present in double copies in our strains, which guided our decision to construct single-copy deletion strains using homologous recombination However, the tor gene in A. flavus exhibited varying copy numbers, as was confirmed by absolute quantification PCR at the genome level (Table S1). However, it is hard to understand for Table S1: Estimation of copy number of tor gene in A. flavus toro and sumoo stand for the initial copy number, and the data are graphed as the mean {plus minus} 95%confidence limit. CN is copy number. As indicated in the Methods, Using sumo gene as reference, the tor and tapA gene copy number was calculated by standard curve. In Table S1 of WT, for tor gene, CN value is1412537 compared to 1698243 in tor+/-, for the reference gene sumo,794328 compared to1584893, how these data could support copy gene numbers of tor?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your insightful comments. We understand the confusion with the data presented in Table S1 regarding the copy number estimation of the <italic>torA</italic> gene in <italic>A. flavus</italic>. We apologize for not providing a clear explanation for the data in the table. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is widely used to determine the copy number of a specific gene. It involves amplifying the gene of interest and a reference gene simultaneously using specific primers and probes. By comparing the amplification curves of the gene of interest and the reference gene, we can estimate the relative copy number of the gene.</p>
<p>To address your concern and provide more accurate information, we have re-performed the copy number analysis using southern blot. Southern blot analysis allows for the direct estimation of gene copy number by hybridizing genomic DNA with a specific probe for the gene. This method provides more reliable and accurate results in determining gene copy numbers. We discovered that the <italic>A. flavus</italic> genome contains a single copy of the <italic>torA</italic> gene. Consequently, we conducted additional experiments to elucidate its function. Specifically, we generated strains with a xylose-inducible promoter system to modulate the expression of <italic>torA</italic> (Lines 204-238, page 10).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Point 2: In response: For the knockout of the FRB domain, we used the homologous recombination method, but because tor genes are double-copy genes, there are also double copies in the FRB domain. Despite our efforts, we encountered challenges in precisely determining the location of the other copy of the tor gene. I could not understand these consistent data, why not for using sequencing?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable feedback. We determined again and confirmed that the <italic>torA</italic> gene is a single copy. So we removed this part of the results to avoid any ambiguity or potential misinterpretation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Point 3: Response in Due to the large number of genes involved, we did not perform a complementation experiment. If there were no complementation data, how to demonstrate data are solid?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your important suggestion. We understand that complementation experiments are commonly used to validate gene deletions. Therefore, to ensure the reliability of our data, we have conducted supplementary experiments on specific gene deletions, such as Δ<italic>sitA</italic>-C and Δ<italic>ppg1</italic>-C. Thank you again for your positive comments and valuable suggestions, which have significantly contributed to enhancing the quality of our manuscript (Lines 320-322, page 15).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Point 4: Acknowledge the confusion? We acknowledge the confusion in our presentation and will ensure that accurate genetic nomenclature is used consistently</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comments on our manuscript. We recognize the importance of precise and consistent use of genetic nomenclature, as it is critical for the clarity and integrity of our research findings. We have carefully reviewed the sections of our manuscript where genetic terms were used and have made the necessary corrections to ensure that all nomenclature is accurate and used consistently throughout the text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Point 5: In the revised version of new manuscript, southern blotting was carried out and found only one copy was existed for tested genes at last. Thus, whole manuscript conclusions should be changed. In addition, Reviewer 1 suggestion for using Illumina-sequence strategy, their tor and tapA mutants could be verified whether they are aneuploid?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to express our gratitude for your insightful comments and suggestions. Following the new experimental data obtained from Southern blotting, we have identified that only one copy of the tested genes exists, and we have revised our conclusions throughout the manuscript. This has led to a significant reinterpretation of our results and a reassessment of the implications for our study. Based on this result, we designed and constructed strains with the tor gene under the control of a xylose-inducible promoter. This approach allows for the conditional expression of the tor gene. Thank you once again for your meticulous review (Lines 204-238, page 10).</p>
