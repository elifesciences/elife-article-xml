<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Understanding how the brain encodes behaviour is the ultimate goal of neuroscience and the ability to objectively and reproducibly describe and quantify behaviour is a necessary milestone on this path. Recent progresses in machine learning and computational power have pushed the development and adoption of powerful systems leveraging on high-resolution videorecording to track pose and describe behaviour in all four dimensions, however the temporal and spatial resolution of these systems come as a compromise with their throughput and accessibility. Here we describe <italic>coccinella</italic>, an open source reductionist framework that allows for high-throughput analysis of behaviour using real-time tracking on a distributed mesh of microcomputers followed by resource-lean statistical learning. We show that a reductionist system outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives when exploring the pharmacobehaviour in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The nervous system integrates stimuli, internal states, expectations, and previous experience to regulate behavioural output. Describing, quantifying, and modulating behaviour are critical aspects of modern neuroscience and, ever since its inception, the field has spent considerable effort into building and sharing paradigms or tools aimed at objectively and reproducibly quantify behaviours in the most disparate animal models, to the point that this exercise is now recognised as an exciting subfield of neuroscience in its own right: ethomics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. As the portmanteau name itself suggests, ethomics is not just about describing behaviour (<italic>etho-</italic>) but also about doing so in a high-throughput fashion (<italic>-omics</italic>), collecting data simultaneously from a large number of individuals with no or limited human intervention. Irrespective of the behaviour or the animal model to be analysed, the first compromise a researcher will face when choosing a tool for behavioural quantification will always be between “throughput” and “resolution”: a high-throughput analysis will allow for powerful experimental manipulations – such as genetics or pharmacological screenings – offering unbiased approaches in identifying neuronal circuits, genes, molecules underpinning behaviour; high-resolution analysis, on the other hand, promises to identify and discriminate even minuscule differences that may not be immediately visible to the human eye, and to label behaviours into identifiable classes (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>.: “grooming”, “courting”, “trembling”) that may be more relevant to researchers interested in modelling disease or generally more interested in an anthropomorphic description. In the past years, the field has generally converged towards the adoption of high-resolution video recording of activity, in some cases adopting cameras that have millisecond temporal resolution or developing setups that provide depth information for three-dimensional reconstruction of motion or posture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Given the recent evolution in machine learning and progresses in computational power, even these high-resolution analyses can be at least in part compatible with high-throughput approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, especially when employed on small invertebrate animal models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> or when aided by robotic handling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. These systems, however, can still be prohibitively expensive for most laboratories, and not easily compatible with throughput in the - omics scale. Moreover, besides the technical urge of removing entry barrier and make ethomics an accessible tool, an equally important underlying questions concerns what is the minimal amount of information that needs to be extracted to identify and classify behaviour. Do we always necessarily gain information from extracting micro-postural features or by analysing activity in three dimensions? To what extent this may actually add counterproductive biological noise to some assays?</p>
<p>Here we introduce <italic>coccinella</italic>: a new experimental framework that combines high-throughput, inexpensive, real-time ethomics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> with state-of-the-art statistical learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> to characterise and discriminate complex behaviours using a reductionist approach based solely on one simple feature. <italic>Coccinella</italic> builds on ethoscopes, an accessible open source platform, to extract in real-time minimalist information from flies challenged in different behavioural paradigms. We show that this system outperforms the state-of-the-art alternatives in recognising the pharmacobehavioural space, providing better discernibility at a fraction of the cost, thus opening new doors to high-throughput ethomics.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p><italic>Drosophila</italic> ethomics studies generally rely on image acquisition through so called industrial-cameras, able to collect videos with high temporal and spatial resolution and featuring mounts for a large selection of lenses. Some of the cameras commonly used for these purposes (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>.: FLIR, Point Grey, Basler)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> are expensive and are normally employed in close-up imaging that microscopically highlights the smallest anatomical features of the animal but at the same time greatly limits the number of experimental subjects that can be recorded by a single device. Normally, each camera would be connected to a dedicated powerful computer for acquisition and storage of the videos. The cost and physical footprint of these setups make them incompatible, at least for most laboratories, with high-throughput simultaneous acquisition. To lower this barrier, we created a framework that employs the distributing computing power of ethoscopes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, thus allowing for inexpensive analysis of activity in hundreds or thousands of flies at once. Each ethoscope is powered by a Raspberry Pi microcomputer and collects images through a Raspberry Pi NoIR camera, overlooking a bespoke 3D printed arena hosting 24 individually isolated flies. Digital images are acquired at a resolution of 1280×960 pixels with each animal being constricted in an ellipse measuring 25.8 ± 1.4 x 9.85 ±1.4 pixels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). In this setup, flies are free to move in a circular two-dimensional space with a diameter of 11.5mm designed to maintain the animal in the walking position<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> while venturing on solidified agar providing nutrients, or drugs. At this working resolution, ethoscopes would be capable to acquire videos at 30 fps and store them to be used for offline analysis at a later point, but we instead opted for online tracking and real-time parametric extraction, meaning that images were analysed by each raspberry Pi at the very moment they were acquired (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). This latter modality limits the temporal resolution of information being processed (one frame every 444 ms ± 127 ms, equivalent to 2.2 fps on a Raspberry Pi3) but provides the most affordable and high-throughput solution, dispensing the researcher from organising video storage or asynchronous image processing. In previous analysis of activity and sleep<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, we found that the maximal velocity of the fly over a period of 10 seconds best described the basic motion features of the animal, allowing us to accurately differentiate between different activity patterns, such as walking, grooming, feeding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. We therefore adopted this reductionist measure for <italic>coccinella</italic> too, ultimately producing monodimensional time-series of a behavioural correlate, which were then digested using highly comparative time-series analysis (HCTSA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, a computational framework that effortlessly subjects time-series to more than 7700 literature-relevant statistical tests, looking for meaningful discriminative features. Features successfully extracted through HCTSA were then used to classify behaviour using a linear support vector machine (SVM<sub>linear</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>) and here presented and compared using confusion matrices (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1a</xref>). To test the ability of this system to discriminate behaviour, we started by exploring the pharmacobehavioral space of flies fed with a panel of known or putative neurotropic chemicals, comprising molecules previously described in the literature along with experimental ones being considered as potential insecticides (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c, 1d</xref> – <xref rid="tblS1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Using an initial panel of 17 treatments (16 drugs and one solvent control) we were able to predict compounds with an accuracy of 71.4% (vs. 5.8% of a random classifier – <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). Some compounds induced behaviour with a particularly high predictive fingerprint: dieldrin, for instance, was predicted with an accuracy of 94% and flonicamid with an accuracy of 87%. For others, our system fared more poorly (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. tetramethrin showed 41% accuracy). In all cases, however, the relative confusion was negligible, with all compounds being correctly identified as the first choice and with the first predicted compounds having, on average, a score that was 15-times greater compared to the second best choices (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref> – min.: 3.3x; max.: 65x ). To validate our framework and exclude that the system operates by overfitting biologically irrelevant information we follow two lines of control. First, we fed flies with lower concentrations of the same compounds (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). Feeding flies with different concentrations of drugs unsurprisingly showed a different effect on short term lethality (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1b</xref>), with several compounds hitting a 25% lethality rate before the end of the experiment when fed at the highest concentration (1000ppm – <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1b</xref>). In these conditions, the predictive accuracy of the system decreased from 71.4% (1000ppm) to 61.8% (100ppm), falling to 36.1% with the lowest concentrations (1ppm), indicating that the system does operate on pharmacologically induced, biologically meaningful behavioural correlates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). A similar drop in accuracy was observed using a smaller panel of 12 treatments (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2a</xref>). As a second line of work to test specificity, we obtained genetic mutants known to be resistant to specific pharmacological treatments: the <italic>para</italic><sup><italic>L1029F</italic></sup> allele encodes for a version of the α-subunit of voltage-gated sodium channel conferring resistance to DDT and pyrethroids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>; the <italic>Rdl</italic><sup><italic>A301S</italic></sup> allele encodes for a version of the ligand-gated chloride channel conferring resistance to dieldrin and fiproles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Challenging these mutants with their respective compounds created confusion in the clustering algorithm for which finding the difference between drug treatment and solvent control became a harder task, especially in the case of DDT and <italic>para</italic><sup><italic>L1029F</italic></sup> (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2a</xref>). The observed drop in accuracy suggests again that <italic>coccinella</italic> is working on biologically relevant behavioural signatures and the fact that some discrimination can still be observed with targets harbouring point mutations, which severely affecting compound efficacy, is indicative of very high sensitivity.</p>

<p>Having established the accuracy and sensitivity of the system, we next wanted to test its usefulness in a genuine high-throughput scenario. We subjected a total of 2192 flies to a panel of 40 treatments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>), mostly featuring known compounds but also two unexplored molecules (<xref rid="tblS1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Given that the 100ppm intermediate concentrations showed the best compromise between accuracy and lethality (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary figure 1b</xref>), we performed this larger screen using compounds at 100ppm only. Even with such a large panel, the system was able to first guess 39 out of 40 of the tested treatments (the only exception being the Syngenta Compound #5) with an overall accuracy of 44.5%, vs 2.5% of the random classifier.</p>
<p>A reductionist approach served us well so far, identifying with remarkable accuracy even subtle changes when we explored the pharmacobehavioural space of a large number of neuroactive compounds in wild type and mutant flies. But how does it compare to other more established paradigms? <italic>Coccinella</italic> is arguably to be preferred in terms of accessibility and throughput, but what is the amount of useful information that we are sacrificing? To quantify any possible loss in information content, we run a series of parallel experiments in which flies were fed with a selected panel of 12 treatments (11 drugs and a solvent control, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) and their behaviour analysed either using <italic>coccinella</italic> or using the state-of-the-art methods, which started from high-resolution imaging and employed supervised machine learning for pose estimation (DeepLabCut<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>) followed by unsupervised identification of behavioural grammar (B-SOiD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>). To widen the range of comparisons, data were then either immediately clustered using different common clustering algorithms (K-nearest neighbours, random forest) or first processed through a smaller, selected subsample of the HCTSA array (Catch22<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>) before being clustered using SVM<sub>linear</sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). In this challenge, <italic>coccinella</italic> unambiguously identified 10 out of 12 compounds, with poor performance only for two of them (flubendiamide and tetramethrin) and an overall accuracy of 42.4%, vs 8.3% of the random classifier (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). Surprisingly, none of the state-of-the-art high-resolution paths did better than this. The combination of pose-estimation → grammar extraction → random forest classification scored as the second best, with an accuracy of 25.4% but with only three compounds being unambiguously identified (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>). The same experimental dataset clustered with even poorer performance when using K-nearest neighbours (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2e</xref>) and even the application of HCTSA features extraction to the B-SoID output still could not match the accuracy observed with <italic>coccinella</italic>’s reductionist approach (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>). This analysis is not meant to be conclusive. We expect that some alternative combination of state-of-the-art approaches will probably manage to match or likely improve over <italic>coccinella</italic>’s performance, yet the fact we could obtain such an impressive result with a system that is arguably unmatched in terms of throughput and economic cost is, alone, an argument that gives new weight to this (and future) reductionist approaches.</p>

</fig>
<p>Finally, to push the system to its limit, we asked <italic>coccinella</italic> to find qualitative differences in sleep rebound after different regimes of sleep deprivation. <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> shows a strong, conserved homeostatic regulation of sleep that forces flies to recover, at least in part, lost sleep (for instance after a night of forceful sleep deprivation)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. We previously showed that the extent of sleep rebound observed after sleep deprivation only loosely correlates with the amount of lost sleep<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> and it remains an open question, in the field, whether similar amounts of sleep rebound may in fact differ from each other in some inscrutable feature that would underpin a different “sleep depth”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, similarly to what it is believed to happen in mammals. We therefore analysed a dataset of 727 flies that experienced different regimes of mechanically enforced sleep deprivation during the 12 hours of the night (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Flies were housed in tubes that would rotate after a set time of inactivity ranging from 20 to 1000 seconds leading to different degrees of sleep restriction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>, dataset sampled from <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>). In this experimental paradigm, all treatments led to a statistically significant rebound compared to the undisturbed control animals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>). We then run <italic>coccinella</italic> on the two subsets of the panel: the baseline data, acquired the morning before the sleep deprivation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>), and the rebound data, on the morning after (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref>). Unsurprisingly, we could not detect any internal biological difference in the pre-sleep deprivation control set, featuring flies of identical genotype and age housed in different tubes before the sleep deprivation treatment. In these conditions, <italic>coccinella</italic> could not discern, and performed exactly as a random classifier would (9% vs 9% – <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>). However, analysis of those same animals during rebound after sleep deprivation showed a clear clustering, segregating the samples in two subsets with separation around the 300 seconds inactivity trigger (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref>). This result is important for two reasons: on one hand, it gives, for the third time, strong evidence that the system is not simply overfitting data of no biological significance given that it could not perform any better than a random classifier on the baseline control. On the other hand, <italic>coccinella</italic> could find biologically relevant differences on rebound data after different regimes of sleep deprivation. Interestingly enough, the 300 seconds threshold that <italic>coccinella</italic> identified has a deep intrinsic significance for the field, for it is considered to be the threshold beyond which flies lose arousal response to external stimuli, defining a “sleep quantum”, the minimum amount of time required for transforming inactivity bouts into sleep bouts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>System neuroscience is living a period of renaissance and large scale quantification of behaviour is driving this revolution, together with a plethora of new genetic tools that allow thermo- and opto-genetic manipulations and – at least in <italic>Drosophila</italic> – a galore of genetic transformants for circuit tracking and manipulation. Progresses in machine learning and computer power have had a massive impact on the field of ethomics, especially in achieving levels of anatomical tracking that allow mapping of the tiniest movements on an experimental animal model with the highest temporal resolution and with little human supervision<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Most of these system, however, rely on relatively expensive setups and do not scale easily to high-throughput experimental paradigms. They are ideal to identify behavioural patterns and study fine motor control but may be undue for many other uses. Here we introduce a new framework, <italic>coccinella</italic>, that merges an open-source, economically accessible hardware platform (ethoscopes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>) with a powerful toolbox for statistical analysis and clustering (HTCSA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> / Catch22<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>). <italic>Coccinella</italic> is a reductionist tool not meant to replace the behavioural categorization that other tools can offer: it cannot apply anthropomorphic labels to behaviour (“courting”, “lounging”, “sipping”, “jumping” <italic>etc</italic>.) but it can successfully identify large behavioural phenotypes and generate unbiased hypothesis on how behaviour – and a nervous system at large – can be influenced by chemicals, genetics, artificial manipulations in general. We provide evidence that <italic>coccinella</italic> can be used to successfully explore and compartmentalise the pharmacobehavioural space, possibly opening new avenues for drug discovery using <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> as a model. The success of <italic>Drosophila</italic> as experimental model was built on the many genetic screens of the 1900s. We propose <italic>coccinella</italic> as an accessible, pivotal tool to restart this important line of work in any laboratory, without funding or access to technology being a discriminative factor.</p>

<p><italic>Rdl</italic><sup><italic>A301S</italic></sup> is derived from <italic>Rdl</italic><sup><italic>MDRR</italic></sup> (RRID:BDSC_1675), an <italic>Rdl</italic> allele isolated from a natural population in Maryland<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, and underwent isogenization and selection on dieldrin to eliminate the metabolic resistance and maintain the dieldrin target site resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. The <italic>Rdl</italic><sup>MDRR</sup> was obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center. For <italic>para:</italic> the L1029F mutation, located in the voltage gated sodium channel paralytic, has been extensively reported to confer resistance to DDT and pyrethroids in many other insect species (called kdr, knockdown resistance, reviewed in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>). In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> gene, kdr maps to L1029F and is equivalent to the often cited L1014F in other insects (e.g. <italic>Musca domestica</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>). The kdr L1029F mutation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Para was introduced via CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing (see Supplementary Materials and Methods).

<title>Handling and preparation of drugs</title>
<p>All insecticide compounds were supplied by Syngenta Ltd. from their in-house stock (see <xref rid="tblS1" ref-type="table">Supplementary table 1</xref> for a full list of compounds used). Compounds were received in solid form and diluted in solvent containing 5% ethanol (VWR, 20821), 5% acetone (Sigma,179124) and 10% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (D2650, Sigma) in distilled water to 1000ppm initially, then further diluted in the solvent mixture to 100ppm and 1ppm (where 1mL/L = 1000ppm). For insecticide assays, 0.5mL of 5% sucrose (Sigma, S0389), 1% agarose (Sigma, A6236) solution was pipetted into each well and allowed to set. Following this, 2μL of compound solution were placed on the surface and allowed to dry for 30 minutes or more. Male flies were then placed on the surface with a small glass cover slip placed on top (13mm circular cover slip, VWR631-0150). Flies were briefly anaesthetised (&gt;1 minute) before being placed onto the surface of the plate. Once each well had been filled with a single male fly, arenas were placed into the ethoscope and recorded for a minimum of 2 days. All experiments were started between ZT0 and ZT1 and within 30 minutes of the flies being placed in the wells. For each compound in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1c</xref> and <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1c</xref>, 3 repeats were done at different time points. For <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, two repeats to three biological repeats per compound.</p>

<title>Data acquisition and processing</title>
<p>Ethoscope data were first processed in R using rethomics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Each time series was exported (.csv) and converted using Python to individual time series in a file format (.dat) compatible with MatLab. A metadata (.txt) file served as a reference file of each individual time series with keywords outlining compound groups and concentrations for processing data using HCTSA.</p>

<title>HCTSA / Catch22</title>
<p>Following this process, HCTSA feature extraction was performed on the time-series data (for <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figures 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Suppfig1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Suppfig2A</xref>). After the features were extracted, outputs of error-producing operations were removed through a normalization process using a sigmoidal transformation. HCTSA inbuilt functions were then used to classify data using a linear SVM classifier and a confusion matrix comparing the time series was generated. For some of the time-series data (that in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figures 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Suppfig2B</xref>), a smaller feature set of HCTSA, Catch-22 was used for feature extraction. Due to the smaller number of features used with this method, normalization was not required before using a linear SVM classifier to generate a confusion matrix comparing the results. A time series of 12 hours was used for the HCTSA analysis in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>.

<title>Video generation for flies on insecticides</title>
<p>Custom 3D-printed squares were designed using the online CAD software Onshape and printed using Ultimaker 2+ 3D printers using PLA plastic. For insecticide assays, 0.5mL of 5% sucrose (Sigma, S0389), 1% agarose (Sigma, A6236) solution was pipetted into each well and allowed to set. Following this, 2μL of compound solution were placed on the surface and allowed to dry for 30 minutes or more before male flies were placed on the surface with a small glass cover slip placed on top (13mm circular cover slip, VWR631-0150). Flies were briefly anaesthetised (&gt;1 minute) before being placed onto the surface of the square. Once each well had been filled with a single male fly, squares were placed in the arena and a video was recorded for a minimum of 12 hours using an ELP 8 megapixel camera with an IMX179 Sensor and 2.8-12 mm variable focus manual lens. All videos recordings were started between ZT0 and ZT1. Recordings of flies exposed to compounds were done in a randomised manner. Video data was then broken down into shorter segments of 15-minute videos for processing. The first 15-minutes following 1 hour of fly exposure to compound or control was used for pose extraction.</p>

<title>Deeplabcut / B-SoID</title>
<p>The use of DeepLabCut (version 2.1) followed the detailed protocol outlined by<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Briefly, frames for labelling were extracted from 3 representative videos using a K-means algorithm and frames were labelled with 22 unique body parts (head, left eye, right eye, thorax top, thorax bottom, abdomen top, abdomen middle, abdomen bottom, left wing tip, right wing tip, left foreleg tip, left foreleg middle, right foreleg tip, right foreleg middle, left middle leg tip, left middle leg middle, right middle leg tip, right middle leg middle, left back leg tip, left back leg middle, right back leg tip, right back leg middle). These frames were labelled locally with a DeepLabCut graphical user interface (GUI) before the project file was uploaded to Google Drive for training and video analysis to be done using Google Colab. The data was split into a 9:1 test:train dataset and training was run for more than 150,000 iterations before the average Euclidean error was computed between labels and predictions. The model at the best performing checkpoint was used to predict pose in novel videos. Following this, B-SOID was used to de-structure behaviour using the output of DeepLabCut and generate fly-specific time-series of behavioural grammar as in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Generation of ParaL1029F via CRISPR-CAS9 based genome editing</title>
<p>CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing was used to introduce a point mutation L1029F in para-PBG isoform, CTT to TTT, L to F by homology-dependent repair (HDR) using one guide RNA and a dsDNA plasmid donor. The strategy design, molecular biology and screening was completed by Well Genetics Inc., Taiwan (R.O.C.). The cassette PBacDsRed contains Piggy Bac 3’ terminal repeats, the selection marker 3xP3-DsRed, and Piggy Bac 5’ terminal repeats. The selection marker 3xP3-DsRed contains Piggy Bac 3’ terminal repeats, 3x Pax3 and hsp70 promoter, DsRed2, SV40 3’UTR, and Piggy Bac 5’ terminal repeats. The dsRed marker facilitates the genetic screening and was excised by Piggy Bac transposase. Only one TTAA motif was left after transposition embedded in mutated intron sequence, and create a mutation G to A on X:16,486,649; X:16,486,649∼ X:16,486,646, CTAA to T TAA in intron.

<p>This study presents an <bold>important</bold> open-source resource for high-throughput behavioral screening. The protocols employ inexpensive, off the shelf hardware, and carry out real-time analysis of hundreds of behaving flies. Although these protocols were developed using Drosophila melanogaster, they could easily be applied to other model systems. The evidence in support of the conclusions is <bold>solid</bold> although more details on the algorithms used for phenotyping would be helpful in order to better assessing the overall robustness of the platform.</p>

<p>In the current paper, Jones et al. describe a new framework, named coccinella, for real-time high-throughput behavioral analysis aimed at reducing the cost of analyzing behavior. In the setup used here each fly is confined to a small circular arena and able to walk around on an agar bed spiked with nutrients or pharmacological agent. The new framework, built on the researchers' previously developed platform Ethoscope, relies on relatively low-cost Raspberry Pi video cameras to acquire images at ~0.5 Hz and pull out, in real time, the maximal velocity (parameter extraction) during 10 second windows from each video. Thus, the program produces a text file, and not voluminous videos requiring storage facilities for large amounts of video data, a prohibitive step for many behavioral analyses. The maximal velocity time-series is then fed to an algorithm called Highly Comparative Time-Series Classification (HCTSA)(which itself is based on a large number of feature extraction algorithms) developed by other researchers. HCTSA identifies statistically salient features in the time-series which are then passed on to a type of linear classifier algorithm called support vector machines (SVM). In cases where such analyses are sufficient for characterizing the behaviors of interest this system performs as well as other state-of-the-art systems used in behavioral analysis (e.g., DeepLabCut).</p>
<p>In a pharmacobehavior paradigm testing different chemicals, the authors show that coccinella can identify specific compounds as effectively as other more time-consuming and resource-consuming systems.</p>
<p>
The new paradigm should be of interest to researchers involved in drug screens, and more generally, in high-throughput analysis focused on gross locomotor defects in fruit flies such as identification of sleep phenotypes. By extracting/saving only the maximal velocity from video clips, the method is fast. However, the rapidity of the platform comes at a cost--loss of information on subtle but important behavioral alterations. When seeking subtle modifications in animal behavior, solutions like DeepLabCut, which are admittedly slower but far superior in terms of the level of details they yield, would be more appropriate.</p>
<p>The manuscript reads well, and it is scientifically solid.</p>
<p>1- The fact that Coccinella runs on Ethoscopes, an open source hardware platform described by the same group, is very useful because the relevant publication describes Ethoscope in detail. However, the current version of the paper does not offer details or alternatives for users that would like to test the framework, but do not have an Ethoscope. Would it be possible to overcome this barrier and have coccinella run with any video data (and, thus, potentially be used to analyze data obtained from other animal models)?</p>
<p>2- Readers who want background on the analytical approaches that the platform relies on following maximal velocity extraction, will have to consult the original publications. In particular, the current manuscript does not provide much information on Highly Comparative Time-Series Classification (HCTSA) or SVM; this may be reasonable because the methods were developed earlier by others. While some readers may find that the lack of details increases the manuscript's readability, others may be left wanting to see more discussion on these not-so-trivial approaches. In addition, it is worth noting that the same authors who published the HCTSA method also described a shorter version named catch22, that runs faster with a similar output. Thus, explaining in more detail how HCTSA operates, considering that it is a relatively new method, will make the method more convincing.</p>
