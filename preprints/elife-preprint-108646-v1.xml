<abstract><p>Hepatocytes undergo extensive proliferation to facilitate liver repair after injury, yet early adaptive changes prior to proliferation remain unclear. Here, we report that during early acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury (AILI), hepatocytes exhibit transient proliferation suppression, most pronounced in mid-zone hepatocytes due to zonal APAP metabolism. Using spatial transcriptomics, immunohistochemistry, and functional studies, we identified a unique mid-zone stress-response program. Central to this adaptation is the Atf4-Chop axis, which actively suppresses proliferation via the cell cycle inhibitor Btg2, prioritizing cytoprotection over cell division. This transient arrest is a critical survival strategy: halting energy-intensive proliferation during peak injury allows mid-zone hepatocytes to redirect resources towards protection, enhancing their survival in early AILI. Thus, Atf4-Chop-mediated quiescence preserves a hepatocyte reservoir necessary for subsequent regenerative proliferation and effective repair. Our findings reveal a key adaptive trade-off in mid-zone hepatocytes where transient proliferation arrest promotes early survival to enable repair.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is the leading cause of drug-induced acute liver failure worldwide, resulting in over 10,000 hospitalizations and approximately 500 deaths annually in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> The hepatotoxicity of APAP is initiated by its metabolic activation through cytochrome P450 enzymes, primarily in pericentral hepatocytes, generating the reactive metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> NAPQI depletes glutathione and forms protein adducts, leading to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction that culminate in centrilobular necrosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> Although the mechanisms of APAP bioactivation and toxicity are well-characterized, the early adaptive responses of hepatocytes—particularly their proliferative dynamics across lobular zones—remain poorly understood.</p>
<p>The liver is organized into functional hexagonal units termed lobules, where hepatocytes display spatial heterogeneity across three distinct zones: periportal (PP, zone 1), mid-zonal (Mid, zone 2), and pericentral (PC, zone 3).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> These zones exhibit unique gene expression profiles and metabolic specializations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> Pericentral hepatocytes (zone 3), expressing high levels of cytochrome P450 enzymes, are the primary site of acetaminophen (APAP)-induced necrosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> However, recent spatial profiling, functional, and lineage tracing studies have identified midzonal hepatocytes (zone 2) as the predominant source of new hepatocytes during both homeostasis and repair, demonstrating significant proliferative capacity and metabolic plasticity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> Despite these advances, how mid-zone hepatocytes dynamically adapt during the initial phase of acute stress remains unknown.</p>
<p>A key regulator of cellular stress adaptation is the integrated stress response (ISR), which phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) to suppress global translation while selectively upregulating stress-responsive genes, including activating transcription factor 4 (Atf4) and its downstream target pro-apoptotic factor C/EBP homologous protein (Chop, encoded by DNA damage-inducible transcript 3 [Ddit3]).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> Although Chop is traditionally associated with apoptosis, its transcriptional targets exhibit significant overlap with those of Atf4, encompassing genes that paradoxically support cell survival and growth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> These findings underscore the context-dependent duality of the Atf4-Chop axis across different stress conditions, highlighting the need to elucidate its precise regulatory roles in specific physiological settings.</p>
<p>Through spatial transcriptomics (ST) and functional analyses, we demonstrate that zonal heterogeneity in APAP metabolism drives a stress-adaptive response in mid-zone hepatocytes during early AILI. This response is mediated by the Atf4-Chop-Btg2 axis, which orchestrates a transient proliferation arrest to prioritize cellular survival over regenerative capacity. Our findings elucidate the spatial and molecular mechanisms governing hepatocyte adaptation to acute injury, uncovering a critical survival-regeneration trade-off in early phase of acute liver injury.</p>

<title>Mid-zone hepatocytes exhibit the most pronounced proliferative decline during early acute liver injury</title>
<p>To assess hepatocyte proliferation in early AILI, wild-type C57BL/6J mice were intraperitoneally injected with 300 mg/kg APAP, and liver sections were analyzed at multiple time points (0, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours post-APAP). Immunohistochemical staining for Ki67, a proliferation marker, revealed that mid-zone hepatocytes exhibited a roughly 3-fold higher basal proliferative activity than PP and PC hepatocytes under homeostatic conditions (0 hour) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, B). During the early injury phase (3–12 hours post-APAP), the number of Ki67<sup>+</sup> hepatocytes in the mid-zone sharply declined from 70 to 20 per section, reaching proliferation levels similar to those in PP and PC zones (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, B). By 24 hours post-APAP, mid-zone proliferation gradually recovered (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, B), indicating a transient suppression of proliferation in this region during early AILI. Further analysis of proliferation dynamics in each zone confirmed that all zones exhibited reduced proliferation during the injury initiation phase, with the mid-zone showing the most decline (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Comparative value change analysis (relative to 0 hour) further supported these findings, highlighting the mid-zone as the most affected region in terms of proliferative suppression during early AILI (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>

<title>Mid-zone hepatocytes show distinct gene expression profiles with reduced proliferative activity during early acute injury</title>
<p>To investigate the mechanism underlying proliferation pause during early AILI, liver sections from wild-type mice treated with APAP for various time points were subjected to ST using the Visium (10 × Genomics) platform (Figure S1A). Due to variability in mice’s responses to APAP, multiple mice were treated at each time point, and the samples representing the average level at each time point were selected based on Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels for ST analysis. H&amp;E staining of liver sections used for ST revealed a gradual increase in the necrotic area from 0 to 24 hours (Figure S1B). Spatial map analysis consistently and unbiasedly divided the liver into three zones (PP, Mid, and PC) across all time points (Figures S1C). Analysis of ST data at 0, 3, 6, and 24 hours post-APAP via UMAP plots consistently revealed distinct zonal clusters and dynamic spatiotemporal patterns during the early phase of acute injury (Figures S1D and S1E). Spatiotemporally resolved heatmaps of representative markers, such as <italic>Glul</italic> (a PC marker) and <italic>Cyp2f2</italic> (a PP marker), further reinforced the stability of zonation profiles during early acute liver injury (Figure S1F). These findings suggest that while gene expression profiles change during acute injury, the fundamental spatial architecture of liver zones remains stable. Additionally, immunofluorescence staining of Glutamine Synthetase (GS, the protein product of <italic>Glul</italic>) and RNA-FISH for <italic>Cyp2f2</italic> in liver sections collected at 6 hours post-APAP confirmed these ST analyses (Figure S1G).</p>
<p>We further analyzed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in hepatocyte zones (PP, Mid, and PC) at 0, 3, 6, and 24 hours post-APAP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Throughout the 0 to 24-hour period post-APAP, gene expression in the PP remained relatively stable. At 0, 3, and 6 hours post-APAP, genes associated with metabolism (such as <italic>Hsd17b13</italic>, <italic>Fabp1</italic>, <italic>Apoc2</italic>, <italic>Thrsp</italic> for fat metabolism; <italic>Rida</italic>, <italic>Hal</italic>, <italic>Gls2</italic>, <italic>Bhmt</italic> for fatty acid metabolism; <italic>Aldob</italic>, <italic>Pck1</italic> for glucose metabolism) and transport (such as <italic>Alb</italic>, <italic>Hpx</italic>, <italic>Selenop</italic>, <italic>Trf</italic>, <italic>Lcn2</italic>) were prominently expressed, with a notable upregulation of inflammatory response-related genes (such as <italic>Orm1</italic>, <italic>Serpina1c</italic>, <italic>Lrg1</italic>) observed at 24 hours post-APAP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). In contrast, Mid-zone exhibited significant changes over time. Initially, it showed high expression of genes related to cell proliferation (such as <italic>Igfbp2</italic>), metabolism (such as <italic>Scd1</italic>, <italic>Cdo1</italic>, <italic>Ces1c</italic>, <italic>Ttr</italic>, <italic>Apoa1</italic>), and homeostasis (such as <italic>Hamp</italic>, <italic>Cps1</italic>, <italic>Rgn</italic>) at 0 hours, transitioning to stress response/cell survival (such as <italic>Hmox1</italic>, <italic>Hspa8</italic>, <italic>Atf3</italic>, <italic>Osgin1</italic>) and protein degradation/autophagy (such as <italic>Ubb</italic>, <italic>Ubc</italic>, <italic>Sqstm1</italic>) at 3 and 6 hours, and eventually shifting to cell proliferation and wound healing (such as <italic>Fgg</italic>, <italic>Fgl1</italic>, <italic>Fgb</italic>) by 24 hours post-APAP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The PC showed a decrease in xenobiotic metabolism (such as <italic>Cyp3a11</italic>, <italic>Cyp2e1</italic>, <italic>Cyp1a2</italic>, <italic>Cyp2c37</italic>) and fat metabolism (such as <italic>Apoe</italic>, <italic>Akr1c6</italic>, <italic>Hpd</italic>, <italic>Oat</italic>) during early AILI (at 0, 3, 6 hours post-APAP), with a marked increase in the expression of genes related to cytoskeleton (such as <italic>Actb</italic>, <italic>Krt8</italic>, <italic>Krt18</italic>) and redox regulation (such as <italic>Prdx1</italic>, <italic>Srxn1</italic>) observed at 24 hours post-APAP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). These differential expression patterns across various zones and time points post-APAP highlight significant changes in Mid-zone. Notably, our analysis suggests that the Mid-zone undergoes a stress adaption during the initial phases of acute liver injury.</p>

<p>Further analysis focuses on DEGs in Mid-zone at 6 hours post-APAP compared to 0 hour. The volcano plot revealed a notable increase in the number of genes significantly upregulated in the mid zones at 6 hours, predominantly associated with the stress response and adaptation (such as <italic>Atf3</italic>, <italic>Hmox1</italic>, <italic>Osgin1</italic>, <italic>Ddit3</italic>, <italic>Gadd45a</italic>, <italic>Atf4</italic>, <italic>Jun</italic>, <italic>Hspa1</italic>) as well as cell proliferation and apoptosis (such as <italic>Btg2</italic>, <italic>Egr1</italic>, <italic>Igfbp1</italic>, <italic>Sqstm1</italic>, <italic>Dnajb1</italic>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Among the significantly upregulated genes, Sqstm1 (Sequestosome 1) was selected for further validation. Sqstm1 encodes the p62 protein, a key regulator of autophagy and oxidative stress response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> While Sqstm1 expression was almost evenly distributed across all zones at 0 hours, it was markedly elevated in the mid-zone at 6 hours post-APAP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Immunohistochemical staining further confirmed the distinct localization of p62 in the mid-zone at this time point (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Together, our findings indicate that Mid-zone hepatocytes undergo dynamic changes during the early phases of acute liver injury, primarily characterized by stress response and adaptation.</p>
<p>Further ST analysis revealed that Ki67-positive spots also show a transient reduction during the early injury (at 3 and 6 hours post-APAP) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>), which aligns with the findings from Ki67 immunohistochemical staining. Cell cycle analysis is crucial for understanding cell proliferation, as it reviews the stages of the cell cycle that cells are in and how many cells are actively dividing.(23) In the cell cycle, the S phase is responsible for DNA synthesis and replication, while the G2M phase prepares cells for and executes mitosis.(23) Analysis of cell-cycle phase distribution, based on genes identified in previous studies,(24, 25) revealed that Mid-zone hepatocytes exhibited a transient increase in S-phase genes at 3 hours, followed by a decline at later time points (6, and 24 hours). In contrast, Mid-zone hepatocytes exhibited reduced G2/M-phase scores at 3 and 6 hours, returning to baseline levels by 24 hours (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). This suggests that Mid-zone hepatocytes may initiate DNA synthesis, but they are unable to complete the cycle due to the environmental toxicity or cellular damage. Nuclear Autoantigenic Sperm Protein (<italic>Nasp</italic>) binds to histones and facilitate chromatin assembly during the S phase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> Casein Kinase 1 Beta (<italic>Cks1b</italic>) participates in the control of G1 phase and the transition to the S phase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> High Nasp levels indicate efforts toward DNA repair and chromatin stability, while low <italic>Cks1b</italic> levels point to a potential cell cycle arrest or a reduction in cell proliferation to manage the damage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Overall, ST analysis revealed that Mid-zone hepatocytes exhibit distinct gene expression profiles and cell cycle arrest during early acute injury.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Zonal metabolism of APAP leads to stress response in Mid-zone hepatocytes</title>
<p>Next, we aimed to elucidate the cause for the stress response observed in the Mid-zone during early APAP. APAP is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes (Cyp family) into reactive metabolites, particularly N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), which can induce oxidative stress and damage cellular components if not promptly detoxified by glutathione (GSH) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). We analyzed the gene expression levels of Cyp family enzymes in hepatocyte zones (PP, Mid, and PC) at 0, 3, 6, and 24 hours post-APAP. Our analysis revealed a gradient decrease in the expression levels of most Cyp enzymes, showing a trend from high expression in PC to lower expression in PP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Scatter plots of representative Cyp enzymes, such as <italic>Cyp2e1</italic> and <italic>Cyp1a2</italic>, clearly showed a temporal and spatial expression pattern consistent with this gradient decrease from CV to PV (Figure S2A). Immunohistochemical staining of Cyp1a2 confirmed its gradient decrease in protein expression from the CV to the PV under homeostatic conditions (0 hour). However, following APAP-induced toxicity, Cyp1a2 expression declined around the CV— where necrosis was prominent—during the injury initiation phase (3–24 hours post-APAP). Consequently, the Mid-zone adjacent to necrotic regions emerged as the primary area retaining Cyp1a2 expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, D). These findings suggest that the spatial redistribution of Cyp expression establishes the Mid-zone as the primary site of APAP metabolism during early AILI, thereby inducing subsequent transcriptional reprogramming (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>).</p>

<p>To investigate this hypothesis, we administered mice with varying doses of APAP (100, 300, and 500 mg/kg) to induce different extents of liver injury. H&amp;E staining revealed a dose-dependent increase in the size of the injured areas, with higher doses resulting in larger areas of injury (Figure S2B and S2C). Subsequently, we performed immunofluorescence staining for Chop, a protein differentially highly expressed in the Mid-zone at 6 hours post-APAP compared to 0 hour (as identified in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), to assess the Mid-zone response. Our findings indicate that Chop expression is absent at low doses of APAP when necrosis does not occur. However, as the dose of APAP increases, the injured area expands, and Chop expression shifts toward the PV, consistently surrounding the injured area (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F and G</xref>). Together, these findings demonstrate that CV necrosis establishes the adjacent peri-necrotic region as the dominant site of APAP metabolism, contingent upon both Cyp family expression levels and APAP dosage. This spatially restricted metabolic adaptation drives subsequent region-specific transcriptional changes in the surrounding parenchyma (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>).</p>

<p>Among the top 10 TFs with highest activity in the Mid-zone during early AILI, Ddit3 and Atf3 were the two most highly expressed, with Atf4 ranking seventh (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref> and Figure S3B). Since Ddit3 expression is often regulated by Atf4, and the Atf4-Ddit3 axis plays a critical role in stress adaptation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> we chose to focus on this pathway for further investigation. The violin plot analysis demonstrated that Atf4 and Ddit3 were prominently active in Mid-zone, particularly at 3 and 6 hours post-APAP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> and Figure S3C). Gene regulatory networks illustrated associations between Atf4 and its target genes (such as <italic>Gdf15</italic>, <italic>Hspa8</italic>, and <italic>Ddit3</italic>) and Ddit3 with its targets (such as <italic>Hspa8</italic>, <italic>Hmox1</italic>, <italic>Osgin1</italic>, <italic>Gadd45a</italic>, and <italic>Egr1</italic>) at 3 hours post-APAP (Figure S3D). Heatmap further clearly showed that the target genes of Atf4 and Ddit3 are exclusively expressed in the Mid-zone hepatocytes at 6 hours post-APAP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Many of these target genes were DEGs in Mid-zone during early AILI, underscoring the critical role of the Atf4-Ddit3 axis in orchestrating gene expression changes in this region.</p>
<p>From the regulatory networks, it is evident that many genes regulated by Atf4 and Chop overlap. Therefore, we conducted a GO pathway analysis to identify the pathways co-regulated by Atf4 and Chop. The results revealed the top 15 enriched pathways for genes co-regulated by Atf4 and Chop in Mid-zone at 3 and 6 hours post-APAP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref> and Figure S3E). These pathways encompass responses to unfolded proteins, stress, autophagy, and regulation of apoptotic signaling pathways. Additionally, GO pathway analysis identified the top 15 enriched pathways for up-regulated genes specifically in Mid-zone at 3 hours post-APAP compared to other zones, further highlighting pathways co-regulated by Atf4 and Chop in response to APAP (Figure S3F). The pathways co-regulated by Atf4 and Chop point to the activation of ISR. To confirm the occurrence of ISR in Mid-zone during the initiation stage of AILI, we performed immunohistochemical staining for phosphorylated eIF2α (p-eIF2α) at 0 and 3 hours post-APAP and observed increased expression of p-eIF2α in the mid-zone (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). While the ISR is a generalized pathway integrating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and other insults through eIF2α kinases, ER stress is a subset of cellular stresses that activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) via PERK/IRE1/ATF6. Their overlap occurs at PERK-eIF2α-ATF4, but ER stress uniquely engages IRE1/XBP1 and ATF6 for ER-specific repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> To evaluate the involvement of ER stress in Mid-zone, we further analyzed the expression levels of genes related to stress response and ER stress based on DEGs identified in Mid-zone at 0, 3, and 6 hours post-APAP treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref> and Figure S3G). Most of stress response-related genes are highly upregulated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref> and Figure S3G). However, despite the high expression of <italic>Atf4</italic> and <italic>Ddit3</italic>, other ER stress-related genes, such as <italic>Eif2ak3</italic>, <italic>Atf6</italic>, and <italic>Xbp1</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> either remained unchanged or were downregulated at 3 and 6 hours compared to 0 hour post-APAP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref> and Figure S3G). This analysis highlights the unique role of the Atf4-Ddit3 axis in Mid-zone during early AILI.</p>
<p>To validate Mid-zone responses and transcriptional changes during early AILI, we analyzed an additional scRNA-seq dataset from AILI mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> UMAP visualization demonstrated that hepatocytes could be clustered into three distinct zones (PP, PC, and Mid) at 3 and 6 hours post-APAP (Figures S4A and S4B). The zonal gene expression patterns were confirmed, with PC-specific genes (<italic>Glul, Cyp2e1, Cyp2a5</italic>), PP-specific genes (<italic>Alb, Cyp2f2, Sds</italic>), and Mid-zone genes (<italic>Hmox1, Atf3, Ubc</italic>) exhibiting distinct spatial distributions (Figure S4C). GO pathway analysis revealed the top 10 enriched pathways for upregulated genes in Mid-zonal hepatocytes at 3 and 6 hours post-APAP, highlighting key stress-response and cell death processes (Figures S4D and S4E). Consistent with our findings, SCENIC analysis also identified the activation of similar TF motifs across zonal regions, with distinct Ddit3 and Atf3 motifs activated in Mid-zone hepatocytes at 3 and 6 hours post-APAP (Figures S4F and S4G). These results reinforce the regulatory changes observed in our ST data, further emphasizing the unique role of mid-zonal hepatocytes in stress adaptation.</p>

<p>Among the Ddit3-binding DEGs, we observed B-cell translocation gene 2 (Btg2), which is cell cycle inhibitor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> Moreover, <italic>Btg2</italic> is one of the target genes that coregulated by Ddit3 and Atf4.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study reveals that during the early phase of AILI, mid-zone hepatocytes undergo a transient proliferation arrest, orchestrated by a distinctive transcriptional program centered on the Atf4-Chop axis. Spatial transcriptomics and functional assays demonstrate that this adaptive response promotes survival by upregulating the cell cycle inhibitor Btg2, highlighting a trade-off between cytoprotection and proliferative capacity. Notably, zonal metabolic heterogeneity in APAP processing drives preferential activation of these stress pathways in mid-zone hepatocytes. These findings uncover a critical mechanism by which hepatocytes prioritize stress adaptation before initiating regeneration, offering new insights into the spatiotemporal regulation of liver repair (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

<p>Our study reveals that mid-zone hepatocytes employ a protective proliferation arrest during early AILI, mediated by the Atf4-Chop axis of the integrated stress response (ISR). While the ISR shares upstream initiators with ER stress (e.g., eIF2α phosphorylation), its outcomes are context-dependent. ER stress specifically activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) through sensors inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> with genetic studies demonstrating their critical roles in AILI – knockout of IRE1α, X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), or Chop consistently attenuates liver damage, confirming the UPR’s contribution to hepatotoxicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> Unlike classical ER stress, we find that mid-zone hepatocytes leverage the Atf4-Chop axis to transiently halt proliferation via Btg2, favoring survival. This aligns with emerging evidence that Chop can paradoxically support adaptation in mitochondrial stress,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> suggesting that its role in fine-turning of ISR in mammals.</p>
<p>The antiproliferative activity of Btg2 has been studied through an integrated network of transcriptional and post-transcriptional cell cycle regulatory mechanisms. A study reveals that Btg2 functions as a molecular bridge between poly(A)-binding protein cytoplasmic 1 (PABPC1) and the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex subunit CNOT7 (CAF1), facilitating accelerated degradation of cell cycle-related transcripts through enhanced poly(A) tail removal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> At the transcriptional level, Btg2 exerts specific control over G2/M progression by disrupting the positive feedback loop between cyclin B1 and its transcriptional activator FOXM1 (forkhead box protein M1), thereby suppressing cyclin B1 expression and inducing cell cycle arrest.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> Furthermore, Btg2 demonstrates broader cell cycle inhibitory capacity through its interactions with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) during G1/S transition and its ability to modulate the tumor suppressor p53 (TP53).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> In the context of AILI, the stress-responsive Atf4-Chop pathway induces Btg2 expression in mid-zonal hepatocytes, where it may coordinate a comprehensive proliferation arrest through these complementary mechanisms. This multilayered regulatory strategy enables hepatocytes to temporarily suspend cell division and redirect resources toward cellular repair and stress adaptation during the acute phase of toxic injury.</p>
<p>A key limitation of this study is the scarcity of early-phase AILI human samples, which currently precludes definitive validation of the clinical relevance of these zonal adaptations. To address this gap, we performed a preliminary analysis of published single-cell RNA sequencing data from APAP-overdose patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> Intriguingly, in one of two analyzed patients, mid-zone hepatocytes exhibited transcriptional signatures remarkably consistent with our murine findings, including: (1) upregulation of Atf4-Chop pathways, and (2) downregulation of cell proliferation genes. While the small sample size (n=2) prevents definitive conclusions, these preliminary observations suggest potential conservation of stress-responsive mechanisms between murine and human mid-zone hepatocytes during AILI. Further studies with larger clinical cohorts will be essential to verify these findings and establish their translational significance.</p>
<p>In summary, our study uncovers a spatially coordinated stress adaptation mechanism in mid-zone hepatocytes during early AILI, where the Atf4-Chop axis transiently suppresses proliferation via Btg2 upregulation. By elucidating how hepatocytes prioritize survival before initiating repair, our work provides a framework for understanding the dynamic interplay between stress adaptation and regeneration in tissues.</p>

<p>This study addresses an <bold>important</bold> question in liver biology: how zonal hepatocytes balance survival and proliferation following injury; using spatial transcriptomics, mechanistic perturbations, and functional assays, the authors propose that a mid-zone Atf4-Chop axis to Btg2 program temporarily suppresses proliferation to promote survival during APAP-induced hepatotoxicity. The idea that distinct intrahepatic zones mount tailored stress responses is conceptually significant and has implications for regeneration and toxicology. The dataset is rich and the methodology modern, but several conclusions rely on assumptions about zonation under injury, limited injury models, and <bold>incomplete</bold> functional validation of the Atf4-Chop-Btg2 axis. With targeted revisions and additional experiments, the work has the potential to provide strong mechanistic insights into liver zonation and injury responses.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors present evidence that during acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury, mid-zone hepatocytes activate an integrated stress response (ISR) program via Atf4 and Chop, leading to induction of Btg2. This program suppresses proliferation in the early phase of injury, prioritizing hepatocyte survival before regeneration begins. The study uses spatial transcriptomics, immunohistochemistry, CUT&amp;RUN, and AAV overexpression to support this model.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Innovative use of spatial transcriptomics to capture zonal differences in hepatocyte stress responses.</p>
<p>(2) Identification of a mid-zone specific ISR signature and candidate downstream regulator Btg2.</p>
<p>(3) Functional experiments with Atf4-Chop-Btg2 modulation provide causal evidence linking ISR activation to proliferation inhibition.</p>
<p>(4) Conceptually significant model that hepatocytes actively balance survival and regeneration dynamically in a zone-specific manner.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Zonation definition under injury has been shown to be sustained broadly, but is not sufficiently validated and quantified, especially considering the resolution of the 10x Visium system and the potential variation of outcomes based on how to define zones.</p>
<p>(2) The model is built entirely in APAP injury, which specifically targets pericentral hepatocytes. It remains unclear whether the proposed mechanism applies to other liver injuries (e.g., partial hepatectomy, CCl4).</p>
<p>(3) Baseline proliferation appears higher than expected in homeostasis (Figure 1B), and fold change analysis (not absolute counts) may be needed to assess zonal proliferation suppression (Figure 1D).</p>
<p>(4) AAV-based overexpression raises potential confounds (altered CYP activity before injury) and shows incomplete penetrance that is not quantified. (Figure 5 - Figure 6).</p>
<p>(5) The functional link between proliferation suppression and improved survival is inferred, but direct survival /injury readouts are limited.</p>

<p>The manuscript reports protection of midlobular hepatocytes from APAP toxicity by activation of Atf4-CHOP (Ddit3)-mediated cell cycle arrest and stress response. The authors acknowledge that their finding is unexpected because CHOP typically induces cell death. Therefore, they functionally validate several aspects of the proposed Atf4-CHOP mechanism. Along these lines, the mitigation of APAP toxicity by AAV expression of Atf4 or Btg2, the latter identified as CHOP effector, is impressive. Whether Atf4 indeed acts through CHOP and whether midlobular hepatocytes are protected because of cell cycle arrest is less clear. These and other criticisms are described in the following.</p>
<p>Major points:</p>
<p>(1) Starting with the basics, one wonders why midlobular hepatocytes manage to mount a defensive response to APAP but pericentral hepatocytes don't. Is this because midlobular hepatocytes express the relevant Cyps (2e1, but also 1a2 and 3a11) at lower levels, which mitigates toxicity and buys them time? This would be supported by F2A but not by F3B, at least not for the most important Cyp2e1. A moderate difference is shown for Cyp1a2 expression in F3D, but is that enough to explain the different fates? Or are additional post-transcriptional effects on these Cyps at work?</p>
<p>(2) The evidence presented in support of cell cycle arrest of midlobular hepatocytes is not fully convincing: there is no overt difference in S and G2/M gene scores in F2F; the marker genes used for S phase and G1 to S progression in F2G are unusual. Along these lines, one wonders if spatial transcriptomics confirmed the Ki67 immunostaining results in F1 also for specific zones, not only overall, as shown in F2E?</p>
<p>(3) The authors conclude in line 364 that halting of proliferation by Btg2 favors survival, which raises the question of whether Btg2 knockout causes death in midlobular hepatocytes in F6K. Data addressing this question, that is, the localization and extent of tissue necrosis and ALT levels after APAP, are missing. The efficiency of the knockout of Btg2 is also not given.</p>
<p>(4) Related to the previous question, the BTG2 immunostaining in F6F is not convincing when compared to F6D. One also wonders if it is necessary to apply APAP to find induction of BTG2 by AAV-Ddit3?</p>
<p>(5) Related to the previous question, the proposed Atf4-Ddit3 axis is challenged by the lack of midlobular induction of Atf4 in the APAP scRNA-seq data published by another group, presented in S4F and G. Further analysis of AAV-Atf4 samples generated for F5 could address whether it is really Atf4 that acts on Ddit3 in APAP toxicity.</p>
<p>(6) Related to the previous question, the ATF4 immunostaining in F5A doesn't look convincing, with many brown pigments appearing to be outside of the nucleus.</p>
<p>(7) It is not ruled out that AAV expression of Atf4 or Btg2 reduces hepatocyte sensitivity to APAP by affecting the expression of the Cyps needed for activation. In other words, does AAV-Atf4 or AAV-Btg2 change the expression of any of the Cyps relevant to APAP in the 3 weeks before APAP application (F5B)?</p>
<p>(8) It is laudable that the authors tried to extend their findings to humans by using snRNA-seq data from a published study (line 391), but it is unclear why they didn't analyze all 10 patients in that study but instead focused on 2 and stated that this small sample number prevented drawing definitive conclusions and could therefore only be mentioned in the discussion.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper by Zhu et al explores zonal gene expression changes and stress responses in the liver after APAP injury. 3-6 hours after APAP, zone 2 hepatocytes demonstrate important gene expression changes. There is an increase in stress response/cell survival genes such as Hmox1, Hspa8, Atf3, and protein degradation/autophagy genes such as Ubb, Ubc, and Sqstm1. This is hypothesized to be a &quot;stress adaption&quot; which happens during the initial phases of acute liver injury. Furthermore, there is a spatial redistribution of Cyp450 expression that then establishes the Mid-zone as the primary site of APAP metabolism during early AILI. This particular finding was identified previously by other groups in several single-cell papers. Ddit3 (Chop) expression also increases in zone 2. The authors focused mostly on the Atf4-Ddit3 axis in stress adaptation. Importantly, they probe the functionality of this axis by overexpressing either ATF4 or DDIT3 using AAV tools, and they show that these manipulations block APAP-induced injury and necrosis. This is somewhat convincing evidence that these stress response proteins are probably important during injury and regeneration.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, I think this is a useful study, showing that the Mid-lobular zone 2 hepatocytes turn on a stress-responsive gene program that suppresses proliferation, and that this is functionally important for efficient, long-term regeneration and homeostasis. This adds to the body of literature showing the importance of zone 2 cells in hepatic regeneration, and also provides an additional mechanism that tells us how they are better at surviving chemical injuries.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The main concern is that the overexpression of ATF4 and DDIT3 is causing reduced cell death and damage by APAP. This makes it harder to understand if these genes are truly increasing survival or if they are just reducing the injury caused by APAP. It may be better to perform overexpression immediately after, or at the same time as APAP delivery. Alternatively, loss-of-function experiments using AAV-shRNAs against these targets could be useful.</p>
