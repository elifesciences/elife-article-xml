<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Although most species have two sexes, multisexual species (i.e., those with multiple mating types) are also widespread. However, it is unclear how mating-type recognition is achieved at the molecular level in multisexual species. The unicellular ciliate <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic> has seven mating types, which are determined by the MTA and MTB proteins. In this study, we found that both proteins are essential for cells to send or receive complete mating-type information, and transmission of the mating-type signal requires both proteins to be expressed in the same cell. We found that MTA and MTB form a mating-type recognition complex that localizes to the plasma membrane, but not to the cilia. Stimulation experiments showed that the mating-type-specific regions of MTA and MTB mediate both self-and non-self-recognition, indicating that <italic>T. thermophila</italic> uses a dual approach to achieve mating-type recognition. Our results suggest that MTA and MTB form an elaborate multifunctional protein complex that can identify cells of both self and non-self mating types in order to inhibit or activate mating, respectively.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sexual reproduction is almost universal among eukaryotic organisms. Mating type (or sex) is a key regulatory feature of gamete fusion. Most species have only two mating types (e.g., male and female, + and -, or a and α) and species usually use either self-or non-self-recognition mechanism to achieve mating-type recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Goodenough &amp; Heitman, 2014</xref>). However, species in some lineages, such as some ciliates and basidiomycetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Heitman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Phadke &amp; Zufall, 2010</xref>), possess multiple mating types, and multiple-alleles self-incompatibility system were observed in some plants, such as Brassicaceae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Iwano &amp; Takayama, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Takayama &amp; Isogai, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Vekemans &amp; Castric, 2021</xref>). This raises the interesting question of how mating types are recognized at the molecular level in multiple mating-type systems.</p>
<p>The model unicellular ciliate, <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic>, has seven mating types (I–VII). Under starvation conditions, any cell of one mating type can mate with a cell of any of the other six mating types, but not with one of the same mating type (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref rid="figs1-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>, Video 1–3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Cervantes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Nanney, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Orias et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Yan et al., 2021</xref>). Mating-type recognition in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> depends on direct cell–cell contact, which suggests that mating-type proteins localize to the cell surface. However, there is no direct evidence to indicate whether they are ciliary proteins or not. When one cell comes into contact with a cell of a different mating type, a mating-type-dependent recognition event enables both cells to enter a pre-conjugation stage (called costimulation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bruns &amp; Palestine, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Finley &amp; Bruns, 1980</xref>). Even when cells of different mating types are mixed in unequal ratios (for example, 9 : 1), all cells become fully stimulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bruns &amp; Palestine, 1975</xref>). Processes that take place during costimulation include Tip transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Wolfe &amp; Grimes, 1979</xref>) and concanavalin A (Con-A) receptor appearance (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Wolfe &amp; Feng, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Wolfe et al., 1986</xref>). In preparation for pairing, costimulated cells of the same and different mating type(s) adhere to form very loose pairs. Heterotypic cell pairs form a stable conjugation junction, whereas homotypic pairs separate very quickly (Video 2 and 3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kitamura et al., 1986</xref>).</p>

<p>The mating-type system of <italic>T. thermophila</italic> was described by Nanney and collaborators in the early 1950s (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Orias, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Orias et al., 2017</xref>)). We previously showed that mating type is determined by a pair of mating-type genes that are organized in head-to-head orientation: <italic>MTA</italic> and <italic>MTB</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Cervantes et al., 2013</xref>). Each gene has a terminal exon that encodes five transmembrane (TM) helices and a cysteine-rich growth factor receptor (GFR) domain. The region between the two terminal exons of the gene pair encodes the N-terminal mating-type-specific extracellular regions. Based on the mating-type-specific regions, the mating-type genes are called <italic>MTA1-MTB1</italic> for Mating type I, <italic>MTA2-MTB2</italic> for Mating type II and so on. We previously showed that Δ<italic>MTB</italic> cells do not form pairs or produce progeny and that Δ<italic>MTA</italic> cells retain mating-type specificity but pair extremely poorly and rarely produced progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Cervantes et al., 2013</xref>); we concluded that the two genes are non-redundant and both are essential for mating. However, challenges such as multiple mating types; the high molecular weight, membrane localization and extremely low expression levels of mating-type proteins; and difficulty in genetically manipulating the mating-type gene locus have so far prevented elucidation of the mode of action of the MTA and MTB proteins and of whether they mediate self-or non-self mating-type recognition.</p>
<p>In this study, we provide direct evidence that the MTA and MTB form an elaborate multifunctional protein complex that can identify cells of both self and non-self mating types to inhibit or activate mating, respectively.</p>

<title>Mating-type recognition cannot be explained by a simple receptor–ligand model</title>
<p>Receptor–ligand interactions are a critical mechanism for intercellular communication that may regulate mating-type recognition in <italic>T. thermophila</italic>, irrespective of whether self-or non-self-recognition mechanisms are employed. Therefore, we first assessed whether mating-type recognition conforms to a straightforward receptor–ligand model (in which one mating-type protein acts as the receptor and the other as the ligand) and whether self or non-self is recognized (<xref rid="figs2-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2–figure supplement 1A, 1</xref> and 2). For this, we determined whether deletion of each mating-type gene affected the transmission and detection of mating signals to and from wild-type (WT) cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> shows the experimental procedure) by assessing the ability of cells to undergo costimulation (the prerequisite for mating). Our experiment allows us to test if cells missing one of the two mating-type proteins can still costimulate WT cells (<xref rid="figs2-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2–figure supplement 1A</xref>, 3 and 6).</p>

<p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental procedure for the costimulation experiments. Starved WT cells of mating types V (WT-V) and VII (WT-VII) were separately pre-incubated with the indicated mating type VI mutant (9 : 1 ratio) for 30 min and then the pre-incubated cells were mixed at a 1 : 1 ratio. Note that before mixing the costimulated cells, any potentially pairing cells were separated by shaking. (<bold>B</bold>) Effect of pre-incubation with Δ<italic>MTA</italic> and Δ<italic>MTB</italic> on the rate of pair formation. Each experiment was repeated three times, with &gt; 100 pairs counted at each time point. Matched two-way ANOVA was used for the statistical analysis. N.S., not significant; *, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; **, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01; ***, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; ****, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001. Unpaired mutants were excluded when calculating the pairing rate (see Materials and Methods). (<bold>C</bold>) Tip transformation, a hallmark of costimulation. Costimulated cells from two different WT strains are shown because their tips have slightly different shapes. Each strain was pre-incubated with the strain shown in subscript. Yellow dashed circle, transformed cell tip. (<bold>D</bold>) Appearance of Con-A receptors, another hallmark of costimulation. In all, ∼90% cells show Con-A receptor fluorescence (panels 4, 5 and 9). The low percentage of cells (7%) with fluorescence in panel 7 were probably WT cells, which comprised 10% of the pre-incubation culture. Each strain was pre-incubated with the strain shown in subscript. Yellow dashed circle, Con-A receptor fluorescence.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="566168v1_fig2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>In <italic>T. thermophila</italic>, cells normally enter into the fully costimulation stage within ∼30 min after mixing starved WT cells of two different mating types, and start pair formation during the next ∼30 min (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, black line). Cells that have already been costimulated immediately start forming pairs with other costimulated cells of a different mating type (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, red line).</p>
<p>To our surprise, the rate of pair formation in WT cells pre-incubated with either Δ<italic>MTA</italic> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, green line) or Δ<italic>MTB</italic> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, blue line) did not increase (i.e., costimulation did not occur). These results were not changed by extending the pre-incubation time (<xref rid="figs2-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2–figure supplement 1B</xref>). Therefore, both MTA and MTB proteins are essential for the mating-type signal; there is no simple receptor–ligand relationship.</p>
<p>In addition, WT cells were not costimulated even when they were simultaneously incubated with both Δ<italic>MTA</italic> and Δ<italic>MTB</italic> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, teal line), although, according to the receptor–ligand model, they should have received “MTA stimulation” from Δ<italic>MTB</italic> cells and “MTB stimulation” from Δ<italic>MTA</italic> cells. This result indicates that the absence of a mating-type protein in one cell cannot be complemented by its presence in another cell in the same culture; the MTA and MTB proteins must be in the same cell to transmit the mating-type signal. This finding suggests that mating-type recognition cannot be explained by a simple receptor–ligand model. It is possible that the MTA and MTB proteins form a complex which either serves as a recognizer (functioning as both ligand and receptor) or a co-receptor (which influences ligand–receptor activity). But, since MTA and MTB are the only genes with mating-type-specificity, it is unlikely that the complex is acting as a co-receptor.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Mating-type proteins differentially regulate two steps of costimulation</title>
<p>During costimulation, cells undergo a sequence of developmental events that remodel the anterior cell membrane and its associated cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cole, 2013</xref>). Two hallmarks of this process are Tip transformation (in which the anterior tip of the cell becomes curved) and Con-A receptor appearance (receptors bound by the plant lectin concanavalin A, which binds to mannose containing glycoproteins). When WT cells of one mating type were mixed with WT cells of another mating type, the cell tips became transformed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, 5 and 9) and Con-A receptors appeared in almost all cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, 4). When WT cells were pre-incubated with Δ<italic>MTA</italic>, Δ<italic>MTB</italic>, or both cell types, Tip transformation was not observed in any cell (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, 6–8). Similarly, when cells of each mutant were pre-incubated with WT cells, Tip transformation was not detected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, 10 and 11). The outcome was slightly different for Con-A receptor appearance. Con-A receptors were not observed in WT cells pre-incubated with Δ<italic>MTB</italic> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, 6) or in cells of either mutant pre-incubated with WT cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, 7 and 8). In contrast, when WT cells were exposed to Δ<italic>MTA</italic> or “Δ<italic>MTA</italic> cells plus Δ<italic>MTB</italic> cells”, the Con-A receptor was detected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, 5 and 9); this is consistent with Δ<italic>MTA</italic> cells retaining a very weak ability to pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Cervantes et al., 2013</xref>). These results indicate that neither Δ<italic>MTA</italic> and Δ<italic>MTB</italic> cells can fully stimulate WT cells or be stimulated by WT cells. They also demonstrate that costimulation can be separated into two stages: (i) the appearance of Con-A receptors, which requires the expression of MTB only in partner cells, and (ii) morphological transformation of the cell tip, which requires both MTA and MTB.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Mating-type proteins form a complex with several coexpressed proteins</title>
<p>The inability of “Δ<italic>MTA</italic> cells plus Δ<italic>MTB</italic> cells” to costimulate WT cells of a different mating type indicates that MTA and MTB proteins can only function when expressed on the same cell (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, teal; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, 8). We previously found that CDK19 and CYC9 proteins are also essential for mating. Δ<italic>CDK19</italic> and Δ<italic>CYC9</italic> cells cannot mate with other cells, but they still express MTA and MTB proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ma et al., 2020</xref>). In WT cells, the pairing rate was increased following pre-incubation with Δ<italic>CDK19</italic> or Δ<italic>CYC9</italic> cells of a different mating type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ma et al., 2020</xref>). These results further support the idea that MTA and MTB must be expressed on the same cell to be fully functional, leading us to hypothesize that MTA and MTB proteins form a <underline>m</underline>ating-type recognition <underline>c</underline>omplex (MTRC).</p>
<p>To test whether MTA and MTB proteins physically interact, an HA-tag coding sequence was ligated to the 3ʹ end of the <italic>MTA</italic> gene (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>); cellular proteins were co-precipitated with HA-tagged MTA and analyzed by immunoprecipitation-coupled mass spectrometry (IP-MS). As expected, the MTB protein co-purified with MTA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, C), as did another set of proteins, which we named MRC1–MRC6 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, C and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>–Source data 1 and 2). Next, we produced strains expressing either HA-tagged MTB or MRC1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), and found that each protein pulled down a subset of the proteins that co-purified with MTA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, C). Unfortunately, these pull-down experiments were not as successful as the MTA IPs, perhaps because of the higher molecular weight of MTB and MRC1. Taken together, our results suggest that MTA, MTB, and MRC1–MRC6 form the MTRC. Alternatively, MTA and MTB may interact with subsets of MRC proteins to form smaller complexes or alternative MTRCs. Different protein interactors were identified in extracts from cells at different mating stages. This may reflect conformational changes in the MTRC but the huge molecular weight of the complex and extremely low expression levels of its proteins make this possibility difficult to investigate.</p>

<p>Mating-type-related factors in other species are often relatively small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Iwano &amp; Takayama, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Kahmann &amp; Bölker, 1996</xref>), but those of <italic>T. thermophila</italic> are large proteins (predicted size, 92–212 kDa). <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref> shows the predicted domains of the MRC1–MRC6 proteins. Like MTA and MTB, MRC1 has five predicted TM helices and a GFR domain. MRC2 has eight TM helices and a pectin lyase-fold domain, suggesting a possible role in carbohydrate chain modification. MRC3 has two TM helices in the central region and an adjacent ∼35 amino acid (aa) poly-E region. MRC4 and MRC5 (previously named TPA9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Wang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Wang &amp; Takeyasu, 1997</xref>)) are both P-type ATPases that are likely to function as calcium-translocators. MRC6 has four TM helices and a P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolases. Most of the MRC genes are highly coexpressed with <italic>MTA</italic> and <italic>MTB</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Examination of the whole genome sequences of strains with mating types II–VII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), confirmed that only the sequences of <italic>MTA</italic> and <italic>MTB</italic> genes are mating-type-specific.</p>
<p>In addition to the MRC proteins, CDK19, CYC9, CIP1, and AKM3 were identified in IP-MS experiments, but with relatively few supporting peptides (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Our previous work showed that CDK19, CYC9, and CIP1 are components of a cyclin-dependent kinase complex. These genes are coexpressed with <italic>MTA</italic> and <italic>MTB</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>) and are important for mating, and the encoded proteins localize to the cell tip and pairing junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ma et al., 2020</xref>). AKM3 is predicted to be a K<sup>+</sup> channel of unknown biological function. It is coexpressed with <italic>MTA</italic> and <italic>MTB</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), and we found that the <italic>AKM3</italic> deletion strain cannot pair. Therefore, these four proteins are also likely to interact with the mating-type proteins (perhaps indirectly and/or via weak interactions) and might be involved in downstream signaling following mating-type recognition.</p>

<title>Mating-type proteins localize to the cell surface but not to the cilia</title>
<p>We used the MTA7-HA strain to determine the localization of mating-type proteins. Cell fractionation (<xref rid="figs4-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>) revealed that MTA7-HA is a membrane protein (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Biotinylation and isolation of cell surface proteins confirmed that MTA7-HA is exposed on the cell surface (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). To investigate whether MTA7-HA localizes to the cilia membrane, we isolated and collected cilia (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>) and then analyzed cilia protein extracts by IP-coupled western blotting (WB) and MS. MS analysis identified typical ciliary proteins, such as inner and outer arm dynein proteins (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>–Source data 1). However, both IP-WB (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>) and MS (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>–Source data 1) consistently failed to identify MTA7-HA protein in the cilia fraction. These results conclusively indicate that MTA7-HA localizes to the cell surface, but not to cilia. Unfortunately, we failed to detect MTA7-HA by immunofluorescence staining of cells at any mating stage (starvation, costimulation, or conjugation), probably due to the epitope masking and extremely low expression level.</p>

<p>To further examine localization of the mating-type proteins, eGFP-tagged MTB2 was overexpressed from an exogenous locus (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). This strain (which has a mating type VI background) mated normally with WT cells of all mating types except for VI and II. This result indicates the overexpressed MTB2-eGFP protein is fully functional for mating. Interestingly, cells of this strain can also mate with one another (self-mating); a similar phenotype was previously reported for strains expressing multiple mating-type proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Lin &amp; Yao, 2020</xref>). The overexpressed MTB2-eGFP protein was detected on the cell surface in a linear pattern radiating from the cell tip to the cell body along the ciliary rows (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>, costimulated cell; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>, mating pair), although signals are also apparent between ciliary rows. Co-staining with a tubulin dye showed that the MTB2-eGFP protein is adjacent to, rather than co-localizing with, the base of cilia (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>, G, enlarged). Confocal images from the interior of the cell and through the cilia showed that MTB2-eGFP localizes to the cell surface (and also to intracellular structures, probably the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi), but not to the cilia (<xref rid="figs4-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>), confirming our results with the MTA7-HA protein (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-D</xref>).

<p>First, we tested whether MTAxc and MTBxc can influence mating in cells with a different mating-type specificity (i.e., non-self-recognition). When WT cells were incubated with MTAxc (and/or MTBxc) of a different mating type, markers of costimulation were not observed (<xref rid="figs5-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5–figure supplement 2</xref>). Surprisingly, treated cells had a significantly increased pairing rate. Compared with controls (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A–C</xref>, black), WT cells (VI and VII) pre-treated with MTAxc or MTBxc of different mating types (VII and VI, respectively) had an increased pairing rate (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A–C</xref>, green or blue), with a stronger effect after pre-treatment with both MTAxc and MTBxc (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A–C</xref>, teal). Dose–effect assays showed that pairing rates increased with increasing MTA6xc and MTB6xc concentrations between 3 pg/ml and 30 pg/ml, with the effect becoming saturated or weaker at higher concentrations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A–F</xref>). MTAxc and MTBxc also stimulated mating for all other WT mating types (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>, H), indicating that this is a general effect.

<p>We used similar methods to examine whether pre-treatment with a cognate mating-type-specific region (i.e., self-recognition) affects mating. Treatment of WT cells (VI and VII) with MTAxc and/or MTBxc of the same mating type decreased the pairing rate (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>, E, green or blue).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although the basic biological features of the <italic>T. thermophila</italic> mating-type system were discovered over half a century ago, the mechanism for mating-type recognition remains unclear. Here, we identified a novel MTRC that contains MTA, MTB, and several other proteins and provide evidence that MTA and MTB mediate both self and non-self mating-type recognition.</p>
<p>In most species, mating signals are associated with relatively small proteins or molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Iwano &amp; Takayama, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Kahmann &amp; Bölker, 1996</xref>). However, in <italic>T. thermophila</italic>, the MTRC is likely to be over a million Daltons in size. This large size is consistent with its multiple functions: An elaborate MTRC is needed to inhibit mating between cells of the same mating type while also activating mating between cells of different mating types. This is likely to be a highly complex process, given that there are seven mating types in all. Further structural studies of this protein complex may reveal the specific self-and non-self-recognition mechanisms.</p>
<p>An open question is why <italic>T. thermophila</italic> should use such a dual approach to achieving mating-type recognition. Recent research on basidiomycetes and flowering plants (other species with multiple mating types) has shown that their mating-type recognition (or self-incompatibility) mechanisms involve either self-or non-self-recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Fraser &amp; Heitman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Iwano &amp; Takayama, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Vekemans &amp; Castric, 2021</xref>). Our previous evolutionary study showed that the length of the mating-type-specific region differs significantly among different <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Yan et al., 2021</xref>). Based on the massive difference in length, it is reasonable to speculate that different species might use different mechanisms for mating-type recognition. Therefore, dramatic evolution of the mating-type recognition mechanism seems to have occurred relatively soon after the emergence of the <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> genus. Further detailed functional and evolutionary studies may reveal how and why this recognition mechanism evolved and how its evolution contributed to speciation.</p>
<p>We still do not know what intracellular signals are transduced when the MTRCs on two cells interact. Mating-type self-recognition might generate an inhibitory signal or might simply inactivate the MTRC. In many species, such as <italic>Papaver rhoeas</italic> and <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic>, interaction between mating-type proteins of the same mating type induces changes in cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration that cause self-incompatibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Giamarchi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Harada et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Wu et al., 2011</xref>). A similar system may exist in <italic>T. thermophila</italic>, since the MRC4 and MRC5 proteins are predicted to be Ca<sup>2+</sup>-translocators. Interaction between MTRCs on cells of different mating types (non-self-recognition) should result in their activation to allow the cells to initiate pairing. We propose that the activation signal involves the CDK19 complex (a cyclin-dependent kinase complex) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ma et al., 2020</xref>) and AKM3 (a K<sup>+</sup> channel; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>) because they probably interact with the MTRC. We expect future studies to lead to the discovery of more detailed mechanisms for mating-type recognition and initiation of conjugation involving these proteins.</p>
<p><italic>Paramecium tetraurelia</italic>, a closely related Oligohymenophorean ciliate, has only two mating types, which are determined by the expression or non-expression of a <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>-MTA/B-like protein called mtA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Singh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Yan et al., 2021</xref>). An intriguing question is whether mtA also engages in the formation of a MTRC with other proteins by serving as a recognizer rather than mediating a straightforward receptor–ligand interaction. Future investigations of <italic>Paramecium tetraurelia</italic> may shed light on the origins and evolutionary aspects of this distinctive mating system. Moreover, due to the extremely long evolutionary distance, recognition mechanisms discovered in model species fall short of explaining many of the intricate biological events in protists. Insight into the detailed function of MTRC could contribute to our understanding of cell–cell recognition processes in other species, such as <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> and <italic>Plasmodium</italic>.</p>

For analysis of Tip transformation, cells were observed and photographed as soon as possible after fixation with 1% PFA. To distinguish between cell strains in a pairing mixture, starved cells of one strain were labeled with 500 nM MitoTracker (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR, USA), followed by two washes with 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) before mixing.</p>

<title>Expression and purification of the extracellular region of mating-type proteins</title>
<p>Coding sequences of the extracellular region of mating-type proteins (MTA6xc, MTB6xc, MTA7xc, and MTB7xc) were codon-optimized and synthesized for expression in an insect-cell system (<italic>Trichoplusia ni</italic> Hi5 cells). Codon-optimized sequences were cloned into pFastBac vectors containing an N-terminal hemolin signal peptide sequence and a C-terminal 10×His tag sequence. The obtained constructs were transformed into competent DH10Bac cells and individual bacmids were transfected into <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> Sf9 cells. Recombinant Baculoviruses were collected after 4 days and used to infect <italic>Trichoplusia ni</italic> Hi5 cells for protein expression. Proteins were harvested 60 h after infection and purified with Ni-NTA Superflow resin (Qiagen), anion-exchange chromatography (Source 15Q, GE Healthcare), and size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex-200 Increase 10/300, GE Healthcare).</p>

<title>Bioinformatics analysis</title>
<p>All microarray data were derived from <italic>Tetra</italic>FGD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Xiong et al., 2011</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tfgd.ihb.ac.cn/">http://tfgd.ihb.ac.cn/</ext-link>). DNA sequencing data for mating type II–VII cells are derived from a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Compute pI/Mw (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.expasy.org/compute_pi/">https://web.expasy.org/compute_pi/</ext-link>) was used to predict protein molecular weight. InterProScan (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/</ext-link>) was used for function and domain annotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Jones et al., 2014</xref>).</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>For mating experiments, more than 100 unpaired cells or cell pairs were counted, with three to five independent replicates. GraphPad software (version 8.0.2) was used for statistical analysis based on ANOVA (matched, Fisher’s LSD test).</p>

<caption><title><italic>T. thermophila</italic> lifecycle.</title>
<p><italic>T. thermophila</italic> has seven mating types. Cells divide asexually when nutrition is adequate. After starvation, cells of any two different mating types recognize each other and enter a pre-conjugation stage called costimulation. In this stage, cells first become round (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Fujishima et al., 1993</xref>); subsequently, their cell tips are transformed into a curved shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Wolfe &amp; Grimes, 1979</xref>) and the Con-A receptor becomes detectable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Wolfe &amp; Feng, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Wolfe et al., 1986</xref>). Costimulated cells then form pairs via a rotating behavior (Video S1, S2). During the sexual life cycle (conjugation), cells undergo a series of sexual events such as meiosis and reciprocal fertilization (for details refer to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Orias et al., 2011</xref>)). Exconjugants (separated pairs) finally form parent-like progeny when nutrition becomes available, but remain sexually immature. After ∼60 fissions, cells mature and their mating type is determined and becomes fixed (for details of mating-type determination, refer to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Cervantes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Lin &amp; Yao, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Orias et al., 2017</xref>)).</p></caption>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this study, Yan et al. investigate the molecular bases underlying mating type recognition in Tetrahymena thermophila. This model protist possesses a total of 7 mating types/sexes and mating occurs only between individuals expressing different mating types. The authors aimed to characterize the function of mating type proteins (MTA and MTB) in the process of self- and non-self recognition, using a combination of elegant phenotypic assays, protein studies, and imaging. They showed that the presence of MTA and MTB in the same cell is required for the expression of concavalin-A receptors and for tip transformation - two processes that are characteristic of the costimulation phase that precedes cell fusion. Using protein studies, the authors identify a set of additional proteins of varied functions that interact with MTA and MTB and are likely responsible for the downstream signaling processes required for mating. This is a description of a fascinating self- and non-self-recognition system and, as the authors point out, it is a rare example of a system with numerous mating types/sexes. This work opens the door for the further understanding of the molecular bases and evolution of these complex recognition systems within and outside protists.</p>
<p>The results shown in this study point to the unequivocal requirement of MTA and MTB proteins for mating. Nevertheless, some of the conclusions regarding the mode of functioning of these proteins are not fully supported and require additional investigation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
1. The authors have established a set of very useful knock-out and reporter lines for MT proteins and extensively used them in sophisticated and well-designed phenotypic assays that allowed them to test the role of these proteins in vivo.</p>
<p>2. Despite their apparent low abundance, the authors took advantage of a varied set of protein isolation and characterization techniques to pinpoint the localization of MT proteins to the cell membrane, and their interaction with multiple other proteins that could be downstream effectors. This opens the door for the future characterization of these proteins and further elucidation of the mating type recognition cascade.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The manuscript is structured and written in a very clear and easy-to-follow manner. However, several conclusions and discussion points fall short of highlighting possible models and mechanisms through which MT proteins control mating type recognition:</p>
<p>1. The authors dismiss the possibility of a &quot;simple receptor-ligand system&quot;, even though the data does not exclude this possibility. The model presented in Figure 2 S1, and on which the authors based their hypothesis, assumes the independence of MTA and MTB proteins in the generation of the intracellular cascade. However, the results presented in Figure 2 show that both proteins are required to be active in the same cell. Coupled with the fact that MTA and MTB proteins interact, this is compatible with a model where MTA would be a ligand and MTB a receptor (or vice-versa), and could thus form a receptor-ligand complex that could potentially be activated by a non-cognate MTA-MTB receptor-ligand complex, leading to an intracellular cascade mediated by the identified MRC proteins. As it stands, it is not clear what is the proposed working model, and it would be very beneficial for the reader for this to be clarified by having the point of view of the authors on this or other types of models.</p>
<p>2. The presence of MTA/MTB proteins is required for costimulation (Figure 2), and supplementation with non-cognate extracellular fragments of these proteins (MTAxc, or MTBxc) is a positive stimulator of pairing. However, alone, these fragments do not have the ability to induce costimulation (Figure 5). Based on the results in Figures 5 and 6 the authors suggest that MT proteins mediate both self and non-self recognition. Why do MTAxc and MTBxc not induce costimulation alone? Are any other components required? How to reconcile this with the results of Figure 2? A more in-depth interpretation of these results would be very helpful, since these questions remain unanswered, making it difficult for the reader to extract a clear hypothesis on how MT proteins mediate self- and non-self-recognition.</p>

<p>This manuscript reports the discovery and analysis of a large protein complex that controls mating type and sexual reproduction of the model ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila. In contrast to many organisms that have two mating types or two sexes, Tetrahymena is multi-sexual with 7 distinct mating types. Previous studies identified the mating type locus, which encodes two transmembrane proteins called MTA and MTB that determine the specificity of mating type interactions. In this study, mutants are generated in the MTA and MTB genes and mutant isolates are studied for mating properties. Cells missing either MTA or MTB failed to co-stimulate wild-type cells of different mating types. Moreover, a mixture of mutants lacking MTA or MTB also failed to stimulate. These observations support the conclusion that MTA and MTB may form a complex that directs mating-type identity. To address this, the proteins were epitope-tagged and subjected to IP-MS analysis. This revealed that MTA and MTB are in a physical complex, and also revealed a series of 6 other proteins (MRC1-6) that together with MTA/B form the mating type recognition complex (MTRC). All 8 proteins feature predicted transmembrane domains, three feature GFR domains, and two are predicted to function as calcium transporters. The authors went on to demonstrate that components of the MTRC are localized on the cell surface but not in the cilia. They also presented findings that support the conclusion that the mating type-specific region of the MTA and MTB genes can influence both self- and non-self-recognition in mating.</p>
<p>Taken together, the findings presented are interesting and extend our understanding of how organisms with more than two mating types/sexes may be specified. The identification of the six-protein MRC complex is quite intriguing. It would seem important that the function of at least one of these subunits be analyzed by gene deletion and phenotyping, similar to the findings presented here for the MTA and MTB mutants. A straightforward prediction might be that a deletion of any subunit of the MRC complex would result in a sterile phenotype. The manuscript was very well written and a pleasure to read.</p>

<p>The authors describe the role, location, and function of the MTA and MTB mating type genes in the multi-mating-type species T. thermophila. The ciliate is an important group of organisms to study the evolution of mating types, as it is one of the few groups in which more than two mating types evolved independently. In the study, the authors use deletion strains of the species to show that both mating types genes located in each allele are required in both mating individuals for successful matings to occur. They show that the proteins are localized in the cell membrane, not the cilia, and that they interact in a complex (MTRC) with a set of 6 associated (non-mating type-allelic) genes. This complex is furthermore likely to interact with a cyclin-dependent kinase complex. It is intriguing that T. thermophila has two genes that are allelic and that are both required for successful mating. This coevolved double recognition has to my knowledge not been described for any other mating-type recognition system. I am not familiar with experimental research on ciliates, but as far as I can judge, the experiments appear well performed and mostly support the interpretation of the authors with appropriate controls and statistical analyses.</p>
<p>The results show clearly that the mating type genes regulate non-self-recognition, however, I am not convinced that self-recognition occurs leading to the suppression of mating. An alternative explanation could be that the MTA and MTB proteins form a complex and that the two extracellular regions together interact with the MTA+MTB proteins from different mating types. This alternative hypothesis fits with the coevolution of MTA and MTB genes observed in the phylogenetic subgroups as described by Yan et al. (2021 iScience). Adding MTAxc and/or MTBxc to the cells can lead to the occupation of the external parts of the full proteins thereby inhibiting the formation of the complex, which in turn reduces non-self interactions. Self-recognition as explained in Figure 2S1 suggests an active response, which should be measurable in expression data for example. This is in my opinion not essential, but a claim of self-recognition through the MTA and MTB should not be made.</p>
<p>The authors discuss that T. thermophila has special mating-type proteins that are large, while those of other groups are generally small (lines 157-160 and discussion). The complex formed is very large and in the discussion, they argue that this might be due to the &quot;highly complex process, given that there are seven mating types in all&quot;. There is no argument given why large is more complex, if this is complex, and whether more mating types require more complexity. In basidiomycete fungi, many more mating types than 7 exist, and the homeodomain genes involved in mating types are relatively small but highly diverse (Luo et al. 1994 PMID: 7914671). The mating types associated with GPCR receptors in fungi are arguably larger, but again their function is not that complex, and mating-type specific variations appear to evolve easily (Fowler et al 2004 PMID: 14643262; Seike et al. 2015 PMID: 25831518). The large protein complex formed is reminiscent of the fusion patches that develop in budding or fission yeasts. In these species, the mating type receptors are activated by ligand pheromones from the opposite mating type that induce polarity patch formation (see Sieber et al. 2023 PMID: 35148940 for a recent review). At these patches, growth (shmooing) and fusion occur, which is reminiscent (in a different order) of the tip transformation in T. thermophilia. The fusion of two cells is in all taxa a dangerous and complex event that requires the evolution of very strict regulation and the existence of a system like the MTRC and cyclin-dependent complex to regulate this process is therefore not unexpected. The existence of multiple mating types should not greatly complicate the process, as most of the machinery (except for the MTA and MTB) is identical among all mating types.</p>
<p>The Tetrahymena/ciliate genetics and lifecycle could be better explained. For a general audience, the system is not easy to follow. For example, the ploidy of the somatic nucleus with regards to the mating type is not clear to me. The MAC is generally considered &quot;polyploid&quot;, but how does this work for the mating type? I assume only a single copy of the mating type locus is available in the MAC to avoid self-recognition in the cells. Is it known how the diploid origin reduces to a single mating type? This does not become apparent from Cervantes et al. 2013. Also, the explanation of co-stimulation is not completely clear (lines 49-60). Initially, direct cell-cell contact is mentioned, but later it is mentioned that &quot;all cells become fully stimulated&quot;, even when unequal ratios are used. Is physical contact necessary? Or is this due to the &quot;secrete mating-essential factors&quot; (line 601)? These details are essential, for interpretation of the results and need to be explained better.</p>
<p>Abstract and introduction: Sexes are not mating types. In general, mating types refer to systems in which there is no obvious asymmetry between the gametes, beyond the compatibility system. When there is a physiological difference such as size or motility, sexes are used. This distinction is of importance because in many species mating types and sexes can occur together, with each sex being able to have either (when two) or multiple mating types. An example are SI in angiosperms as used as an example by the authors or mating types in filamentous fungi. See Billiard et al. 2011 [PMID: 21489122] for a good explanation and argumentation for the importance of making this distinction.</p>
