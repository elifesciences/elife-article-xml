<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The unlimited expansion of human progenitor cells in vitro could unlock many prospects for regenerative medicine. However, it remains an important challenge as it requires the decoupling of the mechanisms supporting progenitor self-renewal and expansion from those mechanisms promoting their differentiation. This study focuses on the expansion of human pluripotent stem (hPS) cell derived pancreatic progenitors (PP) to advance novel therapies for diabetes.</p>
<p>We obtained mechanistic insights into PP expansion requirements and, through a hypothesis-driven iterative approach, identified conditions for the robust and unlimited expansion of hPS cell derived PP cells under GMP-compliant conditions. We show that the combined stimulation of specific mitogenic pathways, suppression of retinoic acid signaling and inhibition of selected branches of the TGFβ and Wnt signaling pathways are necessary for the effective decoupling of PP proliferation from differentiation. This enabled the reproducible, 2000-fold, over ten passages and 40-45 days, expansion of PDX1<sup>+</sup>/SOX9<sup>+</sup>/NKX6-1<sup>+</sup> PP cells. Transcriptome analyses confirmed the stabilisation of PP identity and the effective suppression of differentiation. Using these conditions, PDX1<sup>+</sup>/SOX9<sup>+</sup>/NKX6-1<sup>+</sup> PP cells, derived from different, both XY and XX, hPS cells lines, were enriched to nearly 90% homogeneity and expanded with very similar kinetics and efficiency. Furthermore, non-expanded and expanded PP cells, from different hPS cell lines, were differentiated in microwells into homogeneous islet-like clusters (SC-islets) with very similar efficiency. These clusters contained abundant β-cells of comparable functionality as assessed by glucose-stimulated insulin secretion assays.</p>
<p>These findings established the signaling requirements to decouple PP proliferation from differentiation and allowed the consistent expansion of hPS cell derived PP cells. They will enable the establishment of large banks of GMP-derived PP cells derived from diverse hPS cell lines. This approach will streamline SC-islet production for further development of the differentiation process, diabetes research, personalized medicine and cell therapies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Diabetes is a global epidemic affecting almost 10% of the world’s population. Its two main forms result from the immune destruction (type 1) or malfunction (type 2) of insulin-producing β cells residing in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. Severe cases of diabetes often necessitate whole pancreas transplantation or pancreatic islet transplantation to restore metabolic control and insulin independence. However, both approaches face critical limitations due to the scarcity of tissue donors and the requirement for life-long immunosuppression which hinders, the already limited β-cell self-renewal, and is associated with severe side effects and morbidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Nir et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The remarkable progress over the last decade in the differentiation of human pluripotent stem (hPS) cells into pancreatic islet cells (SC-islet cells) suggests that this approach could provide an unlimited source of β-cells for transplantations and personalized medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Amin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Balboa et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Du et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hogrebe et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Millman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Ramzy et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Shapiro et al., 2021</xref>). The underlying strategy recapitulates in vitro the stepwise differentiation of epiblast cells initially to definitive endoderm and then to pancreatic progenitor-containing (PP) cells, pancreatic endocrine progenitors and, finally, to pancreatic islet cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kroon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Pagliuca et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c121">Rezania et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Russ et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Zeng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Zhu et al., 2016b</xref>). Clinical trials employing either GMP-grade PP cells in a non-immunoprotective macroencapsulation device (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Shapiro et al., 2021</xref>) (NCT03163511) or GMP-grade SC-islet cells in an immunoprotective macroencapsulation device (NCT02239354) suggested that diabetes cell therapies can become a reality. Obstacles to be overcome include the limited maturation of the resulting β-cells, incomplete conversion of hPS cells into endocrine cells and the large number of SC-islet cells required for a single transplantation. Elucidating the mechanisms that maintain the self-renewal of pure PP cells, while inhibiting their differentiation, would allow the establishment of expandable populations of PP cells and address the need for large numbers of pancreatic endocrine cells.</p>
<p>During development, the intersection of several signals induces the pancreatic anlage at the posterior foregut. Repression of posteriorly derived Wnt signaling is initially essential to define the foregut region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">McLin et al., 2007</xref>). There, the pancreas and liver develop from a common progenitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cerda-Esteban et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Deutsch et al., 2001</xref>). Bipotent progenitors, located distant to the cardiac mesoderm, which secretes the pro-hepatic signals FGF10 and BMPs, remain competent to adopt pancreatic fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Jung et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Rossi et al., 2001</xref>). The combination of RA signaling, derived from the somitic mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Martin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Molotkov et al., 2005</xref>), and endothelial signals, derived from the dorsal aorta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lammert et al., 2001</xref>), induces the formation of pancreatic progenitors. A complex, stage-specific expression of several transcription factors (TFs) guides pancreatic cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Duvall et al., 2022</xref>). The epithelial pancreatic progenitors are characterized by the combined expression of several TFs, most notably Pdx1, Nkx6-1 and Sox9, which are essential for progenitor self-renewal and subsequent endocrine differentiation. Pdx1 expression is induced at the boundary between the Sox2-expressing anterior endoderm and the Cdx2-expressing posterior endoderm and it is necessary to maintain the pancreatic identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Sherwood et al., 2009</xref>). Its function is reinforced by Sox9 which cooperates with Pdx1 to repress Cdx2 expression in the pancreatic anlage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Shih et al., 2015</xref>). Pdx1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Jonsson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Offield et al., 1996</xref>) and Sox9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Seymour et al., 2007</xref>) loss-of-function experiments resulted in pancreatic agenesis, establishing their key role in maintaining pancreatic identity. Sox9 is subsequently essential for the induction of Neurog3, the TF which is necessary and sufficient for the induction of the pancreatic endocrine lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gradwohl et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Grapin-Botton et al., 2001</xref>). Nkx6-1 is another key contributor to the maintenance and self-renewal of pancreatic progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Sander et al., 2000</xref>). It is also required for β-cell specification since ectopic Nkx6-1 expression directed endocrine precursors into β-cells, whereas β-cell specific ablation of Nkx6-1 diverted these cells into the other endocrine lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Schaffer et al., 2013</xref>). Given the importance of these three TFs, the identification of conditions to stabilize PDX1<sup>+</sup>/SOX9<sup>+</sup>/NKX6-1<sup>+</sup> cells will set the stage for unlimited PP cell expansion and their efficient differentiation into SC-islets PDX1<sup>+</sup>/SOX9<sup>+</sup>/NKX6-1<sup>+</sup> PP cells undergo self-renewal <italic>in vivo</italic> for a limited amount of time. During development, feed-forward loops, that steer cells toward differentiation, operate in parallel with maintenance and self-renewal mechanisms. To achieve unlimited expansion of PP cells <italic>in vitro</italic> it will be necessary to disentangle differentiation signals from proliferation and maintenance signals. Several pathways have been implicated in these processes. Notch signaling mediates progenitor self-renewal as well as lineage segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Afelik et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Murtaugh et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Shih et al., 2012</xref>) and its downregulation is necessary for endocrine lineage specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Apelqvist et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Jensen et al., 2000</xref>). Notch signaling is itself regulated by the extracellular signal sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1p) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Serafimidis et al., 2017</xref>). Canonical Wnt signaling has also been implicated in PP maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Afelik et al., 2015</xref>). Low levels of endogenous RA signaling are involved in subsequent differentiation steps of PP cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kobayashi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Lorberbaum et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Tulachan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Vinckier et al., 2020</xref>). Finally, expression of TGFβ ligands and receptors is widespread during pancreas development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Crisera et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Tulachan et al., 2007</xref>) and it has been suggested that the TGFβ pathway activity regulates the pancreatic lineage allocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Miralles et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Sanvito et al., 1994</xref>). TEAD, and its coactivator YAP, act as integrators of extracellular signals to activate key pancreatic signaling mediators and transcription factors which promote the expansion of pancreatic progenitors and their competence to differentiate into endocrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cebola et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Serafimidis et al., 2017</xref>). Cell confinement acts as a mechanic signal to downregulate YAP and trigger endocrine differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Mamidi et al., 2018</xref>) and this finding has been applied to promote the differentiation of hPS cell-derived PPs into endocrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Rosado-Olivieri et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Culture conditions to expand hPS cell-derived PDX1<sup>+</sup>/SOX9<sup>+</sup> cells have been previously reported but these methods relied either on feeder layers or limiting 3D conditions in an agarose hydrogel matrix and did not maintain the expression of the crucial TF NKX6-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Konagaya and Iwata, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Trott et al., 2017</xref>). A recent study claimed the expansion of a hPS cell-derived cell population, containing PDX1<sup>+</sup>/NKX6-1<sup>+</sup> cells, on fibronectin and in a defined medium using SB431542, a broad (ALK4/5/7) TGFβ inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Inman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Nakamura et al., 2022</xref>). Unfortunately, the reproducibility of the expansion was not documented and the reported percentage of PDX1<sup>+</sup>/NKX6-1<sup>+</sup> PP cells in the expanded cells varied widely among the three different hPS cell lines used, from 65% to 35% and 20%. Furthermore, RNA Seq data showed that <italic>NKX6-1</italic> expression actually decreased during expansion, in two out of the three samples presented, (E-MTAB-9992) suggesting that NKX6-1 expression was not reliably maintained under those culture conditions. In another study, PP cells, generated through genetic reprogramming of human fibroblasts into endoderm progenitor cells, could be expanded in a chemically defined medium containing epithelial growth factor (EGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and SB431542, another general (ALK4/5/7) TGFβ inhibitor. However, the percentage of PDX1<sup>+</sup>/NKX6-1<sup>+</sup> cells was less than 20% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Zhu et al., 2016a</xref>). The authors then identified a BET bromodomain inhibitor that could mediate the unlimited expansion of PDX1<sup>+</sup>/NKX6-1<sup>+</sup> PP cells on feeder layers of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Ma et al., 2022</xref>). Unfortunately, the use of feeder layers precluded the use of this method in a clinical setting and it did not address the mechanistic requirements for the expansion.</p>
<p>PP cells express the components of a large number of signaling pathways and we hypothesized that a longitudinal transcriptome analysis of non-expanding and occasionally expanding PP cells would provide candidate signaling pathways reasoning that upregulated pathways in expanding cells would promote expansion, whereas downregulated pathways would be blocking expansion and/or favoring differentiation. We leveraged these findings and employed a hypothesis-driven iterative process to define conditions that allowed robust, unlimited expansion, of hPS cell-derived PP cells. We found that the combined stimulation of specific mitogenic pathways, suppression of retinoic acid signaling and inhibition of selected branches of the TGFβ and Wnt signaling pathways enabled the 2000-fold expansion of PP cells over ten passages and 40-45 days. Expansion conditions are GMP-compliant and enable the robust, reproducible expansion, as well as intermediate cryopreservation, of PP cells derived from diverse hPS cell lines with essentially identical growth kinetics. These conditions select PDX1<sup>+</sup>/SOX9<sup>+</sup>/NKX6-1<sup>+</sup> PP cells, suggesting that they will be advantageous for hPS cell lines that may differentiate less efficiently into PP cells. Expanded PP cells differentiated, with very similar efficiency to non-expanded cells, into SC-islet clusters that contained functional β-cells as shown by glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) assays.</p>
<p>Our findings will allow the establishment of large banks of PP cells derived under GMP conditions from diverse hPS cell lines, streamlining the generation of SC-islet clusters for further development of the differentiation procedure, diabetes research, personalized medicine and cell therapies.</p>

<title>Identification of candidate signaling pathways implicated in PP expansion</title>
<p>H1 hPS cells were differentiated into PP cells and PP cell expansion was attempted using the initial conditions (CINI) (Table S1) that relied on EGF and FGF2 and A83-01, a broad TGFβ inhibitor of ALK4/5/7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Tojo et al., 2005</xref>). The CINI formulation was similar, but not identical, to that used previously in the attempted expansion of PP cells derived through the reprogramming of human fibroblasts into endoderm progenitor cells, where SB431542, another brοad TGFβ inhibitor of similar specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Inman et al., 2002</xref>), was employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Zhu et al., 2016a</xref>).

In most instances, cell numbers remained either constant or decreased, resulting in growth arrest. Occasionally (one out of five attempts), PP-containing cells (referred to hereafter just as PP cells for simplicity) expanded and could then be maintained for at least up to ten passages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>).

Immunofluorescence experiments and qPCR analyses suggested the maintenance of the PP identity in these expanding PP (ePP) cells since expression of <italic>PDX1</italic>, <italic>NKX6-1</italic> and <italic>SOX9</italic> remained stable at both the protein (compare Figure S1A, B and S1C) and transcript levels (Figure S1D). Immunofluorescence analysis of cryosections showed that these ePP cells could subsequently differentiate into endocrine cells (Figure S1E). These results suggested that EGF, FGF2 and broad TGFβ inhibition were not sufficient for the reproducible expansion of hPS cell-derived PP cells.</p>

<p>PP cells express the components of numerous signaling pathways (Table S2 and S3) and we hypothesized that transcriptome comparison of non-expanding and CINI ePP cells could identify pathways implicated in the expansion. Upregulated pathways in ePP cells would be promoting expansion, whereas downregulated pathways would be blocking expansion and/or favoring differentiation. Thus, we compared the RNA Seq profiles of cells directly after their differentiation into pancreatic progenitors (dPP) (p0) (n=4), and CINI ePP cells at passage 5 (p5) (n=3) and p10 (n=3). Of the analyzed dPP samples, one was subsequently successfully expanded. Analysis for differentially expressed genes (DEG) identified groups of genes that were continuously up or down-regulated genes and genes showing changes only within the first five passages (Figure S1F and Table S2). Metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) plot of the Euclidian distances of the samples demonstrated clustering of the samples strictly according to their passage number. The single p0 sample, which subsequently expanded successfully, clustered with the other p0 samples suggesting that it was not fundamentally different from samples that failed to expand. These findings suggested a reproducible adaptation of ePP cells to the culture conditions primarily during the first five passages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) suggested that components of the TGFβ signaling pathway were negatively correlated with expansion whereas E2F target genes and DNA replication were positively correlated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). E2F TFs are indirectly activated by growth signals to regulate multiple cell cycle genes and promote cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ertosun et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Rubin et al., 2020</xref>). This raised the possibility that expanding cells upregulate their own growth factors engaging themselves in an autocrine growth loop. On the other hand, all key components of the Hippo pathway were expressed but were not transcriptionally regulated, with the exception of <italic>SHANK2</italic>, a negative regulator and <italic>WWTR1(TAZ)</italic>, a transcriptional regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Meng et al., 2016</xref>) (Table S3). To gain a better mechanistic insight into potentially involved signaling pathways, we then examined the expression kinetics of all individual ligands and receptors expressed in dPP and ePP cells.</p>
<p>High expression of TGFβ ligands as well as Type I and Type II receptors suggested that all three branches of this signaling pathway were active at p0 (Table S3). The negative correlation of the TGFβ signaling pathway with the expansion appeared to retrospectively justify the use of the broad TGFβ signal inhibitor A83-01 in the CINI expansion medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Tojo et al., 2005</xref>). However, since this pathway has several branches often with cell-dependent opposing functions, we assessed the expression kinetics of all expressed TGFβ ligands and receptors. The most highly expressed TGFβ ligands, in dPP cells, were <italic>TGFb1</italic> and <italic>BMP2</italic>, the expression of which was repressed nearly four-fold during expansion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, S1G). TGFb1 and BMP2 act through the ALK1/5 and ALK3/6/2 receptors, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Brown and Schneyer, 2010</xref>), so A83-01 would block TGFB1 but not BMP2 signaling. On the other hand, <italic>ALK4</italic> and its ligand, <italic>GDF11</italic>, remained strongly expressed throughout expansion; <italic>GDF11</italic> was even upregulated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, Table S3), suggesting a possible positive role of this TGFβ signaling branch in the expansion of pancreas progenitors. These findings suggested that the use of broad TGFβ inhibitors such as A83-01 or SB431542 may not be optimal because they do not inhibit BMP2 signaling whereas they block ALK4 signaling, which might promote PP expansion through GDF11. This provided a mechanistic rationale for the subsequent use of more specific TGFβ inhibitors.</p>
<p>To account for the positive correlation of the expression of E2F targets with expansion, we then examined the gene expression kinetics of growth factors during expansion. There was a striking, nearly 30-fold, upregulation of <italic>FGF18</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref> and Table S3) suggesting a strong requirement for the activation of the MAPK pathway. Incidentally, FGF18 has a selective affinity for FGFR3 and 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>), the two most highly expressed <italic>FGFRs</italic> in dPP and ePP cells. Other <italic>FGFs</italic> were weakly expressed and not upregulated during expansion (Table S3). Expression of <italic>FGF18</italic>, as well as of other <italic>FGFs</italic> and <italic>FGFRs</italic>, was detected at several stages of pancreas development in whole pancreata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dichmann et al., 2003</xref>). Another potentially interesting growth factor signaling pathway was the PDGF signaling pathway. PDGFR signaling has not been so far implicated in pancreas development or PP expansion but it promotes the expansion of young beta cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>PDGF</italic> receptors <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic> were stably and strongly expressed during expansion but the initially strong expression of two of the expressed ligands, PDGFA and B was downregulated by 30- and 15-fold, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>, S1H, Table S3). These findings provided a mechanistic rationale to provide FGF18 during expansion and/or inhibit PDGF signaling in subsequent experiments.</p>
<p>RA promotes the differentiation of pancreatic progenitors during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Lorberbaum et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Martin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Ostrom et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Vinckier et al., 2020</xref>). PP cells highly expressed the retinol dehydrogenase 11 (<italic>RDH11</italic>) and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1a1 (<italic>ALDH1A1</italic>) genes, which encode enzymes that convert vitamin A into retinoic acid, as well as the RA nuclear receptors <italic>RARA</italic>, <italic>RARG</italic>, <italic>RXRA</italic> and <italic>RXRB</italic>. Therefore, in the presence of vitamin A, this pathway could act in an autocrine manner to promote differentiation. Strikingly, successful expansion was accompanied by a dramatic, 25-fold, downregulation in the expression of the RA-producing enzyme <italic>ALDH1A1</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>, Table S3). Thus, we speculated that PP cells are poised to initiate RA-mediated differentiation in an autocrine feed-forward loop and, therefore, eliminating vitamin A in the medium might stabilize the PP state.</p>
<p>The Notch signaling pathway is implicated in multiple aspects of pancreatic development including the expansion of pancreatic progenitors and lineage selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Afelik et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Apelqvist et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Murtaugh et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Qu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Seymour et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Shih et al., 2012</xref>). The expression of Notch receptors, ligands and effectors, such as HES1, displayed a complex pattern of changes during expansion. (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>, S1I, Table S3) that suggested an overall attenuation, but not silencing, of the pathway.</p>
<p>In summary, the findings suggested that several mechanisms may contribute to stabilizing the PP state. Alone or in combination, inhibition of selected branches of the TGFβ pathway, attenuation of the Notch pathway, additional mitogenic stimulation with FGF18, and suppression of RA and PDGF signaling may lead to reproducible expansion of the PP cells.</p>

<title>Elimination of RA and selective TGFβ inhibition allow reproducible expansion of PP cells</title>
<p>We assessed several expansion culture conditions (summarized in Table S1), based on the mechanistic insights discussed above, using PP cells generated with an adaptation of published procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Balboa et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">Mahaddalkar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c121">Rezania et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">Shi et al., 2017</xref>) (Table S4). Our strategy to achieve reproducible and robust PP expansion involved activation or inhibition of specific signaling pathways, either individually or in combination. We first suppressed RA signaling by substituting the vitamin A-containing B27 supplement with a Vitmain A-free B27 formulation. Additionally, we substituted A83-01 with the ALK5 II inhibitor (ALK5i II) that targets primarily ALK5, and to a lesser extent ALK3/6, but not ALK4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gellibert et al., 2004</xref>). This was named condition 0 (C0). C0 was further elaborated by replacing FGF2 with FGF18 (C1) as well as adding the Notch inhibitor XXI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Seiffert et al., 2000</xref>) (C2), or the PDGFR inhibitor CP673451 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Roberts et al., 2005</xref>) (C3) or adding both Notch and PDGFR inhibitors (C4). Since FGF2 and FGF18 belong to different FGF subfamilies and have overlapping, but not identical, FGFR specificities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>), we also addressed a possible synergistic effect of these FGFs in PP expansion by combining them in C5. In contrast to CINI, three of these conditions, C0, C1 and C5, resulted in the reproducible expansion of PP cells for at least 10 (C0, C1, n=3) or 11 (C5, n=5) passages with doubling times (T<sub>d</sub>) of 3.9, 3.6 and 2.3 days, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, Table S1).</p>

<p>Assessment of the expression of key PP genes by qPCR at p5 and p10 suggested that, in all three conditions, initial high levels of <italic>PDX1, NKX6-1</italic> and <italic>SOX9</italic> expression were maintained (<italic>NKX6-1</italic>, <italic>SOX9</italic>) or even transiently increased at p5 (C5, <italic>PDX1</italic>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B-D</xref>). Expression of <italic>PTF1A</italic> was dramatically decreased in all three conditions suggesting a shift to a bipotent endocrine/duct progenitor identity (Figure S2A). Expression of <italic>FOXA2</italic>, involved in PP cell maintenance and endocrine lineage development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lee et al., 2019</xref>), was upregulated in C5, indicating that cells expanded in this condition might be more amenable to terminal endocrine differentiation (Figure S2B). On the other hand, there was a statistically significant increase in the expression of the liver and gut markers <italic>AFP</italic> and <italic>CDX2</italic> in C0 and C1 and a similar, but weaker, trend in C5 (Figure S2C, D). This suggested that these conditions (C0, C1, C5) allowed cells to express aspects of liver and gut programs. Since C5 had a significantly lower T<sub>d</sub> and a less pronounced increase in <italic>AFP</italic> and <italic>CDX2</italic> expression, we concentrated on the analysis and further improvement of C5.</p>
<p>To first confirm the C5 qPCR results at the protein level, we assessed the expression of several markers by immunofluorescence for C5 ePP cells. Immunofluorescence suggested that PDX1 and SOX9 were uniformly expressed at p0, p5 as well as p10 and that a large number of PP cells were NKX6-1<sup>+</sup> at all three different time points even though expansion appeared to somewhat reduce the number of NKX6-1<sup>+</sup> cells. (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E-G</xref>). Similarly, FOXA2 remained widely expressed at p0, p5 and p10 (Figure S2E-G). Expression of both AFP and CDX2 appeared to increase transiently upon expansion, at p5 (Figure S2H-J). We then quantified the expression of the key PP markers PDX1, SOX9 and NKX6-1 by flow cytometry at p0, p5 and p10. In these analyses, PDX1<sup>+</sup>/SOX9<sup>+</sup> cells were first identified based on the gates set by the corresponding control stainings and, then, the number of NKX6-1<sup>+</sup> cells was determined in these pre-gated cells based on the gate set by the corresponding control staining (Figure S2K-N). These experiments confirmed the immunofluorescence experiments showing that at least 90% of all cells were PDX1<sup>+</sup>/SOX9<sup>+</sup> at all passages examined (Figure S2K-N), whereas nearly 50% of the cells at p0 and p5 and nearly 40% at p10 were PDX1<sup>+</sup>/SOX9<sup>+</sup>/NKX6-1<sup>+</sup>. There was a small, apparent progressive drop in the number of PDX1<sup>+</sup>/SOX9<sup>+</sup> as well as the number of PDX1<sup>+</sup>/SOX9<sup>+</sup>/NKX6-1<sup>+</sup> cells which did not reach statistical significance (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H-K</xref>, S2K-N).</p>
<p>These experiments established that C5 allowed reproducible and robust PP expansion, the basis of which was the elimination of RA signaling and selective TGFβ inhibition. Additionally, EGF, FGF2 and FGF18 synergized to promote a more robust expansion.</p>

<title>Expansion conditions promote primarily the proliferation of PP cells</title>
<p>To understand the mechanism behind the successful and reproducible expansion, we asked whether it was due to enhanced cell survival, proliferation, or a combination of both. De novo generated PP cells were expanded in either C5 or CINI and assayed at p3 for EdU incorporation and apoptosis. The EdU incorporation analysis revealed that C5 cultures contained significantly more EdU<sup>+</sup> expanding cells (10.4 ± 1.2%) than CINI (4.2 ± 0.6%) cultures (<italic>n=4</italic>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-C</xref>, S3A). The apoptosis assays showed that even though the percentage of 7-AAD<sup>+</sup>/Annexin V<sup>+</sup> cells appeared higher in CINI-expanded cells (22.1 ± 5.0%) than in C5-expanded cells (17.2 ± 4.7%) this difference did not reach statistical significance (<italic>n=6</italic>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and Figure S3B, C). Therefore, C5, as compared to CINI, promotes primarily proliferation rather than survival of PP cells but it is important to note that cell death also appears higher in CINI cells. It is likely that the combination of these effects results in reproducible expansion under C5.</p>

<title>Canonical Wnt inhibition restricts upregulation of hepatic fate and promotes PP identity</title>
<p>The upregulation of <italic>AFP</italic> and <italic>CDX2</italic> in C5 ePP cells suggested a drift towards hepatic and intestinal fates that would hinder the efficiency of differentiation into endocrine cells and subsequent maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Nair et al., 2019</xref>). During pancreas development, non-canonical Wnt signaling specifies bipotent liver/pancreas progenitors to pancreatic fates whereas canonical Wnt signaling leads to liver specification and the emergence of gastrointestinal identity (Ober et al., 2006; So et al., 2013; Muñoz-Bravo et al., 2016; Rodríguez-Seguel et al., 2013). PP cells, at p0 as well as subsequent passages, strongly and stably expressed several <italic>WNT</italic> receptors, co-receptors as well as canonical and non-canonical signals (Table S3). Thus, to suppress the upregulation of hepatic and/or intestinal fates, we supplemented C5 with the canonical Wnt inhibitor IWR-1 to selectively inactivate the canonical Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chen et al., 2009</xref>) (condition 6; C6, Table S1).</p>
<p>C6 ePP cells retained a growth rate similar to C5, showing that IWR-1 supplementation did not significantly affect their growth; their T<sub>d</sub> was 2.5 days as opposed to 2.3 days for C5 ePP cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). C6 expansions using vitronectin-N (VTN-N) showed no change in expansion efficiency or promotion of the PP identity (<italic>n=3</italic>). VTN-N is a defined peptide that can be produced under GMP-conditions. Since all other media components can also be produced under GMP-conditions, this finding established that this approach is also GMP-compliant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>).</p>

<p>Relative to C5 ePP cells of the same passage number, C6 ePP cells retained strong expression of <italic>PDX1, NKX6-1</italic> and <italic>SOX9</italic> and similar expression levels of <italic>PTF1A</italic> and <italic>FOXA2</italic> (Figure S4A). Importantly, the expression of the liver markers examined, <italic>AFP, HHEX</italic> and <italic>TTR,</italic> was significantly lower, by p10, in the C6 ePP cells as compared to C5 ePP cells (Figure S4B). However, expression of <italic>CDX2</italic> was only marginally reduced (Figure S4A). The expression of <italic>PDX1, NKX6-1, SOX9</italic> and <italic>FOXA2</italic> was also examined at the protein level by immunofluorescence which suggested that their expression was stable and persisted at high levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B-D</xref>, S4C-E). Similarly to C5 ePP cells, expression of AFP and CDX2 in C6 ePP cells was detectable by immunofluorescence at p5 but significantly reduced at p10 (Figure S4F-H). Flow cytometry quantification of the cells expressing key PP markers at p0, p5 and p10 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E-I</xref>, S4I-L) showed a significant increase in the number of PDX1<sup>+</sup>/SOX9<sup>+</sup>/NKX6-1<sup>+</sup> C6 ePP cells from 48%±11% (n=5) at p0 to 90%±10% (n=3) at p5 and 95%±5% (n=5) at p10 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>). This, along with the reduction in the expression of liver markers, was an additional significant improvement over C5 ePP cells at both p5 and p10 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>). C6 ePP cells could be cryopreserved and recovered with high survival rates (&gt;85%) with no apparent loss of proliferative capacity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>). Chromosomal stability was also assessed after 16 passages analyzing the G-banding of at least 20 metaphases and no alterations were found (Figure S4M).</p>
<p>To further repress the expression of liver and gut markers, we reconsidered BMP inhibition. ALK5i II is considered a relatively weak inhibitor of ALK3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gellibert et al., 2004</xref>). However, BMP2, a ligand of ALK3, was significantly downregulated in the CINI ePP cells (Figure S1G, Table S3). Attempting to effectively inhibit ALK3, we substituted ALK5i II with LDN-193189, which inhibits ALK3 with higher potency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Sanvitale et al., 2013</xref>). LDN-193189 was used alone (C7) or in combination with IWR-1 (C8), however, none of these conditions was efficient in PP cell expansion (Table S1).</p>
<p>In summary, C6, featuring inhibition of the canonical Wnt signaling by IWR-1, promoted the selection of PDX1<sup>+</sup>/SOX9<sup>+</sup>/NKX6-1<sup>+</sup> in the expanding cell population and mitigated the upregulation of liver markers at both the gene and protein expression levels. C6 is a robust, highly reproducible, GMP-compliant procedure suitable for application in cell therapies.</p>

<p>To understand how the C6 expansion procedure affects the transcriptome of PP cells, we performed RNA-Seq analyses on dPP cells (p0) derived from independent differentiations and the corresponding p5 and p10 ePP cells. Principal component analyses (PCA) showed that the main component, PC1, represented most (81%) of the variance among samples and clearly separated p0 PP cells from either p5 and p10 ePP cells. All expanded cells were clustered remarkably close together on the PC1 axis (Figure S5A), suggesting rapid stabilization of the ePP transcriptome after just five passages. This was confirmed by correlation analyses of the transcriptome profiles showing that all major changes occurred between p0 and p5 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A, B</xref>, S5B). Results from Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses of DEGs between p0 and p10 were consistent with a cell adaptation to culture conditions, the signaling molecules used for the expansion and an effect on the differentiation process (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, S5C). We then compared the transcriptome of our VTN-N ePP cells with that of ePP cells expanded on feeders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Ma et al., 2022</xref>), on fibronectin (FN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Nakamura et al., 2022</xref>) as well as with that of human fetal PPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">Ramond et al., 2018</xref>). Initial PCA analyses suggested that all <italic>in vitro</italic> derived PP cells clustered away from fetal cells (Figure S5D). Thus, we subsequently restricted subsequent comparisons only among <italic>in vitro</italic> derived PP cells.</p>

<p>In comparative PCA analysis, with the other <italic>in vitro</italic> derived ePP cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Ma et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Nakamura et al., 2022</xref>), our ePP cells clustered separately with very high similarity among p5 and p10 ePP cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). To identify the molecular basis of this difference, we used a variance stabilizing transformation (vst) function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">Love et al., 2014</xref>) and hierarchical clustering to identify genes that are differentially regulated in our ePP cells (Figure S5E). Interestingly, these consisted only of upregulated genes and GO analyses showed that affected categories referred to epithelial maintenance and differentiation, cellular signaling response and metabolic processes (GO BP), membrane components (GO CC) and metabolism (GO MF and KEGG) (Figure S5F). An interesting upregulated gene in our ePP cells was <italic>GP2</italic>, a gene encoding a zymogen granule membrane glycoprotein that has been identified as a unique marker of human fetal pancreatic progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Cogger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Ramond et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, GP2<sup>+</sup> enriched hPS cell-derived PP cells are more efficiently differentiating into pancreatic endocrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Aghazadeh et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ameri et al., 2017</xref>). Direct comparison of <italic>GP2</italic> expression among ePP cells showed that our expansion method resulted in a progressive strong <italic>GP2</italic> upregulation and expression. This expression was nearly 50-fold higher than expression in the FN ePP cells at p10 whereas feeder ePP cells did not express this marker to any appreciable extent (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>, Table S5). Robust GP2 expression in our ePP cells was confirmed by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry where 60% ± 4.5% (n=3) of the ePP (p10-12) cells scored positive (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>).</p>
<p>To further understand the differences among ePP cells we compared the expression of several additional pancreatic gene markers. <italic>PDX1</italic> expression was generally reduced after expansion but remained at comparable levels among the three procedures (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>, Table S5). <italic>SOX9</italic> expression remained stable in the feeder ePP cells and increased in the FN PP cells, whereas it was downregulated in our ePP cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>, Table S5). Because SOX9 is also a major driver of the ductal pancreatic program we assessed whether higher SOX9 levels might be associated with higher levels of this program. We examined the collective expression of TFs driving the duct program, such as <italic>PROX1</italic>, <italic>HES1</italic>, <italic>GLIS3</italic> and <italic>ONECUT1</italic>. During development, these genes are initially expressed in bipotent progenitors and then to duct progenitors and differentiated duct cells but they are excluded from the endocrine compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bastidas-Ponce et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with the stronger <italic>SOX9</italic> expression, overall expression levels of these TFs were higher in FN ePP cells suggesting that the ductal program was more active in these cells (Figure S5G, Table S5). During pancreas development, both <italic>NKX6-1</italic> and <italic>NKX6-2</italic> are expressed in progenitor cells, acting in concert to define bipotent progenitors and to subsequently specify endocrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Binot et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Henseleit et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Nelson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Pedersen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Schaffer et al., 2010</xref>). The antibody we used most likely recognizes both proteins, given the very high similarity of NKX6-1 and NKX6-2 at the region of the antigen (Figure S5H). Consistent with the flow cytometry experiments, our expanded cells showed that the combined <italic>NKX6-1/2</italic> expression was strongly upregulated and similar to that of feeder ePP cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>, Table S5). Interestingly, that was due to a strong, expansion-dependent upregulation of <italic>NKX6-2</italic> (Figure S5I, Table S5). Here it is important to note that whereas <italic>NKX6-1/2</italic> expression in feeder and our ePP cells is strong in all samples analysed, it is very low in all FN ePP samples with the exception of a single sample (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>, Table S5). This suggests a lack of reproducibility in the expansion of PDX1<sup>+</sup>/NKX6-1<sup>+</sup> FN ePP cells. The expression of other progenitor TF genes such as <italic>FOXA2</italic> and <italic>RBPJ</italic> remained comparable in all expanded cells, although <italic>FOXA2</italic> retained higher levels in the FN ePP cells and <italic>RBPJ</italic> retained higher levels in our ePP cells (Figure S5I, Table S5).</p>
<p>Gene expression analyses, during expansion in the C5 medium, showed complete repression of <italic>PTF1A</italic> expression during the expansion (Figure S2A). This was also observed in the C6 expansion medium (Figure S4A). During development, Nkx6-1/Nkx6-2 act antagonistically to Ptf1a to downregulate its expression and promote the conversion of multipotent progenitor cells (MPCs) into bipotent cells (BP) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Schaffer et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, we asked whether PP expansion promoted BP identity (PDX1<sup>+</sup>/SOX9<sup>+</sup>/NKX6-1<sup>+</sup>/PTF1A<sup>-</sup> cells) to the expense of MPC (PDX1<sup>+</sup>/SOX9<sup>+</sup>/NKX6-1<sup>+</sup>/PTF1A<sup>+</sup>) identity. The RNA Seq analyses showed that <italic>PTF1A</italic> repression was a common feature of all expansion procedures (Figure S5J, Table S5). Expression of <italic>CPA1</italic>, a marker of MPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>) was also reduced during expansion, further supporting a transition to BP identity. This downregulation was notable in the FN and VTN-N expanded cells because <italic>CPA1</italic> expression of the corresponding p0 cells was substantially higher (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>, Table S5). We also found that <italic>DCDC2A</italic>, a BP progenitor marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Scavuzzo et al., 2018</xref>) was expressed in both FN ePP and VTN-N ePP cells, but not in feeder ePP cells (Figure S5J, Table S5). These data suggested that ePP cells, particularly FN and VTN-N ePP cells, resemble to BPs rather than MPCs.</p>
<p>NEUROG3<sup>+</sup> pancreatic endocrine progenitors, divide very rarely, if at all and employ a feed-forward mechanism for their differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Azzarelli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Krentz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, it is expected that an efficient PP expansion procedure would efficiently repress the endocrine program and loss of PP cells by differentiation towards the endocrine lineage. Indeed, a common feature of all expansion procedures was the repression of the endocrine differentiation program. Key TFs such as <italic>NEUROG3</italic> and its downstream effectors <italic>NEUROD1</italic>, <italic>NKX2-2</italic>, and <italic>INSM1</italic> were essentially switched off with very similar efficiency in all PP cells, however, it should be noted that expression of these genes was already very low in p0 cells in the Ma et al protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Ma et al., 2022</xref>). On the other hand, expression levels of <italic>RFX3</italic> and <italic>RFX6</italic> was generally higher in the feeder and FN ePP cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>, S5K, Table S5). Expression of terminal endocrine differentiation markers in all ePP cells was also negligible, particularly at late passages (Table S5).</p>
<p>Expression of acinar TFs such as <italic>BHLHA15</italic> and <italic>RBPJL</italic> was virtually undetectable in all expanded cells (Table S5). Finally, we compared the expression of liver and gut markers. Feeder ePP cells retained only negligible expression of the liver markers <italic>AFP</italic> and <italic>HHEX</italic>. However, expression of these markers was nearly 7-fold and 10-fold higher, respectively, in the FN ePP cells, as compared to our ePP cells, suggesting an overall decreased propensity to endocrine differentiation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref>, S5L, Table S5). Finally, expression of the gut marker <italic>CDX2</italic> was slightly higher in the feeder ePP cells but generally comparable in all three methods (Figure S5L, Table S5).</p>
<p>In summary, the comparative transcriptome analyses suggested that ePP cells transition from the MPC to the BP state and that our C6 expansion procedure is more efficient at strengthening the PP identity and efficiently repressing the initiation of endocrine differentiation and alternative liver fate.</p>

<title>Expansion under C6 selects PDX1<sup>+</sup>/SOX9<sup>+</sup>/NKX6-1<sup>+</sup> cells derived from either XX or XY hPS cells</title>
<p>Different hPS cell lines may vary in their differentiation efficiency and this complicates the clinical implementation of this technology. C6 expansion resulted in the selection of PDX1<sup>+</sup>/SOX9<sup>+</sup>/NKX6-1<sup>+</sup> cells and this would be advantageous for iPS cell lines that may not differentiate as efficiently. To assess whether the C6 expansion condition, established using the male H1 human embryonic stem (hES) cell line, was similarly applicable to other hPS cell lines of either sex. To address this, we used the female H9 hES cell line, a line that has a preference for neural rather than endoderm differentiation, and a male iPS cell line derived in the CRTD (CRTD1, hPSCreg: CRTDi004-A) with unknown lineage preference. Cells were differentiated into PP cells in monolayer culture (Table S4) and PP cells were then expanded in C6 for at least ten passages. The comparison of the growth curves of H1-(H1-PP), H9-(H9-PP) and CRTD1-(CRTD1-PP) derived ePP cells did not suggest statistically significant differences. A T<sub>d</sub> of 2.3 and 2.2 days for H9-PP and CRTD1-PP derived ePP cells, respectively, was calculated. Expansion in VTN-N coated cell culture surface appeared at least equally efficient as the expansion on Matrigel for H9- and CRTD1-PP cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A, B</xref>).</p>

<p>We then compared the maintenance of the PP identity during the expansion of H9-PP and CRTD1-PP cells to that of H1-PP cells using qPCR to quantify gene expression levels at p0, p5 and p10. Expression of <italic>PDX1</italic>, <italic>NKX6-1</italic> and <italic>SOX9</italic> in H9-derived PP cells was strikingly similar to that of H1-derived PP cells at p0 and also following expansion. Expression of these markers in CRTD1-PP cells diverged with decreased <italic>PDX1</italic> expression, at p0 and p10, but increased <italic>NKX6-1</italic> expression at p5 and p10 (Figure S6A-C). Expression of <italic>FOXA2</italic> and <italic>PTF1A</italic> in p0 H9-PP and CRTD1-PP ePPs was also very similar to that in H1-PP cells with the exception of a transient increase of <italic>FOXA2</italic> expression at p5 (Figure S6D, E). Expression of <italic>AFP</italic> and <italic>CDX2</italic> was also very similar in H9-PP and CRTD1-PP cells as compared to H1-PP cells except for a transient <italic>CDX2</italic> upregulation in CRTD1-PP cells at p5 (Figure S6F, G).</p>
<p>We then evaluated the presence of PDX1<sup>+</sup>/SOX9<sup>+</sup> and PDX1<sup>+</sup>/SOX9<sup>+</sup>/NKX6-1<sup>+</sup> cells in H9-PP and CRTD1-PP cells at p0, p5 and p10 using flow cytometry. H9 cells were less efficiently differentiated into PDX1<sup>+</sup>/SOX9<sup>+</sup> cells in comparison to either H1 or CRTD1 cells giving rise to 77%±8% (n=6) as opposed to 98%±2% (n=5) and 89%±5% (n=3) PDX1<sup>+</sup>/SOX9<sup>+</sup> PP cells for H1- and CRTD1-PP cells, respectively. However, this percentage increased to 91% (n=3) by p10, similar to that for H1-(98%±1%) (n=5) and CRTD1-(95%±6%) (n=4) p10 ePP cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6C, D</xref>). Importantly, the percentage of PDX1<sup>+</sup>/SOX9<sup>+</sup>/NKX6-1<sup>+</sup> H9-PP and CRTD1-PP cells increased from 45%±29% and 39%±6% at p0 to 90% and 85%±6% at p10, respectively. This was a very similar selection to that observed for H1-derived PP cells, which was from 48%±11% at p0 to 89%±13% at p10 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6C, D</xref>). Chromosomal stability, following expansion, was confirmed also for these lines, since no alterations were found after analysis of the G-banding of at least 20 metaphases for each line at p12 (H9-PP cells) or p13 (CRTD1-PP cells) (Figure S6H, I).</p>

<title>All C6 ePP cells differentiate into SC-islets containing functional β-cells</title>
<p>Having established that our PP expansion procedure is efficient across PP cells derived from different hPS cell lines, we asked whether ePP cells can be differentiated equally efficiently into SC-islets. H1 dPP cells as well as H1, H9 and CRTD1 ePP cells, expanded for at least ten passages, were clustered in microwells and differentiated using an adaptation of published media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">Mahaddalkar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c121">Rezania et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">Shi et al., 2017</xref>) (Table S4) to generate SC-islets. Both H1 dPP and ePP cells gave rise to similar clusters containing INS<sup>+</sup>/NKX6-1<sup>+</sup>, INS<sup>+</sup>/MAFA<sup>+</sup>, GCG<sup>+</sup> and SST<sup>+</sup> endocrine cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A, B</xref> and S7A, B) as well as similar percentages of INS<sup>+</sup>, INS<sup>+</sup>/GCG<sup>+</sup> and GCG<sup>+</sup> cells as determined by flow cytometry (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>, S7C, D). The total number of INS<sup>+</sup> and GCG<sup>+</sup> cells was between 50% and 55% in both H1 dPP- and ePP-derived SC-islets (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). We also compared the differentiation propensity of H1 dpp and ePP cells after their differentiation into SC-islets by evaluating the expression of the duct marker <italic>KRT19</italic>. Its expression was significantly lower in ePP cells but it should be noted that in both cases expression wase extremely weak (Figure S7E).</p>

<p>Finally, we assessed the functionality of the β-cells in H1 dPP-as well as H1, H9 and CRTD1 ePP-derived SC-islets in static GSIS assays where SC-islets were sequentially incubated in Kreb’s buffer containing low glucose levels (2.8mM), Kreb’s buffer containing high glucose levels (16.7 mM) and finally a depolarizing Kreb’s buffer containing high glucose levels (16.7 mM) and KCl (30 mM). As a comparison, human islets were processed in a similar manner. Human C-pep levels were measured from the supernatant of successive incubations and used to calculate the fold stimulation. These experiments showed that dPP- and ePP-derived SC-islets contained β-cells of very similar functionality (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>) and, as expected, close, but not similar, functionality to human islets.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The unlimited expansion of progenitor cells holds significant therapeutic promise but remains an important challenge in regenerative medicine. Progenitor cells are dynamic entities and the key objective in these efforts is to uncouple survival and proliferation from widely employed feed-forward mechanisms that promote their differentiation. The latter are not exclusively regulated from extrinsic signals but rely to a large extent on internal regulators as well as autocrine signals. Thus, the hallmarks of efficient progenitor expansion would be the maintenance of key progenitor features, the efficient suppression of differentiation programs and alternative lineages and the capacity to efficiently differentiate under appropriate conditions. For therapeutic applications, such expansion should also be efficient, reproducible, applicable across different cell lines and compatible with chemically defined culture media.</p>
<p>Regarding pancreatic development in particular, several feed-forward networks have been documented with exquisite detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Arda et al., 2013</xref>). In the early pancreatic progenitors, a Sox9/Fgf feed-forward loop is essential to escape liver fate and promote pancreas identity and expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Seymour et al., 2012</xref>). Fgf10 was identified as a possible extrinsic signal but it was shown that it also promotes liver identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hart et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Jung et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Norgaard et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Rossi et al., 2001</xref>). Ptf1a initially forms heterodimers with Rbpj to promote expansion of MPCs and activate transcription of Rbpjl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Masui et al., 2010</xref>). Expression of PTF1A in the MPCs is essential to set in motion an epigenetic cascade that is required for subsequent duct and endocrine differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Miguel-Escalada et al., 2022</xref>). Rbpjl eventually replaces Rbpj in its complexes with Ptf1a and the Ptf1a. Rbpjl complexes promote the specification of acinar progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Masui et al., 2010</xref>). Their mutual cross-repression with Nkx6-1/2 define the acinar progenitors and BPs, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Schaffer et al., 2010</xref>). We found that PP cells at p0 resemble MPCs because they express high levels of <italic>PTF1A</italic> but also <italic>CPA1</italic>, a marker of MPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>). Expansion promotes the switch to BP identity as documented by the strong downregulation of both <italic>PTF1A</italic> and <italic>CPA1</italic> and the corresponding upregulation of <italic>NKX6-1/2</italic> as well as <italic>DCDC2A</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Scavuzzo et al., 2018</xref>) suggesting that ePP cells may resemble bipotent progenitors as described in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Schaffer et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling activates YAP to set the stage for the endocrine differentiation of PP cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Serafimidis et al., 2017</xref>) and the YAP/TEAD complex regulates the enhancer network that maintains PP cells in a proliferative state (Cebola, I. et al. Nat Cell Biol 17, 615-26, 2015). In BP cells, YAP activation mediates a mechanotransduction pathway to maintain cells in a proliferative state and its inactivation is a prerequisite for endocrine differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cebola et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Rosado-Olivieri et al., 2019</xref>). The latter mechanism was exploited to improve the in vitro pancreatic β-cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hogrebe et al., 2020</xref>). As expected, gene expression of all the Hippo pathway components is strong in PP cells but there is no apparent regulation of the pathway, at least at the gene expression level, during expansion. Upon YAP inactivation and endocrine commitment, the TFs Myt1 and Neurog3 form a feed-forward loop to promote the final commitment into the endocrine lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). Differentiating cells are dynamic cell populations that do not move synchronously through the successive differentiation stages and this can explain the substantial expression levels of the TFs of the endocrine programme in PP cells. The expansion procedure we propose was successful in freezing cells in a state preceding endocrine commitment as shown by the dramatic repression of all endocrine TFs.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that the expression kinetics of signals and signal receptors during expansion under CINI would give us indications on which signaling pathways should be either repressed or activated to promote reproducible expansion. This approach was successful and we favor the hypothesis that these are autocrine signals and receptors expressed in the PP cells themselves because this modulation remains necessary even at late passages when the percentage of PDX1<sup>+</sup>/SOX9<sup>+</sup>/NKX6-1<sup>+</sup> is around 90%. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that some or even all of the inhibited signals, including the suppression or RA signaling through the withdrawal of vitamin A, may come from non-PP cells present in the culture. In this case their action would be to block expansion and/or survival of alternative cell fates. A convincing answer to this question should await single cell RNA Seq analyses but it is worth noting that a high initial PP cell density was an essential requirement for robust early expansion for all cell lines. This suggests that autocrine signals play a key role in the process.</p>
<p>We found that a combination of EGF, FGF2 and FGF18 promoted robust expansion of hPS cell derived PP cells. EGF promotes <italic>NKX6-1</italic> activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Nostro et al., 2015</xref>) but on its own it could not support consistent PP cell expansion (CINI, Table S1). FGF2 is a widely used mitogen and whereas it enhanced PP proliferation (C1) it was less efficient than FGF18 (C5, Table S1). There was a clear synergy of the two mitogens in promoting expansion and possibly the enrichment in NKX6-1<sup>+</sup> cells (C6, Table S1). NKX6-1 regulates multiple cell cycle genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>) and thus some of the effects of these mitogens might be indirectly reinforced through NKX6-1. The comparison of early (p3) CINI and C5 cells suggested that higher proliferation in the latter was the main driver of successful expansion. Cell death appeared also lower in C5 cells (17.2 ± 4.7% against 22.1 ± 5.0%) and thus it is likely that the combination of these effects results in reproducible expansion under C5. The high rates of cell death suggest that committed non-PP cells are primarily affected and bona fide PP cells as well as cells still competent to become bona fide PP cells compensate with higher proliferation. This question could be resolved by co-staining of the cells with PP markers as well as cell death and proliferation markers.</p>
<p>PP cells express the enzymes necessary to convert vitamin A into retinoic acid (RA) (Table S3) which, in turn, promotes differentiation of the pancreas progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Lorberbaum et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Martin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Ostrom et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Vinckier et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, eliminating vitamin A from the expansion medium was important in order to uncouple PP expansion from differentiation. The TGFβ signaling pathway plays a complex role in the induction, maintenance and endocrine differentiation of pancreas progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Guo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Sanvito et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Spagnoli and Brivanlou, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Tulachan et al., 2003</xref>) and this was reflected in the widely variable gene expression kinetics of receptors and ligands during CINI expansion. Accordingly, our experiments suggested that the highly specific ALK5i II inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Sanvitale et al., 2013</xref>) (C5, C6) was more efficient than the less specific A83-01 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Tojo et al., 2005</xref>) (CINI) in promoting PP expansion. Further inhibition of the pathway with the addition of LDN193198, which targets ALK3 more efficiently than ALK5i II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gellibert et al., 2004</xref>), dramatically reduced PP expansion (C7, Table S3). We documented that preferential expansion of progenitors, rather than cell survival, was the main mechanism of the expansion, in agreement with the idea that the expansion medium effectively decoupled proliferation from differentiation. Finally, the addition of the canonical Wnt inhibitor IWR-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chen et al., 2009</xref>) significantly reduced AFP expression and promoted an efficient selection of NKX6-1<sup>+</sup> cells, without affecting the proliferation rate, presumably by reducing the branching of expanding cells towards the hepatic fate.</p>
<p>The molecules employed in our C6 expansion medium are not, with the partial exception of FGF-18, foreign to the differentiation conditions used to generate SC-islets. RA has been used to induce the primitive gut tube conversion to PP cells and ALK5i II has been to promote the PP to endocrine progenitor conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hogrebe et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Rosado-Olivieri et al., 2019</xref>) Additionally, IWR-1 has been proposed to increase endocrine differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Sharon et al., 2019</xref>). This may appear contradictory but we think that it is the combination of signals that promotes a certain cell state rather than specific signals. Accordingly, we carried out the generation of PP cells before expansion and their differentiation after expansion in exactly the same way as for PP cells that were not expanded. In these procedures we employed RA and ALK5i II as published earlier but in our hands IWR-1 did not make a difference in either the dPP or ePP to endocrine progenitor transition.</p>
<p>Culture conditions to expand hPS cell-derived PP cells have recently been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Ma et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Nakamura et al., 2022</xref>) but suffer from a number of disadvantages as outlined in the introduction. An important feature of our expansion procedure is the reproducible enrichment in PDX1<sup>+</sup>/SOX9<sup>+</sup>/NKX6-1<sup>+</sup> which can reach 90%, irrespective of the cell line used. Thus, this procedure will be particularly useful for hPS cell lines with reduced initial capacity to differentiate into PP cells. The comparison of the transcriptome profiles showed that our procedure is unique in effecting a strong upregulation of <italic>GP2</italic>, a unique marker of human fetal PP cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Cogger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Ramond et al., 2017</xref>) associated with a high PP preference for endocrine differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Aghazadeh et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ameri et al., 2017</xref>). Another unique feature, was the strong upregulation of <italic>NKX6-2</italic>, another marker of PP cells which complements <italic>NKX6-1</italic> function but is not retained in differentiated endocrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Binot et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Henseleit et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Nelson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Pedersen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Schaffer et al., 2010</xref>). The FN procedure appeared to maintain higher levels of TF genes engaged in the duct program, as well as higher levels of <italic>AFP</italic> and <italic>HHEX</italic>, markers of the liver lineage. Expression of acinar <italic>TFs</italic> was very low in all three procedures and, as expected, the expression of <italic>TFs</italic> driving the endocrine program was strongly reduced in all three procedures albeit our procedure appeared more efficient in this respect, particularly with regard to <italic>RFX3</italic> and <italic>RFX6</italic> expression. It is important to point out that all three procedures resulted in noticeable upregulation of <italic>CDX2</italic>, a gut TF and future efforts should be directed in addressing this, using modifications of the current procedure and FC quantification of CDX2<sup>+</sup> cells. Interestingly, all ePP cells clustered separately from human fetal progenitors. This could reflect genuine differences due to culture conditions or differences in developmental age, including the possibility that ePP cells may represent a transient, unstable state in vivo. Another possibility is that PP cells in vivo might be more heterogeneous as it is expected that progenitors at different positions in the developing organ would be at different developmental stage.</p>
<p>Importantly, ePP cells from H1, H9 and CRTD1 hPS cells all differentiated with similar efficiency to dPP cells into SC-islets containing similar numbers of β-cells of comparable functionality. This may appear surprising because ePP cells contained a much higher percentage of PDX1<sup>+</sup>/SOX9<sup>+</sup>/NKX6-1<sup>+</sup> cells. It should be noted, however, that the liver marker AFP and, particularly, the gut marker CDX2 were upregulated, whereas expression of <italic>PTF1A</italic>, recently shown to promote endocrine differentiation of hPS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Miguel-Escalada et al., 2022</xref>), was essentially lost. The same pattern, and even higher upregulation of gut and liver markers, was also seen in the other expansion procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Ma et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Nakamura et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>The unlimited expansion of PP cells reported here is applicable to different hPS cell lines and presents several advantages in the efforts to scale-up the generation of islet cells, including β-cells, for the cell therapy of diabetes. It reduces the number of differentiation procedures to be carried out starting at the hPS cell stage, thus eliminating a source of variability and allows the selection of the most optimally differentiated PP cell population for subsequent expansion and storage. Since it is currently acknowledged that current differentiation procedures do not produce fully functional β-cells, these ePP cells will provide a convenient springboard to refine downstream differentiation procedures. Suitable surface markers for the selection of endocrine cells at the end of the differentiation procedure have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Veres et al., 2019</xref>) but such procedures may prove too expensive in a clinical setting. Alternatively, expanded PP cells could be directly used for transplantations as it has been shown that they can mature in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kroon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Shapiro et al., 2021</xref>). Whether PP cells or terminally differentiated SC-islet cells would be the best approach in future transplantations, is still discussed but, in any of these cases, the availability of a highly pure GMP-grade, hPS cell derived PP cell population has several advantages as discussed above.</p>
<p>The transition to full GMP conditions is expected to be relatively straightforward. Human iPS cell lines are already being generated under GMP conditions and, depending on the culture medium, the first key differentiation step (monolayer hPS cell to definitive endoderm) might need adjustment regarding seeding density, the length of time that hPS cells remain as a monolayer, confluency at the time of differentiation initiation and possibly concentrations of signals, particularly Activin A and CHIR. In our hands, the plate coating, either with Matrigel or GMP-compatible reagents such as FN or VTN-N, does not have any impact on the differentiation efficiency to definitive endoderm and subsequent stages. Otherwise, the large majority of supplements, used in hPS cell culture and differentiation into SC-islets, are small molecules and recombinant proteins which can be already purchased as GMP reagents. Some small molecules are not yet available as GMP versions but they could be manufactured upon custom request if necessary.</p>
<p>In summary, the expansion of PP cells will facilitate the generation of unlimited number of endocrine cells, initially for studying diabetes, drug screening for personalized medicine and eventually cell therapies. The chemically defined expansion procedure we report here will be an important step toward generating large numbers of human pancreatic endocrine cells that are of great interest for biomedical research and regenerative medicine.</p>

<title>Derivation of the CRTD1 human iPS cell line</title>
<p>The CRTD1 human iPS cell line (hPSCreg: CRTDi004-A) was generated from previously published foreskin fibroblasts (termed Theo) of a consenting healthy donor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">Wolf et al., 2016</xref>). Isolation of cells and reprogramming to hiPS cells was approved by the ethics council of TU Dresden (EK169052010 und EK386102017). Theo fibroblasts were reprogrammed at the CRTD Stem Cell Engineering Facility at the Technical University of Dresden using the CytoTune-iPS 2.0 Sendai Reprogramming Kit (Thermo Fischer Scientific A16517) according to the supplier’s recommendations for transduction.

<p>The paper presents a novel approach to expand iPSC-derived pdx1+/nkx6.1+ pancreas progenitors, making them potentially suitable for GMP-compatible protocols. This advancement represents a significant breakthrough for diabetes cell replacement therapies, as one of the current bottlenecks is the inability of expanding PP without compromising their differentiation potential. The study employs a robust dataset and state-of-the-art methodology, unveiling crucial signaling pathways (eg TGF, Notch...) responsible for sustaining pancreas progenitors while preserving their differentiation potential in vitro.</p>
<p>The current version of the paper has improved, increasing the clarity and providing clear explanations to the comments raised regarding quantifications, functionality of the cells in vivo etc...</p>
<p>The discussion on challenges adds depth to the study and encourages future research to build upon these important findings</p>

<p>In this work, Jarc et al. describe a method to decouple the mechanisms supporting progenitor self-renewal and expansion from feed-forward mechanisms promoting their differentiation.</p>
<p>The authors aimed at expanding pancreatic progenitor (PP) cells, strictly characterized as PDX1+/SOX9+/NKX6.1+ cells, for several rounds. This required finding the best cell culture conditions that allow sustaining PP cell proliferation along cell passages while avoiding their further differentiation. They achieve this by comparing the transcriptome of PP cells that can be expanded for several passages against the transcriptome of unexpanded (just differentiated) PP cells.</p>
<p>The optimized culture conditions enabled the selection of PDX1+/SOX9+/NKX6.1+ PP cells and their consistent, 2000-fold, expansion over ten passages and 40-45 days. Transcriptome analyses confirmed the stabilization of PP identity and the effective suppression of differentiation. These optimized culture conditions consisted in substituting the Vitamin A containing B27 supplement with a B27 formulation devoid of vitamin A (to avoid retinoic acid (RA) signaling from an autocrine feed-forward loop), substituting A38-01 with the ALK5 II inhibitor (ALK5i II) that targets primarily ALK5, supplementation of medium with FGF18 (in addition to FGF2) and the canonical Wnt inhibitor IWR-1, and cell culture on vitronectin-N (VTN-N) as a substrate instead of Matrigel.</p>
<p>The strength of this work relies on a clever approach to identify cell culture modifications that allow expansion of PP cells (once differentiated) while maintaining, if not reinforcing, PP cell identity. Along the work, it is emphasized that PP cell identity is associated to the co-expression of PDX1, SOX9 and NKX6.1. The optimized protocol is unique (among the other datasets used in the comparison shown here) at inducing a strong upregulation of GP2, a unique marker of human fetal pancreas progenitors. Importantly GP2+ enriched hPS cell-derived PP cells are more efficiently differentiating into pancreatic endocrine cells (Aghazadeh et al., 2022; Ameri et al., 2017).</p>
<p>The unlimited expansion of PP cells reported here would allow scaling-up the generation of beta cells, for the cell therapy of diabetes, by eliminating a source of variability derived from the number of differentiation procedures to be carried out when starting at the hPS cell stage each time. The approach presented here would allow selection of the most optimally differentiated PP cell population for subsequent expansion and storage. Among other conditions optimized, the authors report a role for Vitamin A in activating retinoic acid signaling in an autocrine feed-forward loop, and the supplementation with FGF18 to reinforce FGF2 signaling.</p>
<p>This is a relevant topic in the field of research, and some of the cell culture conditions reported here for PP expansion might have important implications in cell therapy approaches. Thus, the approach and results presented in this study could be of interest for researchers working in the field of in vitro pancreatic beta cell differentiation from hPSCs. Table S1 and Table S4 are clearly detailed and extremely instrumental to this aim.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p>
<p>The authors describe a method to decouple the mechanisms supporting pancreatic progenitor self-renewal and expansion from feed-forward mechanisms promoting their differentiation. The findings are important because they have implications beyond a single subfield. The strength of evidence is solid in that the methods, data and analyses broadly support the claims with only minor weaknesses.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful for the substantial effort that reviewers put into reading our manuscript and providing such a detailed feedback. We have strived to address, as much as possible, all comments and criticisms. Thanks to the feedback, we believe that we have now a significantly improved manuscript. Below, there is a point-bypoint response.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review)</bold></p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors are developing a new protocol that aims at expanding pancreatic progenitors derived from human pluripotent stem cells under GMP-compliant conditions. The strategy is based on hypothesis-driven experiments that come from knowledge derived from pancreatic developmental biology.</p>
<p>The topic is of major interest in the view of the importance of amplifying human pancreatic progenitors (both for fundamental purposes and for future clinical applications). There is indeed currently a major lack of information on efficient conditions to reach this objective, despite major recurrent efforts by the scientific community.</p>
<p>Using their approach that combines stimulation of specific mitogenic pathways and inhibition of retinoic acid and specific branches of the TGF-beta and Wnt pathways, the authors claim to be able, in a highly robust and reproducible manner) to amplify in 10 passages the number of pancreatic progenitors (PP) by 2,000 folds, which is really an impressive breakthrough.</p>
<p>The work is globally well-performed and quite convincing. I have however some technical comments mainly related to the quantification of pancreatic progenitor amplification and to their differentiation into beta-like cells following amplification.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the positive assessment. Below we provide a point-by-point response to specific comments and criticisms.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors)</bold></p>
<p>Figure 1:</p>
<p>Panel A: What is exactly counted in Fig. 1A? Is it the number of PP (as indicated in the title) or the total number of cells? If it is PPs, was it done following PDX1/NKX6.1/SOX9 staining and FACS quantification? This question applies to a number of Figures and the authors should be clear on this point.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now define ‘PP cells’ as ‘PP-containing cells’ (PP cells) the first time we use the term in the RESULTS section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Panel D: I do not understand the source of TGFb1, GDF11, FGF18, PDGFA. Which cell type(s) express such factors in culture? I was not convinced that the signals are produced by PP and act through an autocrine loop. I have the same type of questions for the receptors: PDGFR on the second page of the results; RARs and RXRs on the third page.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We refer to these factors/receptors as components of a tentative autocrine loop. We agree we do not prove it and we now comment on this in the discussion section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 2:</p>
<p>FACS plots are very difficult to analyze for two reasons: I do not understand the meaning of the y axes (PDX1/SOX9). Does that mean that 100% of the cells were PDX1+/SOX9+? The authors should show the separated FACS plots. More importantly, the x axes indicate that NKX6.1 FACS staining is very weak. This is by far different from what can be read in publications performing the same types of experiments (publications by Millman, Otonkoski...as examples). How was quantification performed when it is so difficult to properly define positive vs negative populations? It is necessary to present proper &quot;negative controls&quot; for FACS experiments and to clearly indicate how positive versus cells were defined</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now explain the gating strategy better in the results section, all controls are included in figure S2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 3:</p>
<p>What is the exact &quot;phenotype&quot; of the cells that incorporated EdU: It would be really instructive to add PDX1/NKX6.1/SOX9 staining on top of EdU. I am also surprised that 20% of the cells stain positive for Annexin V. This is a huge fraction. Does that mean that many cells (20%) are dying and if the case, how amplification can take place under such deleterious conditions?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an interesting mechanistic point but performing these experiments would delay the publication of the final manuscript for too long. These assays were done at p3 in order to catch CINI cells that do not expand in most cases. It is important to note that cell death also appears higher in CINI cells. It is likely that the combination of these effects results in reproducible expansion under C5. We comment on the possibilities in the discussion section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 4:</p>
<p>On FACS plots the intensity at the single cell level (see x-axis of the figure) of the NKX6.1 staining is found to increase in Fig. 4G by 50-100 folds when compared to Fig. 4E. Is it expected? This should be discussed in the text. Do the authors observe the same increase by immunocytochemistry?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The apparent difference is actually 10-fold (from 2x102 to 2x103). We think that the most likely reason for this apparent increase is that at p0 we typically used very few cells for the FC in order to keep as many as possible for the subsequent expansion. If we had used more, we would be able to also detect cells with higher expression. As we mention in the bioinformatics analysis, NKX6 expression does increase with passaging and therefore it is also possible that at least part of this increase is real. However, we don’t have suitable data (same number of cells analyzed at each passage) to address this in a reliable manner.</p>

<p>Figure 5</p>
<p>Previous data from the scientific literature indicate that in vitro, by default, PP gives rise to duct-like cells. This is a bit described in the result section and supplementary figures taking into account the expression of transcription factors. However the data are not clearly explained and described in quite a qualitative manner. They should appear in a quantitative fashion (and the main figures), adding additional duct cell markers such as Carbonic anhydrase, SPP1, CFTR, and others. I assume that the authors can easily use their transcriptomic data to produce a Figure to be described and discussed in detail.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We think it can be misleading to use such markers (other than TFs and the latter only as a collective) because specific markers of terminal differentiation are more often than not expressed during development in multipotent progenitors, the most conspicuous example been CPA1. To illustrate the point, we used the RNA Seq data of and plotted the expression values of a panel of duct genes in isolated human fetal progenitors (Ramond et al., 2017) together with their expression in p0 PP and ePP cells from all three different procedure (please see below). All raw RNA Seq data were processed together to enable direct comparison. According to the analysis of Ramond et al the A population corresponds to MPCs, C to early endocrine progenitors (EP), D to late endocrine progenitors and, by inference and gene expression pattern B to BPs. Expression levels of all these markers were very similar suggesting that these markers cannot be used to distinguish between duct cells and progenitor cells. Importantly, SC-islets derived from either dPP or ePP cells express extremely low and similar levels of KRT19, a marker of duct cells. This latter information is now included in the last part of the results (Figure S7).</p>

<p>Fig. 7:</p>
<p>
The figure is a bit disappointing for 2 reasons. In A and B, the quality of INS, GCG, and SST staining is really poor. In E, GSIS is really difficult to interpret. They should not be presented as stimulatory indexes. The authors should present independently: INS content; INS secretion at low glucose; INS secretion at high glucose; INS secretion with KCL. Finally, the authors should indicate that glucose poorly (around 2 fold) activates insulin/C-Pept secretion in their stem-cell-derived islets.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We disagree with the quality assessment of the immunofluorescence. Stimulation indexes are also used very widely but we now provide data for actual C-peptide secretion normalized for DNA content of the SC-islets. For technical reasons we do not have normalized C-peptide secretion for human islets. However, we provide a direct comparison to the stimulation index of human islets assayed under the same conditions (2.7 mM glucose / 16.7 mM glucose / 16.7 mM glucose + 30 mM KCl) without presenting SC-islets separately and tweaking the glucose basal (lowering) and stimulation (increasing) levels to inflate the stimulation index. This is unfortunately common. In any case, we do not claim an improvement in the differentiation conditions and our S5-S7 steps may not be optimal but this is not the subject of this work.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>The paper presents a novel approach to expand iPSC-derived pdx1+/nkx6.1+ pancreas progenitors, making them potentially suitable for GMP-compatible protocols. This advancement represents a significant breakthrough for diabetes cell replacement therapies, as one of the current bottlenecks is the inability to expand PP without compromising their differentiation potential. The study employs a robust dataset and state-of-the-art methodology, unveiling crucial signaling pathways (eg TGF, Notch...) responsible for sustaining pancreas progenitors while preserving their differentiation potential in vitro.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>This paper has strong data, guided omics technology, clear aims, applicability to current protocols, and beneficial implications for diabetes research. The discussion on challenges adds depth to the study and encourages future research to build upon these important findings.</p>

<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>The paper does have some weaknesses that could be addressed to improve its overall clarity and impact. The writing style could benefit from simplification, as certain sections are explained in a convoluted manner and difficult to follow, in some instances, redundancy is evident. Furthermore, the legends accompanying figures should be self-explanatory, ensuring that readers can easily understand the presented data without the need to be checking along the paper for information.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have simplified the text in several places and removed redundancies, particularly in the discussion. We revisited the figure legends and made minor corrections to increase clarity. However, regarding the figure legends, we think that adding the interpretation of the results would be redundant to the main text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The culture conditions employed in the study might benefit from more systematic organization and documentation, making them easier to follow.</p>
<p>
There is a comparative Table (Table S1) where all conditions are summarized.  We refer to this Table every time that we introduce a new condition. We also have a Table (Table S4) which presents all different media and components used it the differentiation procedure.</p>
<p>Another important aspect is the functionality of the expanded cells after differentiation. While the study provides valuable insights into the expansion of pancreas progenitors in vitro and does the basic tests to measure their functionality after differentiation the paper could be strengthened by exploring the behavior and efficacy of these cells deeper, and in an in vivo setting.</p>

<p>We have done all these standard analyses but we think that they did not contribute anything else useful to the study with the exception of pointing to the finding that the TGFb pathway is negatively correlated with expansion, and this is included in the study. The ‘unbiased’ analysis that the reviewer suggests did not turn out something else useful to exploit for the expansion. This does not mean that our approach is biased – in our view it is hypothesis-driven. As we also write in the manuscript, if in a certain pathway a key gene fails to be expressed, the pathway will not show up in any GO or GSEA analyses. However, the pathway will still be regulated. The RA and FGF18 cases clearly illustrate this. We realize that these analyses have become a standard but we think that it is not the only way to approach genomics data and these approaches did not offer much in the context of this study.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review)</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this work, Jarc et al. describe a method to decouple the mechanisms supporting progenitor self-renewal and expansion from feed-forward mechanisms promoting their differentiation.</p>
<p>The authors aimed at expanding pancreatic progenitor (PP) cells, strictly characterized as
PDX1+/SOX9+/NKX6.1+ cells, for several rounds. This required finding the best cell culture conditions that allow sustaining PP cell proliferation along cell passages, while avoiding their further differentiation. They achieve this by comparing the transcriptome of PP cells that can be expanded for several passages against the transcriptome of unexpanded (just differentiated) PP cells.</p>
<p>The optimized culture conditions enabled the selection of PDX1+/SOX9+/NKX6.1+ PP cells and their consistent, 2000-fold, expansion over ten passages and 40-45 days. Transcriptome analyses confirmed the stabilization of PP identity and the effective suppression of differentiation. These optimized culture conditions consisted of substituting the Vitamin A containing B27 supplement with a B27 formulation devoid of vitamin A (to avoid retinoic acid (RA) signaling from an autocrine feed-forward loop), substituting A38-01 with the ALK5 II inhibitor (ALK5i II) that targets primarily ALK5, supplementation of medium with FGF18 (in addition to FGF2) and the canonical Wnt inhibitor IWR-1, and cell culture on vitronectin-N (VTN-N) as a substrate instead of Matrigel.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strength of this work relies on a clever approach to identify cell culture modifications that allow expansion of PP cells (once differentiated) while maintaining, if not reinforcing, PP cell identity. Along the work, it is emphasized that PP cell identity is associated with the co-expression of PDX1, SOX9, and NKX6.1. The optimized protocol is unique (among the other datasets used in the comparison shown here) in inducing a strong upregulation of GP2, a unique marker of human fetal pancreas progenitors. Importantly GP2+ enriched hPS cell-derived PP cells are more efficiently differentiating into pancreatic endocrine cells (Aghazadeh et al., 2022; Ameri et al., 2017).</p>
<p>The unlimited expansion of PP cells reported here would allow scaling-up the generation of beta cells, for the cell therapy of diabetes, by eliminating a source of variability derived from the number of differentiation procedures to be carried out when starting at the hPS cell stage each time. The approach presented here would allow the selection of the most optimally differentiated PP cell population for subsequent expansion and storage. Among other conditions optimized, the authors report a role for Vitamin A in activating retinoic acid signaling in an autocrine feed-forward loop, and the supplementation with FGF18 to reinforce FGF2 signaling.</p>
<p>This is a relevant topic in the field of research, and some of the cell culture conditions reported here for PP expansion might have important implications in cell therapy approaches. Thus, the approach and results presented in this study could be of interest to researchers working in the field of in vitro pancreatic beta cell differentiation from hPSCs. Table S1 and Table S4 are clearly detailed and extremely instrumental to this aim.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the positive assessment. Below we provide a point-by-point response to general comments and criticisms.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>The authors strictly define PP cells as PDX1+/SOX9+/NKX6.1+ cells, and this phenotype was convincingly characterized by immunofluorescence, RT-qPCR, and FACS analysis along the work. However, broadly defined PDX1+/SOX9+/NKX6.1+ could include pancreatic multipotent progenitor cells (MPC, defined as PDX1+/SOX9+/NKX6.1+/PTF1A+ cells) or pancreatic bipotent progenitors (BP, defined as PDX1+/SOX9+/NKX6.1+/PTF1A-) cells. It has been indeed reported that Nkx6.1/Nkx6.2 and Ptf1a function as antagonistic lineage determinants in MPC (Schaffer, A.E. et al. PLoS Genet 9, e1003274, 2013), and that the Nkx6/Ptf1a switch only operates during a critical competence window when progenitors are still multipotent and can be uncoupled from cell differentiation. It would be important to define whether culturing PDX1+/SOX9+/NKX6.1+ PP (as defined in this work) in the best conditions allowing cell expansion is reinforcing either an MPC or BP phenotype. Data from Figure S2A (last paragraph of page 7) suggests that PTF1A expression is decreased in C5 culture conditions, thus more homogeneously keeping BP cells in this media composition. However, on page 15, 2nd paragraph it is stated that &quot;the strong upregulation of NKX6.2 in our procedure suggested that our ePP cells may have retracted to an earlier PP stage&quot;. Evaluating the co-expression of the previously selected markers with PTF1A (or CPA2), or the more homogeneous expression of novel BP markers described, such as DCDC2A (Scavuzzo et al. Nat Commun 9, 3356, 2018), in the different culture conditions assayed would more shield light into this relevant aspect.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is certainly an interesting point. The RNA Seq data suggest that ePP cells resemble BP cells rather than MPCs and that this occurs during expansion. We have now added a new paragraph in the results section to illustrate this and added graphs of CPA2, PTF1A and DCDC2A expression during expansion in Figure 5, S5 as well as data in Table S5. In summary, we favor the interpretation that expanded cells are close but not identical to the BP identity and refer to that in the discussion. We have also amended the statement on page 15 stating <code>the strong upregulation of NKX6.2 in our procedure suggested that our ePP cells may have retracted to an earlier PP stage</code>.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In line with the previous comment, it would be extremely insightful if the authors could characterize or at least discuss a potential role for YAP underlying the mechanistic effects observed after culturing PP in different media compositions. It is well known that the nuclear localization of the co-activator YAP broadly promotes cell proliferation, and it is a key regulator of organ growth during development. Importantly in this context, it has been reported that TEAD and YAP regulate the enhancer network of human embryonic pancreatic progenitors and disruption of this interaction arrests the growth of the embryonic pancreas (Cebola, I. et al. Nat Cell Biol 17, 615-26, 2015). More recently, it has also been shown that a cell-extrinsic and intrinsic mechanotransduction pathway mediated by YAP acts as gatekeeper in the fate decisions of BP in the developing pancreas, whereby nuclear YAP in BPs allows proliferation in an uncommitted fate, while YAP silencing induces EP commitment (Mamidi, A. et al. Nature 564, 114-118, 2018; Rosado-Olivieri et al. Nature Communications 10, 1464, 2019). This mechanism was further exploited recently to improve the in vitro pancreatic beta cell differentiation protocol (Hogrebe et al., Nature Protocols 16, 4109-4143, 2021; Hogrebe et al, Nature Biotechnology 38, 460-470, 2020). Thus, YAP in the context of the findings described in this work could be a key player underlying the proliferation vs differentiation decisions in PP.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We do refer to these publications now and refer to the YAP pathway in the introduction and results sections as well as in the discussion. We have not investigated more because the kinetics of the different components of the pathway are complex and do not give an indication of whether the pathway becomes more or less active – please see below.</p>

<p>Regarding the improvements made in the PP cell culture medium composition to allow expansion while avoiding differentiation, some of the claims should be better discussed and contextualized with current stateof-the-art differentiation protocols. As an example, the use of ALK5 II inhibitor (ALK5i II) has been reported to induce EP commitment from PP, while RA was used to induce PP commitment from the primitive gut tube cell stage in recently reported in vitro differentiation protocols (Hogrebe et al., Nature Protocols 16, 41094143, 2021; Rosado-Olivieri et al. Nature Communications 10, 1464, 2019). In this context, and to the authors' knowledge, is Vitamin A (triggering autocrine RA signaling) usually included in the basal media formulations used in other recently reported state-of-the-art protocols? If so, at which stages? Would it be advisable to remove it?</p>

<p>These points and our views are now included in the discussion</p>

<p>In this line also, the supplementation of cell culture media with the canonical Wnt inhibitor IWR-1 is used in this work to allow the expansion of PP while avoiding differentiation. A role for Wnt pathway inhibition during endocrine differentiation using IWR1 has been previously reported (Sharon et al. Cell Reports 27, 22812291.e5, 2019). In that work, Wnt inhibition in vitro causes an increase in the proportion of differentiated endocrine cells. It would be advisable to discuss these previous findings with the results presented in the current work. Could Wnt inhibition have different effects depending on the differential modulation of the other signaling pathways?</p>

<list-item><p>On page 4 of the introduction, in the context of &quot;Unlimited expansion of PP cells in vitro will require disentangling differentiation signals from proliferation/maintenance signals. Several pathways have been implicated in these processes...&quot; the authors are advised to consider mentioning the YAP mediated mechanisms as another key aspect underlying MPC phenotype (Cebola, I. et al. Nat Cell Biol 17, 615-26, 2015) and the BP to endocrine progenitor (EP) commitment (Mamidi, A. et al. Nature 564, 114-118, 2018; Rosado-Olivieri et al. Nature Communications 10, 1464, 2019). This should be better discussed in the context of the Weaknesses mentioned in the Public Review. It would be worth considering adding effectors and other molecules involved in YAP and Hippo pathway signaling to Table S3.</p>

<p>We have added the role of the Hippo/YAP pathway in the introduction and mentioned in the results the finding that components of the pathway are generally not regulated except two that are now added in Table S3</p>

<p>The paragraph is rewritten because it was not clear – we used A83-01 and not SB431542. Other approaches had used SB431542.</p>

<list-item><p>Page 8, 2nd paragraph, near &quot;Expression of both AFP and CDX2 increased transiently upon expansion, at p5 (Figure S2H-J).&quot; How do you explain results in FigS2C, D and FigS2E (AFP/CDX2)? RT-qPCR data does not suggest transient downregulation.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>AFP and CDX2 were – wrongly – italicized in the quoted passage. Therefore, in one case we refer to the protein and in the other to the transcript levels. We corrected and added the qualifier ‘appeared’. The difference is most likely due to translational regulation but we did not elaborate since we do not know. In any case, we have used the, less favorable but more robust, gene expression levels as the main criterion.</p>

<p>We strive to keep sections autonomous so that the reader would not have to flip between figures and sections – this is why we think that figure S4A is preferable as it is; it is a direct comparison of C6 to C5 for the different markers and has the additional advantage that one needs not to include p0 levels.</p>

<p>No, because the baseline (average 1) is the C5 expression at the corresponding passage no. We changed the y-axis label, hopefully it is clearer now.</p>

</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>This statement regarding ‘undetectable PTF1A expression’ refers to expanded PP cells (ePP), not PP cells at p0. For the latter, expression is indeed close to 1000 in normalized RNA-sequence counts as mentioned in the Table legend.</p>

<p>-Page 11, 4th paragraph, &quot;In summary, the comparative transcriptome analyses suggested that our C6 expansion procedure is more efficient at strengthening the PP identity&quot;. In the context of comments made in the Public Review, more accuracy needs to be put when defining PP identity. Are these MPC or BP?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The RNA Seq data suggest that expansion promotes a MPC  BP transition. We have added a paragraph in the corresponding results section and comment in the discussion.</p>

</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>Its role is in the MPCs and it prepares the epigenetic landscape to allow for duct and endocrine specification later, thus it ‘creates epigenetic competence’. The paper was cited out of context and we have now corrected it.</p>

<p>Additional recommendations by the Reviewing Editor:</p>
<p>An insufficient number of experimental repetitions have been used for the following data: (Figure 1A, n = 2; Figures 2B-D, p10, n = 2; Figures 6A and B, VTN-N, n = 1).</p>

<p>This is true but we do not draw quantitative conclusions from or do comparisons with these data.</p>
