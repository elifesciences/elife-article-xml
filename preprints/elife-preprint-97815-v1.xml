<title>Abstract</title><p>Many integrative filamentous phages not only lack Ff coliphage homologues essential for assembly but also have distinct packaging signals (PS). Their encapsidation remains completely uncharacterized to date. Here we report the first evidence of a PS-dependent checkpoint for integrative filamentous phage assembly. Suppressor screening of PS-deficient phages identified an unknown protein, PSB15 (<bold><underline>PS</underline></bold>-<bold><underline>b</underline></bold>inding <bold><underline>15</underline></bold> kDa), crucial for encapsidation. The WAGFXF motif of the PSB15 N-terminus directly binds to PS DNA with conformational change, while suppressor mutations relieve DNA binding specificity constraints to rescue assembly arrest. PSB15 interacts with phospholipid cardiolipin via its basic helix and C-terminus, and recruits PS DNA to the inner membrane (IM). The PSB15-PS complex is released from the IM by interaction between its hydrophobic linker and thioredoxin (Trx), a host protein that is required for Ff assembly but whose mechanisms are still unclear. Live cell imaging shows that thioredoxin and DNA binding regulate the dwelling time of PSB15 at cell poles, suggesting that they both facilitate the dissociation of PSB15 from the IM. Loss of PSB15 or its PS-binding and IM-targeting/dissociation activity compromised virus egress, indicating that the PS/PSB15/Trx complex establishes a regulatory phage assembly checkpoint critical for integrative phage infection and life cycles.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Assembly and secretion of the archetypical filamentous Ff coliphage was one of the first prokaryotic cell and molecular biology topics studied over 60 years ago (Zinder, 1967; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Salivar et al., 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Beaudoin and Pratt, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Loh et al., 2019</xref>; Mai-Prochnow et al., 2015; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hay and Lithgow, 2019</xref>) Virus reproduction requires reasonable efficiency of assembly processes. Virion formation begins with the synthesis of individual coat proteins and is followed by selective binding of the packaging signal (PS) at the inner membrane (IM). PS is a <italic>cis</italic>-acting DNA element that distinguishes viral genomes from cellular DNAs or RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Tate and Peterson, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Shen et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Webster et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dotto et al., 1981</xref>). During encapsidation, directionality of Ff particles matters as phage particles are structurally asymmetric at their leading and trailing end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wickner and Killick, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Conners et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jia and Xiang, 2023</xref>). At the leading end, pVII and pIX protein complex interact with the PS hairpin of pV-coated phage ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Russel and Model, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Russel, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Haase et al., 2022</xref>). On the phage assembly site, pIV forms a large, gated channel within the outer membrane (OM), while pI and pXI form the IM component of an equimolar, multimeric trans-membrane complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Ploss and Kuhn, 2010</xref>; Gibaud, 2021). As phage DNA traverses through the IM, pV is displaced by the major capsid protein, pVIII, where encapsidation requires machinery made of pI, pXI and pIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Haase et al., 2022</xref>). The order of viral encapsidation with various structural proteins is mostly irreversible with great specificity ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bruinsma et al., 2021</xref>). Nonetheless, across other filamentous phage subtypes, little is known about how the various viral proteins orchestrate a carefully conserved process of infection with host proteins and egress from the membrane.</p>
<p>Integrative filamentous phages play critical roles in human and plant diseases caused by devastating bacteria. These phages integrate their genomes into the host bacterial chromosome directly and replicate like prophages, instead of episomally, like Ff. They have been shown to influence the virulency of their host bacteria, including <italic>Yersinia pestis biovar orientalis</italic> and <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>, which respectively causes plague and cholera, and the biofilm formation of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, contributing to public health consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Waldor and Mekalanos, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gonzalez et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rice et al., 2009</xref>). To date, there are more than 30 different integrative filamentous phages identified from human, animal, and plant pathogens (Mai-Prochnow et al., 2015; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hay and Lithgow, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Yeh et al., 2023</xref>). However, very little is known about the PS or encapsidation processes crucial for their replication and infection life cycles.</p>
<p>Thus far, genomic information has shown that integrative filamentous phages of Gram-negative bacteria lack an Ff gIV and gIX homologue. We also verified that Ff gVII homologues are not present in many integrative filamentous phages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Yeh et al., 2023</xref>). The absence of these crucial structures prompted us to identify the PS of these phages, what viral (structural and non-structural) factors are involved in their assembly and egress, and how the PS DNA becomes targeted to the IM for encapsidation. To explore the viral assembly of integrative filamentous phages, we first characterized <italic>Xanthomonas</italic> phage PS, which has distinct properties from Ff. Its loop is essential for PS activity, and it contains a shorter (7-8 bp) GC-rich stem compared to f1 (&gt;20 bp). The <italic>Xanthomonas</italic> phage PS also has a different consensus sequence, but importantly, its 5’ to 3’ orientation is not critical for PS competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Tate and Peterson, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Shen et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Webster et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dotto et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Russel and Model, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Yeh et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we found that the PS plays a crucial role in phage assembly distinct from Ff. We identified an unknown protein, PSB15 (<bold><underline>PS</underline></bold>-<bold><underline>b</underline></bold>inding <bold><underline>15</underline></bold> kDa), through genetic suppressor screening, which rescued assembly arrest caused by loss of PS function. PSB15 directly binds to and targets PS and phage DNA to the IM, where this interaction is later released by thioredoxin (Trx), a host protein. We report the first evidence of a filamentous phage assembly checkpoint controlled by PS/PSB15/Trx. These results reveal the underappreciated diversity of the PS in filamentous phages, and demonstrates the many ways filamentous phages can assemble and reproduce, thus redefining the model of integrative filamentous phage assembly.</p>

<title>Suppressor screening of PS-interacting proteins</title>
<p>To identify protein factor(s) involved in assembly, we first modified Russel and Model’s method of suppressor screening for PS-interacting protein(s) based on phage plaque morphology (Supplemental Figure S1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Russel and Model, 1989</xref>). We generated a ϕLf-UK phage synonymous T340A/C341G mutant that lost its PS activity but kept gII protein function to facilitate phage DNA replication (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Yeh et al., 2023</xref>). The ϕLf-UK T340A/C341G plaque morphology was tiny (0.1-0.2 mm) compared to the wild-type phage (1-1.2 mm). On the bacterial lawn, normal-sized plaques could be found with a high frequency of 5×10<sup>-2</sup> to 10<sup>-4</sup>. The normal-sized plaques were collected to amplify phages. These phage mutants represented either true reversion (A340 → T340) or second-site mutations (pseudorevertants), which contain suppressor mutations able to compensate for the loss of PS activity.</p>

<p>We added a second screening step to find suppressors by using these phage mutants as helper viruses to infect bacteria transformed with pORIPS-PS(-) plasmid. When infected with ϕLf-UK helper phage, pORIPS-PS(-) contains an antisense PS [PS(-)] sequence unable to assemble transducing particles (TPs) efficiently (0.9-1.5% yield compared to the canonical PS) (24). Pseudorevertants, but not true revertants, can provide suppressors <italic>in trans</italic> to compensate for the deficient production of pORIPS-PS(-) TP. Therefore, pseudorevertants can be screened by detecting the significant increase of pORIPS-PS(-) TPs released into the medium using qPCR. A total of 123 pseudorevertants were isolated from 4 independent screens (1026 phages with normal-sized plaques). The mutations of 100 suppressors were mapped by whole genome sequencing, and the results are summarized in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>.</p>
<p>Our data showed that gVII, gI, and two unknown genes, ORF9 and ORF11, genetically interact with the PS. These pseudorevertants all contain a single nonsynonymous mutation. A total of 30 and 24 pseudorevertants contained the substitution of T5291C and T5246C, respectively, which encode a Thr7Ala (T7A) and Thr22Ala (T22A) mutation in the ϕLf-UK ORF9 protein (here named as <bold><underline>PS</underline> <underline>b</underline></bold>inding <bold><underline>15</underline></bold> kDa, PSB15). C4678A and G4655A mutations in ORF11 (Arg80Leu and Arg88Cys in protein) were identified among 16 and 12 pseudorevertants, respectively. We also isolated 8 pseudorevertants with C1580G (ORF4/gVII Asn36Arg) and 10 ones with A3576C (ORF8/gI Glu104Ala) mutations. Because ORF9/PSB15 is an unknown protein and conserved among all <italic>Xanthomonas</italic> integrative filamentous phages, we chose to focus on the encapsidation roles of ORF9/PSB15 in this study.</p>

<title>PSB15 protein is required for viral assembly <italic>in trans</italic> but not phage DNA integration or replication</title>
<p>T340A/C341G mutations cause a drastic decrease in phage reproduction yield (∼10<sup>-4</sup> fold), measured by phage particle DNA copy numbers released in the medium (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, red). Suppressors T5291C (PSB15-T7A) and T5246C (PSB15-T22A) can rescue this assembly arrest phenotype, consistent with TP production results in our screening. PSB15 is conserved among <italic>Xanthomonas</italic> and <italic>Stenotrophomonas</italic> filamentous phages (24) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). However, its function has never been reported. Based on AlphaFold algorithm predictions, PSB15 contains 5 putative structure domains: N-terminal DUF3653 (AA 1-29), helix 1 (AA 30-58), linker (AA 59-68), helix 2 (AA 69-81), and a disordered C-terminal tail (AA 82-108) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>

<p>To confirm that the ORF9 product is a protein, rather than a non-coding RNA, and that it engages in encapsidation, the start codon of ORF9 was mutated in replicative form (RF) DNA (ϕLf-UK-ϕPSB15) and transformed into bacteria. The PSB15 protein expression in ϕLf-UK-ϕPSB15-transformed bacteria can not be detected (Figure S2). ϕLf-UK-ϕPSB15 phage reproduction was significantly reduced, and the plaque size was tiny (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), indicating that loss of PSB15 phenocopies ϕLf-UK PS mutations (Yeh et al., 2024). An <italic>in vivo</italic> complement assay showed that phage production of ϕLf-UK-ϕPSB15 can be fully rescued by co-transformation with pPSB15 plasmid (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, green), which ectopically expresses the PSB15 protein (Figure S2). Furthermore, the phage assembly defect caused by the PS mutant, T340A/C341G (T340A/C341G-ϕPSB15 RF transformants), can be rescued by ectopic expression of PSB15-T7A or -T22A, but not wild type (WT) PSB15 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, orange). Taken together, this and later data confirm that PSB15 protein is crucially involved in encapsidation as a <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor, and its amino acid T7A and T22A mutants are suppressors for the PS mutant.</p>
<p>We also found that integration of ϕLf-UK-ϕPSB15 into the host chromosome (<italic>att</italic>L and <italic>att</italic>R), intracellular RF dsDNA replication (<italic>att</italic>P), phage ssDNA, and coat protein synthesis (data not shown) remained unchanged (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>), indicating that PSB15 is not essential in these functions. Because the PSB15 protein can be detected in ϕLf-UK-infected cell lysate, but not in CsCl-purified virions, it appears not to be a structural or minor coat protein (Figure S2).</p>

<p>We sought to examine PSB15 and PS binding using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> shows that PSB15 can form a complex with PS oligonucleotides of all <italic>Xanthomonas</italic> filamentous phages (ϕLf-UK/ ϕLf, Xf109, Cf1c/XacF1, ϕLf2, Cf2, ϕXv2, and XaF13) with similar equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>d,app</sub> =10.2 ± 1.1 to 13.4 ± 2.1 nM, Table S1). PSB15 was unable to bind to PS(-) oligonucleotide (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>), poly(A)<sub>25</sub>, poly(T)<sub>25</sub>, poly(C)<sub>25</sub>, or poly(G)<sub>25</sub> (Table S1), indicating that binding is sequence specific. The specificity of PS-PSB15 complex was also demonstrated by a supershift generated by anti-PSB15 antibody, but not by the control antibody (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). No intermediate band suggested a highly cooperative mode of interaction between PSB15 and PS DNA.</p>
<p>Furthermore, PS stem (fStem) and loop mutants (fLoop, T340A/C341G, C344G) failed to bind to PSB15 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). We also tested other PS mutants listed in Table S1. Our data demonstrate that the consensus sequence for encapsidation [GGX(A/-)CCG(C/T)G in the stem and T340, C344 in the loop] is also essential for the PS binding to PSB15 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>

<title>DNA binding properties and essential motifs of PSB15</title>
<p>Alignment of the N-terminal DUF3653 domain of <italic>Xanthomonas</italic> and <italic>Stenotrophomonas</italic> filamentous phages reveals three conserved motifs (<sup>6</sup>LTG, <sup>10</sup>WAGFXF, and <sup>22</sup>TPE) at a ϕ hairpin structure seen in AlphaFold. Suppressors T7A and T22A are located at the LTG and TPE motif, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>). This formulated the hypothesis that LTG/WAGFXF/TPE is the PS DNA binding motif. To test this, we purified recombinant PSB15 mutants with alanine substitutions (LTG/3A, WAGF/4A, TPE/3A, F15A, T7A, T22A). For comparison, we also prepared PSB15 mutants in other domains (Supplemental Figure S3). EMSA showed that mutations in LTG/3A, WAGF/4A, TPE/3A, and F15A, but not other domains, completely abolished PS DNA binding (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>, and 5C), suggesting that LTG/WAGFXF/TPE contains the DNA binding motif. Suppressors T7A and T22A showed distinct properties because they were able to bind to PS(-) and canonical PS DNA with similar affinity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref> and Table S2). These results not only indicate that T7 and T22 contribute to PS DNA binding specificity, but also explain why T7A and T22A can rescue phage assembly arrest.</p>

<p>To identify the direct DNA binding site, recombinant PSB15 protein was UV cross-linked with <sup>32</sup>P-labeled PS DNA ([<sup>32</sup>P]PS probe). Followed by nuclease digestion, PSB15 was radiolabeled by the [<sup>32</sup>P]PS probe under UV irradiation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). After trypsin digestion, radiolabeled PSB15 peptides were separated by reverse phase HPLC and analyzed by Edman degradation sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Merrill et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Williams and Konigsberg, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Prasad et al., 1993</xref>; Katsuki et l., 2005). A radiolabeled peptide with an amino acid sequence of T<underline>LTG</underline>P<underline>WAGFS<bold>X</bold></underline>QGGHLI<underline>TPE</underline>GR, corresponding to amino acid 5 to 26 with LTG/WAGFXF/TPE motifs, was identified. Moreover, the recovery yield of phenylthiohydantoin (PTH)-phenylalanine was drastically reduced to 2.3% in cycle 11 (F15), indicating that F15 is the direct contact residue crosslinking to the PS DNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). This result is also consistent with F15A abolishing PS binding (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>, 2F, and 2H).</p>
<p>Several hydrogen bonds within or between the <sup>6</sup>LTG/<sup>10</sup>WAGFXF/<sup>22</sup>TPE motifs (e.g. G8-A11, W10-F13, W10-T7, F13-L6, T22-E24, T22-R26) were predicted by AlphaFold. These bonds appear to be critical to form the PSB15 ϕ hairpin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). We took advantage of tryptophan 10 (W10) being located within the immediate vicinity of the direct DNA binding site, F15 (<bold><sup>10</sup>W</bold>AGFX<bold><sup>15</sup>F</bold>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Tryptophan is most strongly influenced by the polarity of its local microenvironment, so it can serve as an unlabeled fluorescence sensor for detecting changes in its exposure to solvent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Ghisaidoobe and Chung, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fernández et al., 2016</xref>). This allows us to verify PS DNA binding properties of PSB15 using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. PSB15 contains three tryptophan residues (W10, W35, and W46). Two alanine substitutions at W35 and W46 in helix 1 of WT PSB15 protein [WT(2(WA)] did not affect DNA binding (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2H</xref>, Table S2). Therefore, recombinant WT(2WA) protein was used to detect tryptophan fluorescence changes of the WAGFXF motif after binding to PS DNA. Following excitation at 295 nm, where the tyrosine absorption is negligible, the emission spectra of WT(2WA) showed a maximum (λ<sub>max</sub>) at 360 nm. λ<sub>max</sub> was blue-shifted to 351 nm upon PS DNA binding, and fluorescence intensity significantly increased (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). This data suggests that DNA binding caused the movement of W10 to the less polar inner core of the hydrophobic cavity of PSB15. This spectral change is specific to the PSB15-PS DNA interaction, because λ<sub>max</sub> and intensity were neither changed with PS(-) DNA (λ<sub>max</sub> =360 nm, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>) nor with F15A(2WA) protein (λ<sub>max</sub> =358 nm, data not shown), in both conditions where no DNA binding occurred. Taken together, we conclude that PS DNA binding affects the tertiary structure of the <sup>10</sup>WAGFXF motif.</p>
<p>Since T7 may interact with W10 via hydrogen bonding, we further tested our hypothesis that T7A alters PS binding specificity due to its influence with WAGFXF motif (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The T7A(2WA) protein has a comparable DNA binding affinity and specificity as T7A (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>, 2H, and Table S2). T7A(2WA) λ<sub>max</sub> was 358 nm. In contrast to WT(2WA), there was no wavelength shift regardless of DNA binding (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Importantly, both PS and PS(-) DNA caused a similar increase of the W10 fluorescence of T7A(2WA), preserving the intensity gap observed between the curves in both figures (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3G</xref>). This data suggests that T7 in the LTG motif contributes to the conformational change of the WAGFXF motif upon DNA interaction, which is essential to recognize the specific PS elements or exclude binding to PS(-).</p>

<p>PSB15 contains a hydrophobic linker (A55-L68), Arg/Lys-rich helix 2 (R69-G81), and Pro/Arg/Lys-rich C-terminal tail (AA L82-V108) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, 4D, 4E, and 5A). Because both the helix 2 and C-terminal tail are very basic, the isoelectric points of PSB15 proteins are estimated within the range of 10.47 to 11.35. The prominent feature of Pro/Arg/Lys-rich sequences is also found in the putative translocation motif (TrM) for <italic>Xanthomonas</italic> type III effector proteins (e.g. XopB, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>), which is required for their association with bacterial membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Prochaska et al., 2018</xref>). To investigate the membrane binding properties of PSB15, we generated substitution mutations of conserved residues in the linker (A63D; <sup>65</sup>VIYL → DDDD, named “VIYL/4D”), helix 2 (D70A; <sup>73</sup>RKRQEKK→ AAAQEAA, named “H-RK/5A”), and C-terminal tail (<sup>102</sup>RRRKGRV→ AAAAGAV, named “T-RK/5A”) in pPBS15 plasmid (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>). Ectopically expressed linker (A63D and VIYL/4D), D70A, and F15A proteins can be detected in the IM fraction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). However, loss of basic residues (H-RK/5A and T-RK/5A) resulted in the failure of PSB15 targeting to the IM. Our results indicate that the basic helix 2 and the C-terminal tail are PSB15 membrane binding motifs.</p>
<p>Our data also led to the next hypothesis that PSB15 helix 2 and the C-terminal tail interact with the negatively charged membrane surface. It has been shown that <italic>Xanthomonas</italic> membranes are rich in an anionic phospholipid, cardiolipin (CL), which carries two negative charges at physiological pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Moser et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Prochaska et al., 2018</xref>). The direct binding of PSB15 with phospholipids was tested by mixing recombinant PSB15 with liposomes (small unilamellar vesicles, SUVs) in different combinations of phospholipids (phosphatidylethanolamine, PE; phosphocholine, PC; phosphatidylglycerol, PG; and CL). Liposome flotation assay was used to separate SUV-bound and free PSB15 by a step sucrose gradient. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref> shows that PSB15 was bound to SUVs (upper) with composition similar to the native <italic>Xanthomonas</italic> membrane (PE: PG: CL: PC=52%: 13%: 30%: 5%, “native” SUVs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Moser et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Prochaska et al., 2018</xref>). PSB15 can bind to liposomes with CL (PE: CL= 50%: 50% and PC: CL= 50%: 50%), but not with negatively charged PG (PE: PG: PC=40%: 40%: 20%), indicating that CL is the lipid-binding target. Binding affinity between PSB15 and native SUVs was estimated as K<sub>d,app</sub> 2.3 ± 0.3 μM. A similar binding affinity of GFP-PSB15 and FM4-64-labled native SUVs, measured by fluorescence, was estimated with K<sub>d,app</sub> (2.5 ± 0.4 μM, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4J</xref>, Supplemental Table S3). Mutations of the linker (A63D, VIYL/4D), D70A or the N-terminus did not affect SUV binding, but both H-RK/5A and T-RK/5A lost their lipid-binding activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4J</xref>, Table S3). We concluded that Arg/Lys residues in the helix 2 and C-terminal tail are essential to target PSB15 to the membrane domain by binding to CL.</p>

<title>PSB15 targets phage DNA to the IM</title>
<p>Because PSB15 binds to both PS DNA and the IM at different domains, we tested the hypothesis that PSB15 recruits phage DNA to the membrane. pPSB15 mutant plasmids were transformed into bacteria, followed by ϕLf-UK-ϕPSB15 phage infection. The IM was fractionated and collected, followed by formaldehyde cross-linking and chromatin immunoprecipitation using anti-PSB15 antibody. After PCR amplification, the antibody-precipitated phage DNA was able to be detected in PSB15 WT, A63D, VIYL/4D, and D70A, but not in H-RK/5A-, T-RK/5A-, and F15A-expressing cells. This result indicates that lipid- and DNA-binding domains are required for PSB15 targeting phage DNA to the IM. Moreover, mutants in each domain failed to rescue assembly arrest of ϕLf-UK-ϕPSB15 (Table S2). We concluded that IM targeting of PSB15 and PS DNA is an essential checkpoint for phage assembly.</p>

<title>Thioredoxin binds to and releases PSB15-PS DNA complex from the lipid membrane</title>
<p>Thioredoxin (Trx) is the only known host protein essential for Ff assembly to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Russel and Model, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lim et al., 1985</xref>). Without Trx, coat protein accumulates in the IM, but particle extrusion from the cell is abolished (Russel, M. and Model, 1983). However, Trx’s function in phage assembly has not been well defined since then. Russel and Model showed genetic evidence that <italic>trxA</italic> mutations of <italic>E. coli</italic> (Pro34, Gly74, Pro76, Gly92) can still participate in redox reactions but did not support Ff phage assembly. They also suggested that Trx can interact with thioredoxin reductase and phage assembly machinery dually on the same surface site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Russel and Model, 1986</xref>). We found that Xcc-TcR bacteria with TrxA G93D mutation also failed to support ϕLF-UK phage assembly (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). The essential role of both PSB15 and Trx in phage packaging prompted us to examine their interaction. We expressed recombinant GST-tagged <italic>Xanthomonas campestris</italic> TrxA and its G93D mutant (mimic to Ff assembly mutant G92D) in <italic>E. coli</italic> and purified them in a glutathione affinity Sepharose column. After mixing purified TrxA and PSB15, the protein complex was pulled down using glutathione resin. WT PSB15 can be co-pulled down with GST-TrxA, but not with GST-TrxA G93D mutant (white arrowhead, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>), indicating that <italic>Xanthomonas</italic> TrxA G93 residue is critical for its direct binding to PSB15. We further mapped the TrxA binding site(s) of PSB15. A63D, VIYL/4D and D70A mutants failed to bind to TrxA, while the TrxA binding ability of R69A, DNA-binding (LTG/3A, WAGF/4A, TPE/3A, F15A) and lipid-binding (H-RK/5A, T-RK/5A) mutants were comparable to WT. This data indicates that the hydrophobic linker and D70 are essential for TrxA binding, whose interaction is also essential to support phage assembly (Table S2).</p>

<p>TrxA-binding mutants A63D, VIYL/4D, and D70A can still bind to PS DNA (Table S2) and the lipid membrane (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4J</xref>). Therefore PS DNA-, membrane-, and TrxA-binding are at different PSB15 domains. We next tested if PSB15 can interact with TrxA and PS DNA simultaneously. GST-TrxA can form a complex with PS DNA and PSB15-WT or lipid-binding mutants (H-RK/5A and T-RK/5A), as evident by a supershift band caused by anti-GST antibody (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). In contrast, anti-GST antibody did not retard the PSB15-PS DNA complex with GST-TrxA G93D or PSB15 TrxA-binding mutants (A63D, VIYL/4D, D70A). Negative control shows that neither TrxA nor anti-GST antibody alone was able to form a complex with PS DNA, confirming that the supershift is dependent on TrxA binding to PSB15. Moreover, TrxA binding did not affect PSB15-PS binding affinity (K<sub>d,app</sub> 12.2 ± 1.3 nM). Taken together, our data supported that TrxA and PS DNA can bind to different domains of PSB15 as a complex.</p>
<p>Because TrxA-binding sites of PSB15 (A63-D70) are adjacent to the lipid-binding domain (R73-K79 in basic helix 2) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>), it seems reasonable to hypothesize that TrxA binding affects PSB15 association with the lipid membrane. This guided the investigation of their interaction. Recombinant TrxA was mixed with PSB15 and native SUVs in a flotation assay. TrxA was not detected with SUVs, indicating that neither lipid nor PSB15 recruited TrxA to the membrane (data not shown). However, SUVs-bound WT PSB15 or F15A levels were reduced as TrxA input concentration increased (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Membrane-bound PSB15 was unchanged when incubated with TrxA binding mutants (A63D, VIYL/4D, D70A) or TrxA G93D. This indicates that TrxA binding releases PSB15 from SUVs. The fluorescence intensity of recombinant GFP-PSB15 was also reduced in association with FM4-64-labeled native SUVs at increasing concentration of TrxA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>).</p>
<p>The possibility that the PSB15-PS DNA complex can also be released together by TrxA from liposomes was also tested. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref> shows a concentration response curve for SUV-bound, FITC-labeled PS DNA decreasing in the presence of TrxA, but not TrxA G93D or PSB15 VIYL/4D. In addition, the response curves show no difference when TrxA was added simultaneously with or after PSB15-PS bound to SUVs (data not shown). Taken together, these findings support the idea that TrxA dissociates the PSB15-PS DNA complex from the phospholipid membrane <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

<title>Trx and DNA binding facilitate PSB15 dissociation <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>Our results led to the hypothesis that Trx can regulate PSB15 dynamics at the IM. To date, there is very little literature about the direct observation of filamentous phage proteins in bacteria using live cell imaging. In order to explore <italic>in vivo</italic> behavior of PSB15, we visualized ϕLf-UK-GFP-PSB15 phage-infected cells using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, which typically only penetrates samples up to 100 nm, and minimizes photobleaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Axelrod, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Johnson and Vert, 2017</xref>).

Although the fluorescence intensity of GFP-PSB15 puncta fluctuated after it reached a plateau, the dwell time of each punctum from multiple cells can be combined to produce a robust mean value (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, movies S1). The mean dwell time was calculated to be approximately 8.23 ± 1.30 s from WT PSB15 puncta (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). We then tested whether TrxA existence or binding could affect PSB15 behavior <italic>in vivo</italic>. Either loss of TrxA binding activity (A63D) or in Xcc-TcR TrxA G93D bacteria did not interfere with the localization of PSB15 at the poles (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). However, the mean dwell time of PSB15 puncta was more than 50 s in both conditions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>, movies S2 and S3).</p>

We further tested this hypothesis by using ϕLf-UK-GFP-PSB15-T7A or PS(-)-GFP-PSB15-T7A phages, where T7A was shown to bind to PS and PS(-) DNA at indistinguishable kinetics (Table S2). T7A punctae showed a similar dwelling time (9.23 ± 1.81 s and 8.98 ± 1.60 s, respectively) between both PS and PS(-), and both were comparable to PSB15-WT with PS (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6E</xref>, movies S6 and S7).

<title>Discussions</title>
<p>Encapsidation of asymmetric filamentous phage particles is a highly ordered reaction, which starts with the targeting of viral ssDNAs to the IM, where the coat proteins are located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wickner and Killick, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Russel, 1991</xref>). Our findings provide the first evidence of a phage assembly checkpoint that ensures membrane conditions are favorable for phage assembly to proceed. This checkpoint is controlled by a nonstructural phage protein, PSB15. PSB15 targets PS DNA to the IM for efficient assembly <italic>in trans</italic>, which has not been reported in coliphages or other filamentous phages. Previously, Hasse et al. reported that the M13 pV-phage DNA complex, but not pV alone, is targeted to pI/pXI in the liposome <italic>in vitro</italic> (Hasse et al. 2022). The Ff PS appears to load onto pI/pXI machinery, where it uses the platform to bind to pVII/pIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Russel 1991</xref>; Dotto and Zinder, 1991; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Grant and Webster, 1984a</xref>; Grant, R.A. and Webster, 1984b). We found that the integrative filamentous phages PS plays a more active roles in IM targeting/dissociation via PSB15 and Trx. It serves as a critical checkpoint that most likely occurs prior to the addition of coat proteins. Failure of this accurate virion formation quality control mechanism causes the arrest of assembly reactions.</p>
<p>Our current working model of the phage assembly checkpoint is illustrated in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>. PSB15 increases the concentration of viral ssDNAs by targeting them to the pole of the IM (the “priming” site), thus facilitating virion production by increasing the rates of intermolecular assembly reactions. Viral coat proteins contain information essential for specific assembly, but accurate encapsidation usually also requires scaffolding or chaperon proteins from the hosts or the viruses themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Palucha et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dearborn et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mateu 2013</xref>). PSB15 targeting the phage DNA to the IM is a highly active checkpoint enabling loading of the priming site. Other protein factors may also restrict or regulate the number of interactions in which viral nucleic acids and coat proteins are involved, such as in the formation of the “initiation complex” proposed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Feng et al., 1999</xref>). Once this checkpoint is satisfied, PSB15-phage DNA is released from the priming site by Trx, and phage DNA is loaded on the pI export complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Haase et al., 2022</xref>). Finally, other coat proteins (pVII, pVIII and pIII/pVI) are added during egress to generate mature viral particles. The possibility of PSB15 and thioredoxin being involved in (1) coat protein transitions from their IM-embedded to structural virion forms, and (2) the release of phage particles, still requires further investigation.</p>

<caption><p>Working model of filamentous phage assembly and its checkpoint control. PSB15 efficiently targets phage DNA to the IM through PS binding at the priming site in the cell pole. Other essential factors (chaperons, scaffolding factors etc.) may participate in the prerequisite reactions and/or the formation of the “initiation complex” to satisfy the assembly checkpoint. Once the checkpoint is satisfied, Trx releases PSB15 and phage DNA from the priming site, then phage DNA is loaded to pI export complex. pV is replaced by major coat protein pVIII, driven by ATP hydrolysis of pI. Virus particles assemble and pass through the OM (likely via the host secretin complex, such as type II secretion system T2SS). pVI and pIII are added to terminate the assembly process, and virions are released out of the host. The structures were illustrated based on AlphaFold or PDB as the following: PSB15 (Uniport: Q8P905), pIII (Uniport: Q3BSR6), pVI (Uniport: Q3BSR8), pVII (Uniport: Q3BSR4), pVIII (PDB:2IFO), thioredoxin (PDB: 2TRX), phage (PDB: 2IFO, 8B3P, 8B3O, 8IXK, 8IXL). Both ends of phage are adopted from f1 and M13 phage structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Conners et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jia and Xiang, 2023</xref>).</p></caption>

<p>Both Ff and <italic>Xanthomonas</italic> phage PS are DNA harpin structures, and their mutations cause tiny plaques to form at high frequencies, generating pseudorevertants with near normal sized plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Russel and Model, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Yeh et al., 2023</xref>). It is worthy to note that the PS(-) sequence still maintains the consensus stem sequence (GGCACCGCG), but contains T340G/C344G mutations in the loop. PSB15 T7A and T22A can bind to PS(-) as interaction suppressors, and T7A can rescue PSB15 dwelling time to the WT dwelling time. Therefore, we speculate that T7A and T22A mutants appear to relieve the stringency of binding specificity and packaging constraints at the loop of T340 and C344. AlphaFold prediction suggested that T7 and W10 interact with each other via a hydrogen bond (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Our intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence data also reflected that the hydrophobicity and microenvironment of W10 residue is affected by PS DNA binding. T7 may participate in DNA binding specificity via a change of the WAGFXF motif conformation.</p>
<p>It has been shown that the XafT protein of the <italic>Vibrio</italic> TLCΦ phage, with both helix-turn-helix XRE and DUF3653 domains, is involved in XerC/D-mediated phage DNA integration by interacting with and activating XerD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Midonet et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Miele et al., 2022</xref>). Because the helix-turn-helix XRE is a DNA binding domain, whether the XafT C-terminal DUF3653 domain directly binds to DNA remains unclear. In <italic>Xanthomonas</italic> and <italic>Stenotrophomonas</italic> phages, XRE HTH and DUF3653 are encoded by two independent ORFs in the negative strand. The DUF3653 domain is located at the N-terminus of PSB15. In contrat to XafT, loss of PSB15 does not affect phage DNA integration efficiency, indicating that PSB15 and its DUF3653 domain are nonessential for XerC/D recombination. On the other hand, we confirmed that PS DNA binds directly at F15 in the DUF3653 domain. Since our attempt to search for PSB15 DNA binding sites via the mass spectrometry method was unsuccessful, other possible DNA binding site(s) cannot be completely ruled out yet. Whether other hundreds of DUF3653 domain-containing proteins from 51 bacterial species are involved in either XerC/D recombination or phage assembly needs further investigation.</p>
<p>TrxA function and its binding protein(s) in Ff phage assembly have not been well studied in 40 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Russel and Model, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Russel and Model, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Russel and Model, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lim et al., 1985</xref>). It has been proposed that Trx may confer processivity by stripping pV off of the DNA and replacing it with the major coat protein, pVIII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Russel, 1991</xref>). Ff gI missense mutations can grow on <italic>E. coli</italic> hosts containing certain <italic>trx</italic>A missense mutations, suggesting that pI and Trx genetically interact. However, their physical binding has never been documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Russel and Model, 1983</xref>). Here we reported the first evidence that PSB15 can bind to TrxA, working together as a control assembly checkpoint. Trx binding is not required for the targeting of PSB15 to the IM or cell poles, but it is essential for the timely release of PSB15 from the membrane <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Both the C-terminus and the basic helix 2 residues are required for binding to the negatively charged cardiolipin of the IM, likely via electrostatic interactions. The isoelectric point value of <italic>Xanthomonas</italic> TrxA is 5.17. Since TrxA’s binding site is adjacent to basic helix 2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>), TrxA binding may neutralize the positive charges of basic helix 2 and interfere with the PSB15-cardiolipin interaction. Given the fact that both PS- and Trx-binding activity facilitate membrane release of PSB15 <italic>in vivo</italic>, identification of PSB15- and Trx-binding protein(s) will help us understand the mechanism of assembly checkpoint control.</p>
<p>Along with PSB15: gVII, gI, and ORF11 genetically interact with the PS. The characterization of gVII, gI, and ORF11 suppressors and their functions are currently underway. It is worthy to note that mutations to either the PS or these assembly proteins in Ff and <italic>Xanthomonas</italic> phages significantly reduce, but do not completely terminate, viral assembly. Whether or not these virions are packaged via an alternative pathway (e.g. pV targets the phage DNA directly to pI/pXI) requires further exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Haase et al., 2022</xref>).</p>

To test TrxA effect on PSB15/DNA complex binding to SUVs, 0.1 to 100 µM of GST-thioredoxin was included in the mixtures prior to flotation. 50 µL of liposome fractions were collected and labeled with 10 µM amphiphilic styryl dye FM4-64 (ThermoFisher Scientific T13320) for 10 min at room temperature. The liposome was pelleted in TN buffer and resuspended with 200 µL TN buffer. The samples were loaded on a 96 well plate (BD), and the fluorescence intensity was read in a SpectraMax Gemini EM plate reader (Molecular Device) at 25 °C with settings as the following: GFP-PSB15 and FITC-labeled PS oligonucleotide (Excitation: 488 nm, Emission: 520 nm, cutoff: 515 nm), and FM4-64-labled SUVs (Excitation: 505 nm, Emission: 725 nm, cutoff: 630 nm). The fluoresce intensity of GFP-PSB15 and the FITC-PS oligonucleotide were normalized with FM4-64-labled SUVs. The apparent binding constant constants (K<sub>d, app</sub>) for the interaction of PSB15 with liposomes were calculated (Xu et al., 2012).</p>

<title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation</title>
<p>pPSB15 mutant plasmids were transformed in Xcc-TcR. After grown at 28°C for 18 hours, bacteria were infected with ϕLf-UK-ϕPSB15 phage for 6 hours at 28°C. After IM was isolated as above, PSB15 protein and phage DNA were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde, incubating for 15 min at 28°C. The cross-linking reaction was quenched by 0.125 M glycine and incubated for 5 min at 28°C. DNA was sheared with six cycles of 20 s pulses at 30% of maximum power with intermittent cooling on ice for 30 s using Branson’s M2800 ultrasonic bath sonicator. PSB15-DNA samples were incubated with 2 μg anti-PSB15 antibody and the mixture was rotated overnight at 4°C. The samples were mixed with 30 μl ChIP-grade protein A/G plus agarose beads (1: 1 slurry, ThermoFisher Scientific 26159) for 1 hour at 4°C. After several washes, the cross-linking was reversed by boiling and recovering from beads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gade and Kalvakolanu, 2012</xref>). Phage DNA samples were amplified by PCR with primers (5’-GCCGCAGAGAAGATCCAAAAGAAC-3’ and 5’-GGAAATACCACGCACCACGGAAG-3’) and analyzed in 1% 0.5 × TBE agarose gel. The cytoplasmic pool of ϕLf-UK-ϕPSB15 phage RF DNA was PCR amplified as the control.</p>

<p>DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by IDT. Binding between the 20 ng DNA oligonucleotides and 1 μg PSB15 proteins was carried out in a final volume of 15 μl in the DNA binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM BME, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml BSA) for 30 min at 25°C. In the “supershift” experiment, 1 μg antibody was included in the binding reaction. 1.5 or 2 % agarose gel solutions (50 mL total volumes) were prepared with agarose powder (Bio-Rad) using 0.5× TBE buffer (45 mM Tris, 45 mM boric acid, 1 mM EDTA) and was then poured into a taped 7 ×10 cm tray. Samples were run in 0.5× TBE buffer at 150V for 10 or 15 mins. After electrophoresis, gels were stained in 50 mL SYBR Gold (ThermoFisher Scientific) in 0.5× TBE buffer (1:5000 dilution) for 40 minutes, followed by destaining in 200 mL 0.5× TBE buffer for 15 minutes with shaking.

<title>Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy</title>
<p>pGII-transformed Xcc-TcR was grown until OD<sub>600</sub>=0.5 and infected by ϕLf-UK-GFP-PSB15 or PS(-)-GFP-PSB15 phage at a multiplicity of infection of 1 for 30 min. Bacterial IM was labeled by FM 4-64 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fishov and Woldringh, 1999</xref>). 200 μl of bacteria was stained with 4 µM FM 4-64 in the medium for 20 min. 4 μl of bacteria was mixed with 80 μl melted agarose (1.5% BD AgarPlaque agarose in 1×phosphate-buffered saline), dropped on a Superfrost Plus precleaned glass slide (Fisher 1255015), and then immediately covered with a Gold Seal cover glass (24×60 mm, 0.13 mm thickness) (ThermoFisher Scientific). The samples were kept in the dark and at room temperature for 20 minutes before imaging. TIRF and epifluorescence images were acquired with an Olympus IX83 inverted microscope equipped with a cellTIRF-4Line module and an Olympus 1.49 numerical aperture 100× Uapo objective. The laser intensity settings on the main laser module were 30 mW for 488 nm (LuxX, Omicron, Germany). A fluorescence filter cube containing a polychroic beamsplitter (R405/488/561/647, Semrock) and a quad-band emission/blocking filter (FF01 446/523/600/695, Semrock) was used. Fluorescence images were captured at 1 Hz frame rates for 30 to 60 seconds using a Hammamatsu ImagEM X2 EM-CCD camera.</p>

<title>Image analysis</title>
<p>The fluorescence emission intensity of each punctum was measured by the maximum intensity from the region of interest (ROI). The maximum intensity from each molecule was measured by first circling a ROI around the molecule. MetaMorph imaging software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) was used to automatically select the brightest pixel from each ROI and subtract the average background intensity from each image. The raw image data in each frame of the movie was analyzed with ImageJ using a GDSC SMLM plugin, which can determine the position of fluorescent molecules with sub-resolution precision (typically ∼&lt;30 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Etheridge et al., 2022</xref>). For dwell-time analysis, the start of each event in ROI was marked by an abrupt increase (&gt; 10 A.U.) in the fluorescence signal, whereas the end of each event was marked by an abrupt decrease in the fluorescence signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Asbury, 2016</xref>). Selecting the start and end of each event yielded the dwell time of each event, which was plotted in a histogram.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work describes a new protein factor required for filamentous phage assembly. The protein PSB15 binds to the packaging signal of the ssDNA, Trx and cardiolipin. A mechanism how the phage DNA is targeted to the assembly site in the bacterial inner membrane is discussed.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The work describes a clever way to detect factors required for phage propagation by looking at the plaque size of pseudorevertants that arise after infection of a phage with a directed mutation in the packaging signal. This led to the detection of a phage protein expressed from ORF9, the PSB15.</p>
<p>The authors convincingly show that PSB15 is expressed in infected cells and can complement a phage with a mutated orf9.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Given the fact that the phage LF-UK is not well explored, many open questions should be mentioned in the introduction. For the study, it is important to know if the phageLF-UK has a mimick or homolog of gV and gXI, and if not, whether PSB15 could take their role.</p>
<p>I am not convinced of the proposition of their term &quot;checkpoint&quot;. The truth is that the authors do not know the real purpose of PSB15. I do not see an advantage for a checkpoint that only adds an additional step to enter the phage assembly site. There must be a biochemical reason for the action of PSB15. Looking at Figure 7, the step from &quot;Release&quot; to &quot;Loading&quot; is just adding many unknowns, e.g. how to transfer the DNA, how to dispose of PSB15 and Trx? Also, in the previous step are three question marks that do not add any solid information.</p>
<p>The in vivo study of subcellular localization is very questionable. Why is there a single fluorescent dot if there are thousands of PSB15 molecules expressed in the cell? I have my doubts that the conclusions the authors make here are correct and meaningful. The movies do not add anything significant.</p>

<p>Secretion of the prototypical F-associated filamentous phage (Ff) of E. coli depends on the selective binding of a hairpin (the packaging signal, PS) by two phage encoded protein, pVII and pIX. PVII and pIX target the PS to IM channels formed by pI and pIV. However, integrative filamentous phages lack a homologue of pIX and pIV, and many of them also lack a homologue of pVII, raising questions on the assembly and secretion of new phages. In the manuscript, Yueh et al. present the identification of a phage-encoded protein, PSB15, which binds to the PS signal of a Xanthomonas integrative filamentous phage, ΦLf-UK. They showed that PSB15 is required for viral assembly and is conserved in several other integrative filamentous phages. They further analyzed how PSB15 binds to PS and demonstrated that it associates to the IM, which targets phage DNA to it. Finally, they show that thioredoxin, the only host protein that was found to be essential for Ff secretion, interacts with PSB15 and releases the PSB15-PS complex from the IM. These results are important because they elucidate a major step in the secretion of integrative filamentous phage, and the role of thioredoxin on filamentous phage secretion in general.</p>
<p>I found the data and interpretation convincing. However, the presentation and description are confusing in places because the reader has to juggle between figures. A scheme depicting what is known and unknown in the integration of Ff phages and interactive filamentous phages in the introduction would be useful to the general reader.</p>
