<title>Abstract</title><p><italic>Saprolegnia parasitica</italic> (<italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic>) is one of the most virulent oomycete species in freshwater aquatic environments, causing severe saprolegniasis and leading to significant economic losses in the aquaculture industry. Thus far, the prevention and control of saprolegniasis face a shortage of medications. Linalool, a natural antibiotic alternative found in various essential oils, exhibits promising antimicrobial activity against a wide range of pathogens. In this study, the specific role of linalool in protecting <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> infection at both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> levels was investigated. Linalool showed multifaceted anti-oomycetes potential by both of antimicrobial efficacy and immunomodulatory efficacy. For <italic>in vitro</italic> test, linalool exhibited strong anti-oomycetes activity and mode of action included: (1) Linalool disrupted the cell membrane of the mycelium, causing the intracellular components leak out; (2) Linalool prohibited ribosome function, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis and ultimately affecting mycelium growth. Surprisingly, meanwhile we found the potential immune protective mechanism of linalool in the <italic>in vivo</italic> test: (1) Linalool enhanced the complement and coagulation system which in turn activated host immune defense and lysate <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> cells; (2) Linalool promoted wound healing, tissue repair, and phagocytosis to cope with <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> infection; (3) Linalool positively modulated the immune response by increasing the abundance of beneficial Actinobacteriota; (4) Linalool stimulated the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines to lyse <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> cells. In all, our findings showed that linalool possessed multifaceted anti-oomycetes potential which would be a promising natural antibiotic alternative to cope with <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> infection in the aquaculture industry.</p>

<label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Saprolegniasis is one of the most serious oomycete diseases in the aquaculture industry all over the world, infecting a wide host range (fish, crustaceans, amphibians, and their eggs.) with a conspicuous symptom (grayish-white cotton wool-like covering on the surface of host)<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]</sup>. Oomycete infections lead to significant economic losses and serious damage to natural ecosystems<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]</sup>. As the infection intensifies, saprolegniasis can cause muscle ulceration, compromised immune system, respiratory problems, secondary infection, and finally result in host death<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]</sup>. <italic>Saprolegnia</italic>, <italic>Achlya</italic>, and <italic>Leptolegnia</italic> are key pathogens responsible for Saprolegniasis outbreaks<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]</sup>, among them, <italic>Saprolegnia</italic> is proven to be the most virulent<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]</sup>. <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic>, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>ferax</italic>, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>delica</italic>, and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>diclina</italic> are the main pathogens causing saprolegniasis<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]</sup>, as a highly virulent group belonging to the phylum Oomycota, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> serves as the primary species in fish infections<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]</sup>.</p>
<p>In the past, malachite green was highly effective in controlling <italic>saprolegnia</italic> infections, however, it has been banned worldwide for its carcinogenic and toxicological effects, which led to a sharp re-emergence of <italic>Saprolegnia</italic> infections in aquaculture industry<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]</sup>. Recently, various methods have been established to deal with <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> infections, mainly including physical (water quality management, temperature control, and so on), chemical (hydrogen peroxide, natural antimicrobial compounds, and so on), and biological (probiotics, antagonistic microbe, and so on) methods<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]</sup>. Among these, antibiotics have served as the primary therapeutic and prophylactic tools for Saprolegniasis management in aquaculture. However, their overuse and abuse have resulted in antibiotic resistance among various aquatic pathogens<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]</sup>. Therefore, the increasing need for sustainable and eco-friendly strategies to combat <italic>saprolegnia</italic> infections has driven research into natural antimicrobial agents, due to their advantages in terms of avoiding antibiotic resistance issues, health safety, and ecological sustainability<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Plant extracts regulate specific and non-specific immunity, promoting immune responses and playing a crucial role in improving production performance, enhancing antioxidant capacity, combating viruses, preventing diseases, and improving gut health<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]</sup>. This immunomodulatory function is mainly attributed to the secondary metabolites found in plants, such as flavonoids, polysaccharides, lactones, alkaloids, diterpenoids, and glycosides. These secondary metabolites can not only directly enhance immune capacity but also balance the gut microbiota and strengthen the intestinal mucosal barrier. After ingestion, plant extracts improve the immune defense mechanisms of intestinal epithelial cells, resist diseases caused by pathogenic microorganisms, and effectively enhance the body’s resistance to pathogen infections<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]</sup>. In our earlier studies, the anti-oomycetes activities of 12 plant essential oils (EOs) and 5 of their major compounds (linalool, pinene, limonene, myrcene, and terpinene) were evaluated, and we found that linalool was one of the strongest anti-oomycetes compounds and selected for further study<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]</sup>. Linalool, a monoterpene alcohol found in various EOs, has shown promising antimicrobial activity against a wide range of pathogens<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]</sup>. Our groups and other research teams have reported that linalool exhibits antimicrobial activity against bacteria such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic><sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]</sup>, <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic><sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]</sup>, <italic>Elizabethkingia miricola</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic><sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]</sup>, <italic>Pseudomonas fragi</italic><sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]</sup>, <italic>staphylococcus aureus</italic><sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]</sup>, <italic>Brochothrix thermosphacta</italic><sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]</sup> and <italic>Aeromonas hydrophila</italic><sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]</sup>, as well as against oomycetes like <italic>Colletotrichum lagenarium</italic><sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]</sup> and <italic>Phytophthora capsici</italic><sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]</sup>, and fungi including <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic><sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]</sup>, <italic>Penicillium citrinum</italic>, <italic>Chaetomium globosum</italic><sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]</sup>, <italic>Colletotrichum gloesporioides</italic>, <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic><sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]</sup>, <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic><sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]</sup> and <italic>Candida albicans</italic><sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]</sup>.</p>
<p>In our previous study, we found that linalool exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against <italic>S</italic>. <italic>ferax</italic><sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]</sup>, while whether it is also a promising agent against <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic>, another key virulent pathogen for <italic>Saprolegniasis</italic>is is still unknown, and the detailed mechanism, especially the <italic>in vivo</italic> immune mechanism induced by linalool remains poorly understood. Thus, in this study we focused on <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> and aimed to investigate the specific role of linalool in protecting <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> infection at both of <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> level by using different technologies, including <italic>in situ</italic> fluorescence observation, microstructure observation, Molecular Docking, AlphaFold2, transcriptome profiling, histological examinations, gut microbiota analysis, and deep bioinformatics analysis. We believe this study will shed light on the antimicrobial activity and mode of action of linalool against <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic>, and contribute to the development of novel antibiotic alternative strategies to cope with <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> infection in aquaculture industry.</p>

</fig>
<p>After adding 5 μL of resazurin dye, when the color of the wells turned to pink, the linalool concentration in the first non-pink well corresponded to the MIC. The culture liquid in the hole where no mycelium growth was seen was marked onto the plate and incubated at 25 °C for 7 days. The well with the lowest linalool concentration and no mycelium growth was identified as MFC. Linalool exhibited the MIC and MFC of 0.025% and 0.025% (v/v, 0.216 mg/mL) against spores, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Besides, both the MIC and MFC against mycelium growth were 0.05% (v/v, 0.432 mg/mL) and 0.1% (v/v, 0.864 mg/mL), respectively. Various linalool doses were examined against <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> CQT2 on linalool-containing plates to evaluate their impact on inhibiting mycelium growth. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C-D</xref>, the findings indicated the anti-oomycetes activity of linalool against <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> CQT2 was dose-dependent. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> displayed mycelium growth on PDA plates under varying linalool concentrations. The viability of mycelium following linalool treatment was assessed using a PI staining assay, where non-viable (dead) mycelium appeared red after PI uptake. Untreated mycelium showed no detectable red fluorescent, indicating 100% viability. In contrast, distinct red fluorescent mycelium was observed after linalool treatment at both MIC and 2×MIC levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>).</p>

<label>2.2</label><title>Effects of linalool on cell membrane damage of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> CQT2</title>
<p>Confocal microscopy using amphiphilic styryl dye FM4-64 has been employed to study endocytosis and vesicle trafficking in living fungal hyphae, while SYTO 9, a fluorescent nucleic acid stain, is widely used in microbiology, particularly in fluorescence microscopy, to evaluate bacterial viability<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]</sup>. The <italic>in situ</italic> fluorescence observations were displayed in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, with linalool treatment for 0 minutes, the mycelium structure remained undamaged, and the red and green fluorescence showed an even distribution. After 2 min, red fluorescence started appearing within the mycelium, accompanied by the entry of the styryl dye FM4-64, indicating damage to the cell membrane. As the duration of linalool treatment increased, the intensity of red fluorescence within the mycelium also increased, indicating a rise in the number of mycelial cell deaths along with severe damage to the cell membrane. When examined by SEM, the mycelium exhibited a smooth and intact surface in the control group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), while in the treated groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), it appeared wrinkled, deformed, and shrunken (Red dashed quadrilateral). When examined by TEM, the untreated mycelium cell exhibited clear and intact ultrastructure in the cell membrane, cell wall, mitochondria, and rough endoplasmic reticulum (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). However, after treatment with linalool, the cell membrane was wrinkled and seriously damaged, and mitochondria began to dissolve (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F-G</xref>, the cell membrane structure disappeared, the cell wall became thinner, and some exhibited severe deformation and bending. Vacuoles appeared in the cytoplasm, and mitochondria and rough endoplasmic reticulum ruptured and dissolved (red circles). No intact organelles were present within the cytoplasm.</p>

</fig>
<p>As shown in the GO classification analysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>), the cellular components were distributed across 8 groups, with “cell part” and “membrane part” being the most prevalent. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with the intrinsic component of the membrane were identified and categorized into four classes: linked to ribosome function, involved in DNA/RNA function, connected to signal transduction and regulation, and pertaining to cell metabolism (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). GO classification analysis revealed a significant number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with the intrinsic components of the membrane. This finding is further supported by observations from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which provide consistent evidence aligning with the GO classification analysis results. Therefore, the cell membrane may be a potential target for linalool.</p>

<p>As shown in Figure S1A-B, a total of 4142 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were discovered between the control and treatment groups, with 2016 showing upregulation and 2108 downregulation. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref> presented the Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the functional aspects of genes and their products. These DEGs were categorized into 20 GO categories, with 6 associated with biological activities, where cellular and metabolic functions had the most DEGs. There were also 6 molecular function categories, with catalytic activity and binding containing the majority of DEGs. Additionally, Figure S1C demonstrated the results of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotation, revealing 10 metabolic (M) pathways, 2 environmental information processing (EIP) pathways, 2 cellular processes (CP), and 5 genetic information processing (GIP).</p>

In addition, KEGG enrichment analysis in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> revealed that “Ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes” was the most enriched pathway, aligning with the GO enrichment analysis results mentioned earlier. The pathway of ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>) showed that linalool influenced DNA transcription, tRNA transport, rRNA processing and maturation (5.8S, 18S, and 25S), and the biogenesis and assembly of ribosome subunits (40S and 60S) in the cell, which might lead to the reduction of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> growth. We found that many DEGs related to ribosome biogenesis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>) and RNA polymerase (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>) are down expressed. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> highlighted the upregulated biological processes, and notably, 11 of them were linked to “amino acids”, such as the sulfur amino acid, L-phenylalanine, alpha-amino acid, tyrosine, and homocysteine.

<p>The results of GO enrichment analysis and KEGG enrichment analysis suggested that linalool might interact with specific domains of the ribosome, potentially affecting its structure and function. To determine whether linalool could bind to ribosome-associated upstream proteins in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic>, molecular docking was conducted to explore the specific binding proteins of linalool with the ribosome. The binding energy of linalool was -6.2 kcal/mol with NOP, -4.8 kcal/mol with SNU13, and -5.0 kcal/mol with DKC1 (Table S1). Consequently, NOP1 was selected as the receptor protein for subsequent molecular docking. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref> illustrated the tertiary structure of ribosomal protein NOP1. Linalool formed hydrogen bonds with glutamic acid (Glu155) and phenylalanine (Phe156) of NOP1 while exhibiting hydrophobic interactions with alanine (Ala181), arginine (Arg182), valine (Val201), and isoleucine (Ile209) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). In summary, this interference may hinder the ribosome’s ability to execute normal biological processes, such as protein synthesis, thereby impacting the growth and reproduction of oomycetes.</p>

In PC group, severe kidney damage was evident, characterized by enlarged glomeruli, glomerular cysts, interstitial bleeding, and infiltration of inflammatory cells. In addition, extensive vacuolation and expansion of intercellular space was observed in hepatocytes, with nuclei displaced toward one side. Cytoplasmic pyknosis and structural disintegration were observed in the pancreatic acinar cells. Meanwhile, the red and white pulp of the spleen was poorly demarcated, the splenic corpuscle was irregularly shaped and arranged, and the white pulp was structurally disrupted.

<label>2.5</label><title>The <italic>in vivo</italic> Saprolegniasis protective mechanism of linalool revealed by comparative transcriptome analysis</title>
<p>To analyze the contrasting gene-level responses in grass carp spleens, a vital immune organ, following <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> infection and linalool treatment, spleen samples were collected for transcriptome analysis. Compared to PC group, 2029 genes in LT group exhibited significant difference, with 809 DEGs up regulated and 1220 down regulated. Meanwhile, 671 genes were identified as significantly different, with 609 DEGs up-regulated and 618 downregulated in LP group relative to PC group (Figure S2A-B).</p>
<p>Based on the GO annotation analysis, a total of 2219 unigenes in the LT group and 520 unigenes in the LP group were classified into 3 primary functional categories (Figure S2C). Within the biological process category, “cellular process,” “metabolic process,” and “biological regulation” were the most prominent subcategories. In terms of cellular components, “membrane part” and “cell part” were highly represented. “Binding” and “catalytic activity” were the most prevalent subcategories within molecular functions. Regarding KEGG annotations, the largest cluster within organismal systems was the immune system, encompassing 209 genes (42.47%) in the LT group (Figure S2D) and 38 genes (50.00%) in the LP group (Figure S2E). In the environmental information processing category, most unigenes were associated with signal transduction, with 227 (65.60%) in the LT group and 38 genes (52.00%) in the LP group. These results suggested that the immune response and signal transduction pathways were crucial for grass carp in dealing with <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> infections.</p>
<p>The GO enrichment analysis of the spleens illustrated in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-B</xref> to reveal distinct biological process. Those down regulated biological process were shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, compared to PC group, the “positive regulation of immune system process” term (GO:0002684) and “regulation of body fluid levels” term (GO:0050878) were enriched with the greatest number of DEGs in LT group. It is worth noting that there are 9 terms related to “body fluids (especially blood)”, such as regulation of coagulation (GO:0050818), blood coagulation (GO:0007596), and regulation of hemostasis (GO:1900046). In addition, those up regulated biological process, the “ion binding” term (GO:0043167) was enriched with the greatest number of DEGs in LT group. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref> illustrated the GO terms with the largest number of down regulated DEGs in LP group was “small molecule binding” (GO:0036094).</p>
<p>KEGG enrichment analysis was used to explore the functional pathways involving DEGs. The 20 significantly enriched up regulated and down regulated pathways of each group are shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C-D</xref>. Multiple pathways associated with immune response were enriched in down regulated genes after linalool treatment in LT group, including complement and coagulation cascades, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, C-type lectin receptor signaling pathway, T cell receptor signaling pathway, B cell receptor signaling pathway, and so on (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway, Complement and coagulation cascades, and Chemokine signaling pathway were enriched with mostly up-regulated genes. Furthermore, metabolic pathways were enriched with mostly down-regulated genes in LP group. Some pathways associated with immune response were significantly enriched, such as Antigen processing and presentation, Fc epsilon RI signaling pathway, Intestinal immune network for IgA production, and so on (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). GO and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed the presence of numerous immune-related genes within corresponding functional processes and pathways. The expression of <italic>fb</italic>, <italic>c1q</italic>, <italic>c2</italic>, <italic>c3</italic>, <italic>c4</italic>, <italic>c6</italic>, <italic>c7</italic>, <italic>c8A</italic>, <italic>c8b</italic>, and <italic>c9</italic> genes were up expressed. Additionally, there was a significant up expressed in the gene expression levels of coagulation factors II (thrombin), VII, VIIi, VIII, X, coagulation factor IXb and IXa, serpin peptidase inhibitor clade C/D/G/F, <italic>fga</italic>, <italic>fgb</italic>, <italic>fgg</italic>, protein C, plasminogen, and plasminogen activator (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). The differential expression of immune-related DEGs implied their role in host defense against <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> infection.</p>
<p>To ensure the regulation of immune-related DEGs by linalool, the expression of several vital immune related genes (<italic>cfh</italic>, <italic>masp2</italic>, <italic>c1r</italic>, <italic>c3</italic>, <italic>cfb</italic>, <italic>ap-1</italic>, <italic>il-1β</italic>, and <italic>il-6</italic>) in different groups were tested by RT-qPCR assay.

<p>In our previous study, we found that linalool affected <italic>S</italic>. <italic>ferax</italic> mainly by altering membrane permeability, causing permanent damage, and membrane breakdown; affecting the oxidation and metabolism of fatty acids and lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and the inhibition of energy supply; degrading the branched chain amino acids and result in the dysfunction of protein synthesis. While, for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic>, linalool exhibited antimicrobial activity by prohibiting ribosome function, inhibiting protein synthesis, disrupting the cell membrane of the mycelium. We found several interesting phenomena when compared these two species. Firstly, the inhibition of protein synthesis was found in both species, but the interesting difference is that linalool inhibits protein synthesis through degrading the branched chain amino acids in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>ferax</italic>, while through prohibited ribosome function in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic>. Secondly, linalool affected the oxidation and metabolism of fatty acids and mitochondrial dysfunction in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>ferax</italic>, while not found in in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic>.

<p>Recent studies demonstrated that the spleen serves antibacterial functions in various fish species, with a high quantity of melano-macrophages that assist in phagocytosis during the immune response<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]</sup>. The rise of macrophages and the change in the pathological and physiological circumstances in fish are correlated<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]</sup>. Similarly, histopathological analysis demonstrated that linalool effectively reduced <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> infection-induced damage in the spleen, indicating its potential immunomodulatory effects on immune organs. Here we used comparative transcriptome analysis to investigate potential genes and signaling pathways regulated by linalool in the spleen of grass carp. Several genes associated with both innate and adaptive immunity, such as complement molecules, pattern recognition receptors, inflammatory cytokines, immunoglobulins, and chemokines, were differentially expressed as shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E-G</xref>.</p>

<label>3.2.1</label><title>Enhancement of complement and coagulation system</title>
<p>It is widely acknowledged that the complement and coagulation system in fish is an important immune defense mechanism for fighting pathogens and maintaining immune homeostasis<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]</sup>. The complement system is made up of over 30 different proteins (complement receptors, internal components, and regulatory proteins) and 3 activation pathways (the classic pathway, the lectin pathway, and the alternative pathway)<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]</sup>. In our study, the expression of <italic>fb</italic>, <italic>c1q</italic>, <italic>c2</italic>, <italic>c3</italic>, <italic>c4</italic>, <italic>c6</italic>, <italic>c7</italic>, <italic>c8a</italic>, <italic>c8b</italic>, and <italic>c9</italic> genes were all up regulated after linalool therapeutic. Meanwhile, the c3a anaphylatoxin chemotactic receptor (<italic>c3aar1</italic>) and mannan-binding lectin serine protease 2 (<italic>masp2</italic>) genes were up expressed. During complement activation, <italic>c3</italic> and <italic>c5</italic> split into molecules such as <italic>c3a</italic>, <italic>c3b</italic>, <italic>c5a</italic>, and <italic>c5b</italic>, of which <italic>c3a</italic> and <italic>c5a</italic> are considered strong inflammatory mediators because of their ability to attract leukocytes and promote inflammation and pathogen clearance<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]</sup>. <italic>masp2</italic> activates complement components such as <italic>c4</italic> and <italic>c2</italic>, triggering a complement cascade reaction that ultimately leads to pathogen rupture<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]</sup>. <italic>c8b</italic> is a subunit of the complement component 8 (<italic>c8</italic>) protein, which helps form the membrane attack complex (MAC) for cell lysis and immune defense against microbes<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]</sup>. In addition, high expression of complement factor H like 3 (<italic>chfl3</italic>) prevents overactivation of the complement system to avoid damage to their own tissues<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]</sup>. The effective antimicrobial role of the <italic>c5a</italic>-<italic>c5ar1</italic> signaling pathway in the complement system has been identified. It functions by enhancing neutrophil phagocytosis of fungi and macrophage-mediated fungicidal activity to combat fungal infections<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]</sup>. In all, our findings suggested that linalool may enhance the complement system which in turn activated host immune defense and lysate <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> cells.</p>
<p>The coagulation cascades are connected with the complement system. Linalool significantly increased the expression of fibrinogen alpha (<italic>fga</italic>), beta (<italic>fgb</italic>), and gamma (<italic>fgg</italic>) chain, which together encoded fibrinogen<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]</sup>, fibrinogen is a crucial component of blood clots to prevent blood loss, and also important in the initial stages of wound healing<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>]</sup>. Secondly, activated prothrombin <italic>f2</italic> is central in clot formation, platelet aggregation, and activating other clotting factors. It also supports tissue repair, cell growth, angiogenesis, and vascular integrity<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]</sup>. Thirdly, an increase in plasminogen (PLG) levels can cause an immune response<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>]</sup>, and serve as a regulator of the natural immune system by promoting the phagocytosis of phagocytes<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>]</sup>. Taken together, the upregulation of fibrinogen, prothrombin, and plasminogen in the coagulation system suggested that linalool may promote wound healing, tissue repair, and phagocytosis to cope with <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> infection.</p>

Firstly, in our study, the function of gut microbiota is mainly enriched in metabolic-related pathways linalool increased the abundance of the beneficial phylum Actinobacteriota and decreased the abundance of the harmful phylum Verrucomicrobiota. Actinobacteriota plays a crucial role because Actinobacteria can produce enzymes, antibiotics, Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), signaling molecules, and immunomodulators<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]</sup>. Meanwhile, Actinobacteriota correlated positive with the complement and coagulation system according to the correlation analysis. Secondly, intestinal IgA production was correlated significantly with Proteobacteria which are the primary inducers of IgA production by B cells<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>]</sup>.

<label>4.</label><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In summary, our study proved that linalool is an effective natural antimicrobial agent against <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic>. Linalool disrupted the cell membrane, resulting in the leakage of cellular components and restricting ribosomal function, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis. Comprehensive analyses revealed the specific role of linalool in protecting <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> infection skin inflammation in grass carp. Meanwhile, the complement and coagulation systems, inflammatory factors, along with Actinobacteriota, significantly involved in this protective effect (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Further investigation would be carried out to explore and refine how linalool affects the inflammatory effects of <italic>S. parasitica</italic> on fish through signaling pathways and mechanisms. We believe that this study will contribute to developing an innovative alternative strategy, distinct from antibiotics, to cope with <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> infection in the aquaculture industry.</p>

<label>5.2</label><title>Agar diffusion assay</title>
<p>The anti-oomycetes effects of EOs and 5 components (linalool, terpinene, limonene, myrcene, and pinene) were assessed by using the agar diffusion method. Initially, a 6 mm mycelium plug was inoculated at the center of the plates. Subsequently, 6 mm sterile filter paper discs were soaked in EOs and components for more than 12 h and placed symmetrically at a distance of 2.5 cm from the target mycelium plug. Sterile distilled water was used as negative control. Finally, the width of the colonies was measured once the mycelium in the control group was completely covered the plate.</p>

<label>5.3</label><title>Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) assays</title>
<p>To determine the MIC and MFC of linalool on mycelium, 6 mm mycelium plugs were inoculated into a 24 well cell culture plate. The wells contained linalool at concentrations of 0.8%, 0.4%, 0.2%, 0.1%, 0.05%, 0.025%, 0.0125%, and 0.00625%, dissolved in 1% Tween 20 and potato dextrose broth (PDB). Wells without mycelium plugs were served as negative controls. After incubating at 25°C for 48 h, the lowest concentration of linalool with no visible mycelium growth was recorded as MIC. Mycelium plugs showing no growth at this MIC concentration then inoculated onto PDA plates and incubated for 7 days at 25°C to determine MFC.</p>
<p>The method for spores induction is similar as previously described by our previous research<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]</sup>.

Following a 24-hour incubation at 20°C, 5 μL of resazurin dye was added. When the color of the wells turned to pink, the linalool concentration in the first non-pink well corresponded to the MIC. The culture liquid from wells with no visible mycelium growth was streaked onto new plates.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The works seeks to investigate the efficacy of linalool as a natural alternative for combating Saprolegnia parasitica infections, which would provide great benefit to aquaculture. This paper shows the effect of linalool in vitro using a variety of techniques including changes in S. parasitica membrane integrity following linalool exposure and alterations in cell metabolism and ribosome function. Additionally, this work goes on to show that prophylactic and concurrent treatment of linalool at the time of S. parasitica infection can improve survival and tissue damage in vivo in their grass carp infection model. The conclusions of the paper are partially supported by the data with the corrections done by the authors improving clarity such that I believe there is merit in the work.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors aimed to delineate the antimicrobial activity of linalool and tried to investigate the mode of action on linalool against S. parasitica infection. One of the main focus of this work was to identify the in vitro and in vivo mechanisms associated with the protective role of linalool against S. parasitica infection.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Authors have used a variety of techniques to prove their hypothesis.</p>
<p>
(2) Adequate number of replicates were used in their studies.</p>
<p>
(3) Their findings showed a protective role of linalool against oomycetes and makes it an attractive future antibiotic in the aquaculture industry.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: The revised version of the manuscript is more thoroughly written with clearer explanations, however there are a few weaknesses in this manuscript.</p>
<p>(1) Although the introduction section was rewritten with rationale, it's still lengthy and not very much to the point.</p>
<p>
(2) The claim of linalool regulating the gut microbiota is based on the correlation analysis only. It's not super convincing and requires experimental validation to strengthen the claim.</p>
<p>Overall, the conclusions drawn by the authors are justified by the data. Importantly, this paper has discovered the novelty of the compound linalool as a potent antimicrobial agent and might open up future possibilities to use this compound in the aquaculture industry.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Adding microscopy of the untreated group to compare Figure 2A with would further strengthen the findings here.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>First of all, we would like to thank Reviewer #1 for their comments and efforts on our manuscript. We have carefully revised it. We used a time-lapse method to capture images at 0 minutes, before any drugs were added. We will change '0 min' to 'untreated,' which will further strengthen the findings.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Quantification of immune infiltration and histological scoring of kidney, liver, and spleen in the various treatment groups would increase the impact of Figure 4.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much to Reviewer #1 for their comments and efforts on our manuscript. We have revised it carefully. We conducted quantitative analysis of immune infiltration in the kidney, liver, and spleen across different treatment groups. However, due to the extremely low number of abnormal cells in the negative control, treatment, and prophylactic groups, neither the instrument nor manual methods could reliably gate the cells. Consequently, quantification of immune infiltration and histological scoring were not performed.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The data in Figure 6 I is not sufficiently convincing as being significant.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks so much for Reviewer #1 comments and efforts for our manuscript. We have revised it carefully. Previous researches have shown that antibiotics and other drugs can cause alterations in gut microbiota. Therefore, we plan to study the effects of antibiotics on gut microbiota. To conduct this research, we need to isolate these microbes from the gut. Although this process is challenging, we still aim to explore the gut microbiota. If possible, we will continue to delve into interesting aspects of how antibiotics affect gut microbiota in future studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Comparisons of the global transcriptomic analysis of the untreated group to the PC, LP, and LT groups would strengthen the author's claims about the immunological and transcriptomic changes caused by linalool and provide a true baseline.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks so much for Reviewer #1 comments and efforts for our manuscript. We have revised it carefully. Due to the initial research design and data analysis strategy, we have focused on comparisons among the PC, LP, and LT groups to more directly explore the differences under various treatment conditions. Specifically, while the transcriptomic data from the untreated group could provide a basic reference, it has shown limited relevance to the core hypotheses of our study. Our research has aimed to investigate the immunological and transcriptomic changes among the treatment groups rather than comparing treated and untreated states. We believe that the current experimental design and data analysis have effectively revealed the mechanisms of linalool and that the additional comparisons among the treatment groups have further supported our conclusions. We hope the reviewer understands the rationale behind our experimental design. If there are additional suggestions, we are more than willing to further optimize the content of our manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The authors have taken for granted that the readers already know the experiments/assays used in the manuscript. There was not enough explanation for the figures as well as figure legends.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks so much for Reviewer #2 comments and efforts for our manuscript. We have revised it carefully. We will provide more detailed explanations of the experiments and assays used in the manuscript, as well as enhance the descriptions in the figure legends, to ensure that readers have a clear understanding of the figures and their context.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors missed adding the serial numbers to the references.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks so much for Reviewer #2 comments and efforts for our manuscript. We have revised it carefully. We will add serial numbers to the references to ensure proper citation and improve the clarity of our manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The introduction section does not provide adequate rationale for their work, rather it is focused more on the assays done.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks so much for Reviewer #2 comments and efforts for our manuscript. We have revised it carefully. We will add a section to the introduction that provides a rationale for our work, specifically focusing on the impact of plant extract on immunoregulation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Full forms are missing in many places (both in the text and figure legends), also the resolution of the figures is not good. In some figures, the font size is too small.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks so much for Reviewer #2 comments and efforts for our manuscript. We will ensure that all abbreviations are expanded where necessary, both in the text and figure legends. Additionally, we will improve the resolution of the figures and increase the font size where needed to enhance clarity.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) There is much mislabeling of the figure panels in the main text. A detailed explanation of why and how they did the experiments and how the results were interpreted is missing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks so much for Reviewer #2 comments and efforts for our manuscript. We have revised it carefully. We will improve the labeling of the figure panels, provide detailed explanations of the experimental methods, including their rationale and interpretation, and clarify the connections between the methods.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) There is not enough experimental data to support their hypothesis on the mechanism of action of linalool. Most of the data comes from pathway analysis, and experimental validation is missing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks so much for Reviewer #2 comments and efforts for our manuscript. We have revised it carefully. Actually, in our manuscript the transcriptomic data are not alone, and we carried out many experiments to substantiate the changes inferred from the transcriptomic data as SEM, TEM, CLSM, molecular docking, RT-qPCR, histopathological examinations. The detailed information is listed as below.</p>
<p>As shown in Figure 2, we combined the transcriptomic data related to membrane and organelle with SEM, TEM, and CLSM images. After deep analysis of these data and observation together, we illustrated that cell membrane may be a potential target for linalool.</p>
<p>As shown in Figure 3, we carried out molecular docking to explore the specific binding protein of linalool with ribosome which were screen out as potential target of linalool by transcriptomic data.</p>
<p>As shown in Figure 5, transcriptomic data illustrated that linalool enhanced the host complement and coagulation system. To substantiate these changes, we carried out RT-qPCR to detect those important immune-related gene expressions, and found that RT-qPCR analysis results were consistent with the expression trend of transcriptome analysis genes.</p>
<p>As shown in Figure 4 and 5, transcriptomics data revealed that linalool promoted wound healing tissue repair, and phagocytosis (Figure. 5E). To ensure these, we carried out histopathological examinations, and found that linalool alleviated tissue damage caused by <italic>S. parasitica</italic> infection on the dorsal surface of grass carp and enhancing the healing capacity (Figure. 4G).</p>
<p>Overall, we will conduct additional experiments to verify the mechanism of action of linalool in the future.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Figure 1 Panel G is not referenced in the legend, this should be fixed</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks so much for Reviewer #1 comments and efforts for our manuscript. We have revised it carefully. Please check the Figure 1. The order of Panel F and G in Figure 1 is wrong. We have modified the order of Figure 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Statistical comparisons between groups in Figure 4 Panels C-F is lacking and should be added.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks so much for Reviewer #1 comments and efforts for our manuscript. We have revised it carefully. Please check the Figure 4 C-F. We have added statistical comparisons between groups in Figure 4 Panels C-F.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Capitalize Kidney label in Figure 4G.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks so much for Reviewer #2 comments and efforts for our manuscript. We have revised it carefully. Please check the Figure 4G. We have capitalized the K of kidney.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors)</bold>:</p>
<p>(1) The authors missed adding the serial numbers to the references. I could not go through the references to cross-check if they cited the right ones because it's extremely difficult to figure out which one corresponds to which reference number.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks so much for Reviewer #2 comments and efforts for our manuscript. We have revised it carefully. Please check the references. We have added the serial numbers to the references.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In the last paragraph of the introduction section, most of the techniques in the paper were summarized which does not go with the flow of the paper. The introduction should not be focused on the different techniques used the focus should be more on the rationale of the work. It would be nice if the last paragraph could be rewritten.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks so much for Reviewer #2 comments and efforts for our manuscript. We have revised it carefully. Please check it in Line 85-94. We have added a section to the introduction that provides a rationale for our work, specifically focusing on the impact of plant extract on immunoregulation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The resolution of the figures is not good.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. We have revised it carefully. Please check all the figures. We have increased the resolution and size of all the figures.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Mostly, the figure legends sound like results, with not enough explanation. Full forms are missing in many places which would make the readers go back to the text/other figures each time.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks so much for Reviewer #2 comments and efforts for our manuscript. We have revised it carefully. Please check it throughout the manuscript and all the figure legends. We have added full names and abbreviations to both the manuscript and all the figure legends so that we don't make the readers go back to the text/other figures each time.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Figure 1:</p>
<p>Figure 1A: there is not enough explanation for this panel. It's not clear from the text which other EOs than Linalool are referred to here. Which EOs were extracted from daidai flowers?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks so much for Reviewer #2 comments and efforts for our manuscript. We have revised it carefully. Please check it in the Figure 1A. Figure 1A is divided into “Essential oils (EOs)” and “The main compounds of EOs” to make it easier to distinguish.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 1B: do the three different wells of each set represent three replicates? If so, are they biological/technical replicates? Also, I'm not sure how the MFC was determined from this figure (line 116) because clearly this panel only corresponds to the determination of MICs, not MFCs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks so much for Reviewer #2 comments and efforts for our manuscript. We have revised it carefully. Please check it in Line 126-130. The three different wells of each set represent three biological replicates. After adding 5 μL of resazurin dye, when the color of the wells turned to pink, the linalool concentration in the first non-pink well corresponded to the MIC. The culture liquid in the well where no mycelium growth was seen was marked onto the plate and incubated at 25°C for 7 days. The well with the lowest linalool concentration and no mycelium growth was identified as MFC.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 1C: the figure legend says that the effect of linalool on mycelium growth inhibition was done over a 6hr timepoint but according to the figure the timepoint was 60hr. I am also confused about the concentrations of linalool used. Although a range of concentration from 0 to 0.4% is mentioned, I only see the time vs diameter curves for 7 concentrations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks so much for Reviewer #2 comments and efforts for our manuscript. We have revised it carefully. Please check it in Line 983 and Figure 1C. We have changed 6 h to 60 h in the figure legends. The reason why only the time vs diameter curves for 7 concentrations in Figure1C is that the growth inhibition of 0.4%, 0.2% and 0.1% linalool on mycelial growth is the same. As a result, the time vs diameter curves coincide. We have shown the time and diameter curves of 0.4%, 0.2% and 0.1% concentration with three dotted lines of different colors and sizes in Figure 1C.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 1D: mislabeled as 1G in the figure panel.</p>

<p>What concentration of linalool was used?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks so much for Reviewer #2 comments and efforts for our manuscript. We have revised it carefully. Please check it in Line 992-996. The mycelium treated with 6×MIC (0.3%) linalool was observed by Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), and the mycelium treated with 1×MIC 0.05% linalool was observed by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).</p>

<p>The full form of DEGs has been mentioned later, but it should be mentioned in the figure legend of Figure 2 as this is the first time the term was used. Also, what is the full form of DEPs?</p>

<p>Thanks so much for Reviewer #2 comments and efforts for our manuscript. We have revised it carefully. Please check it in Line 168, 175, 182, 631, 998, 1001. The word DEPs in Figure 2I was incorrect, and we have changed DEPs to DEGs.</p>

<p>Is there a particular reason for looking into the cellular component rather than molecular function and biological processes in the GO analysis? (what I see is that Figure 2H indicates the prevalence of catalytic activity, binding, cellular, and metabolic processes as well). Also, there is not enough explanation of the observation from Figure 2I (both in the results section and figure legend).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks so much for Reviewer #2 comments and efforts for our manuscript. We have revised it carefully. Please check it in Line 174-179, 998-1002 (Figure 2I). The reason we looked at cellular components rather than molecular functions and biological processes in GO analysis is because we focused more on the effects of cell membranes and cell walls. These results are closely related to and echo the results of our scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and also support the results of electron microscopy. Enough explanations have added to the results and figure legend section to explain the observations from Figure 2I.</p>

<p>(7) Figure 3:</p>
<p>Figures 3A and 3B: The adjusted p value is already indicated in the figures, so there is no need to add statistical significance (Asterix) to each bar. The resolution for these panels is not good and the font is too small.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks so much for Reviewer #2 comments and efforts for our manuscript. We have revised it carefully. Please check the Figure 3A and 3B.

<p>Figure 3C: the figure legend is missing (wrongly added as KEGG analysis, which should be network analysis). The numbering for the figure legends is wrong.

Also, I wonder why ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes has been indicated as the most enriched pathway despite its less connection to the other nodes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks so much for Reviewer #2 comments and efforts for our manuscript. We have revised it carefully. Please check the Figure 3C. Figure 3C is KEGG analysis generated by software, not network analysis. For the convenience of readers, we have made a new Figure of KEGG analysis.</p>

<p>Thanks so much for Reviewer #2 comments and efforts for our manuscript. We have revised it carefully. Please check the 633-635. Functional enrichment analysis was performed using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. KEGG pathway analysis was conducted using Goatools.</p>

<p>Figure 3E: why were the RNA pol structures compared? The authors did not mention anything about this panel in their results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks so much for Reviewer #2 comments and efforts for our manuscript. We have revised it carefully. Please check the line 207. We found that many DEGs related to ribosome biogenesis (Figure 3D) and RNA polymerase (Figure 3E) are down expressed. Because RNA polymerase is closely related to ribosome biogenesis, the downregulation of RNA polymerase directly affects the synthesis of ribosome-related RNAs, including rRNA, mRNA, and tRNA, thereby inhibiting ribosome production. This relationship is particularly significant in cell growth, division, and the response to external environmental changes.</p>

<p>Figures 3F and 3G: please mention which model is illustrated (ribbon/sphere model).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks so much for Reviewer #2 comments and efforts for our manuscript. We have revised it carefully. Please check the line 1010-1015. The tertiary structure of NOP1 was displayed using a cartoon representation. Molecular docking of linalool with NOP1 was performed by enlarging the regions binding to the NOP1 activation pocket to showcase the detailed amino acid structures, which were presented using a surface model, while the small molecule was displayed with a ball-and-stick representation.</p>

<p>Figure 3H: this panel needs more explanation. Why were some of the ABC transporters upregulated while some were downregulated?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks so much for Reviewer #2 comments and efforts for our manuscript. We have revised it carefully. It is a common phenomenon that microorganisms adjust the expression of genes related to substance transport in response to different environmental stimuli to optimize their survival strategies. The expression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters can be upregulated or downregulated due to various factors, such as environmental stimuli, metabolic demands, energy consumption, species specificity, and signaling molecules. This explains why some ABC transporters are upregulated while others are downregulated.</p>

<p>(8) Figure 4:</p>
<p>There was no statistical significance shown in the figures (D-F) which makes me wonder how they worked out that there was any significant increase/decrease, as mentioned in the text. What are the p values? What is the number of replicates? What concentration of linalool was used?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks so much for Reviewer #2 comments and efforts for our manuscript. We have revised it carefully.  Please check the Figure 4D-F. In this study, 4 groups were established: (1) Positive control (PC) group (10 fish infected with <italic>S. parasitica</italic>). (2) Linalool therapeutic (LT) group (10 fish infected with <italic>S. parasitica</italic>, soaked in 0.00039% linalool in a 20L tank for 7 days). (3) Linalool prophylactic (LP) group (10 uninfected fish soaked in 0.00039% linalool in a 20L tank for 2 days, followed by the addition of 1×10<sup>6</sup> spores/mL secondary zoospores). (4) Negative control (NC) group (10 uninfected fish without linalool treatment). Each group had 3 replicate tanks. In each group, 8 fish were utilized for immunological assays, and on day 7, blood samples were collected from the tail veins using heparinized syringes and left to coagulate overnight at 4°C. Kits from Nanjing Jiancheng Institute (Nanjing, China) were used to measure lysozyme (LZY) activity, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and alkaline phosphatase (AKP) activity.</p>

<p>(9) Figure 5:</p>
<p>Again, the resolution and font size are off. Please mention the full forms of the terms used in the figure legend. The interpretation of the in vivo protective mechanism of linalool is completely based on GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis (also some transcriptional analysis). The only wet lab validation done was by checking the mRNA level of some cytokines but that does not necessarily validate what the authors claim.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. We have revised it carefully. Please check all the figures and figure legend. We have increased the resolution and size of all the figures and used the full forms of the terms in figure legend. If we are lucky, we will upload the clearest figures when the manuscript is published. Currently, in the field of aquaculture research, mRNA quantification at the genetic level faces numerous challenges compared to model organisms like mice and zebra fish, primarily due to the lack of available antibodies. For instance, antibodies related to grass carp have not yet been commercialized, making protein-level studies and validations significantly more difficult. This lack of antibodies limits the progress of protein verification. However, we hope to design more experiments and validation tests in the future to gradually overcome these technical bottlenecks and provide stronger support for research in the future.</p>

<p>(10) Figure 6:</p>
<p>There is not enough explanation on why and how the experiments were done. It seems like the authors already presumed that the readers know the experiments. The interpretation of the PCA plot is not clear. Why are the quadrant sizes different? How was the heat map plotted? Also, the claim of linalool regulating the gut microbiota is only dependent on the correlation analysis and there is no wet lab validation for this. The data represented in this figure is not enough to prove their hypothesis and needs further investigation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks so much for Reviewer #2 comments and efforts for our manuscript. We have revised it carefully. Please check the Figure 6. We will improve the labeling of the figure panels, provide detailed explanations of the experimental methods, including their rationale and interpretation, and clarify the connections between the methods.</p>
<p>The goal of PCoA is to preserve the distance relationships between samples as much as possible through the principal coordinates, thereby revealing the differences or patterns in microbial composition among different groups. For example, in our study, PCoA analysis demonstrated that the microbial compositions of the positive control (PC), linalool prophylactic (LP), and linalool therapeutic (LT) groups showed significant differences in the reduced dimensional space, possibly indicating that these treatments had a notable impact on the microbial community.</p>
<p>In our study, the heatmap was generated using the Majorbio Cloud Platform. This platform visualized the preprocessed microbial community data, providing an intuitive representation of the differences in microbial composition and relative abundance among samples. The platform automatically performed steps such as data normalization, color mapping, and clustering analysis, offering convenience for data analysis and interpretation.</p>
<p>Previous researches have shown that antibiotics and other drugs can cause alterations in gut microbiota. Therefore, we plan to study the effects of antibiotics on gut microbiota. To conduct this research, we need to isolate these microbes from the gut. Although this process is challenging, we still aim to explore the gut microbiota. If possible, we will continue to delve into interesting aspects of how antibiotics affect gut microbiota in future studies.</p>

<p>Thanks so much for Reviewer #2 comments and efforts for our manuscript. We have revised it carefully. we have carefully reviewed and confirmed the current experimental design and data analysis. Although we have not made any changes to Figure 7, we have further clarified the interpretation of the results in the revised manuscript, especially concerning the discrepancies between the <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies. We have added more experimental background information to help better understand the possible reasons for these differences.
