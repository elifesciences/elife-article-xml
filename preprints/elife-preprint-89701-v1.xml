<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Changes in chondrocyte gene expression can contribute to the development of osteoarthritis (OA), and so better understanding of the regulative processes during chondrogenesis can highlight potential drug targets for OA. microRNAs (miRNAs) have been a focus of chondrogenesis/ OA research and we have used a combined experimental, bioinformatic, and systems biology approach to explore multiple miRNA-mRNA interactions that regulate chondrogenesis. We identified paralogues miR-199a-5p and miR-199b-5p as pro-chondrogenic regulators of chondrogenesis through bioinformatic analysis. Experimental work demonstrated alteration of miR-199a-5p or miR-199b-5p expression led to significant inverse modulations of chondrogenic biomarkers: <italic>ACAN</italic>, <italic>COL2A1</italic>, <italic>SOX9</italic> and glycosaminoglycan levels. Potential miR-199a/b-5p targets were then identified using RNAseq combined with bioinformatic analysis to identify <italic>FZD6, ITGA3</italic> and <italic>CAV1</italic> as highly likely candidates. Through knockdown experiments we indicated a strong antagonistic relationship between miR-199a/b-5p and <italic>FZD6</italic>, <italic>ITGA3</italic> and <italic>CAV1</italic>. Luciferase assays using <italic>FZD6</italic> and <italic>ITGA3</italic> 3’UTRs luciferase assays indicated both mRNAs to be targets of <italic>miR-199a-5p.</italic> The experimental work was used to generate and parameterize a multi-miRNA 14-day chondrogenesis kinetic model to be used as a repository for the experimental work and as a resource for further investigation of this system. This is the first multi-miRNA model of a chondrogenesis-based system, and it highlights complex relationships between regulatory miRNAs, and predicted indirect miRNA-miRNA interactions, via modulation of miR-140-5p by knockdown of miR-199a/b-5p.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into chondrocytes known as chondrogenesis is an important process during development, as it is a pre-requisite for skeletogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Chondrocytes perform the vital roles of generating and maintaining cartilage during embryogenesis, but are also found in many adult tissues, including articular cartilage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. The master transcription factor responsible for triggering chondrogenesis is SOX9 and during this process chondrocytes secrete anabolic proteins such as Collagen Type II and aggrecan, which are respectively encoded by their protein sub-units COL2A1 and ACAN, and these fibres constitute a significant functional portion of cartilaginous extracellular matrix (ECM) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Over time and influenced by a range of factors such as age, epigenetics and mechanical stress, chondrocytes express increasing levels of catabolic proteins such as MMP13 and ADAMTS5 which respectively degrade COL2A1 and ACAN <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. During skeletogenesis, endochondral ossification is triggered, and chondrocytes will naturally become hypertrophic and differentiate into osteoblasts for healthy bone growth. However, when chondrocytes within articular cartilage become hypertrophic, this leads to detrimental effects, as the cartilage maintenance is greatly diminished, leading to stiffer, less resilient, and joints less able to bear force. Ultimately the chronic loss of cartilage contributes to the extremely debilitating condition of osteoarthritis (OA), which has few treatment options, such as pain relief drugs or surgery, and no cure <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Research into the regulation of chondrogenesis could identify regulatory processes and potential drug targets for OA for pain relief or to delay the progress of hypertrophy. Numerous studies have identified significantly altered microRNAs (miRNAs) during chondrogenesis, which includes investigation into the two important chondrocyte selective miRNAs, miR-140 and miR-455 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. miRNAs are short non-coding RNAs - roughly 19-22nt long, that negatively regulate target mRNAs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Mammalian miRNA-mRNA interactions occur via complementary sequence specificity between a 7-8nt stretch of the miRNA known as the seed sequence, and positions along the 3’UTR of the target mRNA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. miRNA-mRNA interactions are complex because a single mRNA can be targeted by many miRNAs, and a single miRNA can target many mRNAs. The complexity of miRNA-mRNA interactions led us to perform a combined bioinformatic, experimental and systems biology approach to better understand the relationship between microRNAs which may be important to chondrogenesis, and their predicted targets. We identified miR-199a-5p and miR-199b-5p as pro-chondrogenic miRNAs. Just as with miR-140-5p and miR-455, we anticipated miR-199a-5p and miR-199b-5p (miR-199a/b-5p) to target multiple mRNAs during chondrogenesis. To this end we used experimental, informatic and literary data to build kinetic models to explain how miR-199a/b-5p regulated chondrogenesis. The models included three targets identified through RNAseq analysis (<italic>FZD6</italic>, <italic>ITGA3</italic> and <italic>CAV1</italic>), and were used to make predictions of fill experimental gaps and predict novel interactions such as the indirect influence miR-199a/b-5p have over miR-140-5p.</p>

<title>Analysis with TimiRGeN identified miR-199b-5p to be upregulated during chondrogenesis</title>
<p>A 14-day chondrogenesis time series dataset we generated previously was re-analysed with the <italic>TimiRGeN R/ Bioconductor</italic> package - a novel tool we developed to analyse longitudinal miRNA-mRNA expression datasets <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Prior to using <italic>TimiRGeN</italic>, the transcriptomic data underwent timepoint based differential expression analysis, using the 0 time-point as the control group for chondrogenesis samples measured at days: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14, and thus created differential expression data over five time-points. <italic>TimiRGeN</italic> identified signalling pathways of interest over the 14-day time series data (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Eight signalling pathways were found to enriched in at least three of the five time points (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The <italic>TimiRGeN</italic> pipeline was then used to predict miRNA-mRNA interactions that may regulate each of the eight pathways. miRNA-mRNA interactions were kept if the miRNA and mRNA involved in the interaction has a Pearson correlation &lt;-0.75 across the time-series and if the interaction was predicted in at least two of the following three databases: TargetScan, miRDB or miRTarBase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. To identify which miRNAs involved in the miRNA-mRNA interactions were positively changing in each of the eight signalling pathways we scaled the Log2FC values from <italic>limma</italic>. By using scaled Log2FC values, we could highlight magnitude of change, rather than total change.</p>

<p>hsa-miR-140-5p was the most positively changing miRNA in the following seven pathways: Adipogenesis, Clear cell renal cell carcinoma pathways, Epidermal growth factor/Epidermal growth factor receptor, Endochondral ossification, Endochondral ossification with Skeletal Dysplasia, Gastrin signalling pathway and Vascular endothelial growth factor-A/Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 signalling pathway, while <italic>hsa-miR-199b-5p</italic> was the second most positively changing gene in the following six pathways: Clear cell renal cell carcinoma pathways, Epidermal growth factor/Epidermal growth factor receptor, Endochondral ossification, Endochondral ossification with Skeletal Dysplasia, Gastrin signalling pathway and Vascular endothelial growth factor-A/Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 signalling pathway. Other genes such as hsa-miR-455-5p and <italic>BMP2</italic> were also of interest, but we focused on hsa-miR-199b-5p since it was the comparatively under-researched miRNA within the context of chondrogenesis. Furthermore, our previous work identified miR-199b-5p and its paralogue miR-199a-5p as significantly upregulated during chondrogenesis, therefore we chose to focus on both paralogues of miR-199-5p within the context of chondrogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Expression of chondrogenic biomarkers and glycosaminoglycan levels change over time after altering miR-199a-5p or miR-199b-5p expression</title>
<p>To identify if miR-199a-5p and miR-199b-5p regulate chondrogenesis we performed MSC chondrogenic differentiation and measured the consequences of miR-199a-5p overexpression on chondrogenic biomarkers <italic>ACAN</italic>, <italic>COL2A1 and SOX9</italic> by qPCR experiments and GAG (glycosaminoglycan) levels biochemically. Significant upregulation was seen in <italic>ACAN</italic>, <italic>COL2A1</italic> and GAG levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>).

GAG levels were also significantly decreased, by ∼60%, at day 7 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Our results indicated both miR-199a-5p and miR-199b-5p contributed towards positive regulatory roles during chondrogenesis.</p>

<title>FZD6, ITGA3 and CAV1 were the most significantly upregulated miR-199a/b-5p <bold>targets in MSCs during chondrogenesis.</bold></title>
<p>Multiple mRNA targets of miR-199a/b-5p are likely regulated during chondrogenesis. To elucidate which genes are most affected by miR-199 knock-down we performed an RNAseq experiment to identify candidate targets during the early phase of MSC chondrogenesis comparing MSC samples which were undifferentiated (day 0) and MSC samples which were in the early stages of chondrogenesis (day 1). From <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>, we knew the chondrogenic markers were most negatively affected in the early stages of chondrogenesis, so identifying mRNAs which are positively enriched during the first few days of chondrogenesis may identify the most important mRNA targets of miR-199a/b-5p. We chose to inhibit miR-199a-5p or miR-199b-5p since supraphysiological overexpression of miRNA mimics can lead to spurious findings <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Undifferentiated control MSC samples were contrasted against undifferentiated MSCs with either miR-199a-5p or miR-199b-5p inhibition, which respectively resulted in 87 and 46 significantly differentially expressed genes (adjusted P values &lt; 0.05). Similar comparisons at day 1 of chondrogenesis revealed inhibition of miR-199a-5p or miR-199b-5p respectively resulted in 674 and 817 differentially expressed genes. 25 and 341 genes intersected between day 0 and day 1 chondrogenesis inhibition experiments, indicating that both microRNAs may share functional repertoire of targets. Contrasting the day 1 undifferentiated control samples over the day 0 undifferentiated control samples lead to 4391 upregulated and 4168 downregulated significantly differentially expressed genes (&lt; 0.05 adjusted p value). Positively changing genes included well studied pro-chondrogenic markers such as COL2A1 (log2fc =11.6), ACAN (log2fc = 9.18) and SOX9 (log2fc = 3.37). The hundred most significantly differentially expressed genes (Supplementary Table 3) were analysed with enrichr and revealed the most likely cell type to be chondrocytes according to the Panglao database. Gene Ontology (GO) term analysis confirmed that the cells were differentiating towards chondrocytes with terms such as extracellular matrix organization and collagen-containing extracellular matrix significantly (adjusted P values &lt; 0.05) enriched. The miR-199a-5p and miR-199b-5p knockdown experiments showed that well known chondrogenesis genes such as COL2A1, ACAN and SOX9 were significantly downregulated in day one samples, when contrasted to day 0 samples, which strongly indicates the progression to chondrogenesis has been hindered by miR-199a-5p and miR-199b-5p knockdown.</p>
<p>Gene Ontology (GO) term analysis was conducted to identify biological processes linked to miR-199a/b-5p inhibition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Interestingly several gene sets associated with chondrogenesis were suppressed/ less activated during day 1 analyses, including: extracellular matrix constituents, skeletal system morphogenesis, extracellular matrix and collagen containing extracellular matrix. The positively enriched and significantly differentially expressed genes which intersected from the knockdown experiments were further analysed using the <italic>miRNAtap R</italic> package to predict <italic>miR-199a-5p</italic> and <italic>miR-199b-5p</italic> targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. miRNAtap scored each predicted miRNA-mRNA interaction recorded for <italic>miR-199a-5p</italic> and <italic>miR-199b-5p</italic> from five popular miRNA prediction tools (e.g. TargetScans) to rank the most likely targets. We found twenty-one likely mRNA targets were predicted to be targeted by both miRNAs: <italic>ABHD17C, ATP13A2, CAV1, CTSL, DDR1, FZD6, GIT1, HIF1A, HK2, HSPA5, ITGA3, M6PR, MYH9, NECTIN2, NINL, PDE4D, PLXND1, PXN, SLC35A3, SLC35D1</italic> and <italic>VPS26A</italic>. Of the 21 targets, <italic>FZD6</italic> and <italic>NINL</italic> were the only predicted target genes found to be significantly differentially expressed in the MSCs pre-differentiation (day 0) following miR-199a-5p or miR-199b-5p inhibition.</p>

<p>To examine the expression patterns of the 21 genes found through our bioinformatic analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), the genes were also explored in our microarray study (Supplementary Table 2) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. In addition, we used <italic>SkeletalVis</italic> to contrast the behaviour of the 21 genes in other MSC derived chondrogenesis studies (Supplementary Table 3) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>.

We decided to further explore if <italic>FZD6</italic>, <italic>ITGA3</italic> and <italic>CAV1</italic> were true targets of miR-199a/b-5p. Interestingly, <italic>FZD6</italic> and <italic>NINL</italic> were the only genes significantly upregulated during miR-199a/b-5p inhibition at day 0, but <italic>NINL</italic> was not further explored as they were not significantly upregulated at day 1 following miR-199a/b-5p inhibition.

<p>To test the effects miR-199a-5p and miR-199b-5p had on the predicted targets that were identified through RNAseq, we performed a series of inhibition experiments. Since the miRNAs shared the same seed site sequence (nucleotides 2-8; 5’-CCAGUGUU-3’), we wanted to evaluate if knockdown of one of the miRNAs would affect expression of the other paralogue. To check this, we tested if knockdown of one miRNA would lead to similar or different effects to knockdown of both miRNAs. For this, we picked to supress expression of miR-199a-5p as it was the more highly expressed of the two paralogues and contrasted it to inhibition of miR-199a/b-5p. We tested the effects of the knockdowns by measuring the expression of the two most significantly enriched predicted miR-199a/b-5p targets from our bioinformatic analysis – <italic>FZD6</italic> and <italic>ITGA3</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A1</xref>). We saw significant enrichment of <italic>FZD6</italic> and <italic>ITGA3</italic> after miR-199a-5p knockdown and miR-199a/b-5p knockdown, however we generally saw no statistical difference between knockdown of miR-199a-5p knockdown and knockdown of miR-199a/b-5p. We also tested the third most significant predicted target of miR-199a/b-5p - <italic>CAV1</italic>, and how its’ expression changed after miR-199b-5p inhibition over the same time course, and we saw <italic>CAV1</italic> levels were significantly enriched post miR-199b-5p knockdown (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A2</xref>). Unlike FZD6 and ITGA3, CAV1 has previously been established to be a direct binding partner of miR-199a-5p <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. To identify if <italic>FZD6</italic> and <italic>ITGA3</italic> were also direct miRNA-mRNA interactions we cloned the 3’ UTR regions of <italic>FZD6</italic> and <italic>ITGA3</italic> directly downstream of the firefly luciferase gene in the vector pGL3-basic which also contains a control renilla luciferase gene for transfection efficiency normalisation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B1</xref>). These plasmids were transiently transfected into the chondrocytic cell line SW1353 along with control or <italic>miR-199a-5p</italic> mimics. Both <italic>FZD6</italic> and <italic>ITGA3</italic> 3’UTRs reduced the firefly/renilla ratio levels when compared to the empty control vector, suggesting these contain potentially repressive elements. Indeed, the co-introduction of an excess of miR-199a-5p into the cells further repressed the 3’UTR containing vectors firefly/renilla ratio but not that of the control vector, suggesting both genes are direct miR199a-5p targets. Furthermore, pmiRGLO experiments showed after miR-199a-5p overexpression, <italic>FZD6</italic> and <italic>ITGA3</italic> levels increased significantly. Mutations added to the 3’-UTR lead to lower negative effects on the genes, and even had the reverse effect on mut-<italic>ITGA3</italic>.</p>

<title>Kinetic modelling creates an In Silico demonstration of how miR-199a-5p/miR-199b-5p regulates chondrogenesis</title>
<p>We attempted to capture the complexity of how miR-199a/b-5p regulated chondrogensis using an <italic>In Silico</italic> model (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Only using the experimental data presented in this manuscript, and our previous microarray work, we developed a model to demonstrate the relationships between chondrogenic biomarkers and the targets of <italic>miR-199a/b-5p</italic> we identified through RNAseq and subsequent knockdown experiments. Finally, we used events to simulate knockdowns of miR-199a-5p or miR-199b-5p (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). The experiments shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figures 2A</xref>, 2B and 4A were used to parameterise the model, and since the experiments were performed in a staggered manner, we can use to model to make predictions to fill experimental gaps.

Most objects within the model were based on experimental data, and the differences between the experimental data and simulated data are calculated by Mean Squared Error (MSE). Most species, have a MSE of lower than 3 during the different conditions (∼84%) (3/14) indicating many of the experimental dynamics were captured by this model.</p>

<p>We added further detail to enhance our model based on data from literature. This included the addition of Tumour Growth Factor Beta (TGFB) as a trigger for chondrogenesis initiation – just as we had during our chondrogenesis MSC experiments. We found strong mechanistic links between TGFB signalling and <italic>CAV1</italic> expression via SRC kinase. Based on our previous work we also included miR-140-5p as it has been proven as a major regulator of chondrogenesis, and with our kinetic model we predicted how miR-199a-5p or miR-199b-5p inhibition indirectly affected miR-140-5p. Further to this, the enhanced chondrogenesis model enabled us to address some weaknesses in our initial model. Firstly, by simulating the miR-199a-5p and miR-199b-5p knockdown to last until day 7, we saw that <italic>SOX9</italic> mRNA, <italic>COL2A1</italic> mRNA and <italic>ACAN</italic> mRNA dynamics between days 1 and 7 of miR-199b-5p knockdown were flat. Furthermore, our CAV1 dynamics were also flat during miR-199b-5p knockdown. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> shows, from miR-199b-5p knockdown, the chondrogenesis biomarkers had a sharp decrease followed by a steady rise until day 7, and to match the effect of the miR-199b-5p knockdown experiments, we simulated the knockdown to last until day 4.5 instead of day 7. Doing so increased the similarities between our experimental data and simulations. Secondly, we wanted to include other miR-199a/b-5p targets which may have been alluded to in our RNAseq experiment, but not further explored such as <italic>MYH9, PDE4D</italic>. We added a blackbox named ‘OtherTargets’ to represent other targets which miR-199a/b-5p regulate during chondrogenesis. Also, to delay the decrease in <italic>ACAN</italic>, <italic>COL2A1</italic> and GAG levels after miR-199a/b-5p knockdown, we slowed down the interactions between the miR-199a/b-5p targets and <italic>SOX9</italic> by including SOX9 protein and SOX9 phospho-protein as objects in the model. This meant the model could also predict the dynamics of different omics of SOX9 – but we lacked the data to provide any evidence for our predictions. Finally, our initial model used simplistic functions, with few parameters and we found using functions with additional parameters improved our model dynamics (Supplementary Materials) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>).</p>
<p>The enhanced model improved dynamics for several model objects e.g. GAG, <italic>CAV1</italic>, <italic>SOX9</italic>, <italic>ACAN</italic>, <italic>COL2A1</italic>. Generally, our MSE values were better in our enhanced model for the chondrogenesis biomarkers and GAG levels, although overall the MSE values were not improved for the miR-199a/b-5p targets. We found that now 80% (3/15) of the MSE values were below 3, indicating our enhanced model provided a good fit to most of the experimental data. Overall, we saw the dynamics improved in the enhanced model, and in addition, we could make predictions on how miR-140-5p levels would indirectly be influenced from knock-down of miR-199a-5p or miR-199b-5p and such a multi-miRNA model has not yet been created before. Further pathways and important genes such as the SMAD2/3 signalling pathways and the Wnt signalling pathway may also play an important role in this system but could not be explored via modelling with our current level of data. To assist with future hypothesis generation, these pathways which were beyond the scope of this project are shown in the GRN (Supplementary Figure 2).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this paper we performed experimental and computational analyses to better understand the role of miR-199a/b-5p during chondrogenesis. The <italic>MIR199</italic> family were identified as pro-chondrogenic in mouse mesenchymal C3H10T1/2 cells, reportedly by targeting <italic>SMAD1</italic> (miR-199a-3p) and <italic>JAG1 (</italic>miR-199a/b-5p), respectively <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Having previously shown the substantial upregulation of miR-199a/b-5p during chondrogenesis, we now show through both loss-and gain of function experiments that <italic>miR-199a/b-5p</italic> also promotes <italic>SOX9, COL2A1</italic> and <italic>ACAN</italic> expression in human MSC chondrogenesis thus enhancing cartilage generation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. RNAseq analysis identified key targets of <italic>miR-199a</italic>/<italic>b-5p</italic> including <italic>FZD6</italic>, <italic>ITGA3</italic> and <italic>CAV1</italic>, which were experimentally validated and subsequently incorporated into an <italic>In Silico</italic> kinetic model.</p>
<p>miR-199a and miR-199b are vertebrate-specific miRNAs which exhibit an expression pattern associated with mesenchymal tissues and the skeleton <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Antisense transcript <italic>Dmn3os</italic> encodes miR199a and miR214 and its deletion in mice causes skeletal defects including short stature and cranial deformity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Similar phenotypic consequences caused by the loss of <italic>DNM3OS</italic> and therefore <italic>MIR199A</italic> and <italic>MIR214</italic> have also been reported in humans <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. <italic>miR-214</italic> has since been reported to negatively impact on chondrocyte differentiation, through targeting <italic>ATF4</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Thus, our demonstration of the pro-chondrogenic nature of <italic>miR-199a-5p</italic> and <italic>miR-199b-5p</italic> in human MSCs, in addition to the previous demonstration in mouse C3H10T1/2 cells, further supports the role of these miRNAs in chondrogenesis and formation of the skeleton.</p>
<p>We show for the first-time functional evidence for the miR-199b-5p<italic>-CAV1</italic> interaction to occur in human MSCs. Several mechanisms reported in the literature may also support how <italic>miR-199a/b-5p-CAV1</italic> could regulate chondrogenesis, such as the TGFB triggering phosphorylation of CAV1 via SRC-kinase, and the TGFB pathway which is of great importance in chondrogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. In contrast to <italic>CAV1</italic>, <italic>FZD6 and ITGA3</italic> have been less well studied as miR-199a/b-5p targets, and though, miR-199a-5p<italic>-FZD6</italic> has been predicted previously, our luciferase assays show for the first time that <italic>FZD6</italic> has been validated as a target of <italic>miR-199a-5p-FZD</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Previous work by our group has validated <italic>FZD6</italic> as a target of <italic>miR-140-5p</italic>, so it is likely a highly important gene in chondrogenesis. <italic>ITGA3</italic> meanwhile has been found to be a target of <italic>miR-199a-5p</italic> in neck and head cancer cells, and our results confirm this interaction in humans MSCs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The presented model topology (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A, 5C</xref>) was based on our experimental work. Our initial model (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>) was re-worked to better match the experimental patterns seen and to include additional genes which we can make prediction from. The enhanced chondrogenesis model (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>) was initiated with TGFB3, which was used to initiate chondrogenesis in our experiments and was therefore used as the proxy for chondrogenic initiation. As such, TGFB3 promoted miR-199a/b-5p levels to match our microarray data, though based on our previous data TGFB may not directly regulate miR-199a/b-5p levels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. TGFB3 also induced CAV1 via SRC kinase and induced <italic>SOX9</italic> via the SMAD2-SMAD3 pathway, which then stimulated SOX9 protein production (SMAD2/3 were not included in the models) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. However, our microarray data showed <italic>CAV1</italic> gene expression decreased during early chondrogenesis, but then increased again – perhaps indicating CAV1 has a smaller negative regulative effect on chondrogenesis, or only effects early chondrogenesis. Gene expression of <italic>FZD6</italic>, <italic>ITGA3, CAV1</italic> and the OtherTargets blackbox all had inverse relationships with miR-199a-5p and miR-199b-5p, and <italic>FZD6</italic> was also negatively regulated by miR-140-5p.</p>
<p><italic>SOX9</italic> mRNA, SOX9 and P-SOX9 were all treated as separate objects in this model. P-SOX9 promoted <italic>COL2A1</italic>, <italic>ACAN</italic> and <italic>miR-140-5p</italic> expression<italic>. ACAN</italic> contributed directly, and to the greatest extent, to GAG levels (since most cartilage GAGs are post-translationally added to Aggrecan, the protein product of <italic>ACAN</italic>) which was used as the phenotypic level output for the model and a proxy for chondrogenesis progression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Precise mechanisms of how FZD6 and ITGA3 regulated chondrogenesis are unclear, with potentially implicated pathways were included in the larger GRN (Supplementary Figure 1). FZD6 is a transmembrane protein which functions as a receptor for WNT signalling proteins to, most commonly, activate the non-canonical planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway. However, elements of the Wnt signalling pathway have been implicated to act antagonistically to chondrogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. ITGA3 is a cell surface integrin which forms a heterodimer with ITGB1 to form α3β1 heterodimers through which Chondrocyte-fibronectin ECM connections can be created <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Conditional deletion of <italic>Itgb1</italic> in cartilage impacts profoundly on skeletogenesis in mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. α3 integrins have been found to increase in OA cartilage, though a direct mechanism between ITGA3 regulating SOX9 is not clear. Regulation of SOX9 via CAV1 has been more studied, which has shown that the relationship between SOX9 and CAV1 is complex and requires further testing. CAV1 may be affecting SOX9 levels, via its activation of RHOA/ROCK1 signalling, which leads to phosphorylation of SOX9, and also RHOA/ROCK1 inhibition has been shown to both increase levels of SOX9 and chondrogenesis biomarkers in mouse ATDC5 cells, but also decrease levels of <italic>SOX9</italic> and chondrogenesis biomarkers in 3D-chondrocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. It is likely that other mRNA targets of miR-199a/b-5p also contributed chondrogenesis regulation, such as the other genes identified as miR-199a/b-5p targets from the RNAseq analysis e.g. <italic>MYH9, NECTIN2</italic>. Based on this limitation, a “blackbox” called OtherTargets was added to the kinetic model to represent all other anti-chondrogenic <italic>miR-199a/b-5p</italic> targets during chondrogenesis which were not explored in this study. A major limitation of the kinetic models is that we were not able to provide any multi-omic data – as no protein level, or phosphor-protein data were available. We generated a broader GRN (Supplementary Figure 2), which showcases how the models we created could be enhanced with such data.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our combined bioinformatic, laboratory, and systems biology approach was a multi-faceted approach to explore miR-199a-5p and miR-199b-5p as pro-chondrogenic regulators. Based on our bioinformatic analysis, the three most significantly positively changing miR-199a/b-5p were predicted targets <italic>FZD6</italic>, <italic>ITGA3</italic> and <italic>CAV</italic>. Laboratory experiments validated these as direct miR-199a/b-5p targets and confirmed that miR-199a/b-5p positively regulate chondrogenesis. However, the complex nature of miRNA function means there are likely multiple mRNA targets of miR-199a/b-5p which may work synergistically to modulate chondrogenesis. The GRN and kinetic models were created to capture the behaviours of the system and provide a useful resource for further experimental design.</p>

Analysis was performed in comparison with Dharmacon miRIDIAN miRNA mimic nontargeting Control #2 (CN-002000-01) or Dharmacon miRIDIAN miRNA hairpin inhibitor nontargeting Control #2 (IN-002005-01). For all experiments, cells were subject to a single transfection prior to induction of MSC differentiation.</p>

<title>Cloning and Plasmid Transfection in SW1353 Cells</title>
<p>Full length miRNA target 3’UTRs were amplified from human genomic DNA using PCR primers (Supplementary Table 4) to enable Clontech In-Fusion HD cloning (Takara Bio Europe, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France) into the pmirGLO Dual-Luciferase miRNA Target Expression Vector (Promega, Southampton, U.K.) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Mutation of the miRNA seed-binding sites was performed using the QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies) (Supplementary Figure 2). All vectors were sequence verified. SW1353 chondrosarcoma cells were plated overnight in 96-well plates at 50% confluence (1.5 x 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> cells/cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>). Cells were first transfected with 3′UTR luciferase constructs (10 ng) using FuGENE HD transfection reagent (Promega) for 4 hours then transfected with Dharmacon <italic>miR-199a-5p</italic> mimic (50 nM) or miRNA mimic nontargeting Control #2 using Dharmafect 1. After 24 hours of transfection, the SW1353 cells were washed and lysed using Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega) and firefly and renilla luciferase levels determined using the Promega Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System and a GloMax 96 Microplate Luminometer (Promega).</p>

<title>GRN development</title>
<p>The initial system schematic was made in BioRender (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). For the enhanced model, we used <italic>CellDesigner</italic>, SMBL style GRNs are created to represent the biological processed of interest <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. A literature search provided information of GRN topology. Once the whole GRN was created (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>), a more advanced GRN was created to hypothesise further pathways and important players in the system which could not be modelled as we lacked the experimental data to do so (Supplementary Figure 2).</p>

<title>Kinetic modelling</title>
<p>Base data (microarray experiments), and the validation data (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) from qPCR data was converted to numbers compatible to the calibration data from the microarrays using the following formula <italic>KD/C</italic> ∗ <italic>M, KD</italic> being the mean miR-199a-5p or miR-199b-5p value, <italic>C</italic> being the mean control value and M being the mean microarray value. The initial conditions (zero time point) for the calibration and validation datasets were assumed to be the same so the model can have a single initial condition for each validated species. Thus, <italic>KD/C =1</italic> was fixed for each zero-time point, for each species where validation data was available. For GAG levels, the control level at day 7 was treated as 100%, and the change in GAG expression during miR-199b-5p knockdown was measured in contrast to the control to calculate the percentage change. Species selected from the modelled GRN were modelled using <italic>COPASI</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. Calibration was performed using parameter estimation via the Particle swarm algorithm. Inhibition of miR-199a-5p and miR-199b-5p were simulated using events, where the miRNA in question was reduced by 90-95%, until day 7 in the initial model and day 4.5 in the enhanced model. Parameters were altered using sliders to make the model perform miR-199a-5p or miR-199b-5p inhibition behaviour. Mean squared error (MSE) was calculated between actual and simulated data where possible, 1/<italic>n</italic>. ∑<sup>n</sup><sub><italic>i=1</italic></sub> (<italic>yi</italic> − <italic>yi</italic>)<sup>2</sup>.

<p>This study provides <bold>valuable</bold> insight into the role of miR-199a/b-5p in cartilage formation. The evidence supporting the significance of the identified miRNA and its target mRNA transcripts is <bold>convincing</bold>, however further experiments and a broader contextual analysis are warranted to draw a more robust conclusion. This paper will likely primarily benefit scientists focused on diseases related to this biological process, such as osteoarthritis. Furthermore, researchers interested in miRNAs as a broader subject may find the computational model development methodology particularly helpful.</p>

<p>In 'Systems analysis of miR-199a/b-5p and multiple miR-199a/b-5p targets during chondrogenesis', Patel et al. present a variety of analyses using different methodologies to investigate the importance of two miRNAs in regulating gene expression in a cellular model of cartilage development. They first re-analysed existing data to identify these miRNAs as one of the most dynamic across a chondrogenesis development time course. Next, they manipulated the expression of these miRNAs and showed that this affected the expression of various marker genes as expected. An RNA-seq experiment on these manipulations identified putative mRNA targets of the miRNAs which were also supported by bioinformatics predictions. These top hits were validated experimentally and, finally, a kinetic model was developed to demonstrate the relationship between the miRNAs and mRNAs studied throughout the paper.</p>
<p>I am convinced that the novel relationships reported here between miR-199a/b-5p and target genes FZD6, ITGA3, and CAV1 are likely to be genuine. It is important for researchers working on this system and related diseases to know all the miRNA/mRNA relationships but, as the authors have already published work studying the most dynamic miRNA (miR-140-5p) in this biological system I was not convinced that this study of the second miRNA in their list provided a conceptual advance on their previous work.</p>
<p>I was also concerned with the lack of reporting of details of the manipulation experiments. The authors state that they have over-expressed miR-199a-5p (Figure 2A) and knocked down miR-199b-5p (Figure 2B) but they should have reported their proof that these experiments had worked as predicted, e.g. showing the qRT-PCR change in miRNA expression. Similarly, I was concerned that one miRNA was over-expressed while the other was knocked down - why did the authors not attempt to manipulate both miRNAs in both directions? Were they unable to achieve a significant change in miRNA expression or did these experiments not confirm the results reported in the manuscript?</p>
<p>I had a number of issues with the way in which some of the data was presented. Table 1 only reported whether a specific pathway was significant or not for a given differential expression analysis but this concealed the extent of this enrichment or the level of statistical significance reported. Could it be redrawn to more similarly match the format of Figure 3A? The various shades of grey in Figure 2 and Figure 4 made it impossible to discriminate between treatments and therefore identify whether these data supported the conclusions made in the text. It also appeared that the same results were reported in Figure 3B and 3C and, indeed, Figure 3B was not referred to in the main text. Perhaps this figure could be made more concise by removing one of these two sets of panels.</p>
<p>Overall, while I think that this is an interesting and valuable paper, I think its findings are relatively limited to those interested in the role of miRNAs in this specific biomedical context.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study represents an ambitious endeavor to comprehensively analyze the role of miR-199a/b-5p and its networks in cartilage formation. By conducting experiments that go beyond in vitro MSC differentiation models, more robust conclusions can be achieved.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This research investigates the role of miR-199a/b-5p during chondrogenesis using bioinformatics and in vitro experimental systems. The significance of miRNAs in chondrogenesis and OA is crucial, warranting further research, and this study contributes novel insights.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While miR-140 and miR-455 are used as controls, these miRNAs have been demonstrated to be more relevant to Cartilage Homeostasis than chondrogenesis itself. Their deficiency has been genetically proven to induce Osteoarthritis in mice. Therefore, the results of this study should be considered in comparison with these existing findings.</p>
