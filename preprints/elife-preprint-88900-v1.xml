<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sea anemones, jellyfish, corals, and hydrozoans of the Cnidarian phylum use specialized cells called nematocytes to sting for predation or defense. Mechanical and chemical stimuli from prey or predators act synergistically on nematocytes to mediate rapid discharge of a toxin-covered barb from its nematocyst organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Holstein and Tardent, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Watson and Mire-Thibodeaux, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Babonis and Martindale, 2014</xref>). Nematocyst discharge requires calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) influx and, as a one-time use organelle, is tightly controlled to prevent energetically wasteful stinging to irrelevant stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lubbock et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gitter et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Watson and Hessinger, 1994</xref>). We previously found that the starlet sea anemone <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic> uses a uniquely adapted voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (Ca<sub>V</sub>) to integrate simultaneously presented chemical and mechanical cues that elicit nematocyst discharge. Unusually strong voltage-dependent inactivation of <italic>Nematostella</italic> Ca<sub>V</sub> prevents stinging responses to extraneous, non-prey touch signals by reducing and preventing cellular excitability. Ca<sub>V</sub> inactivation is relieved by hyperpolarization of the nematocyte membrane potential to very negative voltages through the effect of prey-derived chemosensory signals that are synaptically transmitted from sensory neurons. Upon relieving Ca<sub>V</sub> inactivation, direct touch responses are amplified to trigger nematocyst discharge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Weir et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, single nematocytes integrate synergistic cues to elicit a precise response, representing a unique cellular system to study how cells detect and transduce signals to produce discrete behavior.</p>
<p>While Ca<sub>V</sub>-mediated sensory integration represents one mechanism by which nematocytes “decide” when to sting, the incredible diversity of cnidarian biology suggests that stinging behavior must be adapted to support the demands of different lifestyles. Cnidarian taxa occupy diverse environmental niches and endure specific metabolic demands, predatory challenges, and environmental pressures for survival, which results in distinct selective pressures on nematocyte evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Beckmann and Özbek, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Babonis et al., 2022</xref>). <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic> and <italic>Exaiptasia diaphana</italic> represent an example of closely related cnidarians with differing environmental niches and metabolic demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Darling et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bedgood et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>Nematostella</italic> are found in shallow brackish water of coastal marshes where they are buried in the mud, hidden from predators, with only their tentacles exposed to catch unsuspecting passing prey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fraune et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, we hypothesize that their stinging is under tight regulation adapted for opportunistic predation. In contrast, <italic>Exaiptasia</italic> are exposed to predators while living in shallow, open ocean environments that provide sufficient sunlight for their endosymbionts to produce important photosynthetic products and nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baumgarten et al., 2015</xref>). Considering these dramatically different ecological contexts, we hypothesized that Ca<sub>V</sub>-mediated regulation of nematocyte discharge has adapted to reflect the demands on stinging behavior in these two anemones. We therefore probed the behavior of these related but distinct anemones and investigated how subtle tuning of a shared molecular-regulatory mechanism drives adaptation in physiology and behavior associated with niche diversification.</p>
<p>In this study, we find that the symbiotic anemone <italic>Exaiptasia</italic> stings in response to mechanical stimuli alone, independent of predation pressure. This behavior serves as a stark contrast with <italic>Nematostella</italic> stinging, which is only elicited by synergistic prey chemicals and touch. Markov decision process modeling coupled with behavioral experiments revealed that <italic>Nematostella</italic> stings as an optimal predator, whereas <italic>Exaiptasia</italic> exhibits optimal defensive stinging behavior. Consistent with indiscriminate stinging behavior, we discover that <italic>Exaiptasia</italic> nematocyte physiology lacks the unusual Ca<sub>V</sub> inactivation used by <italic>Nematostella</italic> to prevent responses to touch in the absence of prey chemicals. Weak inactivation of <italic>Exaiptasia</italic> Ca<sub>V</sub> is mediated by a splice isoform of the beta subunit (Ca<sub>V</sub>β) with a distinct N-terminus. Analysis of chimeric jellyfish and anemone channels reveals that Ca<sub>V</sub> inactivation is broadly regulated by the Ca<sub>V</sub>β N-terminus, suggesting an evolutionary tuning mechanism that could contribute to specific stinging behavior across cnidarians. Thus, we propose Ca<sub>V</sub> adaptations as one molecular mechanism that could shift predatory versus defensive stinging in cnidarians. These results highlight how subtle adaptations in protein structure contribute to complex organismal behavior.</p>

<title>Comparative sea anemone stinging behavior</title>
<p>In their natural habitat, <italic>Nematostella</italic> are hidden by burrowing within the sandy substrate and use an opportunistic predatory strategy to capture prey with their tentacles. In contrast, symbiotic <italic>Exaiptasia</italic> are found within open waters where they experience greater risk of predation and therefore must adopt a more defensive stance. Thus, we first asked whether differences in ecological pressure are reflected by stinging behavior. Consistent with our previous findings, we observed <italic>Nematostella</italic> stinging in response to simultaneously delivered prey extract and touch, reflecting stinging control adapted for predation (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Weir et al., 2020</xref>). Strikingly, <italic>Exaiptasia</italic> tentacles instead exhibited robust stinging even in the absence of prey chemicals (touch alone, <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>). Similar touch-evoked stinging was observed for <italic>Exaiptasia</italic> acontia, which are defensive nematocyte-enriched structures that are ejected and release toxins to repel predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lam et al., 2017</xref>). Considering the drastic differences in stinging behavior, we wondered if <italic>Exaiptasia</italic>’s indiscriminate stinging reflects a distinct control strategy.</p>

<p>To investigate whether different stinging behaviors might be suited for predation versus defense, we developed a normative theory aimed at predicting optimal stinging behavior as a function of nutritional state (see <bold><italic>Supplementary Information</italic></bold> for model details). We focused on stinging intensity, defined as the fraction of nematocysts discharged during a stinging event, and asked whether nutritional state would affect optimal predatory and defensive stinging. In the language of decision models, the intensity of stinging is an action, and it is chosen by the agent, or anemone. In our study, “choice” of stinging means modulation of behavior with nutritional state, rather than a cognitive process. Each choice has associated costs and benefits that depend on the environment. Because anemones sting many times over the course of their lives, an optimal behavior must account for overall costs and benefits after many events; therefore, this is a sequential decision-making problem.</p>
<p>We modeled the optimal stinging response to a given environment by using Markov decision processes (MDP). Each anemone was modeled as an “agent” that must hedge the intensity of its stinging response. The environment, including the identity of prey, predators, and the physiological state of the animals, defines the likelihood, costs, and benefits of successful stinging. Specifically, intense stinging responses are costly since each fired nematocyst needs to be regenerated. But they are also more likely to succeed because greater discharge of stinging barbs increases the likelihood of contact and envenomation. The cost per nematocyte was assumed to be constant and equivalent for defensive and predatory stinging as nematocyst discharge requires regeneration in either case. We assumed that the benefits of successful predatory stinging depend on the capture and consumption of prey, which improves satiation. In contrast, stinging a predator for defense would not improve nutritional state, hence the benefits of stinging would not depend on satiation. We then used the model to predict optimal stinging that maximizes benefits while minimizing costs during starvation and tested the prediction directly against experiments with behaving animals.</p>
<p>Using this approach, we found that optimal stinging strategies were completely different for predatory versus defensive behavior. Regardless of the specific environment (likelihood to succeed and specific costs and benefits), predatory stinging increased with starvation (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref></bold>). To test our theory regarding predatory stinging, we carried out simulations in which agents discharged a random fraction of nematocytes between 0 and 1, regardless of starvation. Random stinging was unsustainable over numerous events and agents quickly reached maximal starvation state. Agents using optimal predatory stinging discharged more nematocysts when starved and less when satiated, leading to sustained stinging behavior and survival. This was true even if they fired the same fraction of nematocytes as the random agent (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>). In contrast, optimal stinging for defense stayed constant or decreased with starvation (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref></bold>). Importantly, while the precise optimal response depended on the details of cost and reward that defined the MDP, the differences between predatory versus defensive stinging were consistent and largely independent of assumptions associated with each reward function (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref></bold>). These results reflect greater rewards to predatory anemones upon stinging during starvation, whereas defensive anemones sting at a similar rate regardless of nutritional status. Thus, our model predicts robust differences in predatory versus defensive stinging behavior.</p>

<p>We next sought to experimentally test whether pressure to predate regulates stinging in <italic>Nematostella</italic> and <italic>Exaiptasia</italic>. To do so, we fed both species of anemones copious amounts of prey (brine shrimp, <italic>Artemia nauplii</italic>) for 1-2 weeks and then deprived them of food for 5 days. Following manipulation of prey availability, <italic>Nematostella</italic> significantly increased stinging in response to starvation, while <italic>Exaiptasia</italic> stinging remained relatively constant despite complete deprivation of prey (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref></bold>). The behavior was remarkably consistent with our normative theory of optimal stinging strategies for predation versus defense (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref></bold>). Furthermore, changes in <italic>Nematostella</italic> and <italic>Exaiptasia</italic> stinging were not due to changes in the abundance of nematocytes because tentacles from both animals were abundantly armed with nematocytes across feeding conditions (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2S1A</xref></bold>). Thus, we conclude that <italic>Nematostella</italic> controls stinging for opportunistic predation while <italic>Exaiptasia</italic> stinging is indiscriminate and serves a greater defensive role for this symbiotic anemone.</p>

<title>Sea anemones with different stinging behavior use distinct Ca<sub>V</sub> channels</title>
<p>We next probed the physiological basis underlying these significantly different stinging behaviors. We previously found that <italic>Nematostella</italic> stinging is triggered by a specialized Ca<sub>V</sub> channel that exhibits strong inactivation to prevent responses to extraneous non-prey mechanical stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Weir et al., 2020</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx triggers an increase in hydrostatic pressure inside the nematocyst capsule that forces the stinging thread to evert explosively at an acceleration of up to 5.41 × 10<sup>6</sup>g, placing it among the fastest biological processes in existence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lubbock and Amos, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lubbock et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Holstein and Tardent, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Weber, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gitter et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Tardent, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Nüchter et al., 2006</xref>). Similar to <italic>Nematostella</italic>, <italic>Exaiptasia</italic> stinging required extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and was abolished by Cd<sup>2+</sup>, a Ca<sub>V</sub> channel blocker (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). Consistent with a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent stinging mechanism, whole-cell patch clamp recordings from nematocytes revealed the presence of voltage-gated inward currents that were blocked by Cd<sup>2+</sup>, suggesting that <italic>Exaiptasia</italic> nematocytes also use Ca<sub>V</sub> channels to control stinging (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>). Indeed, Ca<sub>V</sub> currents in <italic>Exaiptasia</italic> nematocytes exhibited similar voltage-dependent activation properties compared with <italic>Nematostella</italic> nematocytes (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>). Thus, in agreement with previous findings, we conclude that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via Ca<sub>V</sub> channels is broadly important for stinging.</p>

<p>Ca<sub>V</sub> channels respond to positive membrane potentials by opening to conduct Ca<sup>2+</sup>. However, sustained positive voltage drives Ca<sub>V</sub>s to transition to a non-conducting state (inactivation) that prevents re-activation until channels return to a resting state induced by negative membrane potentials. In most cells, voltage-gated ion channel inactivation prevents extended responses to repetitive or prolonged stimulation. <italic>Nematostella</italic> Ca<sub>V,</sub> is unusual because it inactivates at very negative voltages to prevent responses from resting potential, resulting in nematocytes that cannot fire from rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Weir et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast to <italic>Nematostella</italic> nematocytes in which half of all Ca<sub>V</sub> channels (V<sub>i1/2</sub>) were inactivated at ∼ −93mV, <italic>Exaiptasia</italic> nematocytes exhibited two distinct inactivation phenotypes: (1) nematocytes with low-voltage threshold (low-V) inactivation similar to that of <italic>Nematostella</italic> (low-V, V<sub>i1/2</sub> = ∼ −85mV); and (2) a distinct population with weak, high-voltage (high-V) threshold inactivation (high-V, V<sub>i1/2</sub> = ∼ −48mV) (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>). While we did not observe a correlation with abundance or distinct cellular morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Östman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kass-Simon and Scappaticci, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Grajales and Rodríguez, 2014</xref>), we could clearly distinguish the two populations based on these electrophysiological features. Importantly, high-V nematocyte inactivation was minimal at resting voltages (∼ −70mV), so nearly all channels would be available to amplify depolarizing signals, such as those elicited by touch. Thus, these markedly different physiological properties correlate with distinct stinging behavior: <italic>Nematostella</italic> uses unusual Ca<sub>V</sub> inactivation to integrate sensory cues for tightly regulated predatory stinging. In contrast, <italic>Exaiptasia</italic> employs a population of nematocytes with weak Ca<sub>V</sub> inactivation, consistent with direct activation from resting potentials and stinging to touch alone.</p>
<p>What is the molecular basis of distinct nematocyte physiology? Ca<sub>V</sub> channels are made of at least three subunits: the pore-forming α and auxiliary β and α2δ subunits. Transcriptomics revealed that nematocyte-enriched tentacles of <italic>Exaiptasia</italic> expressed <italic>cacna1a</italic>, the pore-forming subunit homologous to that of the previously characterized <italic>Nematostella</italic> nematocyte Ca<sub>V</sub> channel (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4S1</xref></bold>). We also analyzed the Ca<sub>V</sub> β subunit, Ca<sub>V</sub>β, which is required and sufficient for the unusual inactivation properties observed in <italic>Nematostella</italic> Ca<sub>V</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Weir et al., 2020</xref>) (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4S1</xref></bold>). From <italic>Exaiptasia</italic>, we identified two isoforms of Ca<sub>V</sub>β: EdCa<sub>V</sub>β1 and EdCa<sub>V</sub>β2.

<p>Considering this expression profile, we wondered if the two Ca<sub>V</sub>β isoforms could mediate low-V and high-V inactivation phenotypes in <italic>Exaiptasia</italic> nematocytes. To investigate this question, we heterologously expressed each β subunit isoform with other well-characterized Ca<sub>V</sub> subunits (mammalian Ca<sub>V</sub> α and α2δ) that express well in heterologous systems. Both channels exhibited functional Ca<sub>V</sub> currents with similar activation thresholds (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></bold>). However, EdCa<sub>V</sub>β1- and EdCa<sub>V</sub>β2-containing channels significantly differed in their inactivation properties. EdCa<sub>V</sub>β1 inactivated at negative voltages, similar to channels containing <italic>Nematostella</italic> Ca<sub>V</sub>β (NveCa<sub>V</sub>β). In contrast, EdCa<sub>V</sub>β2 mediated Ca<sub>V</sub> currents with weak inactivation, more like channels containing rat Ca<sub>V</sub>β (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">D</xref></bold>). Thus, EdCa<sub>V</sub>β1 and EdCa<sub>V</sub>β2 confer strong and weak inactivation, respectively, and are expressed in distinct nematocytes, consistent with low-V and high-V threshold inactivating nematocyte populations. Genomic alignment revealed that alternative splicing at the N-terminus gives rise to EdCa<sub>V</sub>β1 and EdCa<sub>V</sub>β2 isoforms, serving as a mechanism to dynamically tune nematocyte physiology and potentially stinging behavior in contrast to adaptation through gene duplication and divergence (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref></bold>). Furthermore, by expressing two functional variants, <italic>Exaiptasia</italic> could use distinct nematocyte populations for different behaviors, including a less pronounced role for predation.</p>

<p>To explore evolutionary relationships of Ca<sub>V</sub>β, we constructed a phylogenetic tree of sequences from various cnidarians including <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic> (anemone, NveCa<sub>V</sub>β), <italic>Exaiptasia diaphana</italic> (anemone, EdCa<sub>V</sub>β1 and EdCa<sub>V</sub>β2)<italic>, Cyanea capillata</italic> (jellyfish, CcCa<sub>V</sub>β), <italic>Physalia physalis</italic> (hydrozoan, PpCa<sub>V</sub>β), <italic>Clytia hemisphaerica</italic> (jellyfish, ChCa<sub>V</sub>β), <italic>Cassiopea xamachana</italic> (jellyfish, CxCa<sub>V</sub>β), and the Rat β subunit (rCavβ2) as an outgroup (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref></bold>). Sequence comparison across all amino acid positions revealed that the N-terminus exhibited the greatest sequence diversity (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref></bold>), consistent with previous findings showing extensive alternative splicing in this region in other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Helton and Horne, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Helton et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Takahashi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Foell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Vendel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Ebert et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Buraei and Yang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Siller et al., 2022</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Collectively, our studies on cnidarian stinging, here and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Weir et al., 2020</xref>), reveal different behavior in the primarily predatory anemone <italic>Nematostella</italic> versus the symbiotic anemone <italic>Exaiptasia</italic>. This study used a combination of theory and experimentation to uncover the molecular basis of regulation of the divergent behavior of <italic>Exaiptasia</italic> that uses stinging primarily for defense. Indeed, <italic>Exaiptasia</italic> obtains a large fraction of its energy and nutrients from endosymbiotic algae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Muscatine et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Shick and Dykens, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Steen, 1988</xref>), thus reducing overall pressure to predate. This finding is consistent with a common ecological theme in which symbiotic relationships are established whereby one partner provides food and the other provides shelter and defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lehnert et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bucher et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, it is plausible that synergistic selection drives higher investment in defensive structures to protect symbiotic species.</p>
<p>Our results demonstrate that molecular adaptations tune distinct stinging behavior: <italic>Nematostella</italic> Ca<sub>V</sub>β confers an unusually low threshold for inactivation, basally inhibiting nematocytes unless they are exposed to synergistic prey cues: chemical (hyperpolarizing to relieve inactivation) and mechanical (depolarizing to recruit available Ca<sub>V</sub> channels and elicit stinging) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Weir et al., 2020</xref>). These physiological mechanisms reflect a stinging strategy suited to opportunistic predation by <italic>Nematostella</italic>, which burrow within shallow marshes and sting unsuspecting prey. Consistent with the predictions of optimal control theory, <italic>Nematostella</italic> increased stinging with starvation, suggesting that evolution has shaped its stinging response to maximize benefits for predation. In contrast, <italic>Exaiptasia</italic> nematocytes contain a functionally specialized splice variant of Ca<sub>V</sub>β to mediate high threshold voltage-dependent Ca<sub>V</sub> inactivation, consistent with Ca<sub>V</sub> channel availability to amplify depolarizing signals from rest and stinging in response to touch alone. Thus, <italic>Exaiptasia</italic> physiology is consistent with an indiscriminate stinging strategy for defense, necessary for survival in an exposed environment that facilitates endosymbiotic photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Muscatine et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Shick and Dykens, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Steen, 1988</xref>). Consistent with the predictions of optimal control theory, <italic>Exaiptasia</italic> stinging was nearly independent of starvation, suggesting that evolution has shaped the stinging response to maximize benefits for defense. Using molecular information gleaned from analyzing these two cnidarians, we find that Ca<sub>V</sub>β variation across cnidarians mediates differences in voltage-dependent inactivation, which could contribute to differences in stinging behavior. Thus, our study provides an example by which alternative splicing could account for adaptation across this diverse plethora of organisms and habitats.</p>
<p>While theory predicts robust trends for optimal predation and defense independent of environment, the precise nature of the predicted behavior does depend on the environment. In vivo, stinging is likely influenced by stimulus identity and intensity, background turbulence, and other factors. For example, cnidarians may have evolved distinct innate responses for different prey and use chemical sensing to enact the appropriate stinging response. In this case, optimal control theory can be used to predict the optimal response to known salient environmental cues. Alternatively, cnidarians may learn that specific prey are palatable and easy to catch through repeated exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Botton-Amiot et al., 2023</xref>). In this example, optimal control theory must be replaced by reinforcement learning as the likelihood of successful predation and its cost and benefits (the environment) are unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sutton and Barto, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Indeed, stinging is a complex process mediated by numerous molecular components and cell types that could be subject to evolutionary change or acute modulation. Cnidarians occupy diverse ecological niches and experience varying metabolic demands, predatory challenges, and other survival pressures that could influence stinging behavior. Beyond cnidarians with stationary lifestyles that support photosynthetic endosymbionts (symbiotic anemones, corals, sea pens) and those that use opportunistic “sit-and-wait” ambush predatory strategies (burrowing anemones, siphonophores), others have evolved mobile lifestyles to actively capture prey (jellyfish) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Muscatine et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Shick and Dykens, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Steen, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fraune et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Damian-Serrano et al., 2022</xref>). Stinging by mobile cnidarians could be subject to different physical demands, such as mechanical disturbance from increased turbulence that could necessitate distinct molecular control. Furthermore, stinging can be influenced by acute factors such as physiological state and various sensory cues, including chemicals, touch, or light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Pantin, 1942</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Giebel et al., 1988</xref>;</p>

Thus, further inquiry into modulation of stinging across physiological states such as nutritional condition, altered symbiotic relationships, or developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sandberg et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Columbus-Shenkar et al., 2018</xref>) could reveal dynamic regulation by synaptic connections, hormones, or modulation of transcriptional or translational programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Westfall et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Westfall, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Weir et al., 2020</xref>). Importantly, across all these scenarios, nematocytes remain single-use cells, so it is essential that signaling cascades control discharge in response to the most salient environmental stimuli. Overall, this study demonstrates how studying evolutionary novelties like stinging behavior can yield broad insight into signal transduction and cellular decision making.</p>

For ddPCR experiments, droplet generation (QX200™ Droplet Generator BioRad Cat #1864002) and transfer of droplets to ddPCR™ 96-Well Plates (Bio-Rad Cat #12001925) were performed according to manufacturer’s instructions (Instruction Manual, QX200™ Droplet Generator – Bio-Rad). Custom primers and probes and One-Step RT-ddPCR Advanced Kit for Probes (Bio-Rad Cat #1864021) reaction reagents and Droplet Generation Oil for Probes (Bio-Rad Cat #1863005) were sourced from Bio-Rad (see Key Resources Table for primer and probe sequences). The ddPCR plate was sealed with a Pierceable Foil Heat Seal (Bio-Rad Cat #1814040) and the PX1™ PCR Plate Sealer (Bio-Rad Cat #1814000). Plates were transferred to a Bio-Rad Thermalcycler C1000 (Bio-Rad Cat #1851197).

For <italic>Nematostella</italic> nematocyte recordings, voltage-dependent inactivation was measured during a 200ms activating pulse of −20mV following a series of 1s pre-pulses ranging from −110mV to 30mV, holding at −110mV. Voltage-gated currents were measured through a series of 200ms voltage pulses in 10mV increments from −110mV to 70mV, holding at −110mV. For <italic>Exaiptasia</italic> nematocyte recordings, voltage-dependent inactivation was measured during a 200ms activating pulse of 0mV following a series of 1s pre-pulses ranging from −110mV to 30mV, holding at - 110mV.

<p>For whole-cell recordings in HEK293 cells, pipettes were 3-6MΩ.

For Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents in heterologously expressed channels, voltage-dependent inactivation was measured in one of two ways: (1) during an activating pulse of 0mV following a series of 1s pre-pulses ranging from −110mV to 50mV and holding potential of −80mV; or (2) during an activating pulse of 0mV following a series of 1s pre-pulses ranging from −110mV to 80mV and holding potential of −90mV. Voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents were measured in response to 200ms voltage pulses in 10mV increments from −130mV to 80mV with −110mV holding potential. Voltage-dependent inactivation was quantified as I/I<sub>max</sub>, with I<sub>max</sub> occurring at the voltage pulse following a −110mV prepulse. In some instances, inactivation curves could not be fitted with a Boltzmann equation and were instead fitted with an exponential.

For assaying discharge, 5 mm round coverslips were coated with a solution of 25% gelatin (w/v) dissolved in NSW (for <italic>Exaiptasia</italic>) or 1/3 NSW (for <italic>Nematostella</italic>) and allowed to cure 3-4 hr prior to use. Coverslips were presented to the animal’s tentacles for 5 seconds and then immediately imaged at 20X magnification using a transmitted light source. To assay behavioral responses to prey-derived chemicals, freshly hatched brine shrimp were flash frozen and ground to a powder with a mortar and pestle (Fisherbrand), then filtered through a 0.22µm syringe filter (VWR Cat #28145-501) and osmolarity adjusted for the specific anemone species. Coverslips were submerged in prey extract for 10 seconds then immediately presented to the animal. Nematocytes visualized on coverslips were only those that embedded in the gelatin after discharge. For experiments using pharmacological agents such as CdCl<sub>2</sub>, coverslips were submerged in a solution of 1M (<italic>Exaiptasia</italic>) or 10mM (<italic>Nematostella</italic>) Cd<sup>2+</sup> in milli-Q water for 10 seconds then immediately presented to the animal.

<title>Mathematical model: Optimal control theory for the stinging response</title>
<p>To model <italic>Nematostella,</italic> we assume the agent stings for predation. We thus introduce the state of satiation, <italic>s</italic>, that ranges from 0 to 1; at <italic>s</italic> = 0 the agent is most satiated and at <italic>s</italic> = 1 the agent is most starved. At each time step, the agent decides to perform an action (sting), <italic>a</italic>, representing the intensity of the attack; <italic>a</italic> ranges from 0 to 1, and is experimentally compared to the fraction of nematocytes fired in the behavioral assay. Each action has a cost that is proportional to the fraction of nematocysts that are fired, <italic>c</italic>(<italic>a</italic>) = <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub><italic>a</italic> where <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> is the cost of discharging all nematocysts at once, or cost of full discharge, and we consider <italic>c</italic><sub>!</sub> constant. Each stinging event has a probability <italic>p</italic>(<italic>a</italic>) of achieving successful predation, where <italic>p</italic>(<italic>a</italic>) increases with <italic>a</italic> (more intense attacks are more costly and more likely to succeed). A successful attack leads to the transition to the next state <italic>s</italic>′ where the agent is more satiated <italic>s</italic> → <italic>s</italic>′ = <italic>s</italic> − 1 whereas a failed attack leads to higher starvation state <italic>s</italic> → <italic>s</italic>′ = <italic>s</italic> + 1. The most starved state is absorbing, which is equivalent to a point of no return. A reward <italic>r</italic>(<italic>s</italic>′) is assigned to the state of satiation reached upon attack, indicating its desirability (<italic>r</italic>(<italic>s</italic>′) is a decreasing function of <italic>s</italic>′), and the most starved state entails a starvation penalty <italic>r</italic>(1) &lt; 0. Without loss of generality, all costs and rewards are normalized to the penalty of starvation, hence penalty of starvation is <italic>r</italic>(1) = −1. Our goal is to choose actions that maximize the expected sum of all future net rewards (reward - cost) for each state, which is called the value function. As customary in infinite horizon problems, we ensure convergence of the value function by introducing an effective horizon, i.e. by discounting exponentially rewards that are further in the future with a discount rate <italic>γ</italic> &lt; 1.</p>
<p>The optimal value of a state, <italic>V</italic><sup>∗</sup>(<italic>s</italic>) and the corresponding optimal action <italic>a</italic><sup>∗</sup>(<italic>s</italic>) are obtained by solving the Bellman Optimality equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bellman, 2003</xref>).

<p>With the boundary condition <italic>V</italic><sup>∗</sup>(1) = 0. We solve these equations numerically with the value iteration algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sutton and Barto, 2018</xref>) and analytically under the assumption that <italic>a</italic><sup>∗</sup>(<italic>s</italic>) varies slowly with <italic>s</italic> (details of the asymptotic method can be found in <bold><italic>Supplementary Information</italic></bold>). The asymptotic solution reproduces well the numerical results (compare lines and symbols in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> right, where we used <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> = 1 and <italic>p</italic> = <italic>p<sub>M</sub></italic>(2 – <italic>a</italic><sup>2</sup>) and <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub> = 0.8 and showcased three different functional forms for <italic>r</italic>(<italic>s</italic>), <italic>r</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) = 10 <italic>tan</italic><sup>−1</sup> (1 − <italic>s</italic>); <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="545144v1_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and <italic>r</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) = 3 − 3<italic>s</italic><sup>2</sup>). We also explored how well the asymptotic result can capture the trend of the numerical result by varying the parameters in these three different forms for the reward (SI). The approximate solution is used to demonstrate that the stinging response increases with starvation under broad conditions, i.e. as long as <italic>r</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) and <italic>p</italic>(<italic>a</italic>) are concave functions and c(a) is convex (see <bold><italic>Supplementary Information</italic></bold>). To exemplify the importance of acting optimally to save resources, we considered two agents, one acting optimally and one acting randomly i.e. shooting with a number of nematocysts uniformly distributed between <italic>a</italic><sub>min</sub> and <italic>a<sub>max</sub></italic>. Both agents start at the same starvation state (<italic>s</italic> = 0.9 in <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>) and use on average the same number of nematocysts, but the random agent reaches starvation typically in tens of steps, whereas the optimal agent converges to a steady state (around <italic>s</italic> = 0.3 in the figure) and hardly ever reaches severe starvation.</p>
<p>To model <italic>Exaiptasia</italic>, we assume the agent stings for defense, thus the associated Markov process models transitions between the states of safety, which we indicate with <italic>L,</italic> and danger, which we indicate with <italic>D</italic>. The state of satiation is not affected by stinging and instead is dictated by a separate process that relies on symbionts and which we do not model. Similar to the previous model, the agent chooses an action, <italic>a</italic>, representing the intensity of the attack. Each attack has a likelihood to succeed <italic>p</italic>(<italic>a</italic>) and an associated cost <italic>c</italic>(<italic>a</italic>) = <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub><italic>a</italic> where <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> is the cost of full discharge of all nematocysts at once. A successful attack allows the animal to remain in state <italic>L</italic> and receive a unit reward; a failed attack leads to state <italic>D</italic> and penalty −1. <italic>F</italic> is an absorbing state hence <italic>V</italic><sup>∗</sup>(<italic>F</italic>) = 0. The optimal value and action in state <italic>L</italic> follow:

Assuming a specific form <italic>p</italic> = <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub><italic>a</italic>(2 − <italic>a</italic>) leads to the specific solution <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="545144v1_inline3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> where <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="545144v1_inline4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="545144v1_inline5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. If <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> is constant, there is a non-trivial optimal action as long as <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> &lt; 2<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub>(2 − <italic>γ</italic>) and clearly the optimal action does not depend on starvation (constant solution in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>, right, with <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> = 1; <italic>γ</italic> = 0.99 and <italic>p<sub>M</sub></italic> = 0.8).</p>
<p>Stinging predators does not improve nutritional state, thus transitions among different starvation states are not modelled for defensive stinging, but instead rely heavily on symbionts. However, to capture subtle effects of starvation on defensive stinging, we note that the cost of discharging nematocysts may still depend parametrically on whatever state of starvation the agent happens to be in. In this case, <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> = <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub>(<italic>s</italic>) and under the assumption that the cost increases with starvation, we find that optimal defensive stinging always decrease with starvation, for any functional form of <italic>p</italic> (see <bold><italic>Supplementary Information</italic></bold> for more details). The result is exemplified in <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref></bold> (solutions that vary with starvation) using three functional forms for <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub>(<italic>s</italic>): <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> = <italic>s</italic>; <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> = 1 − (<italic>s</italic> − 1)<sup>2</sup>, and a third function obtained by fitting the experimental data as described in the <bold><italic>Supplementary Information</italic></bold>. Hence for defensive stinging, the optimal strategy is either independent of starvation or may decrease with starvation.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Data were analyzed with Clampfit (Axon Instruments), Prism (GraphPad), or QuantaSoft (BioRad Laboratories) and are represented as mean ± sem. <italic>n</italic> represents independent experiments for the number of cells/patches or behavioral trials. Data were considered significant if p &lt; 0.05 using paired or unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-tests or one-or two-way ANOVAs. All significance tests were justified considering the experimental design and we assumed normal distribution and variance, as is common for similar experiments. Sample sizes were chosen based on the number of independent experiments required for statistical significance and technical feasibility.</p>

<p>This manuscript by He et al. explores the molecular basis of the different stinging behaviors of two related anemones. The freshwater Nematostella which only stings when a food stimulus is presented with mechanical stimulation and the saltwater Exaiptasia which stings in response to mechanical stimuli. The authors had previously shown that Nematostella stinging is calcium-dependent and mediated by a voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) with very pronounced voltage-dependent inactivation, which gets removed upon hyperpolarization produced by taste receptors.</p>
<p>In this manuscript, they show that Exaiptacia and Nematostella differing stinging behavior is near optimal, according to their ecological niche, and conforms to predictions from a Markov decision model.</p>
<p>It is also shown that Exaiptacia stinging is also calcium-dependent, but the calcium channel responsible is much less inactivated at resting potential and can readily induce nematocyte discharge only in the presence of mechanical stimulation. To this end, the authors record calcium currents from Exaipacia nematocysts and discover that the VGCCs in this anemone are not strongly inactivated and thus are easily activated by mechanical stimuli-induced depolarization accounting for the different stinging behavior between species. The authors further explore the role of the auxiliary beta subunit in the modulation of VGCC inactivation and show that different n-terminal splice variants in Exaiptacia produce strong and weak voltage-dependent inactivation.</p>
<p>The manuscript is clear and well-written and the conclusions are in general supported by the experiments and analysis. The findings are very relevant to increase our understanding of the molecular basis of non-neural behavior and its evolutionary basis. This manuscript should be of general interest to biologists as well as to more specialized fields such as ion channel biophysics and physiology.</p>
<p>Some findings need to be clarified and perhaps additional experiments performed.</p>
<p>1. The authors identify by sequencing that the Exaiptacia Cav is a P-type channel (cacna1a). However, the biophysical properties of the nematocyte channel are different from mammalian P-type channels. The cnidarian channel inactivation is exceedingly rapid and activation happens at relatively low voltages. These substantial differences should be mentioned and commented on.</p>
<p>2. The currents from Nematostella in Figure 3d seem to be poorly voltage-clamped. Poor voltage-clamp is also evident in the sudden increase of conductance in Figure 3C and might contribute to incorrect estimation of voltage dependence of activation and if present in inactivation experiments, also to incorrect estimation of the inactivation voltage range. This problem should be reassessed with new data.</p>
<p>3. While co-expression of the mouse Cav channel with the beta1 isoform from Exaiptacia indeed shifts inactivation to more negative voltages, it does not recapitulate the phenotype of the more inactivated Ca-currents in nematocytes (compare Figures 4d and 5d). It should be explained if this might be due to the use of a mammalian alpha subunit. Related to this, did the authors clone the alpha subunit from Exaiptacia? Using this to characterize the effect of beta subunits on inactivation might be more accurate.</p>
<p>4. The in situ shown in Figure 4b are difficult to follow for a non-expert in cnidarian anatomy. Some guidance should be provided to understand the structures. Also, for the left panels, is the larger panel the two-channel image? If so, blue would indicate co-localization of the two isoforms and there seems to be a red mark in the same nematocyte.</p>

<p>This manuscript links the distinctive stinging behavior of sea anemones in different ecological niches to varying inactivation properties of voltage-gated calcium channels that are conferred by the identity of auxiliary Cavbeta subunits. Previous work from the Bellono lab established that the burrowing anemone, Nematostella vectensis, expresses a CaV channel that is strongly inactivated at rest which requires a simultaneous delivery of prey extract and touch to elicit a stinging response, reflecting a precise stinging control adapted for predation. They show here that by contrast, the anemone Exaiptasia diaphana which inhabits exposed environments, indiscriminately stings for defense even in the absence of prey chemicals, and that this is enabled by the expression of a CaVbeta splice variant that confers weak inactivation. They further use the heterologous expression of CaV channels with wild type and chimeric anemone Cavbeta subunits to infer that the variable N-termini are important determinants of Cav channel inactivation properties.</p>
<p>1. The authors found that Exaiptasia nematocytes could be characterized by two distinct inactivation phenotypes: (1) nematocytes with low-voltage threshold inactivation similar to that of Nematostella (Vi1/2 = ~ -85mV); and (2) a distinct population with weak, high-voltage threshold inactivation (Vi1/2 = ~ -48mV). What were the relative fractions of low-voltage and high-voltage nematocytes? Do the low-voltage Exaiptasia nematocytes behave similarly to Nematostella nematocytes with respect to requiring both prey extract and touch to discharge?</p>
<p>2. The authors state in Fig 3 legend and in the results that Exaiptasia nematocyte voltage-gated Ca2+ currents have weak inactivation compared with Nematostella. This description is imprecise and inaccurate. Figure 3 in fact shows that Exaiptasia nematocyte voltage-gated Ca2+ currents display a faster rate of inactivation compared to Nematostella Ca2+ currents. A sub-population of Exaiptasia nematocytes does display less resting state (or steady-state) inactivation compared to Nematostella Ca2+ currents. The authors need to be more accurate and qualify what type of inactivation property they are talking about.</p>
<p>3. In a similar vein, the authors need to be more accurate when referring to 'rat beta' used in heterologous expression experiments. It should be made explicit throughout the manuscript that the rat beta isoform used is rat beta2a. Among the distinct beta isoforms, beta2a is unique in being palmitoylated at the N-terminus which confers a characteristic slow rate of inactivation and a right-shifted voltage-dependence of steady-state inactivation consistent with the data shown in Fig. 4D. Almost all other rat beta isoforms do not have these properties.</p>
<p>4. The profiling of the impact of different Cnidarian Cavbeta subunits on reconstituted Ca2+ channel current waveforms is nice (Fig 5 and Fig 5S1). The N-terminus sequence of EdCaVβ2 is different from palmitoylated rat beta2a, though both have similar properties in showing slow inactivation and a right-shifted voltage-dependence of steady-state inactivation. Does EdCaVβ2 target autonomously the plasma membrane when expressed in cells? If so, this would reconcile with what was previously known and provide a rational explanation for the observed functional impact of the distinct Cavbetas.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The present article attempts to answer both the ultimate question of why different stinging behaviours have evolved in Cnidiarians with different ecological niches and shed light on the proximate question of which electro-physiological mechanisms underlie these distinct behaviours.</p>
<p>Account of major methods and results:</p>
<p>
In the first part of the paper, the authors try to answer the ultimate question of why distinct dependencies of the sting response on internal starvation levels have evolved. The premise of the article that Exaiptasia's nematocyte discharge is independent of the presence of prey (Artemia nauplii) as compared to Nematostella's significant dependence of the discharge on the presence of actual prey, is shown be a robust phenomenon justified by the data in Figure 1.</p>
<p>The hypothesis that defensive vs. predatory stinging leads to different nematocyte discharge behaviours is analysed in mathematical models based on the suitable framework of optimal control/decision theory. By assuming functional relations between the:</p>
<p>1. cost of a full nematocyte discharge and the starvation level.</p>
<p>2. probability of successful predation/avoidance on the discharge level.</p>
<p>3. desirability/reward of the reached nutritional state.</p>
<p>Based on these assumptions of environmental and internal influences, the optimal choice of attack intensity is calculated using Bellman's equation for this problem. The model predictions are validated using counted nematocytes on a coverslip. The scaling of normalised nematocyte discharge numbers with scaled starvation time is qualitatively comparable to what is predicted from the models. The abundance of nematocytes in the tentacles was, on the other hand, independent of the starvation state of the animals.</p>
<p>Next, the authors turn to investigate the proximate cause of the differential stinging behaviour. The authors have previously reported convincing evidence that a strongly inactivating Cav2.1 channel ortholog (nCav) is used by Nematostella to prevent stinging in the absence of prey (Weir et al. 2020). This inactivation is released by hyperpolarising sensory inputs signalling the presence of prey. In this article, it is clearly shown by blocking respective currents that Exaiptasia, too, relies on extracellular Ca2+ influx to initiate stinging. Patch clamp data of the involved currents is provided in support. However, the authors find that in addition to the nCav with a low-inactivation threshold, Exaiptasia has a splice variant with a higher inactivation threshold expressed (Figure 3D).</p>
<p>The authors hypothesise that it is this high-threshold nCav channel population that amplifies any voltage depolarisation to release a sting irrespective of the presence of prey signals. They found that the β subunit that is responsible for Nematostella's unusually low inactivation threshold exists in Exaiptasia as two alternative splice isoforms. These N-terminus variants also showed the greatest variation in a phylogenetic comparison (Figure 5), rendering it a candidate target for mutations causing variation in stinging responses.</p>
<p>Appraisal of methodology in support of the conclusions:</p>
<p>
The authors base their inference on a normative model that yields quantitative predictions which is an exciting and challenging approach. The authors take care in stating the model assumptions as well as showing that the data indeed does not contradict their model predictions. The interesting comparative nature of the modelling part of the study is complicated by slightly different cost assumptions for the two scenarios. Hence, Figure 2 needs to be carefully digested by readers.</p>
<p>It would be even more prudent to analyse the same set of cost-of-discharge vs. starvation scenarios for both species. Specifically, for Nematostella the complete cost-of-discharge vs starvation-state curves as for Exaiptasia (Figure 2E, example 2-4) could be used. It is likely that the differential effect size of Nematostella and Exaiptasia behaviour is the strongest if only the flat cost-of-discharge vs starvation is used (Figure 2A) for Nematostella. But as a worst-case comparison the other curves, where the cost to the animal scales with starvation would be a good comparison. This could help the reader to understand when the different prediction of Nematostella's behaviour breaks down. In addition, this minor change could shed light on broader topics like common trade-offs in pursuit predation.</p>
<p>The qualitatively similar scaling of the model-derived relation between starvation and sting intensity with the counted nematocytes for different feeding pauses is evidence that feeding has indeed been optimised for the two distinct ecological niches.</p>
<p>
To prove that Exaiptasia uses a similar Ca2+ channel ortholog as well as a different splice variant, the authors employed both clean electrophysiological characterisaiton (Figure 3) as well as transcriptomics data (Figure 4S1).</p>
<p>To strengthen the authors' hypothesis that variation in the N-termini leads to changes in Ca2+ channel inactivation and hence altered stinging, the response sequence variability of 6 Cnidaria was analysed.</p>
<p>Additional context:</p>
<p>
Although, the present article focuses on nematocytes alone, currently, there has been a refocus in neurobiology on the nervous systems of more basal metazoans, which received much attention already in the works of Romanes (1885). In part, this is driven by the goal to understand the early evolution of nervous systems. Cnidarians and Ctenophors are exciting model organisms in this venture. This will hopefully be accompanied by more comparative studies like the present one. Some of the recent literature also uses computational models to understand mechanisms of motor behaviour using full-body simulations (Pallasdies et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2023), which can be thought of as complementary to the normative modelling provided by the authors.</p>
<p>Comparative studies of recent Cnidarians, such as the present article, can shed light on speculative ideas on the origin of nervous systems (Jékely, Keijzer, and Godfrey-Smith 2015). During a time (the Ediacarium/Cambrium transition) that has seen the genesis of complex trophic foodwebs with preditor-prey interaction, symbioses, but also an increase of body sizes and shapes, multiple ultimate causes can be envisioned that drove the increase in behavioural complexity. The authors show that not all of it needs to be implemented in dedicated nerve cells.</p>
