<abstract>
<p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 exhibits remarkable genetic diversity. An effective HIV-1 vaccine must therefore elicit antibodies that can neutralize many variants of the virus. While broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) have been isolated from HIV-1 infected individuals, a general understanding of the virus-antibody coevolutionary processes that lead to their development remains incomplete. We performed a quantitative study of HIV-1 evolution in humans and rhesus macaques, including individuals who developed bnAbs. We observed strong selection early in infection for mutations affecting HIV-1 envelope glycosylation and escape from autologous strain-specific antibodies, followed by weaker selection for bnAb resistance. The inferred fitness effects of HIV-1 mutations in humans and macaques were remarkably similar. Moreover, we observed a striking pattern of rapid HIV-1 fitness gains that precedes the development of bnAbs. Our work highlights strong parallels between infection in rhesus macaques and humans, and it reveals a quantitative evolutionary signature of bnAb development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) rapidly mutates and proliferates in infected individuals. The immune system is a major driver of HIV-1 evolution, as the virus accumulates mutations to escape from host T cells and antibodies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Due to the chronic nature of HIV-1 infection, coupled with high rates of mutation and replication, HIV-1 genetic diversity within and between infected individuals is incredibly high. Genetic diversity challenges vaccine development, as vaccine-elicited antibodies must be able to neutralize many strains of the virus to protect against infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>However, there exist rare antibodies that are capable of neutralizing a broad range of HIV-1 viruses. These broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) have therefore been the subject of intense research <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Eliciting bnAbs through vaccination remains a major goal of HIV-1 vaccine design. However, the development of exceptionally broad antibody responses is rare, and such antibodies typically develop only after several years of infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Recent years have yielded important insights into the coevolutionary process between HIV-1 and antibodies that sometimes leads to the development of bnAbs. Clinical studies have collected serial samples of HIV-1 sequences from a few individuals who developed bnAbs and characterized the resulting antibodies, their developmental stages, and binding sites <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. The contributions of HIV-1 and its coevolution to bnAb development are complex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. High viral loads and viral diversity have been positively associated with bnAb development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. However, superinfection, which can vastly increase HIV-1 diversity, is not always associated with bnAb development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, and it does not appear to broaden antibody responses in the absence of other factors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Here, we sought to characterize the evolutionary dynamics of HIV-1 that accompany the development of bnAbs in clinical data. In particular, we inferred the landscape of selective pressures that shape the evolution of HIV-1 within hosts, reflecting the effects of the immune environment. We first analyzed data from two individuals who developed bnAbs within a few years after HIV-1 infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. In both individuals, HIV-1 mutations inferred to be the most beneficial were observed early in infection. In general, mutations that provided resistance to autologous strain-specific antibodies were inferred to be more strongly selected than ones that escaped from bnAbs. We also observed clusters of beneficial mutations along the HIV-1 genome, which were associated with envelope protein (Env) structure.</p>
<p>To confirm the generality of these patterns in a broader sample, we studied recent data from rhesus macaques (RMs) infected with simian-human immunodeficiency viruses (SHIV) that incorporated HIV-1 Env proteins derived from the two individuals above <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. This study also compared patterns of Env evolution in HIV-1 and SHIV in response to host immunity. We observed striking parallels between the inferred fitness effects of Env mutations in RMs and humans, suggesting highly similar selective pressures on the virus despite different host species and differences in individual immune responses. Furthermore, we found that RMs that developed broad, potent antibody responses could clearly be distinguished from those with narrowly focused responses using the evolutionary dynamics of the virus. Specifically, the virus population in individuals who developed greater breadth was distinguished by larger and more rapid gains in fitness than in other individuals. Collectively, these results show high similarity between SHIV evolutionary dynamics in RMs and HIV-1 in humans, and that viral fitness gain is associated with antibody breadth.</p>

<title>Quantifying HIV-1 evolutionary dynamics</title>
<p>We studied HIV-1 evolution accompanying the development of bnAbs in two donors, CH505 and CH848, enrolled in the Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology 001 acute infection cohort <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. CH505 developed the CD4 binding site-targeting bnAb CH103, which was first detectable 14 weeks after HIV-1 infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. CH103 maturation was found to be associated with viral escape from another antibody lineage, CH235, that ultimately developed significant breadth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. CH848 developed a bnAb, DH270, targeting a glycosylated site near the third variable loop (V3) of Env <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Similar to the bnAb development process in CH505, escape from “cooperating” DH272 and DH475 lineage antibodies was observed to contribute to the maturation of DH270 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>).</p>
<p>To quantify HIV-1 evolutionary dynamics, we sought to infer a fitness model that best explained the changes in the genetic composition of the viral population observed in each individual over time. We assume that the effect on viral fitness of each individual mutation <italic>a</italic> at each site <italic>i</italic> is quantified by a selection coefficient <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>a</italic>), with positive coefficients <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>a</italic>) <italic>&gt;</italic> 0 denoting mutations that are beneficial for the virus and <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>a</italic>) <italic>&lt;</italic> 0 denoting deleterious ones. We further assume that the cumulative fitness effects of mutations are additive, such that the overall fitness <italic>F</italic> of a viral sequence is given by the sum of the selection coefficients for all the mutations that it bears. Following this model, we can then quantify the probability of any evolutionary history of the viral population (i.e., the distribution of viral genotypes over time) as a function of the selection coefficients (Methods). We then used MPL <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> to infer the selection coefficients that best fit the viral dynamics observed in data from CH505 and CH848 (Methods). This approach has been successfully applied to study the evolution of HIV-1 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>), as well as SARS-CoV-2 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>) and experimental evolution in bacteria <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Broad patterns of HIV-1 selection</title>
<p>While the great majority of HIV-1 mutations were inferred to be neutral (<italic>s</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>a</italic>) ∼0), a few mutations substantially increase viral fitness (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).

<p>To quantify patterns of selection in Env, we examined the top 2% of mutations inferred to be the most beneficial in CH505 and CH848. The fractions of nonsynonymous mutations within these subsets were 97% and 92% for CH505 and CH848, respectively. These fractions are significantly higher than chance expectations (<italic>p</italic> = 6.7 ×10<sup>−3</sup> and 5.6 ×10<sup>−4</sup>, Fisher’s exact test; Methods), supporting the model’s ability to accurately infer fitness effects in this data. For CH505, we found 10.9-fold more strongly beneficial mutations in the first variable loop (V1) than expected by chance (<italic>p</italic> = 2.5× 10<sup>−3</sup>). This is consistent with the presence of V1 mutations conferring resistance to autologous strain-specific antibodies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Mutations in V4, a region targeted by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, were also 10.0-fold enriched in this subset (<italic>p</italic> = 9.0 ×10<sup>−5</sup>). For CH848, mutations in V1, V3, and V5 were enriched by factors of 14.2, 6.3, and 19.1 among the top 2% most beneficial mutations (<italic>p</italic> = 5.9 ×10<sup>−10</sup>, 6.6 ×10<sup>−3</sup>, and 4.8× 10<sup>−6</sup>). Mutations in these regions were shown to play a role in resistance to DH270 and DH475 lineage antibodies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Reversions and mutations affecting N-linked glycosylation motifs were also likely to be beneficial. We define reversions as mutations where the transmitted/founder (TF) amino acid changes to match the subtype consensus sequence at the same site. Among the top 2% most beneficial mutations, reversions were enriched by factors of 19.9 and 17.8 for CH505 and CH848 viruses, respectively (<italic>p</italic> = 2.1 ×10<sup>−8</sup> and 8.5 ×10<sup>−13</sup>), consistent with past work finding strong selection for reversions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. For CH848, this group also includes several strongly selected mutations observed in Nef (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), a protein that plays multiple roles during HIV-1 infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Mutations affecting N-linked glycosylation motifs (i.e., by adding, removing, or shifting a glycosylation motif) were enriched by factors of 4.6 (<italic>p</italic> = 7.0 ×10<sup>−3</sup>) and 8. 7(<italic>p</italic> = 1.4 ×10<sup>−10</sup>). Changes in glycosylation patterns contributed to antibody escape for both CH505 and CH848 (refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Selection for antibody escape</title>
<p>To quantify levels of selection for antibody escape, we computed selection coefficients for mutations that were observed to contribute to resistance to bnAbs as well as bnAb precursors and autologous strain-specific antibodies (<xref rid="tblS1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Tables 1</xref><bold>-3</bold>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. We mapped the inferred selection coefficients to the Env protein structure <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, highlighting the binding sites for bnAbs and resistance mutations for strain-specific antibodies, as well as important parts of Env (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). We also analyzed when these resistance mutations were first observed in each individual.</p>
<p>Overall, we observed stronger selection for escape from autologous strain-specific antibodies and/or changes in glycosylation during the first six months of infection (<xref rid="tblS4" ref-type="table">Supplementary Tables 4</xref><bold>-5</bold>). This was then followed by more modest selection for escape from bnAb lineages (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). For CH505, mutations that conferred resistance to the intermediate-breadth CH235 lineage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> were less beneficial than top mutations escaping from strain-specific antibodies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). In turn, resistance mutations for the broader CH103 lineage were less beneficial than CH235 resistance mutations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). CH848 is similar, with some highly beneficial mutations affecting glycosylation observed early in infection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). While a few mutations affecting DH270 appear strongly selected, these mutations appeared long before the DH270 lineage was detected (around 3.5 years after infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>). Thus, these mutations may have initially been selected for other reasons.</p>

<title>Consistent patterns of selection in SHIV evolution</title>
<p>Simian-human immunodeficiency viruses (SHIVs) have numerous applications in HIV/AIDS research <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Recently, Roark and collaborators studied SHIV-antibody coevolution in rhesus macaques (RMs), which they compared with patterns of HIV-1 evolution <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Two of the SHIV constructs in this study included envelope sequences derived from CH505 and CH848 transmitted/founder (TF) viruses. There, it was found that 2 out of 10 RMs inoculated with SHIV.CH505 and 2 out of 6 RMs inoculated with SHIV.CH848 developed antibodies with substantial breadth.</p>
<p>To understand whether the patterns of HIV-1 selection observed in CH505 and CH848 are repeatable, and to search for viral factors that distinguish between individuals who develop bnAbs and those who do not, we analyzed SHIV.CH505 and SHIV.CH848 evolution in RMs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. To prevent spurious inferences, we first omitted data from RMs with &lt;3 sampling times or &lt;4 sequences in total (Methods). After processing, we examined evolutionary data from 7 RMs inoculated with SHIV.CH505 and 6 RMs inoculated with SHIV.CH848 (<xref rid="tblS6" ref-type="table">Supplementary Tables 6</xref><bold>-7</bold>). We then computed selection coefficients for SHIV mutations within each RM. Reasoning that selective pressures across SHIV.CH505 and SHIV.CH848 viruses are likely to be similar, we also inferred two sets of joint selection coefficients that best describe SHIV evolution in SHIV.CH505- and SHIV.CH848-inoculated RMs, respectively (Methods).</p>
<p>As before, we examined the top 2% of SHIV.CH505 and SHIV.CH848 mutations that we inferred to be the most beneficial for the virus. Overall, we found consistent selection for reversions (17.9- and 14.2-fold enrichment, <italic>p</italic> = 4.3 ×10<sup>−11</sup> and 1.2× 10<sup>−11</sup> for SHIV.CH505 and SHIV.CH848, respectively), with slightly attenuated enrichment in mutations that affect N-linked glycosylation (2.7- and 4.2-fold enrichment, <italic>p</italic> = 5.4× 10<sup>−2</sup> and 3.4 ×10<sup>−6</sup>). However, there is a small subset of mutations that <italic>shift</italic> glycosylation sites by simultaneously disrupting one N-linked glycosylation motif and completing another, where highly beneficial mutations occur far more often than expected by chance (158.3- and 191.1-fold enrichment, <italic>p</italic> = 1.7 ×10<sup>−4</sup> and 7.9× 10<sup>−11</sup> for CH505 and SHIV.CH505, respectively; 118.7-fold and 90.4-fold enrichment, <italic>p</italic> = 2.0 ×10<sup>−4</sup> and 2.3× 10<sup>−7</sup> for CH848 and SHIV.CH848).</p>
<p>Intuitively, one may expect that strongly beneficial SHIV mutations are more likely to be observed in samples from multiple RMs. However, we found that the number of RMs in which a mutation is observed is only weakly associated with the fitness effect of the mutation (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). While substantially deleterious SHIV mutations are rarely observed across multiple RMs, neutral and nearly neutral mutations are common. Thus, in this data set, it is not generally true that SHIV mutations observed in multiple hosts must significantly increase viral fitness.</p>
<p>We observed some differences between HIV-1 and SHIV in the precise locations of the most beneficial Env mutations. For example, mutations in V4 are highly enriched in CH505 due to a CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell epitope in this region, but not in SHIV.CH505 (2.7-fold enrichment, <italic>p</italic> = 0.13). For SHIV.CH848, beneficial mutations are modestly enriched in V1 and V5 (4.7- and 4.2-fold, <italic>p</italic> = 4.0 ×10<sup>−3</sup> and 6.7× 10<sup>−2</sup>), as in CH848, but not for V3 (0.9-fold enrichment, <italic>p</italic> = 0.22).</p>
<p>Despite some differences in the top mutations, patterns of selection over time in SHIV were very similar to those found for HIV-1. As before, highly beneficial mutations, including ones affecting glycosylation, tended to appear earlier in infection. This was followed by modestly beneficial mutations at later times, including ones involved in resistance to bnAbs in the RMs who developed antibodies with significant breadth (examples in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Detection of SHIV mutations that increase viral load</title>
<p>A major goal of nonhuman primate studies with SHIV is to faithfully recover important aspects of HIV-1 infection in humans. However, due to the divergence of simian immunodeficiency viruses and HIV-1, SHIVs are not always well-adapted to replication in RMs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. To combat this problem, a recent study identified six SHIV.CH505 mutations that increase viral load (VL) in RMs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. These mutations result in viral kinetics that better mimic HIV-1 infection in humans.</p>
<p>Our analysis readily identifies the SHIV.CH505 mutations shown to increase VL. Five out of the top six SHIV.CH505 mutations with the largest average selection coefficients are associated with increased VL (<xref rid="tblS8" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). The final mutation identified by Bauer et al., N130D, is ranked tenth. We also find highly beneficial mutations in SHIV.CH848 that are distinct from those in SHIV.CH505 (<xref rid="tblS9" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 9</xref>). Highly-ranked mutations identified here may be good experimental targets for future studies aimed at increasing SHIV.CH848 replication <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Fitness agreement between HIV-1 and SHIV</title>
<p>Next, we explored the similarity in the overall viral fitness landscapes inferred for HIV-1 and SHIV, beyond just the top mutations. First, we computed the fitness of each SHIV sequence using the joint SHIV.CH505 and SHIV.CH848 selection coefficients inferred from RM data. Then, we computed fitness values for SHIV sequences using selection coefficients inferred from HIV-1 evolution in CH505 and CH848.</p>
<p>We observed a remarkable agreement between SHIV fitness values computed from these two sources (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). For both SHIV.CH505 and SHIV.CH848, the correlation between viral fitness estimated using data from humans (i.e., CH505 and CH848) and RMs is strongly and linearly correlated (Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> = 0.96 and 0.95, <italic>p &lt;</italic> 10<sup>−20</sup>). This implies that evolutionary pressures on the envelope protein SHIV-infected RMs are highly similar to those on HIV-1 in humans with the same TF Env. In fact, this relationship holds even beyond the SHIV sequences observed during infection. Fitness estimates for sequences with randomly shuffled sets of mutations are also strongly correlated (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Evolutionary dynamics forecast antibody breadth</title>
<p>Given the similarity of HIV-1 and SHIV evolution, we sought to identify evolutionary features that distinguish between hosts who develop broad antibody responses and those who do not. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> shows that SHIV sequences from hosts with bnAbs often reach higher fitness values than those in hosts with only narrow-spectrum antibodies. We hypothesized that stronger selective pressures on the virus might drive viral diversification, stimulating the development of antibody breadth. Past studies have associated higher viral loads with bnAb development and observed viral diversification around the time of bnAb emergence <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Computational studies and experiments have also shown that sequential exposure to diverse antigens can induce cross-reactive antibodies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To further quantify SHIV evolutionary dynamics, we computed the average fitness gain of viral populations in each RM over time. We observed a striking difference in SHIV fitness gains between RMs that developed broad antibody responses and those that did not (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). In particular, SHIV fitness increased rapidly before the development of antibody breadth. SHIV fitness gains in RM5695, which developed exceptionally broad and potent antibodies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, were especially rapid and dramatic. These fitness differences were not attributable to bnAb resistance mutations, which were only moderately selected and generally appeared after bnAbs developed.</p>
<fig id="fig6" position="float" fig-type="figure">
<label>Fig. 6.</label>
<caption><title>Rapid SHIV fitness gains precede the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies.</title>
<p>For both SHIV.CH505 (<bold>A</bold>) and SHIV.CH848 (<bold>B</bold>), viral fitness gains over time display distinct patterns in RM hosts that developed bnAbs versus those that did not. Notably, the differences in SHIV fitness gains between hosts with and without broad antibody responses appear <italic>before</italic> the development of antibody breadth, and cannot be attributed to selection for bnAb resistance mutations. RM6072 is an unusual case, exhibiting antibody development that was highly similar to CH505. Although RM6072 developed tier 2 nAbs, they lacked key mutations critical for breadth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Points and error bars show the mean and standard deviation of fitness gains across SHIV samples in each RM at each time.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="603090v3_fig6.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>One outlier in this pattern is RM6072, infected with SHIV.CH505. Antibody development in RM6072 followed a path that was remarkably similar to CH505, including a lineage of antibodies, DH650, directed toward the CD4 binding site of Env <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. However, resistance to the DH650 lineage is conferred by a strongly selected mutation that adds a gly-can at site 234 (T234N, with an inferred selection coefficient of 4.5%). Broadly neutralizing antibodies similar to DH650 are able to accommodate this glycan due to shorter and/or more flexible light chains <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, but DH650 cannot. Antibody evolution in RM6072 thus proceeded along a clear pathway toward bnAb development, but lacked critical mutations to achieve breadth.</p>
<p>Next, we quantified how different types of SHIV mutations contributed to viral fitness gains over time. We examined contributions from VL-enhancing mutations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, antibody escape mutations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, other mutations affecting Env glyco-sylation, and reversions to subtype consensus. We found increased fitness gains across all types of mutations in RMs that developed broad antibody responses, compared to those that did not (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). VL-enhancing mutations, known antibody resistance mutations, and reversions typically made the largest contributions to viral fitness.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The induction of bnAbs is a major goal of HIV-1 vaccine design <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Both computational <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> and experimental <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> studies, as well as observations from individuals who developed bnAbs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, suggest that the co-evolution of antibodies and HIV-1 is important to stimulate broad antibody responses. However, a general understanding of the coevolutionary pathways by which bnAbs develop remains incomplete. Here, we quantitatively studied the evolution of HIV-1 and SHIV (featuring HIV-1-derived Env sequences) that accompanies the development of bnAbs.</p>
<p>Our study highlighted how different classes of mutations (e.g., mutations affecting T cell escape or Env glycosylation) affect fitness <italic>in vivo</italic>. In both HIV-1 and SHIV, we found strong selection for reversions to subtype consensus and some mutations that affected N-linked glycosylation motifs or resistance to autologous strain-specific antibodies. Few CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes were identified in this data set, but the T cell escape mutations that we did observe were highly beneficial for the virus. Consistent with past work studying VRC26 escape in CAP256, we observed more modest selection for bnAb resistance mutations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Overall, we found striking similarities between Env evolution in humans and RMs. Importantly, these parallels extend beyond the observation of repetitive mutations, as the number of hosts in which a mutation was observed was only weakly associated with the mutation’s fitness effect (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Our inferred Env fitness values in humans and RMs were highly correlated, even for artificial sequences with randomly permuted mutations. This indicates that the evolutionary pressures on Env in HIV-1 and SHIV infection are very similar. Our findings reinforce SHIV as a model system that closely mirrors HIV-1 infection.</p>
<p>We discovered that the speed of SHIV fitness gains was clearly higher in RMs that developed broad antibody responses than in those with narrow-spectrum antibodies. Fitness gains in the viral population preceded the development of bnAbs, and they were not driven by bnAb resistance mutations. This suggests that rapid changes in the viral population are a cause rather than a consequence of antibody breadth. While our sample is limited to 13 RMs and two founder Env sequences, we find a clear separation between RMs that did or did not develop antibody breadth. Thus, the dynamics of viral fitness may serve as a quantitative signal associated with bnAb development.</p>
<p>As noted above, Roark and collaborators also performed a detailed comparison of HIV-1 and SHIV evolution with the same TF Env sequences <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. One of their main conclusions was that most Env mutations were selected for escape from CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells or antibodies. We found that many antibody resistance mutations identified by Roark et al. are also positively selected in our analysis. Mutations at sites 166 and 169 were shown to confer resistance to a V2 apex bnAb, RHA1, isolated in RM5695 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>). We inferred moderately positive selection coefficients of 0.49% and 0.43% for R166K and R169K, respectively. The same mutations were found in RM6070, which also developed V2 apex bnAbs, with a selective advantage of 1.7% (<xref rid="tblS10" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 10</xref>). Mutations conferring resistance to autologous strain-specific nAbs were identified at multiple sites by Roark and colleagues: 130, 234, 279, 281, 302, 330, and 334 in RM6072, which developed antibody responses targeting the CD4 binding site (DH650) and V3 (DH647 and DH648) regions. Mutations Y330H and N334S, which confer resistance to V3 autologous nAbs, were detected in all RMs infected with SHIV.CH505, with selective advantages of 3.0% and 4.6% in RM6072, and 1.7% and 3.2% on average across RMs, respectively. Overall, we found that mutations conferring resistance to autologous strain-specific antibodies were common and more strongly selected than bnAb resistance mutations (<xref rid="tblS10" ref-type="table">Supplementary Tables 10</xref><bold>-11</bold>).</p>
<p>While we observed strong selection for strain-specific antibody resistance mutations, these results could also be affected by the effects of these mutations on viral replication independent of immune escape. In particular, many ssAb resistance mutations are also reversions to the subtype consensus sequence, which have often been observed to improve viral fitness <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. For example, N334S, K302N, and T234N are all reversions. These are among the most beneficial mutations inferred for SHIV.CH505 (<xref rid="tblS8" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). In future work, it would be interesting to attempt to fully separate the fitness effects of mutations due to antibody escape and intrinsic replication (cf. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>).</p>
<p>Among other analyses, Roark et al. used LASSIE <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> to identify putative sites under selection (<xref rid="tblS12" ref-type="table">Supplementary Tables 12</xref><bold>-13</bold>). This method works by identifying sites where non-TF alleles reach high frequencies. We found modest overlap between the sites under selection as identified by LASSIE and the mutations that we inferred to be the most strongly selected. For SHIV.CH505, the E640D mutation at site 640 identified by LASSIE is ranked second among 664 mutations in our analysis, and mutations at the remaining 5 sites identified by LASSIE are all within the top 20% of mutations that we infer to be the most beneficial. For SHIV.CH848, the R363Q mutation that is ranked first in our analysis appears at one of the 17 sites identified by LASSIE. Some mutations at the majority of these 17 sites fall within the top 20% most beneficial mutations in our analysis, but some are outliers. In particular, we infer both S291A/P to be somewhat deleterious, with S291P ranked 810th out of 863 mutations.</p>
<p>Beyond the specific context of HIV-1 and bnAb development, our study also provides insight into viral evolution. Despite differences in host biology, the inferred fitness effects of Env mutations in HIV-1 and SHIV were surprisingly similar. This is consistent with the ideas of methods that use sequence statistics across multiple individuals and hosts to predict the fitness effects of mutations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. However, we found that the relationship between the number of individuals in which a mutation was observed and its inferred fitness effect was fairly weak. This suggests that mutational biases and/or sequence space accessibility may play significant roles in short-term viral evolution, even for highly mutable viruses such as HIV-1 and SHIV. As described above, high frequency mutations were also not necessarily highly beneficial. While the recombination rate of HIV-1 is high, correlations between mutations persist, making it difficult to unambiguously interpret frequency changes as signs of selection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>.</p>

Mutations in loop D enabled the virus to escape from CH235, but these sequential mutations in loop D, such as E275K, N279D, and V281S, favorably bound to the mature CH103 and continuously increased the binding affinity between mature CH103 and loop D <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>.

Each mutation appears in only one category in this figure, sorted in the order above. For example, a mutation that affects an N-linked glycosylation motif and which is a reversion to the subtype consensus sequence, but which has not been established to affect resistance to a specific antibody, would have its contribution to fitness counted in the glycan category.</p></caption>

<p>In this <bold>important</bold> quantitative study of HIV-1 evolution in humans and rhesus macaques, selection coefficients are inferred at scale over the HIV genome. Selection coefficients are similar in humans and macaques, providing <bold>convincing</bold> evidence that these coefficients are representative of the fitness landscapes of these viruses within hosts. This work should be of interest to the community working on quantitative evolution and fitness landscape inference, and the finding that rapid fitness gains in the HIV population predict bNAb emergence has implications for HIV vaccine design.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The present work studies the coevolution of HIV-1 and the immune response in clinical patient data. Using the Marginal Path Likelihood (MPL) framework, they infer selection coefficients for HIV mutations from time-series data of virus sequences as they evolve in a given patient.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors analyze data from two human patients, consisting of HIV population sequence samples at various points in time during the infection. They infer selection coefficients from the observed changes in sequence abundance using MPL. Most beneficial mutations appear in viral envelop proteins. The authors also analyze SHIV samples in rhesus macaques, and find selection coefficients that are compatible with those found in the corresponding human samples.</p>
<p>The manuscript is well-written and organized.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The MPL method used by the authors considers only additive effects of mutations, thus ignoring epistasis.</p>
<p>Although the evolution of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) is a motivating question in the introduction and discussion sections (and the title), the relevance of the analysis and results to better understanding how bnAbs arise is not clear. The only result presented in direct connection to bnAbs is Figure 6.</p>
<p>Questions or suggestions for further discussion:</p>
<p>I list here a number of points for which I believe the paper would benefit if additional discussion/results were included.</p>
<p>The MPL method used by the authors considers only additive effects of mutations, thus ignoring epistasis. In Sohail et al (2022) MBE 39(10), p. msac199 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msac199">https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msac199</ext-link>) an extension of MPL is developed allowing one to infer epistasis. Can the authors comment on why this was not attempted here?</p>
<p>I presume one possible reason is that epistasis inference requires considerably more computational effort (and more data). However, since the authors find most beneficial mutations occurring in Env, perhaps restricting the analysis to Env genes only (e.g. the trimer shown in Figure 2) can lead to tractable inference of epistasis within this segment (instead of the full genome).</p>
<p>Do the authors find correlations in the inferred selection coefficients of the two samples CH505 and CH848? I could not find any discussion of this in the manuscript. Only correlations between Humans and RM are discussed.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>This paper combines a biological topic of interest with the demonstration of important theoretical/methodological advances. Fitness inference is the foundation of the quantitative analysis of adapting systems. It is a hard and important problem and this paper highlights a compelling approach (MPL) first presented in (1) and refined in (2), roughly summarized in equation 12.</p>

<p>The authors find that positive selection shapes the variable regions of env in shared patterns across two patient donors. The patterns of positive selection are interesting in and of themselves, they confirm the intuition that hyper-variation in env is the result of immune evasion rather than a broadly neutral landscape (flatness). They show that the immune evasion patterns due to CD8 T and naive B-cell selection are shared across patients. Furthermore, they suggest that a particular evolutionary history (larger flux to high fitness states) is associated with bNAb emergence. Mimicking this evolutionary pattern in vaccine design may help us elicit bNAbs in patients in the future.</p>
<p>There is a lot of information to be found in the full fitness landscape of env. The enormous strength of reversion-to-consensus in the patterns is a known pattern of HIV post-infection populations but they are nicely quantified here. Agreement between SHIV and HIV evolution is shown. They find selection is larger for autologous antibodies than the bNAbs themselves (perhaps bNAbs are just too small a component of the host response to drive the bulk of selection?), and that big fitness increases precede antibody breadth in rhesus macaques, suggesting that this fitness increase is the immune challenge required to draw forth a bNAb. This is all of high interest to HIV researchers.</p>
<p>Strength of evidence</p>
<p>One limitation is, of course, that the fitness model is constant in time when the immune challenge is variable and changing. This simplification may complicate some interpretations.</p>
<p>Equation 12 in the methods is really a beautiful tool because it is so simple, but accounts for linkage and can be solved precisely even in the presence of detailed mutational and selection models. However, the reliance on incomplete observations of the frequency leads to complications that must be carefully (re)addressed here.</p>
<p>For instance, the consistent finding of strong selection in hypervariable regions is biologically intuitive but so striking, that I worry that it might be the result of a bias for selection in high entropy regions. Mutational and covariance terms in equation 12 might be underestimated, due to finite sampling effect in highly diverse populations. Sampling effects lead to zeros in x(t) when actual frequency zeros might be rare at the population sizes of HIV viral loads and mutation rates. Both mutational flux and C underestimation will bias selection upward in eq. 12. The prior papers (1) and (2) seem to show robustness to finite sampling effects, but, again, more care needs to be shown that this robustness transfers to the amino acid inference under these conditions. That synonymous sites are rarely selected for in the nucleotide level is a good sign, and it may be a matter of simply fully explaining the amino-acid level model.</p>
<p>Uncertainty propagates to the later parts of the paper, eg. HIV and SIV shared patterns might be the result of shared biases in the method application. However, this worry does not extend to the apples-to-apples comparison of fitness trajectories across individuals (Figures 5 and 6) which I think are robust (for these sample sizes). The timing evidence is slightly weakened by the fact that bNAb detection is different from bNAb presence and the possibility that fitness increases occurred after the bNAbs appeared remains. Still, their conclusion is plausible and fits in with the other observations which form a coherent and compelling picture.</p>
<p>Overall this is a convincing paper, part of a larger admirable project of accurately inferring complete fitness landscapes.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Shimagaki et al. investigate the virus-antibody coevolutionary processes that drive the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). The study's primary goal is to characterize the evolutionary dynamics of HIV-1 within hosts that accompany the emergence of bnAbs, with a particular focus on inferring the landscape of selective pressures shaping viral evolution. To assess the generality of these evolutionary patterns, the study extends its analysis to rhesus macaques (RMs) infected with simian-human immunodeficiency viruses (SHIV) incorporating HIV-1 Env proteins derived from two human individuals.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A key strength of the study is its rigorous assessment of the similarity in evolutionary trajectories between humans and macaques. This cross-species comparison is particularly compelling, as it quantitatively establishes a shared pattern of viral evolution using a sophisticated inference method. The finding that similar selective pressures operate in both species adds robustness to the study's conclusions and suggests broader biological relevance.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, the study has some limitations. The most significant weakness is that the authors do not sufficiently discuss the implications of the observed similarities. While the identification of shared evolutionary patterns (e.g., Figure 5) is intriguing, the study would benefit from a more explicit discussion of what these findings mean for instance, in the context of HIV vaccine design, immunotherapy, or fundamental viral-host interactions. Even speculative interpretations could provide valuable insights into the broader significance of these results.</p>
<p>A secondary, albeit less critical, limitation is the placement of methodological details in the Supplementary Information. While it is understandable that the authors focus on results in the main text - especially since the methodology is not novel and has been previously described in earlier publications - some readers might benefit from a more thorough presentation of the method within the main paper.</p>
<p>Conclusions:</p>
<p>Overall, the study presents a compelling analysis of HIV-1 evolution and its parallels in SHIV-infected macaques. While the quantitative comparison between species is a notable contribution, a deeper discussion of its broader implications would strengthen the paper's impact.</p>
