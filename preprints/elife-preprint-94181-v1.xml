<title>Summary</title><p>To survive in challenging environments, animals must develop a system to assess food quality and adjust their feeding behavior accordingly. However, the mechanisms that regulate this chronic physiological food evaluation system, which monitors specific nutrients from ingested food and influences food-response behavior, are still not fully understood. Here, we established a low-quality food evaluation assay system and found that heat-killed <italic>E. coli</italic> (HK-<italic>E. coli),</italic> a low sugar food, triggers cellular UPR<sup>ER</sup> and immune response. This encourages animals to avoid low-quality food. The physiological system for evaluating low-quality food depends on the UPR<sup>ER</sup> (IRE-1/XBP-1) - Innate immunity (PMK-1/p38 MAPK) axis, particularly its neuronal function, which subsequently regulates feeding behaviors. Moreover, animals can adapt to a low-quality food environment through sugar supplementation, which inhibits the UPR<sup>ER</sup>-PMK-1 regulated stress response by increasing vitamin C biosynthesis. This study reveals the role of the cellular stress response pathway as physiological food evaluation system for assessing nutritional deficiencies in food, thereby enhancing survival in nature environments.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Food is essential for the survival, growth and fitness of all animals. To adapt to fluctuating environments with a wide range of food sources, animals have developed a food evaluation system. This system enables them to identify nutrient-rich food and avoids low-quality or toxic food, thereby maximizing their survival prospects <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Various sensory neuron evaluation systems in animals has evolved to evaluate food quality through vision <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, olfactory <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> and gustatory senses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Besides these sensory systems that facilitate quick feeding decisions, animals may also initiate cellular stress response programs to detect nutrition/toxin and trigger food response behaviors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. This could be one of physiological food quality evaluation systems that monitor the nutritional status of consumed food. However, the signaling events in cellular stress responses involved in evaluating of specific nutrients and the mechanisms that connect these signaling activities to food behaviors are largely unexplored. More specifically, while cellular stress response through UPR<sup>ER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> and PMK-1/p38 MAPK <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> dependent immunity in response to pathogens have been extensively studied, the functions of these cellular stress response in sensing and evaluating specific nutrients from food remain unclear.</p>
<p>Vitamin C is an essential micronutrient that cannot be synthesized by humans due to the loss of a key enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Animals obtain Vitamin C from their diet and possibly also from gut microbes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Vitamin C is an important physiological antioxidant and a cofactor for a family of biosynthetic and gene regulatory monooxygenase and dioxygenase enzymes. It is also required for the biosynthesis of collagen, L-carnitine, and certain neurotransmitters <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Vitamin C has been associated with various human diseases including scurvy, immune defect and cardiovascular disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Therefore, food evaluation systems in animals for sensing Vitamin C could be critical for their fitness in nature. However, the role of the cellular stress response pathway as food evaluation system for sensing and evaluating Vitamin C remains unexplored.</p>
<p>In this study, using the low-quality food evaluation assay system we established <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, we uncovered the mechanism of cellular stress responses pathway as physiological food evaluation system in evaluating D-Glucose deficiency in food and downstream Vitamin C content in animals through the UPR<sup>ER</sup> (IRE-1/XBP-1) - Innate immunity (PMK-1 p38 MAPK) axis. This mechanism promotes animals to leave low-quality food and is critical for their survival in nature environments.</p>

<title>Low-quality food induces stress response in animals</title>
<p>Our previous studies have shown that Heat-killed <italic>E. coli</italic> (HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>), which lacks certain molecules, is considered a low-quality food that is unable to support animal growth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Morevoer, through metabolic-seq analysis, we identified significant changes in a large numbers of metabolites (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>, Table S1), including lipids (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B</xref>, Table S1), amino acid and their metabolites (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1C</xref>, Table S1), as well as coenzymes and vitamins (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1D</xref>, Table S1). Interestingly, we observed a significant decrease in carboxylic acids and their derivatives (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1E</xref>, Table S1) in <italic>E. coli</italic> after being heat-killed (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1F</xref>, Table S1). This suggests that HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> is nutritionally deficient for <italic>C. elegnas</italic> when compared to normal <italic>E. coli</italic> food.</p>
<p>Next, we conducted two behavior assays to facilitate the analysis of the food evaluation process in animals by seeding L1 animals in assay plates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). In the avoidance assay, wild-type animals avoided the HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> food (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, in the food choice assay, animals initially showed no preference between the two types of food (1-2h), but eventually exhibited a preference for high-quality food (Live <italic>E. coli</italic>) up until the17h mark (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1H</xref>). This suggests that worms depart from the HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> after recognizing it as low-quality food source through ingestion.</p>

<p>In order to investigate the pathways in animals that response to HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>, we performed transcriptomics analysis on worms that were cultured with both HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> and Live <italic>E. coli</italic>. Gene-expression profiling revealed that stress response genes, including those related to biotic stimulus, immune response and response to stress, are up-regulated in animals fed with HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, Table S2). Among these up-regulated genes, we identified 11 out of 62 of UPR<sup>ER</sup> target genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1G</xref> and Table S2). Additionally, about 50%-80% of up-regulated genes overlap with genes responding pathogenic bacteria <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, Table S2), suggesting that UPR<sup>ER</sup> and immune pathways may responded to low-quality food. Consistent with the results of the RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis, the UPR<sup>ER</sup> reporter (<italic>Phsp-4::GFP</italic>) and immunity reporter (<italic>Pirg-5::GFP</italic>) were strongly induced under HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> feeding condition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1G</xref>). Moreover, UPR<sup>Mt</sup> reporter (<italic>Phsp-6::GFP</italic>) was weakly induced under HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> feeding condition (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1I</xref>), and starved worm did not induce UPR<sup>ER</sup> and immunity (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1J</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1K</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, these findings suggest that low-quality food (HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>) triggers a stress response pathway in animals, including UPR<sup>ER</sup> and innate immune. This implies that animals may assess the quality of food through UPR<sup>ER</sup> and innate immune pathway.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Animals evaluate food quality through UPR<sup>ER</sup>-immune depended physiological food quality evaluation system</title>
<p>To determine whether the UPR<sup>ER</sup> and innate immune pathways play a role in evaluating low-quality food, we first examined whether the activation of the UPR<sup>ER</sup> by HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> was dependent on the known signaling components of the UPR<sup>ER</sup> branches, including IRE/XBP-1, PERK/ATF-4 and ATF-6 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. We observed no difference in <italic>Phsp-4::GFP</italic> induction with <italic>atf-4</italic> (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2J</xref>) or <italic>atf-6</italic> (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2B</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2J</xref>) RNAi-mediated knockdown in animals fed with HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>. However, knockdown of <italic>ire-1/xbp-1</italic> or mutation of <italic>xbp-1</italic> reduced GFP fluorescence (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A, 2B</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2J</xref>). Among the 11 deferentially expressed UPR<sup>ER</sup> target genes in animals fed with HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> from RNA-seq (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), 64% of the genes are IRE-mediated genes (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1G</xref>, Table S2). The mRNA level of IRE-1-mediated splicing of <italic>xbp-1</italic> is also induced in animals fed with HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2C</xref>). These data suggest that activation of the UPR<sup>ER</sup> by low-quality food depends on the IRE-1/XBP-1.</p>

<p>To further analyze whether XBP-1-dependent UPR<sup>ER</sup> activation is critical for animals to leave low-quality food, we tested food avoidance behavior using <italic>xbp-1</italic> mutant. The results show that <italic>xbp-1</italic> mutants had a significantly decreased likelihood of leaving of HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>, which was rescued by expressing <italic>xbp-1</italic> in neuron rather than intestine (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). This indicats that XBP-1-dependent UPR<sup>ER</sup> activation in neuron is critical for animals to evaluate low-quality food.</p>
<p>We then investigated which innate immune pathway is involved in evaluating low-quality food. First, we analyzed HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> induced genes from RNA-seq. Among these up-regulated genes, 82 out of 409 of PMK-1-dependent genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> were identified (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2D</xref>, Table S2). Second, we confirmed the induction of several well-known PMK-1 target genes in RNA-seq data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2E</xref>) and reporter analysis (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2F</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2G</xref>). Moreover, the induction of <italic>Pirg-5::GFP</italic> was abolished in <italic>pmk-1</italic> knockdown animals fed with HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2K</xref>). Third, we found that the phosphorylated PMK-1 (p-PMK-1) level was prominently increased in wild-type N2 animals fed HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> compared to feeding <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Finally, <italic>pmk-1</italic> mutants had a decreased likelihood of leaving of HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>, which was rescued by expressing <italic>pmk-1</italic> in neurons rather than intestine (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). These data suggest that PMK-1 regulated immune pathway evaluates low-quality food, especially the neuronal PMK-1 has a critical function for food quality response.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>XBP-1 and PMK-1 are in the same pathway for evaluating food quality</title>
<p>Next, we explored the connection between UPR<sup>ER</sup> (IRE-1/XBP-1) and innate immunity (PMK-1 p38 MAPK) in food quality evaluation. We found that <italic>Pirg-5::GFP</italic> induction (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2H</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2K</xref>) and PMK-1 activation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>) were decreased in animals with <italic>xbp-1</italic> mutation or knockdown when fed with HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>, suggesting that XBP-1 could regulate PMK-1 under this condition. Additionally, <italic>Phsp-4::GFP</italic> induction under HK-<italic>E. coli was</italic> not affected in animals with <italic>pmk-1</italic> RNAi (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2I</xref>), indicating that XBP-1-dependent UPR<sup>ER</sup> activation is not regulated by PMK-1. Finally, we constructed a double mutant of <italic>xbp-1</italic> and <italic>pmk-1</italic> and found that the food avoidance phenotype of the double mutant was similar to the <italic>pmk-1</italic> mutant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>), indicating that PMK-1 is downstream of XPB-1 in responding to low-quality food.</p>

<title>Sugar deficiency in HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> food induces stress response and avoidance behavior in animals</title>
<p>We then investigated which nutrients/metabolites are sensed by animals through the XBP-1-PMK-1 axis for food quality evaluation. First, we hypothesized that the nutrition status is improved in <italic>E. coli</italic> mutant (HK-treatment), which could inhibit URP<sup>ER</sup> and immune response in animals (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A</xref>). We established a system for screening the <italic>E. coli</italic> mutant keio library (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A</xref>), and identified 20 <italic>E. coli</italic> mutants that did not induce <italic>hsp-4::GFP</italic> through the UPR<sup>ER</sup> reporter (<italic>irg-5::GFP</italic>) after three rounds of screening (Table S3). From these 20 E. coli mutant, we identified 9 <italic>E. coli</italic> mutants that did not induce <italic>irg-5::GFP</italic> through the immunity reporter (<italic>irg-5::GFP</italic>) screening (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3B, S3C</xref>, Table S3). Animals fed HK-<italic>yfbR</italic>, which catalyzes carbohydrate derivative metabolic process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, had a decreased ability to leave food (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, Table S3), indicating that HK-<italic>yfbR</italic> may be a higher quality food for animals compared to HK-K12.</p>

<p>Secondly, we preformed a metabolomics analysis of different quality food (HK-K12, HK-<italic>yfbR</italic> and Live-K12). We found that the level of 13 metabolites were similar between HK-<italic>yfbR</italic> and Live-K12, but significantly changed in HK-K12 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3D</xref>, and Table S1). We also found that genes involved in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis were up-regulated in animals fed with HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3E</xref>), suggesting that glycolysis/gluconeogenesis metabolism is disordered in animals fed with HK-<italic>E. coli,</italic> which may result from changes in sugar/carbohydrate intake. The carbohydrates (D-trehalose, Lactose, and D-(+)-sucrose) were also decreased in HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), suggesting that carbohydrate deficiency may induce stress response and avoidance behavior in animals.</p>
<p>Thirdly, to determine which carbohydrate inhibits stress response in animals, we supplemented each metabolite to HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> and found that only Lactose, and D-(+)-sucrose inhibited HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> induced UPR<sup>ER</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3F</xref>). Moreover, we found from our metabolomic data that the sugar level, including Lactose, and D-(+)-sucrose, and D-(+)-Glucose, was also decreased in HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, Table S1). Since Lactose and D-(+)-sucrose are hydrolyzed to produce glucose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, we wondered whether glucose also inhibits the stress response in animals. We found that D-(+)-Glucose supplementation also inhibited HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> induced UPR<sup>ER</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), immune response (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F, 3G</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3G</xref>) and avoidance (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). Moreover, sugar supplementation did not affect UPR<sup>ER</sup> and immunity in normal food (OP50) or starved condition (NGM) (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3H</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3I</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, these findings suggest that sugar/carbohydrates deficiency in HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> induces a stress response and avoidance behavior in animals, which can be inhibited by D-(+)-Glucose supplementation. This implies that animals may evaluate the sugars deficiency through the activation of UPR<sup>ER</sup> and immune responses.</p>

<p>Firstly, we observed an increase in the vitamin C level in animals when fed with HK-yfbR (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), a high carbohydrate food compared to HK-E. coli (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1E</xref>). However, the VC level in bacteria is same (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A</xref>). The VC level also increased when D-Glucose (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4B</xref>) or D-glucuronate (D-GlcA) was added to HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), which was abolished by knocking down VC biosynthesis genes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4B</xref>). This suggests that additional of sugar supplementation promotes VC synthesis in animals fed with HK<italic>-E. coli</italic>.</p>
<p>Secondly, we hypothesized that animals could overcome a low-quality food (HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>) environment by inhibiting the stress response through increasing vitamin C biosynthesis. We found that VC or D-glucuronate (D-GlcA) supplementation inhibited HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> induced UPR<sup>ER</sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>), immune response including <italic>irg-5/sysm-1</italic> reporter expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4C</xref>) and p-PMK-1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4G</xref>), as well as food avoidance (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we asked whether inhibition of stress response and avoidance by sugar supplementation depends on the vitamin C biosynthesis pathway. We found that suppression of HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> induced UPR<sup>ER</sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>), immune response (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4D</xref>) and food avoidance (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K</xref>) by D-GlcA/sugar supplementation was abolished in animals with RNAi of VC biosynthesis genes. Food selection behavior assays showed that D-GlcA/sugar supplementation increased the preference for heat-killed bacteria, which was also suppressed by knocking down VC biosynthesis genes (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4E</xref>). However, VC supplementation still suppressed the UPR<sup>ER</sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>), immune response (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4D</xref>) and food avoidance (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K</xref>), and increased the food preference (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4E</xref>) in animals with or without RNAi of VC biosynthesis genes. This suggests that VC, as the final metabolite synthesized from D-Glucose, is critical for low-quality food response in animals.</p>
<p>Together, these data indicate that the Vitamin C biosynthesis pathway is critical for evaluating whether food is of higher quality and can be eaten by animals. It also suggests that animals could improve their VC levels to adapt to bad food environment.</p>

<title>Animals evaluate sugar and vitamin C through neuronal XBP-1 and PMK-1</title>
<p>As D-GlcA/sugar and VC supplementation suppressed HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> induced UPR<sup>ER</sup>, immune response and food avoidance behavior, we investigated whether animals evaluate sugar and VC through XBP and PMK-1 dependent pathways. We performed a food selection behavior assay by adding D-Glc, D-GlcA or VC to the NGM, <italic>E. coli</italic> and HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). The food selection behavior assays revealed that supplementation with D-Glc, D-GlcA, or VC inhibits the animals’ choice of sugar or VC on <italic>E. coli</italic>-OP50 feeding conditons (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4F</xref>). This suggests that supplementation with D-Glc, D-GlcA, or VC may alter the metabolites of live bacteria, leading to avoidance by the animals. There was no preference observed on NGM (no food condition) supplementation with D-Glc and VC (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4G</xref>), indicating that the intake of sugar or VC alone does not influence animal preference. However, alone D-GlcA could influence worm physiology which induces preference change (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4G</xref>). Interestingly, D-Glc and D-GlcA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>) or VC (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>) supplementation increased the preference for heat-killed bacteria, which was suppressed in <italic>xbp-1</italic> or <italic>pmk-1</italic> mutant animals.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To better survive, animals must evolve a system to recognize and evaluate the quality of their food. This includes the sensory neuron evaluation system for immediate response and feeding decision <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, as well as physiological food evaluation system for chronic response to ingested food. In our previous study, we discovered that the TORC1-ELT-2 pathway, acting as master regulators in intestine, evaluates vitamin B2 deficiency in low-quality food (HK-<italic>E. coli)</italic> and regulates gut digestive activity to impact animal’s food behavior <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. To further identified the mechanism by which animals evaluate low-quality food (HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>), we performed metabolomics and transcriptomics analyses to identify specific nutrition deficiencies in low-quality food and the cellular response pathways that are involved in food evaluation pathway. This study identified a physiological food evaluation mechanism by which animals detect sugar (in food) and vitamin C (in animals) deficiency through UPR<sup>ER</sup> (IRE-1/XBP-1) - Innate immunity (PMK-1/p38 MAPK) regulated cellular stress response program in neurons that dictates food avoidance and selection behaviors.</p>
<p>Unlike the sensory neuron evaluation system, which permits rapid feeding decisions through smell and taste, the cellular stress response as physiological food evaluation system describe here requires a slow and multi-step signal transduction process after the ingestion of food. The disruption of cellular homeostasis by ingested of low-quality or toxic food can activate stress response mechanisms that both increase the cellular ability to withstand and adapt to this disruption of homeostasis and promote behavioral strategies to avoid these conditions and lessen their impact on the organism. These cellular stress response mechanisms include heat shock response, unfolded protein response, oxidative stress response <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Therefore, this slow physiological food evaluation system is an evolutionary adaptation mechanism for detecting nutrition deficiencies in food that was not detected by quick sensory neuronal system.</p>
<p>One of cellular stress response, UPR<sup>ER</sup>, is activated by stresses such as infection and nutrition deficiency that affect homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. The activation of the UPR<sup>ER</sup> by expression of <italic>xbp-1s</italic> in the nervous system has recently been shown to promote changes in feeding and foraging behavior <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. The p38 PMK-1 pathway regulates the expression of secreted innate immune effectors and is required for survival during infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Moreover, UPR<sup>ER</sup> and innate immunity increased by disrupting in vivo state would induce worm aversion from food lawn<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Thus, these two cellular stress response pathways are critical for animals’ survival in changing environment. However, whether UPR<sup>ER</sup> (IRE-1/XBP-1) - Innate immunity (PMK-1/p38 MAPK) evaluates food quality under physiological conditions is largely unexplored. Our study presents evidence that low-quality food (HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>) activate UPR<sup>ER</sup> and PMK-1, and promotes animals to leave food. It is independent of avoidance behavior of hyperactivation of kgb-1/MAPK pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4H</xref>). Mover, our study also shows that neuronal UPR<sup>ER</sup> and PMK-1 are critical for evaluating low-quality food. Therefore, our study established a novel physiological food evaluation system by activating the cellular stress response program with UPR<sup>ER</sup> (IRE-1/XBP-1) - Innate immunity (PMK-1/p38 MAPK).</p>
<p>Collectively, this study uncovers the unexpected function of UPR<sup>ER</sup> (IRE-1/XBP-1) - Innate immunity (PMK-1/p38 MAPK) as a physiological food evaluation system for evaluating and sensing food quality in animals. It also highlights the utility of the HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> (low-quality food) - <italic>C. elegans</italic> interaction as a means to dissect the mechanism of food evaluation system in assessing food. Most importantly, it reveals that animals are capable of altering their nutrient (Vitamin C) levels through in vivo synthesis or food intake to adapt to a poor food environment when better food choices are not available.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study presents interesting findings that suggest that the UPR and immune regulators can act as evaluators of nutritional quality in C. elegans. <bold>Convincing</bold> evidence expands our understanding both of physiological food evaluation systems and of the known roles of stress response pathways in organismal physiology. However, there is limited mechanistic exploration in the study, and in some cases, the effect size is small and statistical significance questionable.</p>

This manuscript by Liu et al explores the role of the UPR and immune regulators in the evaluation of nutritional quality in C. elegans. They identify neuronal UPR activation and the MAPK PMK-1 as key responders to low food quality. In particular, the data suggest that these pathways are activated by low levels of vitamin C synthesis that result from the low sugar levels present in heat-killed E. coli.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The results are intriguing and expand our understanding both of physiological food evaluation systems, and of the known roles of stress response pathways in organismal physiology. The authors use a range of techniques, encompassing imaging, metabolomic analysis, gene expression analysis, and behavioural assays, to support their claims.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
There is limited mechanistic analysis in the study. In particular, how does low vitamin C trigger UPR activation? This is an intriguing finding that, if followed up, could potentially reveal a novel mechanism of UPR activation. In addition, how is the activation of the PMK-1 pathway driven by/coordinated with UPR activation? The data in some figures is not as convincing as it could be: the magnitude of the effect size is small in the supplementation experiments, and the statistical tests used are not always appropriate to enable multiple comparisons.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this work, the authors aim to better understand how C. elegans detects and responds to heat-killed (HK) E. coli, a low-quality food. They find that HK food activates two canonical stress pathways, ER-UPR, and innate immunity, in the nervous system to promote food aversion. Through the creative use of E. coli genetics and metabolomics, the authors provide evidence that the altered carbohydrate content of HK food is the trigger for the activation of these stress responses and that supplementation of HK food with sugars (or their biosynthetic product, vitamin C), reduces stress pathway induction and food avoidance. This work makes a valuable addition to the literature on metabolite detection as a mechanism for the evaluation of nutritional value; it also provides some new insight into the physiologically relevant roles of well-known stress pathways in modulating behavior.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
-The work addresses an important question by focusing on understanding how the nervous system evaluates food quality and couples this with behavioral change.</p>
<p>
-The work takes full advantage of the tools available in this powerful system and builds on extensive previous studies on feeding behavior and stress responses in C. elegans.</p>
<p>
-Creative use of E. coli genetics and metabolite profiling enabled the identification of carbohydrate metabolism as a candidate source of food-quality signals.</p>
<p>
-For the most part, the studies are rigorous and logically designed, providing good support for the authors' model.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
-It is not clear how the mechanism identified here is connected to previously described, related processes. In particular, it is not clear whether this mechanism has a role in the detection of other low-quality foods. Further, the specificity of the ability of sugar/vitamin C to suppress stress pathway induction is unclear (i.e., does sugar/vitamin C have any effect on the activation of these pathways through other means?). Additionally, the relationship of this pathway to the vitamin B2-sensing mechanism previously described by the senior author is unclear. These issues do not weaken confidence in the authors' conclusions, but they do reduce the potential significance of the work.</p>
<p>-The authors claim that the induction of the innate immune pathway reporter irg-5::GFP is &quot;abolished&quot; in pmk-1(RNAi) animals, but Figure S2K seems to show a clear GFP signal when these animals are fed HK-OP50. Similarly, the claim that feeding WT animals HK-OP50 enriches phospho-PMK-1 levels (Fig 2E) is unconvincing - only one western blot is shown, with no quantification, and there is a smear in the critical first lane.</p>
<p>-The rationales for some of the paper's hypotheses could be improved. For example, the rationale for screening the E. coli mutant library is that some mutants, when heat-killed, may be missing a metabolite that induces the ER-UPR. A more straightforward hypothesis might be that some mutant E. coli strains aberrantly induce the ER-UPR when *not* heat-killed, because they are missing a metabolite that prevents stress pathway induction. This is not in itself a major concern, but it would be useful for the authors to provide a rationale for their hypothesis.</p>
<p>-The authors do not provide any explanation for some unexpected results from the E. coli screen. Earlier in the paper, the authors found that innate immune signaling is downstream of ER-UPR activation. However, of the 20 E. coli mutants that, when heat-killed, &quot;did not induce... the UPR-ER reporter,&quot; 9 of them still activate the innate immune response. This seems at odds with the authors' simple model since it suggests that low-quality food can induce innate immune signaling independently of the ER-UPR. Further, only one of the 9 has an effect on behavior, even though failure to activate the innate immune pathway might be expected to lead to a behavioral defect in all of these.</p>
<p>-In a number of places, the writing style can make the authors' arguments difficult to follow.</p>
<p>-Some of the effect sizes observed by the authors are exceedingly small (e.g, the suppression of hsp-4::gfp induction by sugar supplementation in Figs 3C-E), raising some concern about the biological significance of the effect.</p>
<p>-In some cases, there is a discrepancy between the fluorescence images and their quantitation (e.g., Figure 3E, where the effect of glucose on GFP fluorescence seems much stronger in the image than in the graph).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Animals can evaluate food quality in many ways. In contrast to the rapid sensory evaluation with smell and taste, the mechanism of slow nutrient sensation and its impact on food choice is unexplored. The authors utilize C. elegans larvae and their bacterial food as an elegant model to tackle this question and reveal the detailed molecular mechanism to avoid nutrient-poor foods.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The strength of this study is that they identified the molecular identities of the critical players in bacterial food and C. elegans using unbiased approaches, namely metabolome analysis, E. coli mutant screening, and RNA sequencing. Furthermore, they strengthen their findings by thorough experiments combining multiple methods such as genetics, fluorescent reporter analysis, and Western blot.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The major caveat of this study is the reporter genes. The transcriptional reporters were used to monitor the UPRER and immune responses in the intestine of C. elegans. However, their tissue-specific rescue experiments suggest that the genes in the UPRER and immune response function in the neurons. Thus, we should carefully interpret the results of the reporter genes.</p>
<p>Overall, this work provides convincing data to support their model. In the C. elegans field, the behaviors of larvae are not well studied compared to adults. This work will pose an interesting question about the difference between larvae and adults in nutrition sensing in C. elegans and provide a framework and candidate molecules to be studied in other organisms.</p>
