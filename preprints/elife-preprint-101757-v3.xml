<title>Abstract</title><p><italic>Clostridioides difficile</italic> infection (CDI) is the leading cause of hospital-acquired diarrhea that seriously threatens public health. The disruption of normal gut microbiota by the use of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents enables <italic>C. difficile</italic> to proliferate in the colon. The emergence and prevalence of hypervirulent <italic>C. difficile</italic> strains result in increased morbidity, mortality, and high recurrence rates of CDI, thus creating a pressing need for novel therapeutics. The multi-domain toxins TcdA and TcdB are the primary determinants of CDI pathogenesis, rendering them ideal drug targets in the anti-virulence paradigm. In this study, we identified caffeic acid and its derivatives from natural compounds library as active inhibitors of TcdB via a cell-based high-throughput phenotypic screening. Further mechanistic investigations revealed that caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) could directly bind to TcdB, thus suppressing InsP<sub>6</sub>-induced autoproteolysis and inhibiting glucosyltransferase activity. CAPE treatment remarkably reduces the pathology of CDI in a murine infection model in terms of alleviated diarrhea symptoms, decreased bacterial colonization, and relieved histopathological lesions. Moreover, CAPE treatment of <italic>C. difficile</italic>-challenged mice induces a remarkable increase in the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota and alterations of gut metabolites (e.g., adenosine, D-proline, and melatonin), which might partially contribute to the therapeutic outcomes of CAPE against CDI. Our results reveal the potential of CAPE as a therapeutic for the management of CDI, or CAPE might serve as a lead compound for the development of antivirulence drugs targeting TcdB.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Clostridioides difficile</italic> (<italic>C. difficile</italic>) is an obligate anaerobic, spore-forming, gram-positive bacterial pathogen that is the most common cause of hospital-acquired and antibiotic-associated gastrointestinal diseases, including mild diarrhea and life-threatening pseudomembranous colitis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. In the United States, <italic>C. difficile</italic> is responsible for almost half a million infections and approximately 29,000 deaths per year, resulting in an estimated annual healthcare-associated cost of up to $4.8 billion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Importantly, the incidence, severity, mortality and healthcare costs of <italic>C. difficile</italic> infection (CDI) have dramatically increased in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, at least partially owing to the frequent use of antimicrobial agents and the emergence of hypervirulent strains (e.g., PCR ribotypes 027 and 078) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Limited options are available for the treatment of CDI, while antibiotics including metronidazole, fidaxomicin and vancomycin, are the mainstays of clinical practice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. However, antibiotic treatment is ineffective in more than 35% of CDI patients and can lead infection recurrence <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Moreover, the rapid evolution of antibiotic resistance in <italic>C. difficile</italic> has further compromised the therapeutic efficacy of current treatment options <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Therefore, the high morbidity and mortality, high recurrence rates, and emergence of multiple antibiotic-resistant isolates have made this pathogen a major threat to public health; these factors highlight the urgent need for novel therapies.</p>
<p><italic>C. difficile</italic> widely exists in the environment and in the intestinal tract of humans and animals and is mainly transmitted via the fecal-oral route <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. The pathogenesis of CDI is correlated with the use of antibiotics, which impair the structure and composition of the normal gut microbiota, thus allowing <italic>C. difficile</italic> to proliferate in the colon <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Therefore, previous antibiotic therapy is the major risk factor for the development of CDI. In the colon, the dormant spores of <italic>C. difficile</italic> germinate into oxygen-sensitive vegetative cells that produce toxins and cause symptoms of disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. <italic>C. difficile</italic> secretes two large clostridial exotoxins (TcdA and TcdB), which are directly responsible for the clinical pathology of CDI <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Epidemiological studies suggest that most disease-causing <italic>C. difficile</italic> strains have genes that encode TcdB <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. TcdA and TcdB have identical functional domains: a N-terminal glucosyltransferase catalytic domain (GTD), a cysteine protease active domain (CPD), a transmembrane domain (DRBD), and a C-terminal receptor binding domain (CROPs) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. When secreted into the colon, both toxins are internalized by host cells through receptor-mediated, clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Following a decrease in endosomal pH, the toxins undergo conformational changes in the DRBD, resulting in insertion of the toxin into the endosome membrane, pore formation, and the release of the GTD and CPD domains into the cytosol. Then, CPD binding with cytosolic inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP<sub>6</sub>) activates its protease activity, leading to the cleavage and release of the GTD. Eventually, the GTD utilizes UDP-glucose to glucosylate Rho and/or Ras family GTPases, thus disrupting GTPase signaling and resulting in deleterious effects, including cytopathic “rounding”, dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton, apoptosis, and pyroptosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Although both toxins are cytotoxic to host cells, TcdB shows greater toxicity than TcdA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Disruption of the gut microbiota by antimicrobial agents results in high recurrence rates, which limits the application of antimicrobial therapy for CDI <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Consequently, there is a critical need to develop nonantibiotic treatments for CDI, either as standalone or augmented therapies. Importantly, strategies targeting bacterial virulence factors, including toxins, are termed anti-virulence strategies and have attracted interest in the 21<sup>st</sup> century <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Owing to its essential role in <italic>C. difficile</italic> pathogenesis, TcdB has become an ideal target for the development of anti-virulence drugs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. In this study, caffeic acid and a series of its derivatives were found to inhibit TcdB-mediated cell rounding via cell-based screening. Among these potential inhibitors, caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) had the greatest inhibitory effect. Mechanistically, CAPE bound to both full-length TcdB and the GTD fragment, leading to alterations in the secondary structure. This interaction suppressed the InsP<sub>6</sub>-mediated self-cleavage of TcdB, as well as the enzymatic activity of GTD, thereby decreasing the level of glucosylated Rac1 in TcdB-treated host cells and further inhibiting the cytopathology and cytotoxicity of TcdB. Oral administration of CAPE significantly protected against CDI in models of animal infection. In addition to direct toxin inhibition, the therapeutic effect may also be attributed to CAPE-induced alteration of the gut microbiota (e.g., <italic>Bacteroides</italic> spp.) as well as gut metabolites (e.g., adenosine, D-proline, and melatonin). Overall, our study revealed that caffeic acid and its derivatives, particularly CAPE, may serve as promising lead compounds for the development of anti-virulence drugs to treat CDI.</p>

<title>CAPE inhibits cell rounding induced by TcdB</title>
<p>TcdB can inactivate Rho GTPases via glucosylation, leading to the loss of cytoskeletal structure and cell-rounding. Consequently, we utilized this phenotype to identify potential TcdB inhibitors from 2076 chemicals, including 1515 FDA-approved drugs and 561 natural compounds. The minimal concentration of recombinant His<sub>6</sub>-TcdB (0.2 ng/mL) that induced 100% cell rounding within 1 h was used for drug screening. This concentration of TcdB was preincubated with 8 μg/mL of the individual compounds for 1 h, the compounds that were not bound to TcdB were removed by ultrafiltration centrifugal partition and then added to Vero cell cultures. Residual compounds that have not bound to TcdB may lead to an exaggerated assessment of their efficacy and could also result in misleading positive outcomes. As the effective concentration for cellular interactions may inadvertently be increased, such carryover could distort the determination of the compound’s minimum effective concentration. At 1 h post-TcdB treatment, cell morphology was visualized under a light microscope (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). These analyses allowed us to identify 22 candidate compounds with potent inhibitory effects (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Interestingly, six out of the 22 compounds were caffeic acid derivatives. The natural compound library contained eight caffeic acid derivatives, of which methyl caffeic acid and ferulic acid displayed no efficacy. Caffeic acid itself only slightly inhibited TcdB-induced cell rounding, with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of 527.5 μg/mL (1.86 mM) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Table S1</xref>). Notably, except for rosmarinic acid, the IC<sub>50</sub> values for the other screened caffeic acid derivatives were less than 6 μg/mL, suggesting that these compounds potently inhibited TcdB-mediated toxicity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Table S1</xref>). CAPE is the phenethyl alcohol ester of caffeic acid and a main active component of propolis with broad pharmacological properties, such as anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory activities <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. As CAPE has the lowest IC<sub>50</sub> (3.0 μg/mL) among the active caffeic acid derivatives, it was selected as the representative compound for subsequent investigations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Table S1</xref>). After preincubation with increasing concentrations of CAPE, dose-dependent inhibition of cell rounding was observed in both Vero and HeLa cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). The protective influence of CAPE against TcdB-induced Vero cell death remained evident even when the treatment duration was prolonged to 12 h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S1A-B</xref>).</p>

<p>In addition, we also determined whether inhibition of TcdB by CAPE could lead to loss of toxin function <italic>in vivo</italic> using a murine systemic intoxication model. A lethal dose of recombinant His<sub>6</sub>-TcdB (30 ng) was preincubated with either DMSO or CAPE (2 or 4 μg/mL) for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by intraperitoneal injection into mice. Notably, all mice in the DMSO group (n=10) died within 36 h after toxin injection. However, 100% of mice pretreated with CAPE 4 (μg/mL) toxin survived at the monitoring endpoint (72 h) (n=10) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Furthermore, we evaluated the efficacy of CAPE following an intraperitoneal injection by administering it 2 h prior to the injection of TcdB, in order to gauge the survival rate of the mice. The outcomes revealed that a 2 h pretreatment with CAPE at doses of 30 and 50 mg/kg significantly enhanced the mice’s protection rate by 57.1% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S2</xref>). Simultaneously, we assessed the impact of CAPE on <italic>C.difficile</italic> itself. CAPE markedly repressed <italic>tcdB</italic> gene expression at a concentration of 16 μg/mL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S3A</xref>) and inhibited the growth and spore formation of <italic>C. difficile</italic> BAA-1870 at a concentration of 32 μg/mL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S3B-C</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that CAPE is a potent toxin inhibitor of TcdB and may serve as a promising antimicrobial agent.</p>

<title>CAPE decreases InsP<sub>6</sub>-induced autoproteolysis of TcdB and inhibits the enzymatic activity of GTD</title>
<p>TcdB is a multi-domain containing toxin that induces toxicity in host cells via an intricate and multistep mechanism. This mechanism involves (i) receptor-mediated endocytosis, (ii) pore formation and subsequent membrane translocation, (iii) autoproteolysis and release of GTD, and (iv) the glucosylation of small GTPases (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). To determine the mechanism by which CAPE suppresses the cytotoxicity of TcdB, we first labeled full-length TcdB with Alexa Fluor 488; then, the concentration of the endocytosed toxin was determined via flow cytometry. Apparently, incubation of CAPE with TcdB did not significantly affect its entry into host cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Next, we stained CAPE-treated cells with LysoTracker, a fluorescent dye that accumulates in the acidic organelles of live cells. In contrast to the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (Baf-A1), CAPE treatment did not alter the intensity of LysoTracker fluorescence staining in either THP-1 or Caco-2 cells, suggesting that inactivation of TcdB by CAPE is not due to changes in the pH of endosomal compartments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C-D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S4A-B</xref>).</p>

<p>These observations indicate that CAPE might exert its effects after membrane translocation. Indeed, preincubation of full-length TcdB with CAPE blocked the InsP<sub>6</sub>-induced autoproteolysis of TcdB, as revealed by the gradual decrease in the production of released GTP, followed by the addition of increasing amounts of CAPE <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E-F</xref>). Furthermore, we determined the glucosyltransferase activity using recombinant GTD in the absence or presence of different doses of CAPE. Strikingly, incubation with 2 μg/mL CAPE resulted in a significant reduction in GTD activity, whereas 32 μg/mL CAPE compromised 87.5% of the enzymatic activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Importantly, in response to suppression of InsP<sub>6</sub>-induced autoproteolysis and GTD function, treatment of TcdB-challenged cells with CAPE markedly decreased the level of glucosylated Rac1 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H-I</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that CAPE disrupts InsP<sub>6</sub>-induced autoproteolysis of TcdB and inhibits the enzymatic activity of GTD, thereby decreasing the glucosylation of Rac1 and alleviating cell rounding.</p>

<title>CAPE alters the secondary structure of full-length TcdB and GTD</title>
<p>To further clarify the mechanisms used by CAPE to inactivate TcdB, we determined the secondary structures of full-length TcdB and GTD in the absence or presence of CAPE by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Apparently, incubation of CAPE with full-length TcdB resulted in a significant increase in the α-helix content (15.4% to 21.0%) and a concomitant decrease in the β-pleated sheet content (34.5% to 20.9%) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-B</xref>). Similarly, the secondary structure of GTD was markedly altered upon incubation with CAPE, with the proportion of α-helices decreasing from 37.9% to 0.0% and the proportion of β-pleated sheets decreasing from 37.2% to 10.9% (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C-D</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that CAPE may interact with full-length TcdB and GTD to induce conformational changes, thus impairing their functions.</p>

<title>CAPE directly interacts with full-length TcdB and GTD</title>
<p>To investigate the potential interaction between CAPE and TcdB or GTD, the binding constants were determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis. The results showed that CAPE has strong binding affinity with full-length TcdB and GTD, and the KD values were 1.269×10<sup>-5</sup> M and 1.007×10<sup>-3</sup> M, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-B</xref>). The interaction between CAPE and TcdB exhibits a slow approach to equilibrium, which may primarily be attributed to the rapid occupation of the protein’s primary binding sites by the small molecule during the initial phase. Following this, CAPE proceeds to bind to sites with secondary or reduced affinity, a process that prolongs the time required to achieve equilibrium. Furthermore, the possibility that CAPE binds to multiple sites on TcdB necessitates a duration for the exploration and occupation of these various sites before equilibrium is established. These data demonstrate the direct interaction between CAPE and full-length TcdB/GTD.</p>

<p>Next, we performed molecular docking and molecular simulation dynamics analyses to investigate the interaction between CAPE and GTD (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). The results revealed that Leu265, Asp286, Thr465, Ile466, Leu519, and Trp520 in GTD were potential binding sites for CAPE (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). The root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the GTD/CAPE complex was stable over a 100 ns period of simulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Further energy decomposition analysis showed that the side chains of Leu265, Thr465, Leu519, and Trp520 of GTD contributed to binding with CAPE via van der Waals interactions, among which Trp520 had the highest binding energy (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Moreover, we mutated each of the residues that were involved in binding and subsequently determined their glucosyltransferase activities in the presence or absence of CAPE. The enzymatic activities of these mutants were similar to that of wild-type GTD (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>).

<title>CAPE treatment reduces the pathology of CDI in a murine model</title>
<p>The abovementioned observation that CAPE suppresses the function of TcdB prompted us to further evaluate the potential therapeutic effects of this compound in CDI. To this end, we employed a well-established murine model in which infected mice can develop symptoms resembling those observed in human CDIs (25). First, cytotoxicity measurements revealed that the viability of both THP-1 and Vero cells was not affected by CAPE treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S5A-B</xref>), thus indicating low toxicity. Mice were preconditioned with drinking water containing 0.5 g/L cefoperazone for 5 days, followed by normal drinking water for 2 days. After challenge with <italic>C. difficile</italic> BAA-1870 via gavage, mice were then treated daily with either vehicle or 30 mg/kg CAPE by gavage throughout the disease course (day 0 to day 5) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Severe weight loss in <italic>C. difficile</italic>-infected mice was observed on days 2 and 3 post infection and was accompanied by diarrhea (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Notably, compared to the infection control group, CAPE treatment significantly increased the dry/wet weight ratio of the mouse feces, suggesting the alleviation of diarrhea symptoms (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Correspondingly, the weight loss of mice was relieved upon receiving CAPE (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Moreover, fecal pellets collected on day 3 were used to determine the bacterial burden. The results revealed that CAPE treatment significantly decreased the number of <italic>C. difficile</italic> CFUs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). On day 3 post-<italic>C. difficile</italic> infection, the colon was collected for histopathological analysis. Remarkably, <italic>C. difficile-</italic>infected mice exhibited conspicuous colon edema, epithelial cell injury and inflammatory factor infiltration (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). In contrast, these histopathological lesions were significantly reduced in mice given CAPE, but pathological changes were still present (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). This indicates that CAPE may have a limited capacity to reverse the histological damage induced by <italic>C. difficile</italic>. The residual pathology could be attributed to the complex interplay between the pathogen, the host immune response, and the tissue repair process, which may not be fully mitigated by the inhibitory effects of CAPE on TcdB.</p>

<p>Antibiotic-induced dysbiosis of the gut microbiota promotes the development of CDI <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>.

To this end, on the 3<sup>rd</sup> day after <italic>C. difficile</italic> challenge, fecal samples from the control group and CAPE treatment group were collected and subjected to microbiota analysis via 16S rRNA gene sequencing.

In addition, both the α- and β-diversity of the gut microbiota in CAPE-treated mice were significantly greater than those in control mice.

<p>A comparative analysis was performed to examine changes at the phylum level following CAPE treatment. <italic>Bacteroidota</italic>, <italic>Firmicutes,</italic> and <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> were the major constituents in both the CAPE treatment and control groups, suggesting that the administration of CAPE did not significantly alter the mouse microbiota at the phylum level (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>). Next, we compared the 10 most abundant taxa at the genus level. Notably, CAPE treatment markedly elevated the abundance of <italic>Bacteroides</italic> and decreased the abundance of <italic>Muribaculaceae</italic> and <italic>Parabacteroides</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref>). Leveraging linear discriminant analysis of effect sizes (LEfSe), the microbiota was examined at the genus level to identify bacteria exhibiting substantial differences in abundance between the two cohorts (LDA score &gt; 3.5, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).

<title>CAPE alters the levels of gut metabolites in <italic>C. difficile</italic>-infected mice</title>
<p>In addition to the crucial role of the gut microbiota in conferring colonization resistance against <italic>C. difficile</italic>, gut microbiota-derived metabolites significantly contribute to the disease process <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Metabolomic analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of CAPE treatment on gut metabolites in mice. On the 3<sup>rd</sup> day after infection, the feces of mice in each group were frozen by liquid nitrogen for metabolomics analysis. Specifically, utilizing mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, a simple screening of each metabolite is conducted for parameters such as retention time and mass-to-charge ratio. Subsequently, peak area calibration is performed using the first quality control (QC) sample to enhance the accuracy of identification. The peak extraction is then conducted with settings for mass deviation at 5 ppm, signal intensity deviation at 30%, minimum signal intensity, and adduct ions. Simultaneously, quantification of peak areas is carried out, and target ions are integrated. Molecular formulas are predicted using molecular ion peaks and fragment ions, and these are compared with databases such as mzCloud, mzVault, and Masslist. Background ions are removed using blank samples. The raw quantification results are standardized using the formula: original quantification value of the sample / (total metabolite quantification value of the sample / total metabolite quantification value of QC1 sample), to obtain relative peak areas. Compounds with a coefficient of variation (CV) greater than 30% in the relative peak areas of QC samples are excluded. Finally, the identification and relative quantification results of the metabolites are obtained. The PLS-DA model exhibited significant separation of clusters between the model and CAPE treatment groups (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). Among the 1599 metabolites, 109 showed substantial differences in levels between the two groups. Specifically, CAPE-treated mice exhibited 19 metabolites with upregulated expression and 50 metabolites with downregulated expression compared to those in the control group (fold change &gt; 1.5, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). Furthermore, KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that the differentially abundant metabolites were significantly enriched in the purine metabolism and bile secretion pathways (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>). Adenosine is an endogenous purine nucleoside that binds to specific cell surface receptors to exert anti-inflammatory effects at high concentrations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Importantly, CAPE treatment of <italic>C. difficile</italic>-infected mice can increase the adenosine concentration in the gut (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>), which might be attributed to its inhibition of xanthine oxidase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Similarly, the levels of uric acid, the final product of purine degradation, were markedly decreased in mice after receiving CAPE (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>). An earlier study reported that increasing the gut adenosine concentration with an adenosine deaminase inhibitor prevents <italic>C. difficile</italic> toxin A-induced enteritis in mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Therefore, the increase in gut adenosine induced by CAPE might play an important role in its therapeutic efficacy in CDI.</p>

<p><italic>C. difficile</italic> predominantly utilizes sugars and amino acids for energy production through various metabolic pathways, such as fermentation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Notably, Stickland fermentation, a Clostridia-specific type of amino acid fermentation, is associated with <italic>C. difficile</italic> pathogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>.

Interestingly, treatment of <italic>C. difficile</italic>-infected mice with CAPE significantly reduced gut D-proline levels (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>). In addition, the metabolomics data also revealed a dramatic increase in the level of melatonin (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>), which is a ubiquitous indolamine that was previously shown to decrease the rate of recurrent CDI <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>.

<title>Oral administration of melatonin alleviates the symptoms of CDI</title>
<p>Next, we investigated whether any of the upregulated metabolites had a direct influence on TcdB. To this end, we preincubated recombinant TcdB with each of the selected metabolites prior to addition to the cell cultures. Interestingly, treatment with TcdB and 100 μg/mL melatonin significantly alleviated the cell death induced by this toxin (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref>). This observation prompted us to investigate the direct therapeutic potential of melatonin in CDI. Therefore, <italic>C. difficile</italic>-infected mice were orally administered 200 mg/kg melatonin at 24 h intervals. The weight changes and the dry/wet ratio of the stool samples were monitored daily for three days.

Consistent with these observations, histopathological assessment of colonic tissue sections also revealed attenuated colon damage upon melatonin treatment (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9D-E</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p><italic>C. difficile</italic> has become the prevalent agent of nosocomial diarrhea and substantially threatens public health. In particular, the increase in morbidity and mortality caused by the prevalence of hypervirulent and drug-resistant strains has become a global concern <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. In 2019, <italic>C. difficile</italic> was listed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as an “urgent threat” that surpassed methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) and ESBL-producing <italic>Enterobacterales</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. <italic>C. difficile</italic> is a commensal bacterium that colonizes the lower gastrointestinal tract <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. CDI typically occurs in susceptible individuals whose normal gut microbiota is disrupted by the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Although CDI is considered an antibiotic-associated disease, the current treatment for CDI still relies on antimicrobial drugs, including metronidazole, fidaxomicin and vancomycin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Despite antibiotic therapy, more than 35% of CDI patients are susceptible to recurrent infection, which is primarily attributable to the intrinsic effects of antimicrobial agents, which disrupt the microbiota <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. In addition, long-term administration of antibiotics promotes the selection of antibiotic-resistant subpopulations in the gut, thus increasing the risk of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant and opportunistic bacteria <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. As a result, the development of nonantibiotic therapeutics is needed for the treatment of CDI.</p>
<p>Indeed, numerous novel treatments for CDI are being investigated, among which the anti-virulence strategy represents one of the most promising and successful therapeutic approaches <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Unlike antibiotics, which target bacterial components that are critical for bacterial growth, anti-virulence drugs aim to disarm pathogenic bacteria by neutralizing their virulence factors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Therefore, this strategy imposes less selective pressure that directs bacterial evolution of antimicrobial resistance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. The disease progression of CDI is strictly dependent on large clostridial toxins (TcdA and TcdB), as strains lacking both toxins (i.e., A<sup>-</sup>B<sup>-</sup>) were completely avirulent and failed to induce any discernable disease symptoms in a hamster model of infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Importantly, epidemic <italic>C. difficile</italic> strains with increased morbidity and mortality rates produce greater amounts of toxins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Based on these premises, TcdA and TcdB are considered ideal drug targets for CDI in the anti-virulence paradigm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Indeed, bezlotoxumab, a fully humanized monoclonal antibody that neutralizes TcdB, was approved by the FDA and used in CDI patients to reduce the rate of recurrence <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. This achievement has encouraged researchers to develop next-generation anti-virulence treatments. In particular, small molecule inhibitors of toxin production and/or activity have attracted increasing interest owing to their advantages in cost and the convenience of oral administration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. The multidomain architecture and mechanisms of action of clostridial toxins have provided distinct options for blocking their toxicity. Indeed, previous efforts have identified diverse inhibitors that act on distinct steps of intoxication, such as the inhibition of toxin binding to cell receptors, the suppression of endosomal maturation, and the inactivation of GTD or CPD activities <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Although which approach is the best remains unknown, we believe that an inhibitor that targets multiple steps of intoxication would be superior to those that act on a single step. In this study, we identified a series of caffeic acid derivatives that were potent inhibitors of TcdB via a phenotypic screen. Further mechanistic study revealed that CAPE, the phenethyl alcohol ester of caffeic acid, could block InsP<sub>6</sub>-induced autoproteolysis of TcdB and inactivate its GTD function (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>). CAPE can also inhibit the growth of <italic>C. difficile</italic> and the production of spores. Moreover, CAPE treatment significantly protected against CDI in a mouse model of infection. Our results suggested that caffeic acid derivatives, particularly CAPE, are promising lead compounds for the development of targeted therapies against CDI. CAPE is a major component of propolis, a natural bee-produced substance that has been used as a remedy for thousands of years in Europe and Asia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. As a result, further investigations on the therapeutic potential of propolis against CDI, either in combination with standard therapy or as a single therapy, would be of great interest.</p>

<caption><title>A model for CAPE-mediated suppression of TcdB cytotoxicity and protection of mice from CDI.</title>
<p>The intoxication of cells by TcdB involves multistep mechanisms. Direct interaction of CAPE with full-length TcdB blocks InsP<sub>6</sub>-induced autoproteolysis, resulting in decreased production of active GTD. The binding between GTD and CAPE inhibits its glucosyltransferase activity, thus decreasing the glucosylation level of Rac1. CAPE treatment of CDI mice markedly restored the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota and induced changes in gut metabolites, which might have contributed to the therapeutic outcomes of CDI following CAPE treatment.</p></caption>

<p>Antibiotic-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis is a major risk factor for CDI <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Thus, reconstituting the gut microbiota is a promising strategy for CDI therapy. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is considered an effective CDI therapeutic strategy and is widely used in clinical practice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Despite the high cure rate and increasing popularity of FMT, patients remains limited acceptance. Another prominent advantage of anti-virulence drugs is that they allow maintenance of the normal microbiota, which is of critical importance for the treatment of CDI. Importantly, CAPE treatment of <italic>C. difficile</italic>-infected mice restored the structure and composition of the microbiota (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>). In particular, the abundance of <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, a critical gut microbiota component that is required for resistance to <italic>C. difficile</italic> colonization <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>, was significantly elevated upon CAPE treatment. Interestingly, <italic>Bacteroides</italic> were also predominant in CDI patients administered RBX2660 (Rebyota), an FDA-approved fecal microbiota product <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. The increased diversity of the gut microbiota might contribute to the therapeutic effects of CAPE in CDI.</p>
<p>In addition to the microbiota, gut metabolites also play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of CDI, either by promoting or suppressing disease progression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. For example, bile acids and amino acids promote spore germination and pathogenesis, while secondary bile acid and short-chain fatty acids aid in colonization resistance and suppress spore germination <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. In addition to restoration of the gut microbiota, metabolomics analysis of mouse fecal samples revealed dramatic alterations in gut metabolites upon CAPE treatment (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>). The differentially abundant metabolites were significantly enriched in the purine metabolism and bile metabolism pathways. Remarkably, the level of adenosine, an endogenous purine nucleoside that can regulate immune responses and inflammatory processes by binding to its receptors, such as its ability to inhibit the release of certain inflammatory mediators, was dramatically increased in CAPE-treated mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. In contrast, the amount of uric acid, the final product of purine metabolism, was reduced. Previous studies showed that the increase in adenosine concentrations caused by the inhibition of adenosine deaminase via EHNA prevents <italic>C. difficile</italic> TcdA-mediated damage and inflammation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. This protection might be a result of the anti-inflammatory effects of adenosine, which rely on the activation of its receptors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. In addition, we observed a reduction in the amount of D-proline, which is one of the preferred amino acids utilized by <italic>C. difficile</italic> to generate energy through Stickland reactions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Melatonin is a ubiquitous indolamine that has broad biological activities <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. Notably, we detected a significantly increase in the amount of melatonin in the feces of mice that were administered CAPE. Importantly, an earlier study demonstrated a decreased risk of recurrent CDI in patients exposed to melatonin, possibly owing to its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. In this study, we found that oral administration of exogenous melatonin alleviated the symptoms of CDI in a mouse model of infection. Although determining the exact mechanism will require further investigation, we propose that the melatonin-mediated inhibition of TcdB intoxication observed in this study might contribute to its therapeutic effect. Taken together, these results indicate that the alterations in gut metabolites caused by CAPE might also contribute to treatment outcomes for CDI patients.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study by Guo and colleagues reports the inhibitory activity of caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) against TcdB, a key toxin produced by Clostridioides difficile. C. difficile infections are a major public health concern, and this manuscript provides interesting data on toxin inhibition by CAPE, a potentially promising therapeutic alternative for this disease. The strength of the evidence to support the conclusions is <bold>solid</bold>, with some concerns about the moderate effects on the mouse infection model and direct binding assays of CAPE to the toxin.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Guo and colleagues used a cell rounding assay to screen a library of compounds for inhibition of TcdB, an important toxin produced by Clostridioides difficile. Caffeic acid and derivatives were identified as promising leads, and caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) was further investigated.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Considering the high morbidity rate associated with C. difficile infections (CDI), this manuscript presents valuable research in the investigation of novel therapeutics to combat this pressing issue. Given the rising antibiotic resistance in CDI, the significance of this work is particularly noteworthy. The authors employed a robust set of methods and confirmatory tests, which strengthen the validity of the findings. The explanations provided are clear, and the scientific rationale behind the results is well-articulated. The manuscript is extremely well written and organized. There is a clear flow in the description of the experiments performed. Also, the authors have investigated the effects of CAPE on TcdB in careful detail, and reported compelling evidence that this is a meaningful and potentially useful metabolite for further studies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although the authors have made changes to the manuscript to address some of my comments, many of the comments were not satisfactorily addressed. Many of the changes are still superficial, and some concerns still need to be addressed. Important details are still missing from the description of some experiments. Authors should carefully revise the manuscript to ascertain that all details that could affect interpretation of their results are presented clearly.</p>
<p>There is still very little discussion (none, really) in the manuscript about the fact that, because the authors observed a significant effect of CAPE on both bacterial growth and spore production, some of the phenotypes observed can no longer be attributed solely to toxin inhibition.</p>
<p>The details about mass spectrometry are still insufficient. It is still unclear whether metabolite identifications were always based on MS1 or MS2. Instead, several details that are really secondary were included. Authors should be unequivocally clear as to how metabolite identities were obtained. They should also indicate which mass spectrometer was used, and there should be a section in the Materials and Methods describing these experiments.</p>
<p>About the removal of carry-over compounds, the authors stated that ultrafiltration centrifugal partition was used. However, although the authors explained this in detail in their response to reviewers file, the details were omitted from the main text. Authors should clearly state in the manuscript text that &quot;Due to the large molecular weight of TcdB, approximately 270 kDa, we selected a 100 kDa molecular weight cutoff ultrafiltration membrane. The centrifugation was performed at 4000 g for 5 min to eliminate the compounds that did not bind to TcdB.&quot;</p>
<p>These are important details which need to be included.</p>

<p>I appreciate the author's responses to my original review. This is a comprehensive analysis of CAPE on C. difficile activity. It seems like this compound effects all aspects of C. difficile, which could make it effective during infection but also make it difficult to understand the mechanism. Even considering the authors responses, I think it is critical for the authors to work on the conclusions regarding the infection model. There is some protection from disease by CAPE but some parameters are not substantially changed. For instance, weight loss is not significantly different in the C. difficile only group versus the C. difficile + CAPE group. Histology analysis still shows a substantial amount of pathology in the C. difficile + CAPE group. This should be discussed more thoroughly using precise language.</p>
<p>The authors did a good job addressing my concerns regarding the infection model by providing a more accurate descriptions in the Results section for histology. However, the weight loss improvement by CAPE does not look like a significant effect, although it is trending towards improvement. This should be more accurately described.</p>
<p>Another minor concern is that the current Abstract is overstating the amount of disease attenuation. I would replace &quot;remarkably reduces the pathology&quot; with &quot;reduces some of the pathology&quot;</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Guo and colleagues used a cell rounding assay to screen a library of compounds for inhibition of TcdB, an important toxin produced by Clostridioides difficile.

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors have made some changes in the revised version. However, many of the changes were superficial, and some concerns still need to be addressed. Important details are still missing from the description of some experiments. Authors should carefully revise the manuscript to ascertain that all details that could affect interpretation of their results are presented clearly. For instance, authors still need to include details of how the metabolomics analyses were performed. Just stating that samples were &quot;frozen for metabolomics analyses&quot; is not enough. Was this mass-spec or NMR-based metabolomics. Assuming it was mass-spec, what kind? How was metabolite identity assigned, etc? These are important details, which need to be included. Even in cases where additional information was included, the authors did not discuss how the specific way in which certain experiments were performed could affect interpretation of their results. One example is the potential for compound carryover in their experiments. Another important one is the fact that CAPE affects bacterial growth and sporulation. Therefore, it is critical that authors acknowledge that they cannot discard the possibility that other factors besides compound interactions with the toxin are involved in their phenotypes. As stated previously, authors should also be careful when drawing conclusions from the analysis of microbiota composition data, and changes to the manuscript should be made to reflect this. Ascribing causality to correlational relationships is a recurring issue in the microbiome field. Again, I suggest authors carefully revise the manuscript and tone down some statements about the impact of CAPE treatment on the gut microbiota.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>The legend of Figure 3SB is incorrect. It should read &quot;Growth curves of C. difficile BAA-1870 in the presence of varying concentrations of CAPE (0-64 µg/mL)&quot;. Also, there is something wrong with the symbols in this figure. I suspect what is happening is that the symbols for the concentrations of 32 and 64 µg/mL are superimposing, but this is a problem because the lower line looks like a closed circle, which is supposed to represent the condition where no CAPE was added. The authors should change the symbols to allow clear distinction between each of the conditions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your constructive suggestion. We have modified the panel and figure legend in Figure 3SB. The concentrations of 32 μg/mL and 64 μg/mL are quite similar, which makes it challenging to differentiate between the corresponding data points on the graph. To enhance clarity, we have utilized distinct colors to help distinguish these closely valued lines as effectively as possible.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Since the authors observed a significant effect of CAPE on both bacterial growth and spore production, their discussion and conclusions need to reflect the fact that the effects observed can no longer be attributed solely to toxin inhibition.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your comments. We have modified the corresponding description according to your suggestions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In lines 43-45, authors state that &quot;CAPE treatment of C. difficile-challenged mice induces a remarkable increase in the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota (e.g., Bacteroides spp.)&quot;. It is still unclear to this reviewer why mention Bacteroides between parentheses. Does this mean that there was an increase in the abundance of Bacteroides? If that is the case this needs to be stated more clearly.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your comments. Treatment with CAPE indeed significantly increased the abundance of <italic>Bacteroides spp.</italic> in the gut microbiota (Figure 7H-J). However, to avoid ambiguity in the abstract, we have chosen to delete the specific mention of <italic>Bacteroides spp.</italic> within the parentheses.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The modifications made to lines 132-135 still do not address my concern. Authors stated in the manuscript that &quot;compounds that were not bound to TcdB were removed&quot;. But how was this done? This needs to be clearly explained in the manuscript. In the response to reviewers document, authors state that this was done through centrifugation. But given that the goal here is to separate excess of small molecule from a protein target, just stating that centrifugation was used is not enough. Did the authors use ultracentrifugation? What were the conditions employed. This is critical so that the reader can assess the degree of compound carryover that may have occurred. Also, authors need to clearly acknowledge the caveats of their experimental design by stating that they cannot rule out the contribution of compound carryover to their results.</p>

<p>Thanks for your comments. We employed ultrafiltration centrifugal partition to remove the unbound small molecule compounds. Due to the large molecular weight of TcdB, approximately 270 kDa, we selected a 100 kDa molecular weight cutoff ultrafiltration membrane. The centrifugation was performed at 4000 g for 5 min to eliminate the compounds that did not bind to TcdB. We have incorporated the relevant methods and discussed the potential impacts on the respective sections of the manuscript.</p>

<p>In line 142, authors added the molar concentration of caffeic acid, as requested. Although this helps, it is even more important that molar concentrations are added every time a compound concentration is mentioned. For instance, just 2 lines down there is another mention of a compound concentration. It would be informative if authors also added molar concentrations here and throughout the manuscript.</p>

<p>Thanks for your comments. In our initial test design, we have utilized the concentration unit of μg/mL. However, during the conversion to μM using the dilution method, some values do not result in neat, whole numbers. For instance, the conversion of 32 μg/mL of caffeic acid phenyl ethyl ester yields 112.55 μM, which appears somewhat irregular when expressed in this manner.</p>

<p>Line 277. For the sake of clarity, I would strongly suggest that authors use the term &quot;control mice&quot; instead of &quot;model mice&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your comments. We have modified “model mice” to “control mice” throughout the manuscript.</p>

<p>In line 302, the word taxa should not be capitalized. I capitalized it in my original comments simply to draw attention to it.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your comments. We have modified this word.</p>

<p>In the section starting in line 318, authors still need to include details of how the metabolomics analyses were performed. Just stating that samples were &quot;frozen for metabolomics analyses&quot; is not enough. Was this mass-spec or NMR-based metabolomics. Assuming it was mass-spec, what kind? How was metabolite identity assigned? Etc, etc. These are important details, which need to be included.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your comments. We have added some metabolomics methods in the corresponding section.</p>

<p>In line 338, the authors misunderstood my original comment. This sentence should read &quot;...the final product of purine degradation, were markedly decreased in mice after...&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your comments. We have modified this sentence.</p>

<p>Panels of figure 3 are still incorrectly labeled. The secondary structure predictions are shown in A and C, not A and B as is currently stated in the legend.</p>

<p>Thanks for your comments. We have modified the figure legend in Figure 3.</p>

<p>About Figure 5C, I think the authors for the clarification, but this explanation should be included in the figure legend.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your comments. We have added the relevant information to the figure legend.</p>
