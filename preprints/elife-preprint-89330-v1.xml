<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Neural responses evoked by a stimulus reduce upon repetition. While this adaptation allows the sensory system to attend to novel cues, does information about the recurring stimulus particularly its intensity get compromised? We explored this issue in the locust olfactory system. We found that locusts’ innate behavioral response to odorants varied with repetition and stimulus intensity. Counter-intuitively, the stimulus-intensity dependent differences became significant only after adaptation had set in. Adaptation also altered responses of individual neurons in the antennal lobe (neural network downstream to insect antenna). These response variations to repetitions of the same stimulus were unpredictable and inconsistent across intensities. Although both adaptation and intensity decrements resulted in an overall reduction in spiking activities across neurons, these changes could be disentangled and information about stimulus intensity robustly maintained by ensemble neural responses. In sum, these results show how information about odor intensity can be preserved in an adaptation-invariant manner.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The ability to adapt to sensory cues is key to the survival of many living organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. The goal of this sensory adaptation is to condense neural responses to a persisting or recurring stimulus in order to focus on novel cues. Such condensed neural responses are thought to increase system efficiency by reducing the metabolic requirements of information encoding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. However, is sensory information lost when neural responses are condensed during adaptation? While this computational task appears relatively elementary, any solution should satisfy two important requirements. First, attenuation of stimulus-evoked responses due to adaptation should not alter the identity of the stimulus. Second, information regarding the intensity of the stimulus may have to be preserved when odor intensity conveys information of behavioral importance. The latter requirement is paramount when sensory stimuli have different behavioral significance at varying intensities. For example, some odorants are attractive at lower intensities but switch to being aversive beyond certain threshold values<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Alternately, sensitivity to intensity gradients has to be maintained for sustained periods to allow for navigation towards or away from the stimulus source<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Such biological contexts necessitate the preservation of odor intensity information across repeated encounters with the odorant. However, the mechanism by which information about stimulus intensity is robustly maintained is not fully understood.</p>
<p>Sensory adaptation occurs over both long- and short-time scales<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Long-term adaptation requires gene transcription and protein translation that occurs on the time scale of hours to days<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, whereas short-term adaptation occurs on a millisecond to minute time scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Short-term adaptation results from a wide range of mechanisms with prominent models in the olfactory system being vesicle depletion and facilitation of lateral inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. While both vesicle depletion and lateral inhibition are likely to occur in the olfactory system, these complementary mechanisms will manifest in two different,but testable, outcomes. Vesicle depletion will impact the most prominent neurons with elevated odorevoked responses, whereas facilitation of lateral inhibition would progressively suppress activity in the relatively weak responders. Irrespective of which mechanisms underlie olfactory adaptation, the neural responses evoked by a stimulus will change over time and across repeated encounters. This raises the question, does adaptation then corrupt or alter information regarding the odorant?</p>
<p>The ambiguity that neural adaptation introduces has been documented in visual<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> and auditory systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. However, prior studies have shown that odor identity is robustly maintained by the spatiotemporally patterned neural responses and can allow precise recognition across repeated encounters with the odorant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. But is intensity information corrupted by the changes in neural activity due to sensory adaptation? Both reductions in stimulus intensity and sensory adaptation lead to a reduction in the overall spiking responses in most neural circuits. Do these neural response variations due to neural adaptation and intensity decrements be disentangled? We sought to examine this in the relatively simple insect olfactory system.</p>
<p>Our results show that odor intensity changes result in subtle variations in the overall combination of activated neurons. While sensory adaptation results in an overall reduction in the population neural responses, the activated ensemble is robustly maintained to allow simultaneous and precise decoding of odor identity and intensity. Using an innate behavioral assay, we show that physiological adaptation coincided with enhanced behavioral differentiation between odorant intensities. Thus, our work reveals a simple but elegant approach to achieve adaptation-invariant intensity coding and recognition in the insect olfactory system.</p>

<title>Behavioral responses to an odorant vary with repetition and intensity</title>
<p>We began by examining how behavioral responses change with repetitions of an odorant. We used an innate behavioral assay where the presentation of certain odorants triggered an appetitive palp-opening response (POR) in starved locusts <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>; <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 1</xref>)</bold>. The probability of an odor eliciting a POR (P(POR)) was regarded as an indicator for stimulus perception (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref></bold>). Note that the P(POR) was computed by averaging the behavioral responses across locusts for each trial or repetition number (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c, d</xref></bold>). Intriguingly, we found that the P(POR) systematically increased with repetitions of the same odorant and stabilized after about five stimulus presentations.</p>

<p><bold>(b)</bold>Schematic of the block odor stimulation protocol. Each block consisted of ten trials and a 4s odor pulse was presented in each trial. A 15-minute no-stimulation period separated the blocks.</p>
<p><bold>(c)</bold>Response matrices are shown summarizing individual locust PORs (rows) for blocks of ten trials (columns). White boxes indicate PORs in a specific trial, while black boxes indicate the absence of PORs in that trial. Locusts were sorted such that the least responsive locusts are shown at the top and the most responsive ones are near the bottom. PORs varied between locusts, across trials.</p>
<p><bold>(d)</bold>The probability of PORs across locusts (P(POR)) is shown as a function of trial number for two odorants: iaa and bza at high intensities (1% v/v). P(POR)s as a function of trial number is shown for four odorants (oct, hex, iaa, bza) at two different intensities (0.1% v/v – low and 1% v/v – high). The trials were split into early (trials 1-5) and late (trials 6-10) trials. While the P(POR) of both odorant intensities increased over trials, the P(POR) values for high-intensity odor exposures were notably higher than P(PORs) for low-intensity odor presentations.</p>
<p><bold>(f)</bold> Bar plots compare the average P(POR) for early and late trials for the low- and the high-intensity presentations of the same odor. P(POR) values observed at high and low intensities of an odorant were similar for early trials (p&gt;0.05, one-tailed t-test). For three out of four odors tested the P(PORs) for high-intensity odor exposures were significantly higher (p&lt;0.05, one-tailed t-test). This suggests that locusts can better perceptually distinguish between high and low odor intensities during later trials.</p></caption>

<p>Previous results have shown that the POR is a function of both stimulus identity and intensity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Therefore, we presented each locust with randomized blocks of the same odorant at either high (H, 1% v/v) or low (L, 0.1% v/v) intensities (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref></bold>). Our results indicate that the P(POR) evoked by high and low stimulus intensities of an odorant were not significantly different in the earlier trials (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref></bold>; p &gt; 0.05 for hex, iaa, and bza; one-tailed t-test). However, the P(POR) became significantly different for the high and low-intensity exposures of the same odorant during the later trials (p ≤ 0.05 for hex, oct, and iaa; one-tailed t-test). In other words, high and low stimulus intensities were more behaviorally discriminable in the later trials. Hence, these results counterintuitively suggest that behavioral responses to an odorant at two different intensities were different after multiple encounters with the same stimulus.</p>

<title>Odor-evoked response adaptation leads to complex changes in individual neurons</title>
<p>How do neural responses change as a function of stimulus repetition? To understand this, we examined the odor-evoked responses of individual projection neurons (PNs) in the locust antennal lobe as different odorants at two different intensities were repeatedly presented (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref></bold>). Odor-evoked responses in individual PNs varied subtly across trials (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref></bold>). In general, most PN responses to the odorant were stronger in the first trial and reduced during later trials of the same stimulus. Notably, the changes in PN responses in two different blocks of trials, where the same odorant was presented, showed repeatable changes in odor-evoked spiking patterns and the overall response strength (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref></bold>).</p>

<p><bold>(a)</bold>Schematic of the olfactory stimulation protocol. Each block consisted of twenty-five trials with a four seconds odor pulse delivered in each trial. The inter-trial interval was 56 s. Two datasets were collected. Each dataset consisted of five randomized blocks of four odorants (dataset 1: hex (H), hex (L), oct (H), oct (L), hex (H)-repeat; dataset 2: iaa (H), iaa (L), bza (H), bza (L), iaa (H)-repeat). A fifteen-minute no-odor stimulation period separated blocks of trials.</p>

Spiking activities are shown for twenty-five trials (rows) with earlier trials shown at the top and later trials at the bottom. The shaded region indicates the four seconds odor stimulation period, and the identity of the stimulus is indicated in each plot.</p>
<p><bold>(c)</bold>Raster plots are shown for four representative PNs during two blocks of trials. The same odorant was presented in both blocks. Note that spiking activity changes are repeatable across the block of trials.</p>

Y-axis represents the change in response over trials ((1st trial response – 25<sup>th</sup> trial response)/ (1<sup>st</sup> trial response + 25<sup>th</sup> trial response)). Positive numbers indicate that the first trial had a stronger response, hence response reduction. Negative numbers indicate that the last trial had a stronger response, hence response facilitation. Along the x-axis, the response in the 1<sup>st</sup> trial is shown. Vesicular depletion should impact the strongly activated neurons more, whereas lateral inhibition facilitation should progressively suppress weak responders.</p>
<p><bold>(e)</bold>Following the schematic in <bold><italic>panel d</italic></bold>, response changes observed in PNs are shown. Only PNs with significant odor-evoked responses are included in this plot. Responsiveness of PN was determined based on whether their peak odor-evoked response in the first trial exceeded the mean + 6.5 SDs of spontaneous activity preceding odor stimulation in that first trial. In total hex (L/H), n = 26, 39 PNs; oct (L/H), n = 35, 28 PNs; iaa (L/H), n = 39, 35 PNs; bza (L/H), n = 33, 40 PNs were included in the plot. Different colors and symbols are used to denote the identity of the odorant and its intensity (low-intensity trials – triangles and high-intensity trials – circles). The dotted line shows the regression fit revealing a linear relationship, if any, between the activation strength in the first trial (x-axis) and the response reduction observed (y-axis). As can be noted the R<sup>2</sup> values are low indicating that both vesicle depletion and lateral inhibition facilitation models fail to capture the adaptation trends in our datasets.</p>
<p>(<bold>f)</bold>Changes in PN spiking activity over trials during high-intensity odor exposures (y-axis) are plotted against response changes observed for the same PN during low-intensity exposures of the same odorant. The dotted line indicates the regression fit revealing a linear relationship between the response changes observed during high and low-intensity exposures of the same odorant (hex, R<sup>2</sup>=0.034; oct, R<sup>2</sup>=0.032; iaa R<sup>2</sup>=0.067; bza R<sup>2</sup>=0.0016). The poor linear regression fit here indicates that reductions in neural response amplitude for one odor intensity do not model reductions in response amplitude for another odor intensity.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="540073v1_fig2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>Next, we examined how individual PNs adapted during stimulus repetitions. Based on existing literature, two widely considered models of adaptation in the olfactory system are vesicular depletion and facilitation of lateral inhibition. While the vesicular depletion model predicts that the strongest firing neurons would adapt the most, in the lateral inhibition facilitation model the weakly activated neurons would progressively be suppressed more (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref></bold>). To test these two opposing but complementary theories, we calculated the percentage change in the total spike counts observed during first and the 25<sup>th</sup> odor presentations (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref></bold>, <italic>y-axis;</italic> positive values indicate weaker response in the later trial and hence response reduction, whereas negative values indicate facilitation of odor-evoked responses). We plotted these normalized response changes against the total spike counts observed in the very first trial (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref></bold>, <italic>x-axis</italic>). The dotted lines represent the best linear model that fit the two datasets we recorded. If vesicular depletion was the predominant form of adaptation, the slope of the regression line would be positive. Whereas a negative slope would indicate that lateral inhibition was the predominant form of adaptation. However, as can be noted, across both datasets with two concentrations of the four odorants tested, neither model captured the adaptation dynamics in our datasets (<italic>R</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> = 0.05, 0.01, respectively).</p>
<p>Are trial-to-trial changes in stimulus-evoked neural responses at two different concentrations of the same odorant correlated? If this is the case, then it would be reasonable to expect neurons that adapt more at the higher concentration to also change in a similar fashion at a lower concentration and <italic>vice versa</italic>. To assess this, we calculated and plotted the normalized change in spike counts for each PN at both high and low concentrations of the same odorant (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref></bold>). Notably, the PNs with the greatest response change during repetitions of the higher-intensity odor exposures were not the ones that adapted heavily when encountering the same stimulus at a lower intensity (<italic>R</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> = 0.034 (hex), 0.032 (oct), 0.067 (iaa), 0.0016 (bza)). In sum, these results indicate that change due to adaptation in individual neurons is not a simple function of its response strength. Further, how individual neurons adapted is a function of both odor identity and intensity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Adaptation and intensity decrements both reduce ensemble neural response strength</title>
<p>What is the overall change in the spiking response across the neural ensemble? To examine this, we calculated the average spiking response across all PNs recorded and plotted the spike counts as a function of time for each trial (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref></bold>). Expectedly, the overall response strength was stronger in the first trial and reduced when the same stimulus was repeatedly encountered. A similar reduction in overall response strengths was also observed when the odorant intensity was reduced (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref></bold>)</p>

</fig>
<p>Are the response reductions during stimulus repetition comparable to those observed with stimulus intensity decrements? To determine this, we plotted the total spike counts summed across all PNs over the entire stimulus presentation duration and plotted it as a function of the trial number (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref></bold>). We compared the changes over trials with the total spike counts observed during the high (H) and low (L) intensities of the same odorant. Notably, the total PN ensemble spike counts decreased due to both stimulus intensity reduction and repetition of the stimulus. Do these results indicate that adaptation could potentially confound information regarding stimulus intensity?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Adaptation-invariant encoding of odor intensity</title>
<p>Could the information regarding stimulus intensity be robustly encoded in the population neural responses? As noted earlier, both spiking activities in individual neurons and the volume of spikes at the ensemble level vary across trials. If adaptation alters the overall spiking activity amplitude (i.e. vector length; <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref></bold>), while changes in stimulus intensity alter the combination of activated neurons (i.e. vector direction; <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref></bold>), then information about odor identity and intensity can be preserved in an adaptationinvariant fashion. To test whether the recorded ensemble of neurons in our datasets encoded information in such an adaption-invariant fashion, we first visualized the high-dimensional neural activities in each trial using a dimensionality reduction approach (see <bold>Methods</bold>). We plotted the ensemble responses in each 50 ms time bin during the odor presentation time window (4 s), and linked them based on the order of their occurrence, to generate trial-by-trial odor response trajectories (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c, d</xref></bold>). Note that each trial generated a single loop response trajectory after dimensionality reduction. Further, neural responses in different trials evoked closed-loop trajectories that systematically reduced in length with increasing repetition but maintained their direction indicating that the combination of neurons activated were mostly conserved. Different odorants evoked responses that were markedly different in the combination of activated neurons and therefore their response trajectories were oriented in different directions. Notably, different concentrations of the same odorant also generated response trajectories that subtly varied in direction. As a direct consequence, even though the overall spiking activities reduced over trials, the odor response trajectories reliably maintained their direction in all the trials. Hence, information about odor identity and intensity was robustly maintained across all trials.</p>

<caption><title>Odor identity and intensity information is maintained across trials.</title>
<p><bold>(a)</bold>A schematic showing how the ensemble neural activity might change between two odorants and across multiple trials or repetition. The combination of neural activated should differ between different odorants, and therefore the odor identity should be represented by population response vectors that differ in their direction. Repetitions should reduce response strength without altering the combination of neurons activated.

<p>To quantify these observations, we performed a correlation analysis using high-dimensional PN response vectors. If a similar combination of PNs (high-dimensional activity vectors) were activated in two different trials, then their correlation will be high. Correlations across different trials and concentrations of the same odorant are shown in <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref></bold>. Confirming results from the dimensionality reduction analysis <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>)</bold>, we found odor-evoked responses across different trials of an odorant at a particular intensity were highly correlated (diagonal blocks on each panel). The similarity between odorevoked responses evoked by different concentrations of the same odorant was considerably less correlated (off-diagonal blocks). A hierarchical clustering analysis revealed that the odor-evoked responses nicely clustered based on odor identity and then by intensity (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref></bold>)</p>

<p>In sum, our results reveal that a combinatorial code could encode information regarding odor identity and intensity in an adaptation-invariant fashion.

<title>Neural response suppression vs. behavioral output facilitation</title>
<p>Neural responses evoked by an odorant reduced with repetition <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>)</bold>. However, as we noted earlier, the behavioral responses increased upon stimulus repetition (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref></bold>). This negative correlation is evident when the neural responses (total spiking activities evoked across neurons) was plotted against the behavioral POR response probability during a particular trial (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref></bold>). This negative correlation between neural suppression and behavioral enhancement was observed for all odorants and both concentrations examined. It is worth noting that the last trial of the high-intensity exposure evoked neural responses that were comparable in strength to the first trial of the low-intensity exposure of the same stimulus. Yet, the behavioral responses observed during these two trials were markedly different. Hence, our results also indicate that the probability of the POR response is not simply a function of the total number of spikes elicited.</p>

<title>Neural and behavioral changes due to adaptation are odor specific</title>
<p>Finally, we wondered if the neural response reduction and behavioral enhancements were a global, non-specific state change in the olfactory system brought about by the repetition of any odorant, or are the observed neural and behavioral response changes odor specific. To examine this, we used a ‘catch-trial paradigm.’ <bold>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>)</bold> In these sets of experiments, we repeatedly presented an odorant to induce adaptation. After a substantial reduction in the neural response or stabilization of the behavioral response, a deviant or catch stimulus was presented. Persistence of the observed reduction in neural responses and enhancement in behavioral responses when the catch stimulus is introduced would reveal that the adaptation-induced changes are not odor specific.</p>

<p>We used the catch-trial experiments with two different catch stimuli. Our neural recordings reveal that when iaa (ester) was used as the catch stimulus after repeated presentations of hex (alcohol), the neural responses strength recovered and increased to an overall higher-spike count (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref></bold>). The observed catchiaa response strength matched the unadapted response level to iaa when it was separately presented following a 15-minute reset window (i.e. <bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref></bold>, trial# 31). In contrast, when apple (a complex mixture) was used as the catch stimulus, the neural responses did not recover to higher levels indicating significant cross-adaptation (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref></bold>). Nevertheless, in both cases, the ensemble responses evoked by the catch stimulus were highly similar to the unadapted responses it usually generates (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref></bold>). Therefore, these results indicate that there is stimulus specificity to the adaptation-induced changes in neural responses and that cross-adaptation does not corrupt the identity of the deviant stimulus.</p>
<p>Behaviorally, we chose odor pairs where the component odorants had markedly different levels of POR responses <bold>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7d</xref>)</bold>. Repeated presentations of an odorant (bza or iaa) increased the P(POR) across the locusts as observed before <bold>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7e</xref>)</bold>. Notably when the catch stimulus was presented, the behavioral <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>responses dropped close to the first-trial P(POR) elicited by that odorant (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7f</xref></bold>; dotted line). These findings were also observed when the recurring and catch odorants were switched (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7f</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>In sum, these neural and behavioral results indicate that the observed neural and behavioral response changes brought about by the repeated encounters with an odorant are at least partially odorspecific and are not global non-specific changes in the olfactory system.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Sensory systems often have to deal with constraints that are of an opposing nature. For example, the ability to maintain stable representations is key to robust recognition of sensory stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Often variations in the external environment, such as humidity and temperature, may introduce changes in neural responses that have to be filtered out to preserve the identity of the stimuli. Additionally, the strength or intensity of the stimulus can also change widely. Compressing or even removing these variations might be necessary to recognize an odorant independent of its intensity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Alternately, in certain cases, it might also become important to maintain some of these variations so they can be exploited for guiding or altering the behavioral response. As an example, it might be worth noting that many chemicals that are pleasant at lower intensities can become repelling or even harmful to the organism at extremely high intensities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Hence, the behavioral responses should accordingly vary with intensity. Further, many organisms have shown that they can follow an odorant to their source (source localization). Such behaviors are of ecological importance as they allow the organisms to find the food source or potential mates. In all these cases, it becomes important to maintain variations with stimulus intensity to ensure the organisms are able to approach the odor source. In our earlier studies, we have focused on examining how robust odor recognition is achieved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Here we examined the latter problem of how to maintain information about the stimulus intensity while the responses in the neural circuits are becoming weaker due to adaptation.</p>
<p>Consistent with earlier studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, our data revealed that the response of individual projection neurons in the antennal lobe varied with the repetition of the same stimulus. While a reduction in odorevoked responses was observed in many neurons, an increase in spiking activity and changes in temporal firing patterns was also observed. Notably, these changes were not random but highly repeatable (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref></bold>). Hence, these results indicate that the effect of adaptation in a neural circuit is highly consistent and reliable.</p>
<p>In addition to spike rate reduction, oscillatory synchronization, and inter-neuronal coherence build up in the locust antennal lobe over repeated encounters with an odorant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. This short-term memory was not observed in the antenna but endured in the antennal lobe for several minutes after the termination of the stimulus. Similar results were also reported in the mouse olfactory bulb<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. The inputs from sensory neurons were shown to be consistent across repetition whereas the outputs of the olfactory bulb were systematically reduced with stimulus repetition. These results suggest that loci of short-term adaptation, at least when the stimulus is discontinuous and recurring, is in the antennal lobe/olfactory bulb circuitry. Although the precise mechanism for achieving the same is not fully understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>What is the computational significance of this neural adaptation? Sensory adaptation has been implicated in several important computations such as high-pass filtering, matching neural response to stimulus statistics, generating sparser codes, and optimal representations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. In the olfactory system, adaptation has also been suggested to stabilize neural representation such that recognition of odor identity from ensemble neural responses improved after repeated encounters with the stimulus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. However, adaptation also introduces a potential confound whereby the absolute neural response strength becomes an unreliable indicator of stimulus strength. Our results extend these earlier studies by revealing how this potential confound could be resolved in the olfactory system.</p>
<p>Increases in stimulus intensity have also been shown to result in higher response amplitudes in firing neurons and in the recruitment of additional activated neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. While our results show that this is indeed true, we also found that several neurons responded preferentially during the lower concentration exposures but did not respond when the higher intensity of the same stimulus was presented (<bold><xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 2</xref></bold>). Hence, the activated combination of neurons differed both with stimulus identity and intensity. Furthermore, even though adaptation reduced the overall spiking activities across neurons, the combination of neurons activated was robustly maintained. In other words, the population response vector direction (determined by the combination of neurons activated) was consistent. Only the vector length (determined by the total spikes across neurons) is reduced with the repetition of the stimulus. This simple approach was sufficient to encode the information about the odor intensity in an adaptation-invariant fashion. Additionally, since equivalent information about stimulus identity and intensity was preserved with fewer spikes, neural adaptation can be considered as a method of optimizing the neural representation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Does the observed persistence of concentration information in the neural activities after adaptation translate to observable differences in behavioral outcomes? Using an innate palp-opening response (POR) we examined how behavioral responses varied with stimulus repetition. Unlike the neural responses, we found that the PORs increased with repetition and after about five trials settled into odor-specific levels of responses. Notably, the PORs in the later trials were significantly higher for higher stimulus intensities for most of the odorants used. In sum, our results showed that locusts are better able to behaviorally differentiate stimulus intensity after adaptation.</p>
<p>Alternately, adaptation due to the repetition of an odorant could alter the perceived intensity of the recurring odorant or other related test odorants. The compromise of stimulus intensity information due to adaptation has been observed in behavioral discrimination tasks in rats and even in psychophysical studies in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Such a result can arise when the combinatorial response patterns evoked by the adapting and the test stimulus have significant overlap. However, our results indicate that when changes in odor intensities alter the combination of neurons activated, it is feasible to maintain information about odor intensity levels in a robust fashion.</p>
<p>Finally, we note that the anticorrelated link between neural suppression and behavioral enhancements (called ‘repetition priming’) is well established in other animal models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. How can weaker neural responses lead to enhanced behavioral outcomes? Our results indicate that the antennal lobe neural responses in later trials were not sharpened by pruning out weaker responses (<bold><xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 2</xref></bold>). The weakening of the response strength could potentially lead to a sparser response in the downstream mushroom body. In addition, as we noted earlier, neural response synchrony increases with stimulus repetition. Whether weaker but synchronized activity in neurons drives sparser and more selective responses which then produce enhanced behavioral outcomes remains to be carefully examined.</p>

<title>Odor stimulation</title>
<p>For delivering odorants, we followed a protocol described in our earlier work. Briefly, odorants were diluted in mineral oil to either 1% or 0.1% concentration (v/v) and sealed in glass bottles (60 ml) with an air inlet and outlet. A pneumatic picopump (WPI Inc., PV-820) was used to displace a constant volume (0.1 L/min) of the static headspace above the diluted odor-mineral oil mixture into a desiccated carrier air stream (0.75 L/min) directed toward one of the locust’s antennae. A vacuum funnel placed behind the locust preparation continuously removed the delivered odors.</p>
<p>The first set of experiments included multiple blocks, with twenty-five trials each when one odorant at one intensity was repeatedly presented. Each trial in the block included a four-second stimulus presentation window. The inter-stimulus interval (between trials) was 60 seconds. Different odorants at different intensities were repeatedly presented in different blocks. A 15-minute window, when no stimulus was presented, separated two consecutive blocks of trials. This window was included to reset any short-term memory that may have formed due to repeated presentation of the same stimulus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The second set of experiments involved two blocks of trials. The first block of trials included 30 trials and the second block consisted of ten trials. In the first 25 trials of block 1, hexanol at 1% v/v was repeatedly presented. In the 26<sup>th</sup> trial, a puff of either isoamyl acetate 1% v/v or apple 1% v/v (a ‘deviant’ odorant) was presented. In trials 27-30, hexanol at 1% v/v was again presented. This was followed by a 15-minute reset window when no stimulus was presented. In the second block of ten trials (trials 31-40), the deviant stimulus was repeatedly presented. All inter-stimulus intervals (between trials) were 60 seconds and all odor presentations were four seconds long.</p>

<title>Electrophysiology</title>
<p>Post-fifth instar adult locusts (<italic>Schistocerca americana</italic>) were reared in a crowded colony with a 12-hour - 12 hour light-dark cycle. both males and females were used for electrophysiological experiments. First, the locusts were immobilized with both antennae intact. Then the primary olfactory region of their brain, the antennal lobes, were exposed, desheathed, and perfused with room-temperature locust saline. Extracellular multiunit recordings of projection neurons (PNs) were performed with a 16-channel, 4x4 silicon probe (NeuroNexus) that was superficially inserted in the antennal lobe (AL). Prior to each experiment, all probes were electroplated with gold to achieve impedances in the range of 200 to 300 kΩ. The recordings were acquired with a custom 16-channel amplifier (Biology Electronics Ship; Caltech, Pasadena, CA). The signals were amplified with a 10k gain, bandpass filtered (0.3 to 6 kHz), and sampled at 15 kHz using a LabView data acquisition system.

<p>This study addresses an <bold>important</bold> question in sensory neuroscience: how the olfactory system distinguishes decreases in stimulus intensity from decreases in neural responses due to adaptation. Based on a combination of electrophysiological and behavioral analyses, <bold>solid</bold> evidence establishes that neural coding changes differently between intensity reductions and adaptation. Intriguingly, behavioral responses tend to increase as the neural responses decrease, suggesting that core features of the odor response persist through adaptation. While the experimental results are <bold>convincing</bold> overall, the conclusions would be strengthened by more refined statistical analysis and data quantification.</p>

<p>The authors use electrophysiological and behavioral measurements to examine how animals could reliably determine odor intensity/concentration across repeated experiences. Because stimulus repetition leads to short-term adaptation evidenced by reduced overall firing rates in the antennal lobe and firing rates are otherwise concentration-dependent, there could be an ambiguity in sensory coding between reduced concentration or more recent experience. This would have a negative impact on the animal's ability to generate adaptive behavioral responses that depend on odor intensities. The authors conclude that changes in concentration alter the constituent neurons contributing to the neural population response, whereas adaptation maintains the 'activated ensemble' but with scaled firing rates. This provides a neural coding account of the ability to distinguish odor concentrations even after extended experience. Additional analyses attempt to distinguish hypothesized circuit mechanisms for adaptation but are inconclusive. A larger point that runs through the manuscript is that overall spiking activity has an inconsistent relationship with behavior and that the structure of population activity may be the more appropriate feature to consider.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, the dissociation of effects of odor concentration and adaptation on olfactory system population codes was not previously demonstrated. This is a significant contribution that improves on any simple model based on overall spiking activity. The primary result is most strikingly supported by visualization of a principal components analysis in Figure 4. However, there are some weaknesses in the data and analyses that limit confidence in the overall conclusions.</p>
<p>1. Behavioral work interpreted to demonstrate discrimination of different odor concentrations yields inconsistent results. Only two of the four odorants follow the pattern that is emphasized in the text (Figure 1F). Though it's a priori unlikely that animals are incapable of distinguishing odor concentrations at any stage in adaptation, the evidence presented is not sufficient to reach this conclusion.</p>
<p>2. While conclusions center on concepts related to the combination of activated neurons or the &quot;active ensemble&quot;, this specific level of description is not directly demonstrated in any part of the results. We see individual neural responses and dimensional reduction analyses, but we are unable to assess to what extent the activated ensemble is maintained across experience.</p>
<p>3. There is little information about the variance or statistical strength of results described at the population level. While the PCA presents a compelling picture, the central point that concentration changes and adaptation alter population responses across separable dimensions is not demonstrated quantitatively. The correlation analysis that might partially address this question is presented to be visually interpreted with no additional testing.</p>
<p>4. Results are often presented separately for each odor stimulus or for separate datasets including two odor stimuli. An effort should be made to characterize patterns of results across all odor stimuli and their statistical reliability. This concern arises throughout all data presentations.</p>
<p>5. The relevance of the inconclusive analysis of inferred adaptation mechanisms in Figure 2d-f and the single experiment including a complex mixture in Figure 7 to the motivating questions for this study are unclear.</p>
<p>6. Throughout the description of the results, typical standards for statistical reporting (sample size, error bars, etc.) are not followed. This prevents readers from assessing effect sizes and undermines the ability to assign a confidence to any particular conclusion.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors' main goal was to evaluate how both behavioral responses to odor, and their early sensory representations are modified by repeated exposure to odor, asking whether the process of adaptation is equivalent to reducing the concentration of an odor. They open with behavioral experiments that actually establish that repeated odor presentation increases the likelihood of evoking a behavioral response in their experimental subjects - locusts. They then examine neural activity patterns at the second layer of the olfactory circuit. At the population level, repeated odor exposure reduces total spike counts, but at the level of individual cells there seems to be no consistent guiding principle that describes the adaptation-related changes, and therefore no single mechanism could be identified.</p>
<p>Both population vector analysis and pattern correlation analysis indicate that odor intensity information is preserved through the adaptation process. They make the closely related point that responses to an odor in the adapted state are distinct from responses to lower concentration of the same odor. These analyses are appropriate, but the point could be strengthened by explicitly using some type of classification analysis to quantify the adaptation effects. e.g. a confusion matrix might show if there is a gradual shift in odor representations, or whether there are trials where representations change abruptly.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
One strength is that the work has both behavioral read-out of odor perception and electrophysiological characterization of the sensory inputs and how both change over repeated stimulus presentations. It is particularly interesting that behavioral responses increase while neuronal responses generally decrease. Although the behavioral effect could occur fully downstream of the sensory responses the authors measure, at least those sensory responses retain the core features needed to drive behavior despite being highly adapted.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Ultimately no clear conceptual framework arises to understand how PN responses change during adaptation. Neither the mechanism (vesicle depletion versus changes in lateral inhibition) nor even a qualitative description of those changes. Perhaps this is because much of the analysis is focused on the entire population response, while perhaps different mechanisms operate on different cells making it difficult to understand things at the single PN level.</p>
<p>From the x-axis scale in Fig 2e,f it appeared to me that they do not observe many strong PN responses to these stimuli, everything being &lt; 10 spikes/sec. So perhaps a clearer effect would be observed if they managed to find the stronger responding PNs than captured in this dataset.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
How does the brain distinguish stimulus intensity reduction from response reductions due to adaptation? Ling et al study whether and how the locust olfactory system encodes stimulus intensity and repetition differently. They show that these stimulus manipulations have distinguishable effects on population dynamics.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
1. Provides a potential strategy with which the brain can distinguish intensity decrease from adaptation. -- while both conditions reduce overall spike counts, intensity decrease can also changes which neurons are activated and adaptation only changes the response magnitude without changing the active ensemble.</p>
<p>
2. By interleaving a non-repeated odor, they show that these changes are odor-specific and not a non-specific effect.</p>
<p>
3. Describes how proboscis orientation response (POR) changes with stimulus repetition., Unlike the spike counts, POR increases in probability with stimulus. The data portray the variability across subjects in a clear way.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
1. Behavior</p>
<p>
a. While the &quot;learning curve&quot; of the POR is nicely described, the behavior itself receives very little description. What are the kinematics of the movement, and do these vary with repetition? Is the POR all-or-nothing or does it vary trial to trial?</p>
<p>b. What are the reaction times? This can constrain what time window is relevant in the neural responses. E.g., if the reaction time is 500 ms, then only the first 500 ms of the ensemble response deserves close scrutiny. Later spikes cannot contribute.</p>
<p>c. The behavioral methods are lacking some key information. While references are given to previous work, the reader should not be obligated to look at other papers to answer basic questions: how was the response measured? Video tracking? Hand scored?</p>
<p>d. Can we be sure that this is an odor response? Although airflow out of the olfactometer is ongoing throughout the experiment, opening and closing valves usually creates pressure jumps that are likely to activate mechanosensors in the antennae.</p>
<p>e. What is the baseline rate of PORs in the absence of stimuli?</p>
<p>e.What can you say about the purpose of the POR? I lack an intuition for why a fly would wiggle the maxillary palps. This is a question that is probably impossible to answer definitively, but even a speculative explanation would help the reader better understand.</p>
<p>2. Physiology</p>
<p>
a. Does stimulus repetition affect &quot;spontaneous&quot; activity (i.e., firing in the interstimulus interval? To study this question, in Figures 2b and c, it would be valuable to display more of the pre-stimulus period, and a quantification of the stability or lability of the inter-stimulus activity.</p>
<p>b. When does the response change stabilize? While the authors compare repetition 1 to repetition 25, from the rasters it appears that the changes have largely stabilized after the 3rd or 4th repetition. In Figure 5, there is a clear difference between repetition 1-3 or so and the rest. Are successive repetitions more similar than more temporally-separated repetitions (e.g., is rep 13 more similar to 14 than to 17?). I was not able to judge this based on the dendrograms of Figure 5. If the responses do stabilize at it appears, it would be more informative to focus on the dynamics of the first few repetitions.</p>
<p>c. How do temporal dynamics change? Locust PNs have richly varied temporal dynamics, but how these may be affected is not clear. The across-population average is poorly suited to capture this feature of the activity. For example, the PNs often have an early transient response, and these appear to be timed differently across the population. These structures will be obscured in a cross population average. Looking at the rasters, it looks like the initial transient changes its timing (e.g., PN40 responses move earlier; PN33 responses move later.). Quantification of latency to first spike after stimulus may make a useful measure of the dynamics.</p>
<p>d. How legitimate is the link between POR and physiology? While their changes can show a nice correlation, the fact the data were taken from separate animals makes them less compelling than they would be otherwise. How feasible is it to capture POR and physiology in the same prep? This would be most helpful, but I suspect may be too technically challenging to be within scope.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewers for their useful and constructive comments. In this provisional response, we will address a few of the major issues and plan to submit a detailed, point-by-point response along with the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>1. Robustness of activated combination of neurons (the ‘activated ensemble’).</p>
<p>The reviewers have asked for additional analyses and visualization of the group of neurons activated and a classification analysis to illustrate the point that the activated set of neurons would allow discrimination between different concentrations even after the spiking activity reduced significantly in the later trials. We relied on visualization using PCA (Manuscript Fig. 4) and quantification using correlation analysis (Manuscript Fig. 5a and Manuscript Supplementary Figure 2). But this point can be easily amplified further to support our conclusions and address a major concern raised by the reviewers.</p>
<p>Visualization of neural responses across trials and odorants: As recommended, we followed the procedures used in Stopfer et al., 2003 (Fig. 6c) and Miura et al., 2012(Fig. 3C) to image neural responses across recorded PNs as a matrix (Author response image 1).</p>
<fig id="sa4fig1">

<title>Author response image 1: Spike counts averaged over the entire 4s odor presentation window across all recorded neurons are shown as a function of trial number (columns).</title>
<p>The sorting is same across different panels. Note that there are 80 neurons whose response was monitored for hexanol and octanol responses (Dataset 1; first row of panels), and 81 neurons whose response was monitored for isoamyl acetate and benzaldehyde (Dataset 2; second row of panels). As can be noted, across the 25 trials the pattern of activation remains consistent. Also, the activated combination of neurons varied robustly with odor identity and intensity.</p>

</fig>
<p>Classification analysis: To illustrate that there is enough information to recognize an odorant and discriminate between different intensities, we performed a leave-one-trial-out classification analysis. The left-out trial was assigned the class label of its nearest neighbor (using correlation distance metric). The results from this classification analysis are shown below in Author response image 2. As a control, we shuffled the odor class labels and repeated the leave-one-trial-out classification analysis.</p>

<title>Author response image 2: Results from classification analysis are shown for the two datasets: hexanol–octanol at different concentrations (dataset 1; 80 PNs), and isoamyl acetate and benzaldehyde (dataset 2; 81 PNs).</title>
<p>We did a leave-onetrial-out validation. The true odor label is shown along the x-axis and the predicted odor label is shown along the yaxis. As can be noted, the class labels for every single trial were correctly predicted in both datasets. The result after class labels were shuffled is also shown for comparison. These results strongly support our conclusion that odor intensity information is preserved and odor concentration can be recognized independent of adaptation.</p>

<p>Correlation with the first trial:</p>
<p>We had shown the correlation across odorants and concentrations as a function of the trial (manuscript Figure 5A). To complement these analyses, here we focus on the correlations with the response evoked in the first trial of each odorant at high and low concentrations and plot this information as a function of trial number (Author response image 3, 4). As can be noted, the correlation across different trials of a given odorant at specific concentrations remains much higher than all other conditions.</p>

<p>Behavioral significance and dynamics: The reviewers had wondered about the relevance of the behavior to the organism. The maxillary palps are sensory organs close to the mouth parts that are used to grab food and help with the feeding process. In our previous studies, we had shown that these palpopening responses are innately triggered by many ‘appetitive odorants.’ However, the probability of palp opening varied across different odorants (Chandak and Raman, 2023). Some odorants evoked higher palp-opening responses and others reduced the probability of palp-opening response (below the median value across odorants). Since all other parameters (such as the clicking sound of valves, and mechanical cues due to airflow during odor presentation), are the same across these different odorants, these observed differences in palp-opening response probability are attributed to the identity of the odorants presented.</p>
<fig id="sa4fig5">
<label>Author response image 5.</label>

<title>Author response image 5: Preference indices were calculated for all odors tested and are shown as a bar plot (n = 26 locusts).</title>
<p>Blue bars indicate odors classified as appetitive, gray bars indicate neutral odors and red bars indicate unappetitive odors. Locusts with a significant deviation from the median response (one-sided binomial test, P &lt; 0.1, were classified as either being appetitive or unappetitive; *P &lt; 0.1, **P &lt; 0.05, ***P &lt; 0.01). Error bars indicate s.e.m. [Replotted Fig 1.c from Chandak and Raman, 2023].</p>
</caption>
<graphic mime-subtype="jpg" xlink:href="elife-89330-sa4-fig5.jpg" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>We had also shown that we could train locusts to have stereo-typed palp-opening responses using the classical conditioning approach (odor – odor-conditioned stimulus and food reward – unconditioned stimulus; Video: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://static">https://static</ext-link>-
content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fncomms7953/MediaObjects/41467_2015_BFncomms7953 _MOESM483_ESM.mov; Saha et al., 2015). The dynamics of those conditioned palp-opening responses have been well characterized.</p>
<p>We will use similar tracking procedures to monitor and quantify the dynamics of innate palp-opening responses as well. We will add supplementary videos to fully capture this behavior.</p>
<p>Early vs. late neural responses:</p>
<p>Since behavioral responses are more likely to start as soon as the odorant is presented, the reviewers wondered whether there are differences in the observed findings if we focus only on the early neural activity (as it might be more important to triggering behavior). Note that the median response time for conditioned palp-opening responses is less than 750 ms (Saha et al., 2015, Chandak and Raman, 2023). Hence, we divided the neural dataset and analyzed the neural response patterns during these early (0-750 ms after onset) and late (2-4 s after odor onset) time windows. In both these epochs, we found that the total spike counts across neurons reduced as a function of trial number or repetition and the combination of neuron activated remained robust (Author response images 6-11).  Hence, we conclude that while the neural responses in different time windows would be important for shaping other parameters of behavioral response dynamics, the overall behavioral response probability that we used in our analysis had a similar relationship with early, late, or total neural activity during the entire odor presentation (i.e. time-window of the neural response did not matter for the analyses presented in the manuscript).</p>

<p>Other Statistical Tests:</p>
<p>The reviewers felt that in many analyses, we did not include error bars to indicate the sample size, SEM, or SD. We will fix this by adding the sample size information to each panel and as appropriate. However, we would also like to point out that many of the analyses are done in a trial-by-trial fashion (e.g. Manuscript Figures 3 – 6). For these analyses, it would not be possible to add SEM or SD. One condition (hex -H or iaa-H) was repeated in each dataset, and we have added them in the results shown in this response letter to demonstrate repeatability. We will strive our best to add these statistics as would be appropriate, but this cannot be done for the trial-by-trial analyses.</p>
