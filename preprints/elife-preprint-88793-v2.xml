<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Synthetic autotrophy is a promising avenue to sustainable bioproduction from CO<sub>2</sub>. Here, we use iterative laboratory evolution to generate several distinct autotrophic strains. Utilising this genetic diversity, we identify that just three mutations are sufficient for <italic>E. coli</italic> to grow autotrophically, when introduced alongside non-native energy (formate dehydrogenase) and carbon-fixing (RuBisCO, phosphoribulokinase, carbonic anhydrase) modules. The mutated genes are involved in glycolysis (<italic>pgi</italic>), central-carbon regulation (<italic>crp</italic>), and RNA transcription (<italic>rpoB</italic>). The <italic>pgi</italic> mutation reduces the enzyme’s activity, thereby stabilising the carbon-fixing cycle by capping a major branching flux. For the other two mutations, we observe down-regulation of several metabolic pathways and increased expression of native genes associated with the carbon-fixing module (<italic>rpiB</italic>) and the energy module (<italic>fdoGH</italic>), as well as an increased ratio of NADH/NAD+ - the cycle’s electron-donor. This study demonstrates the malleability of metabolism and its capacity to switch trophic modes using only a small number of genetic changes and could facilitate transforming other heterotrophic organisms into autotrophs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Anthropogenic interference and intensive burning of fossil fuels releases large amounts of sequestered carbon in the form of CO<sub>2</sub>, a main driver of climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Olofsson and Hickler 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Friedlingstein et al. 2022</xref>). Direct air carbon capture, by any means, is urgently needed to help reduce emissions. Here, we focus on biology-based carbon fixation as a potential avenue for CO<sub>2</sub> capture, which has been shown to be a potentially efficient production platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Leger et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Van Peteghem et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Schwander et al. 2016</xref>). Specifically, we suggest using microbes for CO<sub>2</sub> valorization and produce a diverse repertoire of products including food, fuel, bio-plastics or other commodities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Claassens et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gleizer et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Li et al. 2012</xref>; Nielsen and Keasling 2016). Natural autotrophs already metabolise CO<sub>2</sub> efficiently, yet most are challenging to cultivate and manipulate genetically compared to heterotrophic model organisms like <italic>E. coli</italic>. Here we explore an emerging alternative approach – converting heterotrophic model organisms into tractable autotrophs for bio-production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gleizer et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Baumschabl et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gassler et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gleizer et al. 2019</xref>). In addition to promising engineering applications, studying the transition from heterotrophic to autotrophic metabolism can uncover fundamental principles about the structure and regulation of carbon fixation metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gleizer et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gassler et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Antonovsky et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Barenholz et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Flamholz et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Herz et al. 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, with the increasing interest in platforms for sustainable production, synthetic biologists have been able to successfully manipulate different organisms to enable major metabolic transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gassler et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gleizer et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kim et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Keller et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bang et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Satanowski et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Yishai et al. 2018</xref>). These efforts resulted in the successful introduction of non-native C1 utilisation pathways, and even included successful transitions from heterotrophic into completely autotrophic metabolisms in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gleizer et al. 2019</xref>) and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gassler et al. 2020</xref>). These previous studies introduced the reductive pentose phosphate (rPP) cycle, the most prominent carbon fixation pathway in nature (also known as the Calvin-Benson cycle), into <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>) and <italic>Komagataella phaffii</italic> (previously <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic>). Indeed, we showed that <italic>E. coli</italic> was able to utilise the rPP cycle for the synthesis of all biomass carbon - thus converting it from a heterotroph to an autotroph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gleizer et al. 2019</xref>). However, this transition required continuous culture in selective conditions for several months (adaptive lab evolution) and resulted in many uninterpretable mutations, exposing a large knowledge gap.</p>
<p>Using adaptive lab evolution presents a challenge as it is hard to isolate the changes necessary for a given phenotype from the overall set of accumulated mutations. Here we aimed to characterise the landscape of mutations required for autotrophic growth. Studying mutations that arise in multiple lineages can help us better understand the biological basis for the heterotroph-to-autotroph transition. To achieve this goal, we created a pipeline that enabled us to distinguish mutations essential for autotrophy from unspecific low-frequency mutations, i.e. ones that are generally promoted by the physiological conditions in evolution experiments. The final outcome of this pipeline is a compact essential set of changes permitting autotrophy in <italic>E. coli</italic>. We then proceeded with further analyses to shed light on the mechanism behind this compact set of essential mutations. We show the phenotype included a change in the activity of a central carbon metabolism enzyme and intracellular changes of the non-native carbon fixation cycle’s metabolite and co-factors pools. We conclude by speculating about the role of these metabolic changes.</p>

<title>A compact set of mutations that enable autotrophic growth was identified using rational design, iterative lab evolution and genetic engineering</title>
<p>Adaptive lab evolution is an effective tool that enables integration of non-native metabolic pathways. In order to harness the power of adaptive lab evolution, a selection system must be implemented to direct the evolution towards the desired function. In our case, the selection for the activity of the non-native rPP cycle. To ensure that some level of carbon fixation by RuBisCO becomes essential for growth, we knocked out phosphofructokinase (<italic>pfkA</italic> and <italic>pfkB</italic>), and 6-phosphate-1-dehydrogenase (<italic>zwf</italic>) which creates a stoichiometric imbalance and growth arrest when growing on five carbon sugars such as xylose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gleizer et al. 2019</xref>). This imbalance could be rescued by a metabolic bypass - the phosphorylation of ribulose-5-P by Prk and the subsequent carboxylation by RuBisCO, thereby coupling growth to the heterologously expressed rPP enzymes. Critically, this setup allowed us to evolve <italic>E. coli</italic>, a natural heterotroph, into an autotroph, using a non-native rPP cycle to utilise CO<sub>2</sub> as a sole carbon-source. This system also requires formate dehydrogenase to oxidise formate for energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gleizer et al. 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Although adaptive lab evolution is a powerful tool, it also presents a challenge - once a new phenotype has been achieved, it is hard to separate the essential changes required for its appearance from the overall set of accumulated mutations. In many cases, mutations occur on the background of highly adaptive ones, leading to a spread of neutral “hitchhiker” mutations in the population. In other cases, mutations that appeared at the beginning of the evolution are no longer needed for the final phenotype. Our goal was to find a set of mutations that, if introduced into a heterotrophic wild type <italic>E. coli</italic>, would result in the successful integration of the non-native carbon fixation and energy modules. This would enable autotrophic growth based solely on genetic engineering without the need for further evolutionary adaptation and potentially uncovering the mechanism behind this metabolic transition.</p>
<p>To isolate the essential genetic changes, we used a workflow that included three main stages as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. A) rational design-introduction of required heterologous genes and metabolic knockouts to enforce RuBisCO-dependent growth; B) adaptive lab evolution-revealing mutation candidates by growing the designed strain in autotrophic-selecting conditions over many generations until an autotrophic phenotype is obtained; C) evolution-inspired genetic engineering-introducing the most promising mutations revealed in stage B into the designed strain and testing it for autotrophic growth. Stages B and C were repeated until no further evolution was required, i.e. the designed strain in stage C had an autotrophic phenotype.</p>

<caption><title>Autotrophic phenotype achieved by introducing 3 mutations on top of a rationally designed ancestor.</title>
<p><bold>(A)</bold> We rationally designed the “wild-type” E. coli background strain (BW25113, depicted as a black bacterium) by introducing 4 enzymes: RuBisCO (cbbM), phosphoribulokinase (prkA), carbonic anhydrase (CA) and formate dehydrogenase (fdh), and 3 genomic knockouts: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (zwf) and phosphofructokinase A&amp;B (pfkAB). We denote the resulting strain as “ancestor” (brown bacterium). <bold>(B)</bold> We tested the resulting strain for autotrophic growth and, since it didn’t grow, we used it for adaptive lab evolution in xylose-limited chemostats - i.e., conditions that select for higher carbon fixation flux. Altogether, we were able to isolate three evolved clones (two distinct strains from one chemostat experiment, Evolved I &amp; II, and another strain from a second experiment, Evolved III, step B1). <bold>(C)</bold> Out of four consensus mutations that we identified, two - rpoB and pgi - were incorporated into the ancestor, giving “ancestor 2.0” (light blue bacterium, step C1). Once more, we tested for autotrophic growth and were unsuccessful. Therefore, we initiated another round of adaptive lab evolution experiments using ancestor 2.0 growing in two xylose limited chemostats and isolated two evolved clones (one from each chemostat, step B2). The two clones shared a single consensus mutation, in crp. We thus created a new strain from ancestor 2.0 by introducing the crp mutation into it (blue bacterium, step C2). This strain could grow autotrophically and thus we achieved a compact autotrophic strain.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>To find the most promising mutations in stage B, we applied at least one of two criteria: mutations in genes that occur repeatedly in different autotrophic lineages (but are uncommon in other adaptive lab evolution experiments) or mutations that when reverted, result in a loss of phenotype. We discovered these “consensus” mutations by sequencing isolated autotrophic clones, obtained from repeated adaptive lab evolution experiments-similar to the conditions we used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gleizer et al. 2019</xref> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>; steps B1, B2).</p>
<p>In practice, we inoculated the strain denoted as Ancestor into a chemostat with limited xylose and excess formate. After ≈3 months (≈60 chemostat generations) we isolated from the chemostat a clone able to grow under autotrophic conditions (methods), and compared its mutation set to those of two previously evolved autotrophic clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gleizer et al. 2019</xref>). The intersection of the three clones contained 4 genes that were mutated in all autotrophic isolated clones: the central carbon metabolism enzyme phosphoglucoisomerase (<italic>pgi</italic>), the beta subunit of the RNA polymerase (<italic>rpoB</italic>), poly A polymerase (<italic>pcnB</italic>) and the MalT DNA-binding transcriptional activator (<italic>malT</italic>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, step B1). <italic>rpoB, pcnB</italic> and <italic>malT</italic> are genes that are commonly mutated in adaptive lab evolution experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Phaneuf, Gosting, and Palsson 2019</xref>), suggesting that they have little relevance for autotrophic growth. Therefore, we chose to focus on the <italic>pgi</italic> mutation.</p>
<p>We introduced the H386Y <italic>pgi</italic> mutation into the rationally designed ancestor (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, step C1), and the engineered strain was tested for growth in autotrophic conditions (methods). No growth was observed in those conditions, which meant that additional mutations were necessary in order to achieve autotrophy.</p>
<p>Genomic sequencing revealed that during the genetic manipulation for introducing the <italic>pgi</italic> mutation, another mutation in <italic>rpoB</italic> (A1245V) appeared in the genome. In parallel, reverting a variety of RNA polymerase mutations in other evolved strains back to their wild-type allele, showed that mutations in RNA polymerase are in fact essential to the phenotype. Therefore, despite the fact that it was unintentional, and different from the other <italic>rpoB</italic> mutations observed in the ALE experiments, we left the mutation in the genome and proceeded with this strain.</p>
<p>This strain, mutated in both <italic>pgi</italic> and <italic>rpoB</italic> (denoted “ancestor 2.0”) was then used as the starting point for another round of evolution (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, step B2). Since it had already contained two mutations that were likely to be relevant for the desired phenotype, we expected to observe evolved autotrophic strains after fewer generations, compared to the first round, and to find fewer mutations in them. Indeed, on two separate experiments, it took roughly one month until autotrophic growth was observed, as opposed to more than 90 days in previous attempts. Even though these strains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, “Evolved 4” and “Evolved 5”) both had multiple mutations, only one mutation was shared between these independent evolution experiments - a non-synonymous mutation in the cAMP receptor protein, <italic>crp</italic> (H22N). When we introduced this mutation to the “ancestor 2.0” background in the evolution-inspired genetic engineering stage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, step C2), the strain was immediately able to grow under autotrophic conditions.</p>
<p>Since the RNA polymerase mutation was introduced into this strain (<italic>rpoB</italic> A1245V) as a byproduct of genetic engineering and never observed in the adaptive evolution experiments, we needed to verify its essentiality to the autotrophic phenotype. We found that a reversion of <italic>rpoB</italic> A1245V back to the wild-type allele causes a loss of the autotrophic phenotype. We therefore could conclude that three mutations (<italic>pgi</italic>*, <italic>crp</italic>* and <italic>rpoB</italic>*) are sufficient to facilitate the autotrophic phenotype on top of the heterotrophic ancestor background. We denote the final engineered autotrophic <italic>E. coli</italic> strain, the “compact autotrophic <italic>E. coli</italic>”.</p>
<p>We verified the genotype using whole genome sequencing (methods). The results included the rationally designed knockouts (Δ<italic>pfkA,</italic> Δ<italic>pfkB</italic>, Δ<italic>zwf</italic>), heterologous plasmids (energy and carbon-fixing modules) and the three introduced mutations (<italic>pgi</italic>*, <italic>crp</italic>* and <italic>rpoB</italic>*). During the genetic engineering process, two additional mutations occurred unintentionally in the genes <italic>uhpT</italic> and <italic>yejG</italic>. <italic>uhpT</italic> is a hexose transporter and is unlikely to have any effect on the autotrophic phenotype, especially because the mutation was an early stop codon (Q7*) and likely a loss of function. As the function of <italic>yejG</italic> is unknown, we wanted to ensure that it is not essential to the autotrophic phenotype. Therefore, we reverted the mutation back to its wild-type allele and found that indeed the cells were still autotrophic.</p>
<p>Thus, we constructed a new autotrophic strain with three essential mutations (<italic>pgi</italic>, <italic>crp</italic> &amp; <italic>rpoB</italic>), which we denoted the <italic>compact</italic> strain.

<title>Introduction of autotrophy-enabling gene set into wild-type background does not require bypass-prevention for growth</title>
<p>As described above, in order to select for autotrophic growth, the native <italic>E. coli</italic> was metabolically re-wired by 3 auxiliary genomic knockouts (Δ<italic>pfkA,</italic> Δ<italic>pfkB</italic>, Δ<italic>zwf</italic>). These knockouts created a dependency on carboxylation by RuBisCO for growth even when consuming pentose sugars which were supplemented during the chemostat evolution (see methods, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Antonovsky et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gleizer et al. 2019</xref>). This dependency was expected to direct the evolution towards increased usage of the synthetic rPP cycle and, eventually, to autotrophic growth.</p>
<p>Once autotrophic growth was achieved, and the enabling gene set was found, we wanted to test if these auxiliary knockouts (<italic>pfkA pfkB</italic> and <italic>zwf</italic>) were still required for the phenotype. We introduced the set of autotrophy-enabling genes into a wild-type (BW25113) <italic>E. coli</italic> background (methods, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). After doing so, we discovered an unintentional genomic mutation, in the ribosomal 16S subunit (rrsA) that was introduced during the genomic manipulation process. The engineered <italic>E. coli</italic> strain was able to grow autotrophically, although its final OD was half and its growth rate was less than half of that of the rationally designed compact strain still harbouring the auxiliary knockouts (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). This indicates that the “autotrophic enabling gene set” is sufficient to achieve the trophic mode change and that the knockouts are helpful but not essential for the final autotrophic growth. As discussed below, this demonstrates that, in some cases, metabolic rewiring could be viewed as a temporary “<italic>metabolic scaffold</italic>” which can be removed from the genotype once the desired phenotype is achieved.</p>
<fig id="fig3" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure">
<label>Fig. 3.</label>
<caption><title>Auxiliary knockouts are not required for final phenotype.</title>
<p>We transformed a wild-type BW25113 E. coli strain (black bacteria) with the carboxylating and energy module plasmids (grey circles with coloured gene annotations), and inserted 3 auxiliary genomic knockouts (red octagon) to rewire metabolism toward carboxylating dependency. This strain was used for iterative evolution experiments in order to generate diverse autotrophic strains and reveal mutations candidates for rational design, i.e. consensus mutations. The identified autotrophic enabling mutations (thin grey circle) were then introduced in a wild type strain expressing the heterologous plasmids but without the auxiliary knockouts, the final strain was able to grow in autotrophic conditions. Dashed lines represent gene/mutation introduction.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>We thus established a new engineered autotrophic <italic>E. coli</italic> strain containing a set of three essential and sufficient mutations, and showed that the bypass-prevention knockouts introduced before the ALE are themselves not necessary for the phenotype. Due to the small required number of genetic modifications, this strain provides an opportunity to derive guidelines for future engineering efforts that use the rPP cycle. Having this goal in mind, we focused our attention on identifying the relevant phenotypes of each of these mutations and explaining their adaptive advantage. Because the mutations were essential for the autotrophic growth, we could not use autotrophic conditions to compare them to a strain with wild-type alleles. Therefore, we chose the most suitable combinations of strains and conditions that could isolate the effect of the pertinent mutation.</p>

<title>Modulation of a metabolic branch-point activity increased the concentration of rPP metabolites</title>
<p>Metabolic pathways that regenerate and synthesise more of their own metabolites are referred to as autocatalytic cycles. Within the autotrophic <italic>E. coli</italic> the rPP cycle is autocatalytic. Due to the inherent positive feedback mechanism, autocatalytic cycles tend to be unstable, and therefore the fluxes of entry and exit points (bifurcation/branch points) need to be balanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Barenholz et al. 2017</xref>). Such tuning is needed since any disruption of the balance between cycling and branching fluxes could result in the depletion, or alternatively toxic accumulation of intermediate metabolites, and cycle arrest.</p>
<p>We previously predicted that mutations in branch points will be needed to stabilise the steady state flux within the rPP cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Barenholz et al. 2017</xref>). In line with this prediction we find that the mutation in phosphoglucoisomerase (Pgi), a key branch point in the rPP cycle, follows this design principle. Pgi consumes fructose-6-phosphate (F6P), one of the cycle intermediates, converting it into glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), a precursor for cell membrane biosynthesis. Thus, Pgi regulates flux out of the autocatalytic cycle (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>In the different adaptive lab evolution experiments, we found three distinct mutations in the <italic>pgi</italic> gene. The first, H386Y, is a non-synonymous mutation occurring in one of the catalytic residues in the active site, and is part of the autotrophic enabling gene set. The second was a complete knockout, a 22KB chromosomal deletion, including also 16 other genes. The third was an early stop codon E72*. These observations led us to suspect the H386Y mutation in <italic>pgi</italic> decreases or even completely eliminates the activity of the enzyme.</p>
<p>We tested the kinetic rates of the isomerization of F6P to G6P of two purified Pgi enzymes, wild type Pgi and Pgi H386Y, using a spectroscopic coupled assay, where G6P was coupled to NADP<sup>+</sup> reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Widjaja et al. 1998</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>; see also methods). The measured k<sub>cat</sub> of the wild type Pgi was ≈130 [s<sup>-1</sup>] (±26) which is in line with previous computational predictions of a k<sub>cat</sub> of ≈200 [s<sup>-1</sup>](<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Davidi et al. 2016</xref>). The mutated Pgi showed weak activity with a k<sub>cat</sub> of ≈1.5 [s<sup>-1</sup>](±1). Therefore the <italic>pgi</italic> mutation is in line with the original expectation that branching point regulation is necessary, and the nature of the observed mutations in <italic>pgi</italic> supports the notion that their role is to reduce the efflux from the non-native autocatalytic cycle.</p>
<p>Pgi is part of glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, where significant flux is required in wild type <italic>E. coli</italic>. Accordingly, wild type Pgi catalyses a reaction that is causing a strong efflux of F6P from the cycle, diminishing the regeneration of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) which is usually not needed in the native metabolism but is essential for the rPP autocatalytic activity. In the mutated version of Pgi the efflux capacity is diminished, which can stabilise the cycle (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>Following the same logic, we can expect an increase in the F6P substrate metabolite pool due to reduced consumption by Pgi. Therefore, we measured intracellular sugar-phosphates in the <italic>pgi</italic> mutant strain and a strain with a wild-type <italic>pgi</italic> allele by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). For this comparison, we used the RuBisCO-dependent ancestor strain as the genetic background. We found that the ratio of F6P to G6P was about 3 times higher in the <italic>pgi</italic> mutant strain relative to the wild-type (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Furthermore, the <italic>pgi</italic> mutant had higher levels of metabolites within the rPP cycle (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>), confirming the stabilising function of the mutation.</p>
<p>These results lead us to conclude that the recurring mutations in the <italic>pgi</italic> gene are mediating the integration of the non-native carbon fixation genes into a stable autocatalytic cycle. This is achieved by reducing the ratio of the efflux from F6P to G6P relative to the flux in the cycle, thereby redirecting it towards the rPP cycle and the regeneration of RuBP.</p>

<title>Proteomic analysis reveals up-regulation of rPP cycle and formate-associated genes alongside down-regulation of catabolic genes</title>
<p>The other two mutations in the compact set - <italic>crp</italic> (H22N) and <italic>rpoB</italic> (A1245V), are global effectors in the cell. Crp is one of the most general transcription factors in the cell and has a role in many processes from metabolism to osmoregulation and biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Landis, Xu, and Johnson 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jackson, Simecka, and Romeo 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ammar, Wang, and Rao 2018</xref>). The position H22 in Crp is part of “activation region 2” of the protein, an interaction region with RNA polymerase (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8</xref>). This position was shown to have an effect on promoter specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Niu et al 1996</xref>) and was previously reported to have a role in the integration of the rPP cycle in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Herz et al. 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, mutations in <italic>rpoB,</italic> a subunit of RNA polymerase, have been shown to have a large effect on the cell transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Conrad et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Utrilla et al. 2016</xref>). The observed A1245V mutation in <italic>rpoB</italic> is situated within the core of RNA polymerase, proximal to its interaction with the DNA (figure S8). Furthermore, this genetic variation was previously documented in the adaptation of the <italic>E. coli</italic> B REL1206 strain to high temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Tenaillon et al. 2012</xref>) and is closely positioned to another previously reported <italic>rpoB</italic> mutation (K1242Q) that appeared in adaptation to loss of Pgi activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Charusanti et al. 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Depending on the transcribed gene target, the effect of the two mutations might be additive, antagonistic, or synergistic. Since each one of these mutations individually (in combination with the <italic>pgi</italic> mutation) is not sufficient to achieve autotrophic growth, it is reasonable to assume that only the target genes whose levels of expression change significantly in the double-mutant are the ones relevant for the autotrophic phenotype. Given the accumulated knowledge described above, these mutations are likely to have a broad effect on the cell. We chose to further elucidate their effect using a proteomics approach. As such, we conducted two experiments in an attempt to find changes in expression that are relevant for the adaptation to the new trophic mode. The first experiment compared the proteome of an evolved clone to its ancestor. The second experiment similarly compared an engineered BW25113 (BW) strain, containing the two regulatory mutations from the compact set (i.e., <italic>crp</italic> H22N and <italic>rpoB</italic> A1245V), to a wild type BW strain.</p>
<p>Since our aim was to observe only direct effects induced by the genetic changes, rather than by the environment, we measured the proteomes of the strains under identical conditions and dilution rates. Ideally, the comparison should be done in conditions that require autotrophic growth (since some effects might depend on the lack of an organic carbon source), however, all strains except the evolved clone cannot grow in such conditions. Therefore, we decided on growing the cells in the conditions present at the beginning of the lab evolution experiment, namely a xylose-limited chemostat. The dilution rate was set to ≈0.03 h<sup>-1</sup> leading to a doubling time of ≈24h (methods).</p>
<p>In order to identify the genes with a large and significant fold change (fold change &gt;4, p-value &lt;0.05) we generated a volcano plot for each such comparison (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>). We then proceeded by comparing the output of the first experiment (evolved divided by ancestor, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6A</xref>) to that of the double mutant divided by the base BW strain (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6B</xref>), since both mutations are essential for the phenotype and are known to affect expression. We focused on genes with common trends of expression level in both sets (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The proteomics analysis yielded few genes that had an upregulation of &gt;4-fold in both the evolved versus ancestor and the double mutant versus BW base strain experiments. Two of these up-regulated genes, <italic>fdoG</italic> and <italic>fdoH</italic>, are subunits of the native formate dehydrogenase O enzyme complex (FDH-O) and are therefore related to the energy module. These genes were upregulated in both the evolved strain and in the strain with the <italic>crp</italic> H22N and <italic>rpoB A1245V</italic> double mutation (≈5-fold increase in both cases). The FDH-O enzyme complex takes part in the respiratory chain formed by formate dehydrogenase and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) reductase. Here, the transfer of electrons from formate to DMSO (via a quinone electron carrier) is coupled to the generation of a proton-motive force across the cytoplasmic membrane for energy formation.</p>
<p>Another observed upregulated protein was ribose-phosphate-isomerase B (<italic>rpiB</italic>), which was up-regulated in the evolved strain (&gt;40-fold increase) and in the double mutant ≈5-fold increase (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). <italic>rpiB</italic> is an inducible isoenzyme of the constitutively expressed ribose-phosphate-isomerase A, a core enzyme in the rPP cycle. This might serve as evidence for a higher flux requirement through the pentose-phosphate-pathway, supported by expressing a second isoenzyme. Other explanations may include some form of regulation, perhaps allosteric, inhibiting RpiA activity, making the strain dependent on RpiB activity, or non-specific enzymatic activity of RpiB which is required by the cell. The fourth up-regulated gene - <italic>ftsI</italic>, a peptidoglycan DD-transpeptidase - does not have a clear explanation at this time.</p>
<p>At the other end of the expression spectrum, several pathways were down-regulated in both the evolved and in the BW double mutant strain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Down-regulation of the starvation response, metabolic and PTS component genes seems to be at the heart of the adaptation to autotrophic growth, with several operons experiencing &gt;4-fold decrease in expression. Most notably the <italic>gat</italic>, <italic>ara</italic> and <italic>man</italic> operons responsible for galactitol, arabinose and mannose degradation, respectively. Again, this is evident in both the evolved and the double mutant strains (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Other highly down-regulated metabolic pathways include amino acid biosynthesis, specifically valine and leucine, moreover we observed a down regulation in <italic>rspA &amp; rspB</italic>, which encode for starvation sensing proteins. We suggest these results mean that many pathways usually up-regulated in <italic>E. coli</italic> during starvation may be redundant or even counter-productive in an autotrophic context, and decreasing their expression could result in increased fitness.</p>
<p>We additionally tested whether separating between the two regulatory mutations (<italic>crp</italic> and <italic>rpoB</italic>) might provide a clearer picture, e.g. if different up- or down-regulated genes are targeted by only one of these mutations and not the other. Therefore, we used single-mutant BW strains and compared them to the same BW wild-type as before. Essentially, the results did not change our conclusions and although in most cases the effect of the two mutations was cumulative, we did find at least one case where they were antagonistic (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7</xref>). For example, <italic>fdoG</italic> and <italic>fdoH</italic> showed a ≈4-fold <italic>decrease</italic> compared to wild type when the <italic>crp</italic> mutation was introduced, but (as stated earlier) had a ≈5-fold abundance <italic>increase</italic> in the double mutant, suggesting an epistatic effect between the <italic>rpoB</italic> and <italic>crp</italic> mutations (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6B</xref> &amp; <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7B</xref>).

<title>Mutations in regulatory genes lead to increased availability of the carbon fixation cycle electron donor NADH</title>
<p>Along with the effect on expression, we suspected the two transcription-associated mutations (<italic>crp</italic> &amp; <italic>rpoB)</italic> to also have a metabolic and physiological effect. Since Crp and RpoB are both essential to the autotrophic phenotype and are known to indirectly interact in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Savery, Rhodius, and Busby 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Niu et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Frendorf et al. 2019</xref>), we address them as one unit. The proteomics analysis, where the strain with both mutations seem to have a mutual effect that is in some cases different than in the individual mutants, supported this decision. Mutations in <italic>crp</italic> and <italic>rpoB</italic> are known to affect growth at different conditions such as types of media or carbon sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Utrilla et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Conrad et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cheng et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Frendorf et al. 2019</xref>). Therefore we tested whether this was also the case for the conditions under which the cells evolved in the chemostat.</p>
<p>We performed a growth experiment of the double mutant (<italic>crp</italic> H22N, <italic>rpoB</italic> A1245V) expressing <italic>fdh</italic> in a minimal medium containing xylose and formate. Under such conditions, the strain harbouring both mutations and <italic>fdh</italic> exhibited &gt;25% increase in the final OD compared to the wild type expressing <italic>fdh</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>&amp;<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). At the same time they also showed a longer (&gt;10 hours) lag time.

<p>Since NADH is the electron donor for carbon fixation, and a product of formate consumption via Fdh, we used metabolomics to measure the ratio of NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> in these strains in similar conditions (methods). All of the measured ratios were normalised to the wild-type (with <italic>fdh</italic>) growing in the absence of formate. The addition of 30mM formate, which can serve as an electron donor via oxidation to CO<sub>2</sub> by Fdh, increased NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio by &gt;20-fold in the double mutant, significantly higher than the ≈10-fold increase in the wild-type strain (p-value &lt;0.05).

<p>NADH could affect growth in several ways, as discussed below.

We also note that as the proteomics results suggest - the mutations in global transcriptional machinery like Crp &amp; RpoB could have many other effects on the autotrophic phenotype <italic>(Haverkorn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">van Rijsewijk et al. 2011</xref>)</italic> which await future exploration.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we demonstrated how iterative evolution and engineering were able to narrow down the genomic mutations required for autotrophy in <italic>E. coli</italic> from tens of mutations to only three mutated genes. The three mutated genes - <italic>pgi</italic>, <italic>crp</italic> and <italic>rpoB</italic> - serve as a compact set, which when introduced into a wild-type background and supplemented with the carbon-fixing and energy modules, achieve an autotrophic phenotype. By metabolic, proteomic and physiological characterisation we were able to distil some of the effects of these mutations and understand their role in facilitating the autotrophic phenotype. We suggest that the three main effects achieved by the autotrophy-enabling mutations are: (i) integrating the non-native carbon fixation cycle by enhancing flux within the cycle over outgoing flux; (ii) facilitating the integration of the energy module via decoupling of formate harvesting into energy and redox, thereby increasing the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio, which could have both thermodynamic and kinetic benefits (iii) and freeing protein resources by decreasing unneeded expression.</p>
<p>The mutation in <italic>pgi</italic> affects the activity of its gene product phosphoglucoisomerase - a metabolic enzyme that catalyses a reaction that branches out of the non-native rPP cycle. The enzyme converts F6P (a cycle intermediate) to G6P (a precursor required for membrane biosynthesis). In a previous study, this mutation was found to be essential for the integration of the rPP autocatalytic cycle and was part of a minimal set for hemi-autotrophic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gleizer et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gassler et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Antonovsky et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Barenholz et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Flamholz et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Herz et al. 2017</xref>). As our results suggest, the mutated enzyme shows a significant reduction in activity, which decreases the efflux from the rPP cycle to biosynthesis. We hypothesised that its role is to generate a new, higher, steady-state concentration for the rPP cycle metabolites, thus stabilising the cycle. This was supported by our observation that introducing a pgi mutation into a metabolically rewired RuBiCO-dependent strain resulted in increased concentration of rPP cycle intermediates. This exemplifies the key role branch-points play in autocatalytic cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gleizer et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gassler et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Antonovsky et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Barenholz et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Flamholz et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Herz et al. 2017</xref>), making them a leading target for rational attempts to integrate non-native autocatalytic cycles into metabolism.</p>
<p>The remaining two mutations act as global regulators, which presents a challenge in distinguishing their specific adaptive impacts from their broader effects on cellular expression patterns. Using proteomic analyses, we have managed to identify certain genes that had a major change in expression when one of the regulating mutations was introduced, and when both were introduced together.</p>
<p>One main observation was the down-regulation of several metabolic pathways including catabolism of alternative carbon sources and amino acid biosynthesis. We suggest this is an adaptive role in improving cell resource allocation, and a means to modulate resource allocation, possibly freeing up proteome resources from alternative carbon metabolism proteins. This includes proteins such as PTS system components or ATP dependent transporters, that tend to incur high energetic costs.</p>
<p>Other reasons these catabolic and transport pathways may result in reduced fitness could include competition over metabolites with the rPP cycle, or by causing other metabolic blunders such as dead end products with potential toxicity effects under the new flux regime. Another observed effect the <italic>crp</italic> mutation shows is the up-regulation of <italic>rpiB</italic>, a typically unexpressed isoenzyme to one of the reactions in the rPP cycle. This expression increase could be beneficial or even essential in a scenario where <italic>rpiA</italic>, the main enzyme catalysing this reaction, cannot support the flux required by the rPP cycle, for example due to kinetic capacity limitations or allosteric inhibition. Further work is needed to investigate if up-regulation of <italic>rpiB</italic> is indeed essential for the autotrophic phenotype.</p>
<p>We also suggest these mutations play a role in improving the utilisation of formate, which is supported by the up-regulation of <italic>fdoG &amp; fdoH.</italic> We found that a strain introduced with both the <italic>crp</italic> and <italic>rpoB</italic> mutations demonstrated a pronounced up-regulation of over 4-fold and also a concrete fitness advantage in growth conditions which include formate. Metabolomics analysis showed this strain also has a significant increase in the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio. NADH is the essential cofactor for the electron transfer reaction of the non-native rPP cycle (catalysed by the D-glyceraldehyde-3P dehydrogenase GAPDH) and a product of the non-native formate-based energy module. The importance of this up-regulation is also supported by natural chemolithoautotrophic metabolism, which uses two distinct ways to harvest energy and reducing power from the electron-donor. For example, in the model chemolithoautotroph <italic>Cupriavidus necator</italic>, the oxidation of formate is catalysed by two distinct types of FDH: a soluble, NAD<sup>+</sup>-linked enzyme (S-FDH; EC 1.2.1.2) and a membrane-bound enzyme coupled directly to the respiratory chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Friedrich, Bowien, and Friedrich 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Oh and Bowien 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>We suspect utilising formate dehydrogenase O (FDH-O) in the periplasm is enabling the cell to also utilise formate directly on the membrane to create a proton motive force for energy production without the need to exhaust the intracellular NADH pool, thus allowing for its accumulation. Increased levels of NADH creates favourable thermodynamics for the rPP cycle flux and could also offer improved kinetics. This result is in line with previous models, predicting that high cofactor levels are required for a stable metabolic state of the rPP cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Janasch et al. 2019</xref>). We suggest this observation offers an avenue for future rational design attempts.</p>
<p>We continue by hypothesising that such regulatory mutations are to be expected in adaptive laboratory evolution experiments, especially during selection for a major shift (novelty) in the phenotype. A major shift will often necessitate a modulation of the activity of many cellular components. Lab evolution is limited by population size and number of generations, which means it can only explore a small part of the genotypic space. Therefore, sets of three or more mutations, where each mutation on its own does not confer an advantage, have a negligible probability to occur. On the other hand, a single mutation in a global regulator could concurrently perturb the activity of hundreds of components and might be the only viable solution to capture several required changes simultaneously.</p>
<p>Another reported observation is how metabolic rewiring can serve as a “metabolic scaffold” to direct lab evolution. Since scaffold mutations are put in place for the purposes of selection, they can be removed once the goal is achieved. A common limitation of lab evolution is its tendency to follow evolutionary trajectories which increase fitness by deactivating or losing the heterologously expressed genes, thereby arriving at “dead-end” local optimum. A “metabolic scaffold” as utilised here can block these dead-end trajectories by coupling a target activity (here RuBisCO carboxylation) to growth, thereby increasing the likelihood of trajectories that lead to the desired phenotype. Once the phenotype is achieved, removal of the metabolic scaffold should be possible since growth is by definition dependent on the non-native genes. Using metabolic growth-coupling as a temporary “metabolic scaffold” that can be removed, could serve as a promising strategy for achieving minimally perturbed genotypes in future metabolic engineering attempts.</p>
<p>The approach presented here, of harnessing iterative lab evolution to find a compact set of essential mutations, strikingly shows the extreme malleability of metabolism and evolution capacity to switch trophic modes in laboratory time-scales with very few mutations. It can also serve as a promising pipeline for other genetic engineering attempts. Having a compact and well-defined genotype in a model organism allowed us to reveal metabolic adaptation steps needed for autotrophic growth, and could be used for future exploration of the design principles of the rPP cycle operation and its components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aigner et al. 2017</xref>). The harnessing and rationalisation of the lab evolution process and metabolic adaptation steps elucidated here could facilitate the introduction of the rPP cycle and other carbon fixation cycles into other organisms of interest. Next steps could include integrating metabolic bio-production modules and alternative energy sources. Now that synthetic autotrophy in <italic>E. coli</italic> can be achieved with only a few defined steps, it expands the playground for more labs to join the quest for sustainable bio-production from CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<title>Strains</title>
<p>We generated an engineered ancestor strain for chemostat evolution based on the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BW25113 strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Grenier et al. 2014</xref>). We used P1 transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Thomason, Costantino, and Court 2007</xref>) to transfer knockout alleles from the KEIO strain collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Thomason, Costantino, and Court 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Baba et al. 2006</xref>) to our engineered strain, and to knock out the genes phosphofructokinase (<italic>pfkA</italic> and <italic>pfkB</italic>), and 6-phosphate-1-dehydrogenase (<italic>zwf</italic>). Following the transduction of each knockout allele the KmR selection marker was removed by using the FLP recombinase encoded by the pCP20 temperature-sensitive plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cherepanov and Wackernagel 1995</xref>). Loss of the selection marker and the temperature sensitive plasmid were validated by replica-plating the screened colonies and PCR analysis of the relevant loci. The cells were then transformed with the pCBB plasmid(13) (accession number KX077536) and a pFDH plasmid with a constitutive promoter controlling the expression of the fdh gene that resulted from Gleizer et al. 2019(12). The transfer of mutations from evolved clones for the generation of ancestor 2.0, and other mutated strains was also accomplished by P1 transduction as reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Herz et al. 2017</xref>. P1 lysate was prepared from Keio collection strains that had a Kanamycin (Km) resistance marker located near the desired allele (as specified in Supplementary Data S1). The strains carrying the desired mutated allele were transduced with P1 phages containing the resistance marker and then plated on Km plates. Donor strains were selected based on the presence of the desired mutated allele and the Km resistance marker in their colonies. A P1 lysate from each donor strain was used to transfer the desired mutations to a recipient strain. Because the transferred DNA fragment to the recipient was relatively large (approximately 100 kb), including the selection marker, it often carried adjacent genes. Genotyping was performed using Sanger sequencing. For further genomic modification, pCP20, a temperature-sensitive plasmid encoding the FLP recombinase from the Clone and Strain Repository unit at WIS, was used following standard procedures. This allowed for the removal of Km resistance markers, enabling iterative rounds of genome editing.</p>

<title>Plasmids</title>
<p>To create the pFDH plasmid, an <italic>E. coli</italic> codon optimised DNA sequence of formate dehydrogenase from the methytholotrophic bacterium <italic>Pseudomonas sp. 101</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Popov and Lamzin 1994</xref>) was cloned with an N-terminal His-tag into a pZ plasmid (Expressys, Germany) under a constitutive promoter and with a strong ribosome binding site (rbs B of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Zelcbuch et al. 2013</xref>)). The plasmid has a pMB1 origin of replication and therefore is present in high copy number. We replaced the KmR selection marker on the plasmid with a StrepR marker. An 8 bp deletion appeared in the promoter region of the first evolved clone. This plasmid was isolated and was the plasmid used for all consequential evolution experiments and autotrophic strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gleizer et al. 2019</xref>). Details regarding the pCBB plasmid are reported in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Antonovsky et al. 2016</xref>).</p>

<title>Growth tests</title>
<p>The growth test experiments were conducted in 96 well-plates. The final volume of each well was 200 µL (50 µL of mineral oil and 150 µL culture). The media consisted of M9 media supplemented with varying concentrations of the relevant carbon source, and trace elements (without addition of vitamin B1). Bacterial cells were seeded from a culture tube. Growth temperature was set to 37°C, and either aerated with ambient air or air with elevated CO2 (10%) either with ambient or reduced oxygen (5%). OD600 measurements were taken every 10-30 minutes using a Tecan Spark plate reader.</p>

<title>Chemostat evolution experiments</title>
<p>The evolutionary experiment was conducted in a Bioflo 110 chemostat (New Brunswick Scientific, USA) at a working volume of 0.7L and a dilution rate of 0.02h-1 (equivalent to a doubling time of ≈33 hours) at 37°C. The chemostat was fed with media containing 4 g/L sodium formate and 0.5 g/L D-xylose as sole carbon sources. This amount of xylose in the feed makes xylose the limiting nutrient for cell growth in the chemostat. Gradually the concentration of xylose in the feed was reduced until a phenotype was observed. Chloramphenicol (30 mg/L) and streptomycin (100 mg/L) were added to the feed media. Aeration of the chemostat was done through a DASGIP MX4/4 stand-alone gas-mixing module (Eppendorf, Germany) with a composition of 10% CO2 and 5% oxygen and 85% air at a flow rate of 40 sL/hr. To monitor the chemostat, a weekly sampling protocol was performed. Samples were taken for media analysis and phenotyping (inoculation of the bacteria on minimal media containing formate and lacking D-xylose). The optical density of each extracted sample was measured using a spectrophotometer (Ultrospec 10 Cell density meter, Amersham Biosciences) and a standard 10 mm polystyrene cuvette (Sarstedt, Germany).</p>

<title><sup>13</sup>C Isotopic labelling experiment</title>
<p>A culture of cells that were growing on naturally labelled sodium formate in an elevated CO2 (10%, naturally labelled) incubator (New Brunswick S41i CO2 incubator shaker, Eppendorf, Germany) were diluted 10-fold into fresh M9 media with 30 mM <sup>13</sup>C-formate sodium salt (Sigma Aldrich) to a total volume of 10 ml of culture. In the “open” labelling setup, growth was carried out in 125 ml glass shake flasks (n=3), which allow free exchange of gases between the headspace of the growth vessel and the gas mixture of the incubator. The flasks were placed inside an elevated CO2 (10%) shaker-incubator (New Brunswick) with 37°C. After ≈4 doublings, the cells were harvested for subsequent analysis of protein bound amino acids and intracellular metabolites. In the “closed” labelling setup, growth was carried out in 250 mL glass shake flasks with a transparent extension which allows measurement of the optical density of the culture without opening it. After ≈3 doublings, the cells were diluted 8-fold into flasks covered with air-tight rubber septa (SubaSeal, Sigma Aldrich). Then, the headspace of the flask was flushed with a gas mixture containing 10% <sup>13</sup>CO2 (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, USA) + 90% air or 10% <sup>12</sup>CO2 + 90% air generated by a DASGIP MX4/4 stand-alone gas-mixing module (Eppendorf, Germany). The flasks were placed in a 37°C shaker incubator. After ≈4 doublings, the cells were harvested for subsequent analysis of protein bound amino acids. Glass flasks used in the labelling experiments were pretreated by heating in a 460°C furnace for 5 hours to evaporate any excess carbon sources that could remain in the vessels from previous utilizations. Each labelling experiment was conducted in triplicates (n=3), with <sup>12</sup>CO2 the triplicates were pooled and measured as three technical replicates. The predicted range of labelling under <sup>13</sup>CO2 was calculated using the following equation: <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> = 1 − 0.5<sup><italic>n</italic></sup>, where f is the <sup>13</sup>C fraction and n is the number of doublings, as the remaining unlabelled biomass is decreased 2-fold at each doubling. The <sup>13</sup>C fraction was calculated for 3 and 5 doubling to create the predicted range.</p>

<title>Sample preparation for liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and mass analysis of biomass components</title>
<p>After harvesting the biomass culture samples were prepared and analyzed as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Antonovsky et al. 2016</xref>). Briefly, for protein bound amino acids ≈3 mL of culture at OD600 turbidity of ≈0.1-0.15 were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 minutes at 8,000 g. The pellet was suspended in 1 mL of 6N HCl and incubated for 16 hours at 110°C. The acid was subsequently evaporated with a nitrogen stream, resulting in a dry hydrolysate. Dry hydrolysates were resuspended in 0.6 mL of miliQ water, centrifuged for 5 minutes at 14,000 g and the supernatant was used for injection into the LCMS. Hydrolyzed amino acids were separated using ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC, Acquity - Waters, USA) on a C-8 column (Zorbax Eclipse XBD - Agilent, USA) at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min and eluted off the column using a hydrophobicity gradient. Buffers used were: A) H2O + 0.1% formic acid and B) acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid with the following gradient: 100% of A (0-3 min), 100% A to 100% B (3-9 min), 100% B (9-13 min), 100% B to 100% A (13-14 min), 100% A (14-20 min). The UPLC was coupled online to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (TQS - Waters, USA). Data was acquired using MassLynx v4.1 (Waters, USA). We selected amino acids which have peaks at distinct retention time and m/z values for all isotopologues and also showed correct <sup>13</sup>C labeling fractions in control samples that contained protein hydrolyzates of WT cells grown with known ratios of <sup>13</sup>C6-glucose to <sup>12</sup>C-glucose.</p>
<p>The <sup>13</sup>C fraction of each metabolite was determined as the weighted average of the fractions of all the isotopologues of the metabolite, as depicted in the equation below:

<title>Cultivation Conditions for Metabolome Sampling</title>
<p>For the G6P and F6P, P5P, and S7P measurements: Single colonies were transferred into liquid 3 mL M9 media containing 0.2 g/L xylose, 2g/L formate, Chloramphenicol (30 mg/L) and streptomycin (100 mg/L) from fresh plates with the same medium. The M9 pre-cultures were adjusted to a starting OD600 of 0.05 into 10mL culture in 250 mL glass shake flasks. The flasks were placed inside an elevated CO2 (10%) shaker-incubator (New Brunswick S41i CO2 incubator shaker, Eppendorf, Germany) at 37°C. NADH/NADH+ measurements: Single colonies were transferred into 10 mL M9* xylose streptomycin from fresh M9* xylose streptomycin plates, and cultivated for 24h while shaking at 37°C. M9 pre-cultures were adjusted to a starting OD600 of 0.1 into 12-well plates, with 2 mL of medium in each well. Strains were cultivated in triplicates with or without formate (30 mM), added at the beginning of the culture. Optical density at 600nm was monitored every 10 min using a plate reader (Tecan, Spark).

<title>Metabolomics Measurements</title>
<p>Cultivations were performed as described above. Culture aliquots were vacuum-filtered on a 0.45 μm pore size filter (HVLP02500, Merck Millipore). Filters were immediately transferred into a 40:40:20 (v-%) acetonitrile/methanol/water extraction solution at −20°C. Filters were incubated in the extraction solution for at least 30 minutes. Subsequently, metabolite extracts were centrifuged for 15 minutes at 13,000 rpm at −9°C and the supernatant was stored at −80°C until analysis. For measurements of NADH, NAD, sedoheptulose-7P and the pool of pentose phosphates, extracts were mixed with a <sup>13</sup>C-labelled internal standard in a 1:1 ratio. LC-MS/MS analysis was performed with an Agilent 6495 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Donati et al. 2021</xref>). An Agilent 1290 Infinity II UHPLC system (Agilent Technologies) was used for liquid chromatography. Temperature of the column oven was 30°C, and the injection volume was 3 μL. LC solvents in channel A were either water with 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid (v/v) (for acidic conditions, NADH/NAD), or water with 10 mM ammonium carbonate and 0.2% ammonium hydroxide (for basic conditions, sedoheptulose-7P and pool of pentoses). LC solvents in channel B were either acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid (v/v) (for acidic conditions) or acetonitrile without additive (for basic conditions). LC columns were an Acquity BEH Amide (30 x 2.1 mm, 1.7 μm) for acidic conditions, and an iHILIC-Fusion(P) (50 x 2.1 mm, 5 μm) for basic conditions. The gradient for basic and acidic conditions was: 0 min 90% B; 1.3 min 40 % B; 1.5 min 40 % B; 1.7 min 90 % B; 2 min 90 % B. The ratio of <sup>12</sup>C and <sup>13</sup>C peak heights was used to quantify metabolites. <sup>12</sup>C/<sup>13</sup>C ratios were normalized to OD at the time point of sampling. For the measurements of intracellular glucose-6-P and fructose-6-P, metabolic extracts were 10x concentrated using a vacuum evaporation (Eppendorf Concentrator plus) and resuspended in 40:40:20 (v-%) acetonitrile/methanol/water extraction solution. Temperature of the column oven was 30°C, and the injection volume was 5 μL. LC solvent in channel A was water with 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid (v/v), and in channel B was acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid (v/v). The LC column was a Shodex HILICpak VG-50 2D (2.0 x 150 mm). The gradient was: 0 min 90% B; 58 min 70 % B; 3 min 90 % B. The <sup>12</sup>C peak heights were used to quantify metabolites.

<p>This is an <bold>important</bold> follow-up study to a previous paper in which the authors reconstituted CO2 metabolism (autotrophy) in Escherichia coli. Here, the authors define a set of just three mutations that promote autotrophy, highlighting the malleability of E. coli metabolism. The authors make a <bold>convincing</bold> case that mutations in pgi are loss-of-function mutations that prevent metabolic efflux from the reductive pentose phosphate autocatalytic cycle, and their data suggest possible roles of mutations in two other genes - crp and rpoB. This research will be particularly interesting to synthetic biologists, systems biologists, and metabolic engineers aiming to develop synthetic autotrophic microorganisms.</p>

<p>The authors previously showed that expressing formate dehydrogenase, rubisco, carbonic anhydrase, and phosphoribulokinase in Escherichia coli, followed by experimental evolution, led to the generation of strains that can metabolise CO2. Using two rounds of experimental evolution, the authors identify mutations in three genes - pgi, rpoB, and crp - that allow cells to metabolise CO2 in their engineered strain background. The authors make a strong case that mutations in pgi are loss-of-function mutations that prevent metabolic efflux from the reductive pentose phosphate autocatalytic cycle. The authors also use proteomic analysis to probe the role of the mutations in crp and rpoB. While they do not reach strong conclusions about how these mutations promote autotrophic growth, they provide some clues, leading to valuable speculation.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>The authors have thoroughly addressed the reviewers' comments. The major addition to the paper is the proteomic analysis of single and double mutants of crp and rpoB. These new data provide clues as to the role of the crp and rpoB mutations in promoting autotrophic growth, which the authors discuss. The authors acknowledge that it will require additional experiments to determine whether the speculated mechanisms are correct. Nonetheless, the new data provide valuable new insight into the role of the crp and rpoB mutations. The authors have also expanded their description of the crp and rpoB mutations, making it clearer that the effects of these mutations are likely to be distinct, albeit with potential for overlap in function.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Author response:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p>
<p>The main objective of this study is to achieve the development of a synthetic autotroph using adaptive laboratory evolution. To accomplish this, the authors conducted chemostat cultivation of engineered E. coli strains under xylose-limiting conditions and identified autotrophic growth and the causative mutations. Additionally, the mutational mechanisms underlying these causative mutations were also explored with drill down assays. Overall, the authors demonstrated that only a small number of genetic changes were sufficient (i.e., 3) to construct an autotrophic E. coli when additional heterologous genes were added. While natural autotrophic microorganisms typically exhibit low genetic tractability, numerous studies have focused on constructing synthetic autotrophs using platform microorganisms such as E. coli. Consequently, this research will be of interest to synthetic biologists and systems biologists working on the development of synthetic autotrophic microorganisms. The conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported by appropriate experimental methods and logical reasoning. However, further experimental validation of the mutational mechanisms involving rpoB and crp would enhance readers' understanding and provide clearer insights, despite acknowledgement that these genes impact a broad set of additional genes. Additionally, a similar study, 10.1371/journal.pgen.1001186, where pgi was deleted from the E. coli genome and evolved to reveal an rpoB mutation is relevant to this work and should be placed in the context of the presented findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this study out. It is very interesting that a mutation in a similar region in RpoB was observed in a related context of Pgi loss of activity. We have added a reference to this study in our text (Page 11, line 21).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>he authors addressed rpoB and crp as one unit and performed validation. They cultivated the mutant strain and wild type in a minimal xylose medium with or without formate, comparing their growth and NADH levels. The authors argued that the increased NADH level in the mutant strain might facilitate autotrophic growth. Although these phenotypes appear to be closely related, their relationship cannot be definitively concluded based on the findings presented in this paper alone. Therefore, one recommendation is to explore investigating transcriptomic changes induced by the rpoB and crp mutations. Otherwise, conducting experimental verification to determine whether the NADH level directly causes autotrophic growth would provide further support for the authors' claim.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the valuable comment and agree that the work was lacking such an analysis. Due to various reasons we have opted to use a proteomic approach which we feel fulfills the same purpose as the transcriptomics suggestion. We found interesting evidence in up-regulation of the fdoGH operon (comprising the native formate dehydrogenase O enzyme complex) which could indicate why there is an increase in NADH/NAD+ levels. We also hypothesize that this upregulation might be important more generally by drawing comparisons to natural chemo-autotrophs.</p>
<p>Further experimental work (which we were not able to include in the current study) could help validate this link by deleting fdoGH and observing a loss of phenotype and, on the flip side, directly overexpressing the fdoGH operon and observing an increase in the NADH/NAD+ ratio.
Indeed, if this overexpression were to prove sufficient for achieving an autotrophic phenotype without the mutations in the global transcription regulators, it would be a much more transparent design.</p>
<p>We have added a section titled &quot;Proteomic analysis reveals up-regulation of rPP cycle and formate-associated genes alongside down-regulation of catabolic genes&quot; to the Results based on this analysis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>It would be beneficial to provide a more detailed explanation of the genetic background before the evolution stage, specifically regarding the ∆pfk and ∆zwf mutations. Furthermore, it is suggested to include a figure that provides a comprehensive depiction of the reductive pentose phosphate pathway and the bypass pathway. These will help readers grasp the concept of the &quot;metabolic scaffold&quot; as proposed by the authors.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that this could be helpful and we added a reference to the original paper Gleizer et al. 2019 that reported this design and also includes the relevant figure. We feel that the figure should not be added to the current manuscript as we continue to show that this design is not relevant in the context of the three reported mutations and such a figure could distract the attention of the reader from the main takeaways of the current study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Despite the essentiality of the rpoB mutation (A1245V) to the autotrophic phenotype in the final strain, the inclusion of this mutation in step C1 does not appear to be justified. According to line 37 on page 3, the authors chose to retain the unintended mutation in rpoB based on its essentiality to the phenotype observed in other evolved strains. However, it should be noted that the mutations found in the evolved strain I, II, and III (P552T or D866E) were entirely different from the unintended mutation (A1245V) during genetic engineering. This aspect should be revised to avoid confusion among readers.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this issue out, we added a clarification in the text (page 4 line 7) to avoid such confusion. We believe this point is much clearer now.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The rpoB mutation which was shown to be essential in the study is indeed known to be common in ALE experiments in E. coli. Thus, I searched the different rpoB mutations in ALEdb in E. coli and I was able to find a similar mutation in a study where pgi was knocked out and then evolved. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1001186">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1001186</ext-link> This study seems very relevant given that pgi was a key mutation in the compact set of this work and the section &quot;Modulation of a metabolic branch-point activity increased the concentration of rPP metabolites&quot; informs that loss of function mutations in pgi were also found. The findings of this study should thus be put in the context of the previous related ALE study. I would recommend a similar analysis of crp mutations from studies in ALEdb to see if there are similar mutations in this gene as well or if this a unique mutation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this publication to our attention. We have addressed this observation in the main text (page 11 , line 21). We agree that it could have some connection to the pgi mutation yet we would not want to overspeculate about this role, as we also found the exact same mutation (A1245V) as an adaptation to higher temperature in another E. coli study (Tenaillon et al. 2012). We would like to bring forward the fact that the two reported rpoB mutations are always accompanied by another mutation with pleiotropic effects, either in the transcription factor Crp or in another RNA polymerase subunit (e.g RpoC). As such many epistatic effects could occur, one of which we also report here in page 13, line 18. In conclusion, although there could be a connection between the rpoB and pgi mutations, it could be a mere coincidence and the two mutations could exhibit two distinct roles in two distinct phenotypes.</p>
<p>We also would like to thank the reviewer for suggesting a similar analysis for crp and found another mutation at a nearby residue with strong adaptive effects and mentioned it in our main text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Can the typical number of mutations found in a given ALE experiment be directly compared to those found in this study? It seems like a retrospective analysis of other ALE studies to show how many mutations typically occur in an ALE study and sets which were found to be causal to reproduce the phenotype of interest (through similar reverse engineering in the starting strain) should be presented. Again, the authors cite ALEdb which should provide direct numbers of mutations found in similar ALE studies with E. coli and one could then examine them to find sets of clearly causal mutations which recreate phenotypes of interest. Such an analysis would go a long way in supporting the main finding of &quot;small number&quot; of mutations.</p>
<p>Discussion, page 12, line 42. &quot;This could serve as a promising strategy for achieving minimally perturbed genotypes in future metabolic engineering attempts&quot;. There is an entire body of work around growth-coupled production which can be predicted and evolved with a genome-scale metabolic model and ALE. Thus, if this statement is going to be made, relevant studies should be cited and placed in context.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer raises an important point which could indeed yield an interesting perspective. However, it would be difficult to perform this comparison in practice since many of the studies published on ALEdb have not isolated essential mutations from other mutation incidents nor have they determined the role of each mutation in the reported phenotypes. For example, many ALE trajectories include a hypermutator that greatly increases the number of irrelevant mutations and it is nearly impossible to sieve through them to find an essential set.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is hard to compare the “level of difficulty” of achieving one phenotype over another and therefore feel that even though such an analysis would be insightful, it requires an amount of work which is outside the scope of this study.</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to highlight our approach of using the iterative approach, isolating the relevant consensus mutations and repeating this process until no evolution process is required, we are not aware of prior studies that used this approach.</p>
<p>We now clarified what we mean by &quot;promising strategy&quot; in the discussion in order to avoid any false claims about novelty (page 16 line 32): &quot;Using metabolic growth-coupling as a temporary 'metabolic scaffold' that can be removed, could serve as a promising strategy for achieving minimally perturbed genotypes in future metabolic engineering attempts.&quot;</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p>
<p>Synthetic autotrophy of biotechnologically relevant microorganisms offers exciting chances for CO2 neutral or even CO2 negative production of goods. The authors' lab has recently published an engineered and evolved Escherichia coli strain that can grow on CO2 as its only carbon source. Lab evolution was necessary to achieve growth. Evolved strains displayed tens of mutations, of which likely not all are necessary for the desired phenotype.</p>
<p>In the present paper the authors identify the mutations that are necessary and sufficient to enable autotrophic growth of engineered E. coli. Three mutations were identified, and their phenotypic role in enhancing growth via the introduced Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle were characterized. It was demonstrated that these mutations allow autotrophic growth of E. coli with the introduced CBB cycle without any further metabolic intervention. Autotrophic growth is demonstrated by 13C labelling with 13C CO2, measured in proteinogenic amino acids. In Figures 2B and S1, the labeling data are shown, with an interval of the &quot;predicted range under 13CO2&quot;.</p>
<p>Here, the authors should describe how this interval was derived.</p>
<p>The methodology is clearly described and appropriate.</p>
<p>The present results will allow other labs to engineer E. coli and other microorganisms further to assimilate CO2 efficiently into biomass and metabolic products. The importance is evident in the opportunity to employ such strain in CO2 based biotech processes for the production of food and feed protein or chemicals, to reduce atmospheric CO2 levels and the consumption of fossil resources.</p>
<p>Please describe in the methodology how the interval of the predicted range of 13C labeling was derived for Figures 2B and S1. Was it calculated by the dilution factor during 4 generations, or did you predict the label incorporation individually with a metabolic model?</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their comments, and for pointing out the need to clarify how we derived the predicted range of 13C labeling. We edited the text accordingly, and added the relevant calculation to the methods section (under the “13C Isotopic labeling experiment”). We would like to also thank the reviewer for the required text improvements, which were implemented.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p>
<p>The authors previously showed that expressing formate dehydrogenase, rubisco, carbonic anhydrase, and phosphoribulokinase in Escherichia coli, followed by experimental evolution, led to the generation of strains that can metabolise CO2. Using two rounds of experimental evolution, the authors identify mutations in three genes - pgi, rpoB, and crp - that allow cells to metabolise CO2 in their engineered strain background. The authors make a strong case that mutations in pgi are loss-of-function mutations that prevent metabolic efflux from the reductive pentose phosphate autocatalytic cycle. The authors also argue that mutations in crp and rpoB lead to an increase in the NADH/NAD+ ratio, which would increase the concentration of the electron donor for carbon fixation. While this may explain the role of the crp and rpoB mutations, there is good reason to think that the two mutations have independent effects, and that the change in NADH/NAD+ ratio may not be the major reason for their importance in the CO2-metabolising strain.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for their comments and constructive feedback.</p>
<p>We agree that there is probably a broader effect caused by the rpoB and crp mutations, besides the change in the NADH/NAD+ ratio. Hence, we performed a proteomics analysis, comparing the rpoB and crp mutations on a WT background to an autotrophic E.coli, searching for a mutual change in both strains compared to their &quot;ancestors&quot;. We found up-regulation of rPP cycle and formate-associated genes, and a down-regulation of catabolic genes. We added a section dedicated to this matter under the title &quot;Proteomic analysis reveals up-regulation of rPP cycle and formate-associated genes alongside down-regulation of catabolic genes&quot;.</p>

<p>1. Deleting pgi rather than using a point mutation would allow the authors to more rigorously test whether loss-off-function mutants are being selected for in their experimental evolution pipeline. The same argument applies to crp.</p>
<p>We appreciate this recommendation and indeed tried to delete pgi, but the genetic manipulation caused a knockout of other genes along with pgi (pepE, rluF, yjbD, lysC) so in the time available to us we cannot confidently determine whether the deletion alone is sufficient and can replace the mutation.</p>
<p>Regarding crp, we do not think there is a reason to believe the mutation is a loss-of-function. In any case, the proteomics-based characterization of the crp mutation is now included in the SI.</p>

<p>1. Page 10, lines 10-11, the authors state &quot;Since Crp and RpoB are known to physically interact in the cell (26-28), we address them as one unit, as it is hard to decouple the effect of one from the other&quot;. CRP and RpoB are connected, but the authors' description of them is misleading. CRP activates transcription by interacting with RNA polymerase holoenzyme, of which the Beta subunit (encoded by rpoB) is a part. The specific interaction of CRP is with a different RNA polymerase subunit. The functions of CRP and RpoB, while both related to transcription, are otherwise very different. The mutations in crp and rpoB are unlikely to be directly functionally connected. Hence, they should be considered separately.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, the fact that the proteins are interacting in the cell does not necessarily mean that the mutations are functionally connected. We therefore added as further justification in the new section:</p>
<p>&quot;As far as we know, the mutations in the Crp and RpoB genes affect the binding of the RNA polymerase complex to DNA and/or its transcription rates. Depending on the transcribed gene target, the effect of the two mutations might be additive, antagonistic, or synergistic. Since each one of these mutations individually (in combination with the pgi mutation) is not sufficient to achieve autotrophic growth, it is reasonable to assume that only the target genes whose levels of expression change significantly in the double-mutant are the ones relevant for the autotrophic phenotype”.</p>
<p>In our proteomics analysis we considered each mutation separately. We found that in some cases the two mutations together have an additive effect, but in other cases we found that the two mutations together affect differently on the proteome, compared to the effect of each mutation alone. Since both mutations are essential to the phenotype, we decided to go with the approach of addressing the two mutations as one unit for the physiological and metabolic experiments.</p>

<p>1. A Beta-galactosidase assay would provide a very simple test of CRP H22N activity. There are also simple in vivo and in vitro assays for transcription activation (two different modes of activation) and DNA-binding. H22 is not near the DNA-binding domain, but may impact overall protein structure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The mutation is located in “Activating Region 2”, interacting with RNA polymerase. We tried an in-vivo assay to determine the CRP H22N activity and got inconclusive results, we believe the proteomics analysis serves as a good method for understanding the global effect of the mutation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. There are many high-resolution structures of both CRP and RpoB (in the context of RNA polymerase). The authors should compare the position of the sites of mutation of these proteins to known functional regions, assuming H22N is not a loss-of-function mutation in crp.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We added a supplementary figure regarding the structural location of the two mutations, where it is demonstrated that crp H22N is located in a region interacting with the RNA polymerase and rpoB A1245V is located in proximity to regions interacting with the DNA.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. RNA-seq would provide a simple assay for the effects of the crp and rpoB mutations. While the precise effect of the rpoB mutation on RNA polymerase function may be hard to discern, the overall impact on gene expression would likely be informative.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed we agree that an omics approach to infer the global effect of these mutations is beneficial, we opted to use a proteomics approach and think it serves the purpose of clarifying the final, down-stream, effect on the cell.</p>

<p>1. Page 2, lines 40-45, the authors should more clearly explain that the deletion of pfkA, pfkB and zwf was part of the experimental evolution strategy in their earlier work (Gleizer et al., 2019), and not a new strategy in the current study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank you for pointing this out, and edited the text accordingly.</p>

<p>1. Page 3, line 27. Why did the authors compare the newly acquired mutants to only two mutants from the earlier work, not all 6?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The 6 clones that were isolated in Gleizer et al., had 2 distinct mutation profiles. During the isolation process the lineage split into two groups. Three out of the 6 clones (clones 1,2,6) came from the same ancestor, and the other three (clones 3,4,5) came from another ancestor. Hence, these two groups shared almost all of their mutations (see Venn diagram). We decided to use for our comparison the representative with the highest number of mutations from each group (clones 5 and 6).</p>
