<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Neurostimulation of the hippocampal formation has shown promising results for modulating memory but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In particular, the effects on hippocampal theta-nested gamma oscillations and theta phase reset, which are both crucial for memory processes, are unknown. Moreover, these effects cannot be investigated using current computational models, which consider theta oscillations with a fixed amplitude and phase velocity. Here, we developed a novel computational model that includes the medial septum, represented as a set of abstract Kuramoto oscillators producing a dynamical theta rhythm with phase reset, and the hippocampal formation, composed of biophysically-realistic neurons and able to generate theta-nested gamma oscillations under theta drive. We showed that, for theta inputs just below the threshold to induce self-sustained theta-nested gamma oscillations, a single stimulation pulse could switch the network behavior from non-oscillatory to a state producing sustained oscillations. Next, we demonstrated that, for a weaker theta input, pulse train stimulation at the theta frequency could transiently restore seemingly physiological oscillations. Importantly, the presence of phase reset influenced whether these two effects depended on the phase at which stimulation onset was delivered, which has practical implications for designing neurostimulation protocols that are triggered by the phase of ongoing theta oscillations. This novel model opens new avenues for studying the effects of neurostimulation on the hippocampal formation. Furthermore, our hybrid approach that combines different levels of abstraction could be extended in future work to other neural circuits that produce dynamical brain rhythms.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neurostimulation methods have emerged as promising therapeutic modalities to restore neurological functions in a broad range of motor and cognitive disorders (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Gupta et al., 2023</xref></italic></bold>). In the context of learning and memory, deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the entorhinal area or hippocampus has been shown to either enhance (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Suthana et al., 2012</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic>Suthana and Fried</italic></bold>, <bold><italic>2014</italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Titiz et al., 2017</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Jun et al., 2019</xref></italic></bold>) or disrupt (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Jacobs et al., 2016</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Goyal et al., 2018</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Lozano et al., 2016</xref></italic></bold>) memory encoding. These conflicting results may originate from differences in experimental protocols and from a poor understanding of their biophysical underpinnings. Among such mechanisms, the involvement of hippocampal theta oscillations (4-12 Hz) and their interactions with higher-frequency gamma oscillations (30-120 Hz) in memory-related processes has been reported in multiple studies (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Lisman et al., 2005</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">de Almeida et al., 2007</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Lega et al., 2012</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Lin et al., 2017</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Malkov et al., 2022</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abbaspoor et al., 2023</xref></italic></bold>). Moreover, the modulation of gamma oscillations by the phase of theta oscillations in hippocampal circuits, a phenomenon termed theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), correlates with the efficacy of memory encoding and retrieval (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Jensen and Colgin, 2007</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Tort et al., 2009</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Canolty and Knight, 2010</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Axmacher et al., 2010</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Fell and Axmacher, 2011</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Lisman and Jensen, 2013</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Lega et al., 2016</xref></italic></bold>). Experimental and computational work on the coupling between oscillatory rhythms has indicated that it originates from different neural architectures and correlates with a range of behavioral and cognitive functions, enabling the long-range synchronization of cortical areas and facilitating multi-item encoding in the context of memory (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Hyafil et al., 2015</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>Neurostimulation protocols that affect these rhythms, such as theta burst stimulation (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Titiz et al., 2017</xref></italic></bold>), have also been shown to optimally induce long-term potentiation (LTP) (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Larson and Munkácsy, 2015</xref></italic></bold>). Another potential mechanism underlying the effect of hippocampal neurostimulation might be the reset of the phase of theta oscillations in response to exogenous inputs, such as a novel sensory input or a pulse of electrical stimulation applied to the fornix or perforant path (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Buño et al., 1978</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Williams and Givens, 2003</xref></italic></bold>). Theta phase reset is known to facilitate LTP (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">McCartney et al., 2004</xref></italic></bold>) and naturally occurs during both encoding and retrieval of associative memories (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Kota et al., 2020</xref></italic></bold>). In this context, the design of a computational model that replicates memoryrelated theta-gamma oscillations and theta phase reset is of uttermost importance to investigate the effects of electrical stimulation on the hippocampal formation and possibly optimize neurostimulation protocols for memory improvement.</p>
<p>Models of memory-related theta-gamma oscillations in the hippocampal formation have been developed across different resolution levels, ranging from abstract mean-field approaches (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Traub et al., 1997</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Onslow et al., 2014</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Segneri et al., 2020</xref></italic></bold>) to biophysically-realistic conductance-based models (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Lundqvist et al., 2006</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Herman et al., 2013</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Aussel et al., 2018</xref></italic></bold>). Neural masses, which represent the mean activity of a neuronal population, can generate gamma oscillations through reciprocal interactions between an excitatory and inhibitory population (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Traub et al., 1997</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Onslow et al., 2014</xref></italic></bold>), or even using a self-projecting inhibitory population (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Segneri et al., 2020</xref></italic></bold>). Under excitatory oscillatory input at theta frequencies, these models are capable of generating theta-nested gamma oscillations. Similarly, these oscillations can be observed in more complex models of the hippocampal formation composed of single-compartment excitatory and inhibitory neurons connected through conductance-based synapses following the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952</xref></italic></bold>), and driven by a fixed oscillatory theta input (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Aussel et al., 2018</xref></italic></bold>). Theta-nested gamma oscillations also appear in multi-compartment models of prefrontal cortex activity during memory retrieval (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Lundqvist et al., 2006</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Herman et al., 2013</xref></italic></bold>). Finally, several models have investigated the functional link between the hippocampal theta rhythm and memory processes, showing that encoding and retrieval occur at different phases within each theta cycle through phasic changes in neuronal activity and LTP (e.g., <bold><italic>Hasselmo et al</italic></bold>. (<bold><italic>2002</italic></bold>); <bold><italic>Cutsuridis et al</italic></bold>. (<bold><italic>2010</italic></bold>)).</p>
<p>In terms of neurostimulation, most computational work has focused on the mechanisms under-lying DBS of the basal ganglia for motor disorders such as Parkinson’s disease (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Rubin and Terman, 2004</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Pirini et al., 2009</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Mina et al., 2013</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ebert et al., 2014</xref></italic></bold>), peripheral nerve stimulation (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Rattay et al., 2003</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Kipping and Nogueira, 2022</xref></italic></bold>), spinal cord stimulation (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Rattay et al., 2000</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Capogrosso et al., 2013</xref></italic></bold>), or has remained generic (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Basu et al., 2018</xref></italic></bold>). However, models investigating neurostimulation of hippocampal circuits are scarce (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Hendrickson et al., 2016</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Bingham et al., 2018</xref></italic></bold>), and do not take into account the effects on theta-gamma oscillations. For example, a detailed multicompartment model of the rat dentate gyrus was able to replicate experimentally recorded local field potentials induced by different electrode placements and pulse amplitudes during stimulation of the perforant path (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Bingham et al., 2018</xref></italic></bold>). To model the impact of neurostimulation on neuronal oscillations, a more abstract formalism based on Kuramoto phase oscillators (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Kuramoto, 1984</xref></italic></bold>) has been introduced in the context of Parkinson’s disease and essential tremor, which enabled the design of novel neurostimulation paradigms that enhance or disrupt neuronal synchrony in basal ganglia circuits (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Tass, 2003</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ebert et al., 2014</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Asllani et al., 2018</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">Weerasinghe et al., 2019</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>To our knowledge, there is currently no model of the hippocampal formation that is able to replicate both theta-gamma PAC and theta phase reset during neurostimulation. To investigate the effects of neurostimulation on hippocampal circuits while taking into account these two mechanisms, we modified an existing biophysical model of the hippocampal formation (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Aussel et al., 2018</xref></italic></bold>). In this original model, however, the theta rhythm was considered as an oscillatory input of fixed amplitude and phase velocity, which is inconsistent with theta phase reset. To circumvent this limitation, we combined this biophysical model with abstract Kuramoto oscillators that acted as a dynamical source of theta rhythm, thereby modeling medial septum inputs to the hippocampal formation. This new hybrid dynamical model could generate both theta-nested gamma oscillations and theta phase reset, following a particular phase response curve (PRC) inspired by experimental literature (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Lengyel et al., 2005</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Akam et al., 2012</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Torben-Nielsen et al., 2010</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>We then leveraged this model to explore the effect of single-pulse and pulse-train stimulation on theta-gamma oscillations. In the absence of theta input from the medial septum, single-pulse stimulation produced a transient effect consisting of one or several bursts of activity, depending on stimulation amplitude. The presence of multiple bursts depended on the single-cell calcium dynamics and M-type potassium adaptation current. In the presence of weak theta input, designed to mimic a pathological state that impairs theta-gamma oscillations, single-pulse stimulation could produce long-lasting or even persistent activity by switching the network to a highly synchronized state characterized by theta-nested gamma oscillations. When phase reset was not included in the model, this effect was more pronounced when the stimulation pulse was delivered at the peak of the theta rhythm. However, when strong theta reset was considered, the phase at which stimulation was delivered did not influence the outcome. In the presence of an even weaker theta input, mimicking a pathological state that completely abolishes theta-gamma oscillations, only pulse train stimulation could restore physiological theta-gamma oscillations during the stimulation period. As for the previous results, this effect was phase-dependent only when theta reset was not included.</p>
<p>These results provide a new framework to interpret neurostimulation interventions that interfere with hippocampal oscillations and aim at improving memory function. It can be further extended to investigate the effects of more complex neurostimulation protocols, and the impact of stimulation location and amplitude on the observed network dynamics.</p>

<title>A computational model of the hippocampal formation with dynamical theta input</title>
<p>We first developed a computational model of hippocampal circuits, able to generate both thetanested gamma oscillations and theta phase reset. To achieve this, we combined an existing conductance-based model of the hippocampal formation (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Aussel et al., 2018</xref></italic></bold>) with a set of Kuramoto phase oscillators (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Kuramoto, 1984</xref></italic></bold>) that were used to model the dynamical theta input originating from pacemaker neurons in the medial septum (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Wang, 2002</xref></italic></bold>) (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></italic></bold>). Such ensembles of os-cillators are designed to exhibit a strong phase reset of their collective rhythm in response to a perturbation (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Levnajić and Pikovsky, 2010</xref></italic></bold>). The hippocampal model contained excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations in the entorhinal cortex (EC), dentate gyrus (DG), CA3 and CA1 fields within a coronal slice of the human hippocampus (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-C</xref></italic></bold>). The output of the hippocampal formation (i.e., the activity of CA1 pyramidal neurons) was provided as an input to the Kuramoto oscillators, simulating the hippocampal-septal projections through the fornix (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Williams and Givens, 2003</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Nuñez and Buño, 2021</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Takeuchi et al., 2021</xref></italic></bold>). The oscillations produced by the collective behavior of Kuramoto oscillators represented a population average of their activity: highly synchronized and desynchronized states generated respectively high and low amplitude theta oscillations (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></italic></bold>). The number of oscillators was chosen so that their synchronization level (i.e., their order parameter) and their frequency distribution were sufficiently close to their asymptotic behaviour for a large number of oscillators (<bold><italic><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref></italic></bold>).</p>

Although the respective roles of these different projections are not fully understood, previous computational studies have suggested that the direct projection from the medial septum to CA1 is not essential for the production of theta in CA1 microcircuits (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Mysin et al., 2019</xref></italic></bold>). Since our modeling of the medial septum is only used to generate a dynamic theta rhythm, we opted for a simplified representation where the medial septum projects only to the EC, which in turn drives the different subfields of the hippocampus. In our model, Kuramoto oscillators are therefore connected to the EC neurons and they receive projections from CA1 neurons (see methods for more details).</p>
<p>From a conceptual point of view, our model is thus composed of excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) cir-cuits connected in series, with a feedback loop going through a population of coupled phase oscillators. In the next sections, we first describe the generation of gamma oscillations by individual E-I circuits (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref></italic></bold>), and illustrate their behavior when driven by an oscillatory input such as theta oscillations (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref></italic></bold>).

Two coupled populations of excitatory pyramidal neurons (<italic>N</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> = 1000) and inhibitory interneurons (<italic>N</italic><sub><italic>I</italic></sub> = 100) are driven by a ramping current input (0 nA to 1 nA) for 5 s. As the input becomes stronger, oscillations start to emerge (shaded green area), driven by the interactions between excitatory and inhibitory populations. The green inset shows the raster plot (neuronal spikes across time) of the two populations during the green shaded period (red for inhibitory; blue for excitatory). When the input becomes sufficiently strong (shaded magenta area), the populations become highly synchronized and produce oscillations in the gamma range (at approximately 50 Hz). The spectrogram (bottom panel) shows the power of the instantaneous firing rate of the pyramidal population as a function of time and frequency. It reveals the presence of gamma oscillations that emerge around 2s and increase in frequency until 4 s, when they settle at approximately 60 Hz. <bold>B</bold>.

<title>Generation of gamma oscillations by E-I circuits</title>
<p>It is well-established that a network of interconnected pyramidal neurons and interneurons can give rise to oscillations in the gamma range, a mechanism termed pyramidal-interneuronal network gamma (PING) (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Traub et al., 2004</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Onslow et al., 2014</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Segneri et al., 2020</xref></italic></bold>). This mechanism has been observed in several optogenetic studies with gradually increasing light intensity (i.e., under a ramp input) affecting multiple different circuits, such as layer 2-3 pyramidal neurons of the mouse somatosensory cortex (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Adesnik and Scanziani, 2010</xref></italic></bold>), the CA3 field of the hippocampus in rat in vitro slices (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Akam et al., 2012</xref></italic></bold>), and in the non-human primate motor cortex (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Lu et al., 2015</xref></italic></bold>). In all cases, gamma oscillations emerged above a certain threshold in terms of photostimulation intensity, and the frequency of these oscillations was either stable or slightly increased when increasing the intensity further. We sought to replicate these findings with our elementary E-I circuits composed of single-compartment conductance-based neurons driven by a ramping input current (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref></italic></bold> and <bold><italic><xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref></italic></bold>). As an example, all the results in this section will be shown for an E-I circuit that has similar connectivity parameters as the CA1 field of the hippocampus in our complete model (see section “Hippocampal formation: inputs and connectivity” in the methods).</p>
<p>For low input currents provided to both neuronal populations, only the highly-excitable in-terneurons were activated (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></italic></bold>). For a sufficiently high input current (i.e., a strong input that could overcome the inhibition from the fast-spiking interneurons), the pyramidal neurons started spiking as well. As the amplitude of the input increased, the activity of the both neuronal populations became synchronized in the gamma range, asymptotically reaching a frequency of about 60 Hz (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></italic></bold> bottom panel). Decoupling the populations led to the abolition of gamma oscillations (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></italic></bold>), as neuronal activity was determined solely by the intrinsic properties of each cell. Interestingly, when the ramp input was provided solely to the excitatory population, we observed that the activity of the pyramidal neurons preceded the activity of the inhibitory neurons, while still preserving the emergence of gamma oscillations (<bold><italic><xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A</xref></italic></bold>). As expected, decoupling the populations also abolished gamma oscillations, with the excitatory neurons spiking a frequency determined by their intrinsic properties and the inhibitory population remaining silent (<bold><italic><xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2B</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>To further characterize the intrinsic properties of individual inhibitory and excitatory neurons, we derived their input-frequency (I-F) curves, which represent the firing rate of individual neurons in response to a tonic input (<bold><italic><xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A</xref></italic></bold>). We observed that for certain input amplitudes, the firing rates of both types of neurons was within the gamma range. Interestingly, in the absence of noise, each population could generate by itself gamma oscillations that were purely driven by the input and determined by the intrinsic properties of the neurons (<bold><italic><xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3B</xref></italic></bold>). Adding stochastic Gaussian noise in the membrane potential disrupted these artificial oscillations in decoupled populations (<bold><italic><xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3C</xref></italic></bold>). All subsequent simulations were run with similar noise levels to prevent the emergence of artificial gamma oscillations.</p>
<p>Another potent way to induce gamma oscillations is to drive fast-spiking inhibitory neurons using pulsed optogenetic stimulation at gamma frequencies, a strategy that has been used both in the neocortex (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Cardin et al., 2009</xref></italic></bold>) and hippocampal CA1 (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Iaccarino et al., 2016</xref></italic></bold>). In particular, Cardin and colleagues systematically investigated the effect of driving either excitatory or fast-spiking inhibitory neocortical neurons at frequencies between 10 and 200 Hz (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Cardin et al., 2009</xref></italic></bold>). They showed that fast-spiking interneurons are preferentially entrained around 40-50 Hz, while excitatory neurons respond better to lower frequencies. To verify the behavior of our model against these experimental data, we simulated pulsed optogenetic stimulation as an intracellular current provided to our reduced model of a single E-I circuit. Stimulation was applied at frequencies between 10 and 200 Hz to excitatory cells only, to inhibitory cells only, or to both at the same time (<bold><italic><xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4</xref></italic></bold>). The population firing rates were used as a proxy for the local field potentials (LFP), and we computed the relative power in a 10-Hz band centered around the stimulation frequency, similarly to the method proposed in (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Cardin et al., 2009</xref></italic></bold>). When presented with continuous stimulation across a range of frequencies in the gamma range, interneurons showed the greatest degree of gamma power modulation (<bold><italic><xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4</xref></italic></bold>). Furthermore, when the stimulation was delivered to the excitatory population, the relative power around the stimulation frequency dropped significantly in frequencies above 10 Hz, similar to the reported experimental data (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Cardin et al., 2009</xref></italic></bold>). The main difference between our simulation results and these experimental data is the specific frequencies at which fast-spiking interneurons showed resonance, which was slow gamma around 40 Hz in the mouse barrel cortex and fast gamma around 90 Hz in our model. This could be attributed to several factors, such as differences in the cellular properties between cortical and hippocampal fast-spiking interneurons, or the differences between the size of the populations and their relevant connectivity in the cortex and the hippocampus.</p>

<title>Theta-gamma oscillations and theta phase reset under dynamical theta input</title>
<p>Once we validated that our elementary E-I circuits were able to generate gamma oscillations under an input of sufficiently high amplitude, we studied the behavior of the whole model when the theta input was dynamically provided by the Kuramoto oscillators as described above (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></italic></bold>). As in the original model (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Aussel et al., 2018</xref></italic></bold>), the input theta rhythm drove the network to produce spiking activity in the gamma range preferentially around the peak of theta in all excitatory and inhibitory populations (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></italic></bold> and <bold><italic><xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref></italic></bold>). Spectrograms of the CA1 population firing rates revealed that these bursts of activity around each theta peak were characterized by oscillations around 60 Hz (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></italic></bold>). This was confirmed by power spectral densities, which showed a clear peak at 4 Hz (corresponding to the theta drive) and increases in gamma band activity between 40 and 80 Hz (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></italic></bold>). To quantify PAC between theta and gamma oscillations, we used the modulation index (MI) (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Tort et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">2010</xref></italic></bold>), which has been shown to outperform other similar measures (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Hülsemann et al., 2019</xref></italic></bold>). However, we discovered that this metric would give erroneous results in our simulated datasets due to the absence of certain frequency components. To overcome this limitation and avoid artifacts, uniform noise was added to the firing rates prior to computing the MI (<bold><italic><xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6</xref></italic></bold>). We first visualized the quantification of PAC using the comodulogram, which indicates the MI as a function of two frequencies corresponding to the modulating phase signal and the modulated amplitude signal. This analysis confirmed that gamma-band signals between 45 and 75 Hz were modulated by lower theta frequencies between 3 and 6 Hz, which we quantified by computing a global MI in frequency ranges encompassing theta (3-9 Hz) and gamma (40-80 Hz) (<bold><italic><xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5B</xref></italic></bold>). To refine this analysis, we also computed a similar MI between the amplitude of various gamma frequencies and the phase of theta, which indicated that oscillations between 40 and 80 Hz occur preferentially around the peak of theta (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref></italic></bold>C and <bold><italic><xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5B</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>Next, we verified that our model was able to display theta phase reset during single-pulse stimulation (depolarizing pulse, 1-ms duration). This mechanism is tightly linked with the concept of PRC, which characterizes the phase delay or advancement that follows a single pulse delivered to an oscillatory system, as a function of the phase at which this input is delivered. Although there is no direct measurement of the PRC of septal neurons, such characterizations have been performed for individual pyramidal cells in the CA3 and CA1 fields of the hippocampus (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Lengyel et al., 2005</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Kwag and Paulsen, 2009</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Akam et al., 2012</xref></italic></bold>). These PRCs appear biphasic and show a phase advancement (respectively delay) for stimuli delivered in the ascending (respectively descending) slope of theta. We modeled this behavior by a specific term (which we called the phase response function) in the general equation of the Kuramoto oscillators (see methods, <bold><italic><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Equation 1</xref></italic></bold>). Importantly, introducing a phase offset in the phase response function disrupted theta-nested gamma oscillations (<bold><italic><xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7</xref></italic></bold>), which suggests that the septohippocampal circuitry must be critically tuned to be able to generate such oscillations. The strength of phase reset could also be adjusted by a gain that was manually tuned. In the presence of the physiological phase response function and of a sufficiently high reset gain, a single stimulation pulse delivered to all excitatory and inhibitory CA1 neurons could reset the phase of theta to a value close to its peaks (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></italic></bold>). We computed the PRC of our simulated data for different stimulation amplitudes and validated that our neuronal network behaved according to the phase response function set in our Kuramoto oscillators (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></italic></bold>). It should be noted that including this phase reset mechanism affected the generated theta rhythm even in the absence of stimulation, extending the duration of the theta peak and thereby slowing down the frequency of the generated theta rhythm.</p>
<p>Importantly, our approach is generalizable and can be applied to other models producing theta-nested gamma oscillations. For instance, we adapted the neural mass model by Onslow and colleagues (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Onslow et al., 2014</xref></italic></bold>), replaced the fixed theta input by a set of Kuramoto oscillators, and demonstrated that it could also generate theta phase reset in response to single-pulse stimulation (<bold><italic><xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Figure S8</xref></italic></bold>). These results illustrate that the general behavior of our model is not specific to the tuning of individual parameters in the conductance-based neurons, but follows general rules that are captured by the level of abstraction of the Kuramoto formalism.</p>
<p>Overall, we successfully developed a new model of the hippocampal formation able to exhibit both theta-nested gamma oscillations and theta phase reset in response to stimulation. We then decided to explore further the effects of various stimulation protocols on its dynamics.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Effects of theta input and stimulation amplitudes on theta-gamma oscillations</title>
<p>We investigated the behavior of the model across multiple states of varying septal theta input amplitude in response to single-pulse stimulation delivered to CA1. In the absence of theta drive, a single stimulation pulse elicited either zero or two bursts of spiking activity (depending on stimulation amplitude) separated by about 200 ms (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></italic></bold>, C). We first sought to understand the origin of this second burst, as it showed that even a single pulse could induce transient periodic activity around 5 Hz in our model, a frequency within the theta range. A previous model has shown that the presence of Calcium-Activated Non-specific cationic (CAN) currents can lead to self-sustained theta oscillations in the hippocampus (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Giovannini et al., 2017</xref></italic></bold>). Moreover, this study showed a direct link between the increased excitation provided by the CAN current and the spike-frequency adaptation properties of the M-current, directly affecting transitions from an asynchronous low-firing regime to synchronous bursting. We tested the role of the CAN current in the response to single-pulse stimulation by completely removing it from our simulations, which abolished the second burst of activity (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></italic></bold>). Moreover, the time interval separating the two bursts likely resulted from the interplay between the depolarizing CAN current and hyperpolarizing M current (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>In the presence of dynamic theta input, the effects of single-pulse stimulation depended both on theta input amplitude and stimulation amplitude, highlighting different regimes of network activity (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref></italic></bold> and <bold><italic><xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">Figure S9</xref>, <xref rid="figS10" ref-type="fig">Figure S10</xref>, <xref rid="figS11" ref-type="fig">Figure S11</xref></italic></bold>). For low theta input, theta-nested gamma oscil-lations were initially absent and could not be induced by stimulation (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></italic></bold>). At most, the stimulation could only elicit a few bursts of spiking activity that faded away after approximately 250 ms, similar to the rebound of activity seen in the absence of theta drive. For increasing theta input, the network switched to an intermediate regime: upon initialization at a state with no spiking activity, it could be kicked to a state with self-sustained theta-nested gamma oscillations by a single stimulation pulse of sufficiently high amplitude (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref></italic></bold>). This regime existed for a range of septal theta inputs located just below the threshold to induce self-sustained theta-gamma oscillations without additional stimulation, as characterized by the post-stimulation theta power, gamma power, and theta-gamma PAC (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref></italic></bold>). Removing CAN currents from all areas of the model abolished this behavior <bold><italic><xref rid="figS12" ref-type="fig">Figure S12</xref></italic></bold>, which is interesting given the role of this current in the multistability of EC neurons (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Egorov et al., 2002</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Fransén et al., 2006</xref></italic></bold>) and in the intrinsic ability of the hippocampus to generate theta-nested gamma oscillations (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Giovannini et al., 2017</xref></italic></bold>). For the highest theta input, the network became able to spontaneously generate theta-nested gamma oscillations, even when initialized at a state with no spiking activity and without additional neurostimulation <bold><italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref></italic></bold>C.</p>

<title>Neurostimulation for restoring theta-gamma oscillations in pathological states</title>
<p>Based on the above analyses, we considered two pathological states: one with a moderate theta input (i.e., moderately weak projections from the medial septum to the EC) that allowed the initiation of self-sustained oscillations by single stimulation pulses (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref></italic></bold>, point B), and one with a weaker theta input characterized by the complete absence of self-sustained oscillations even following transient stimulation (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref></italic></bold>, point A). In each case, we sought to assess whether single-pulse or pulse train stimulation could induce or restore theta-nested gamma oscillations and whether this effect depended on the phase at which stimulation was delivered (i.e., at the peak or trough of the theta cycle). We hypothesized that any possible phase relationship would also depend on the phase reset mechanism. To test this hypothesis, we ran a series of simulations using two different models: one without phase reset and one with strong phase reset (i.e., the reset gain was set at the value used in <bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>In the case of a moderate theta input and in the presence of phase reset, delivering a pulse at either the peak or trough of theta could induce theta-nested gamma oscillations (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref></italic></bold> and 6C). By contrast, in the absence of phase reset, only stimulation delivered at the peak of theta was able to induce such oscillations, after some time delay (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref></italic></bold>B, D). Quantification of these results in terms of theta power, gamma power, and theta-gamma PAC showed strongly similar responses between stimulation delivered at the peak or trough of theta with phase reset enabled, similar but weaker responses with stimulation delivered at the peak of theta with phase reset disabled, and no response in the case of trough stimulation with phase reset disabled (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>In the case of a weak theta input that completely abolished neuronal oscillations, we delivered stimulation pulses continuously at a frequency matching that of the underlying theta rhythm for a duration of 2 s, in order to restore physiological oscillations (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref></italic></bold>). The stimulation onset was timed to either the peak or trough of the ongoing theta cycle. The continuous delivery of pulses produced similar results as single-pulse stimulation. With phase reset, pulse train stimulation restored theta-nested gamma oscillations within the whole network, irrespective of the phase of stimulation onset (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref></italic></bold>, C). Notably, stimulation delivered at the trough forced a reset of the phase of theta rhythm and led to the subsequent delivery of pulses at the peak of theta. Interestingly, in the absence of phase reset, peak-targeted stimulation induced theta-gamma oscillations in all network areas easily, while trough-targeted stimulation created artificial bursts that propagated in other areas with difficulty, requiring multiple pulses to achieve a fraction of the results of peak-targeted stimulation (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref></italic></bold>, D). Comparing these simulations based on theta power, gamma power, and theta-gamma PAC within CA1 (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref></italic></bold>) showed similar albeit less striking differences as single-pulse stimulation, possibly because CA1 was driven directly by the stimulation. Notably, gamma power in the absence of theta phase reset, was higher when utilizing pulse trains. These differences were even more pronounced in areas other than CA1, as can be seen by the gradual emergence of oscillations for trough stimulation without phase reset (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref></italic></bold>).</p>

<title>Highlights</title>
<p>In summary, we have developed a novel computational model to investigate the effects of electrical stimulation on a slice of the hippocampal formation, incorporating two important features related to memory: theta-nested gamma oscillations and theta phase reset. The key innovation compared to previous models (e.g., <bold><italic>Aussel et al</italic></bold>. (<bold><italic>2018</italic></bold>)) is the introduction of a set of abstract Kuramoto oscillators, which represent pacemaker neurons in the medial septum and are interfaced with biophysically realistic neuronal models in the hippocampus. From a methodological point of view, this hybrid interfacing between two levels of abstraction represents an innovation in itself and could be applied to other systems or brain structures that are driven by dynamical rhythms. The main outcomes reported here relate to the importance of the theta reset mechanism when examining the effects of neurostimulation on hippocampal oscillations.</p>
<p>A very interesting finding concerns the behavior of the model in response to single-pulse stim-ulation for certain values of the theta amplitude (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref></italic></bold>). For low theta amplitudes, a single stimulation pulse was capable of switching the network behavior from a state with no spiking activity to one with prominent theta-nested gamma oscillations. Whether such an effect can be induced in vivo in the context of memory processes remains an open question. Nevertheless, delivering a single stimulation pulse bilaterally to the human hippocampus during a memory task is sufficient to impair memory encoding (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Lacruz et al., 2010</xref></italic></bold>), suggesting that even single-pulse stimulation can indeed have wide network effects that are behaviorally relevant.</p>
<p>The second main finding is that the timing of individual stimulation pulses with respect to the phase of the ongoing theta rhythm matters differently depending on the presence or absence of phase reset (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref></italic></bold> and <bold><italic><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref></italic></bold>). Human intracranial stimulation data indicate that the receptivity of hippocampal circuits to single-pulse stimulation is modulated by the phase of theta (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Lurie et al., 2022</xref></italic></bold>). A number of studies have also reported conflicting results in terms of memory outcomes, which could potentially be attributed to the induction of phase reset through stimulation (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Suthana et al., 2012</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Jacobs et al., 2016</xref></italic></bold>). To our knowledge, however, the degree of phase reset that follows each stimulation pulse remains unknown and should be investigated in future experimental studies. From a technological point of view, the two regimes with and without phase reset have opposite predictions concerning the need for closed-loop stimulation protocols that would trigger stimulation in real-time based on the phase of ongoing theta oscillations. Such phasetriggered stimulation would be most useful if the phase reset mechanism remains relatively limited. When this mechanism becomes too strong, regular continuous stimulation appears sufficient to restore physiological theta-gamma oscillations (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>It should also be noted that the reset gain in our simulations (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Equation 1</xref></italic></bold>, gain <italic>G</italic><sub><italic>reset</italic></sub>) was either completely turned off or set at a high value, producing a strong effect that always reset the phase of theta to its peak. In reality, the degree of theta phase reset is dynamic, depending on the environment and associated task requirements (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Rizzuto et al., 2003</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Mormann et al., 2005</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Jackson et al., 2008</xref></italic></bold>), and may be affected by neurodegenerative disorders that affect the connections between the hippocampal formation and the medial septum. Importantly, our proposed framework can simulate intermediate values of the reset gain, which should ideally be fitted to experimental data in future applications.</p>
<p>Finally, we modeled pathological states by reducing the maximum amplitude of the theta input (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Equation 2</xref></italic></bold>, gain <italic>G</italic><sub>θ</sub>) until theta-nested gamma oscillations were impaired or even abolished (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref></italic></bold>). This choice was meant to simulate neurodegeneration in the medial septum, which is known to be affected in Alzheimer’s disease, leading to oscillatory disruptions (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Nelson et al., 2014</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hampel et al., 2018</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Takeuchi et al., 2021</xref></italic></bold>). Another possibility would be that neurodegeneration limits the ability of the septal pacemaker neurons to synchronize, thus producing a weaker col-lective theta rhythm without affecting the maximum amplitude of individual oscillators. Although we simulated this change in our model by reducing the synchronization parameter, the effects on hippocampal oscillations were less pronounced (<bold><italic><xref rid="figS12" ref-type="fig">Figure S12</xref></italic></bold>). Linking these different modeling parameters to experimental biomarkers will be important in future work.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Even though we took great care in developing a precise representation of the hippocampal formation, the resulting model remains a simplification that could be further enriched. In particular, we deliberately modeled only a single theta generator, while multiple intraand extra-hippocampal generators are known to co-exist (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Kocsis et al., 1999</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Hummos and Nair, 2017</xref></italic></bold>). We decided to model septal pacemaker neurons projecting to the EC as the main source of hippocampal theta as reported in multiple experimental studies (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Buzsáki, 2002</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Buzsáki et al., 2003</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Hangya et al., 2009</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Colgin, 2013</xref></italic></bold>). However, experimental findings and previous models have also proposed that direct septal inputs are not essential for theta generation (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Wang, 2002</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Colgin, 2013</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Mysin et al., 2019</xref></italic></bold>), but play an important role in phase synchronization of hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, the model does not account for the connections between the lateral and medial septum and the hippocampus (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Takeuchi et al., 2021</xref></italic></bold>). These connections include the inhibitory projections from the lateral to the medial septum and the monosynaptic projections from the hippocampal CA3 field to the lateral septum. An experimental study has highlighted the importance of the lateral septum in regulating the hippocampal theta rhythm <bold><italic>Bender et al</italic></bold>. (<bold><italic>2015</italic></bold>), an area that has not been included in the model. Specifically, theta-rhythmic optogenetic stimulation of the axonal projections from the lateral septum to the hippocampus was shown to entrain theta oscillations and lead to behavioral changes during exploration in transgenic mice. To account for these discrepancies, our model could be extended by considering more realistic connectivity patterns between the medial / lateral septum and the hippocampal formation, including glutamatergic, cholinergic, and GABAergic reciprocal connections (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Müller and Remy, 2018</xref></italic></bold>), or by considering multiple sets of oscillators each representing one theta generator.</p>
<p>In terms of neuronal cell types, we also made an important simplification by considering only basket cells as the main class of inhibitory interneuron in the whole hippocampal formation. However, it should be noted that many other types of interneurons exist in the hippocampus and have been modeled in various works with higher computational complexity (e.g., <bold><italic>Bezaire et al</italic></bold>. (<bold><italic>2016</italic></bold>); <bold><italic>Chatzikalymniou et al</italic></bold>. (<bold><italic>2021</italic></bold>)). Among these various interneurons, oriens-lacunosum moleculare (OLM) neurons in the CA1 field have been shown to play a crucial role in synchronizing the activity of pyramidal neurons at gamma frequencies (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Tort et al., 2007</xref></italic></bold>), and in generating theta-gamma PAC (e.g., <bold><italic>Neymotin et al</italic></bold>. (<bold><italic>2011</italic></bold>); <bold><italic>Ponzi et al</italic></bold>. (<bold><italic>2023</italic></bold>)). Additionally, these cells may contribute to the formation of specific phase relationships within CA1 neuronal populations, through the integration between inputs from the medial septum, the EC, and CA3 (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Mysin et al., 2019</xref></italic></bold>). Future work is needed to include more diverse cell types and detailed morphologies modeled through multiple compartments.</p>
<p>Another limitation of our model concerns synaptic transmission delays, which have been largely neglected and could affect the phase relationships between the medial septum and different hippocampal subfields. Experimental studies have indeed reported time delays in the population activities of connected anatomical structures (i.e., from EC to DG) (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Mizuseki et al., 2009</xref></italic></bold>), with pyramidal cells in downstream areas like CA3 and CA1 preferentially firing at different phases of theta (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Dragoi and Buzsáki, 2006</xref></italic></bold>). Propagation effects could also depend on the spatial scale of the model. We also decided to represent only a thin coronal slice of the hippocampal formation, and it remains unclear how an anatomically-accurate model of the whole structure would behave in terms of propagation of spontaneous and electrically-induced neuronal activity.</p>
<p>Importantly, we did not consider learning through synaptic plasticity, even though such mechanisms could drastically modify synaptic conduction for the whole network (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Borges et al., 2017</xref></italic></bold>). Even more interestingly, the inclusion of spike-timing-dependent plasticity would enable the inves-tigation of stimulation protocols aimed at promoting LTP, such as theta-burst stimulation (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Larson and Munkácsy, 2015</xref></italic></bold>). This aspect would be of uttermost importance to make a link with memory encoding and retrieval processes (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Axmacher et al., 2006</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">Tsanov and Manahan-Vaughan, 2009</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Jutras et al., 2013</xref></italic></bold>) and with neurostimulation studies for memory improvement (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Titiz et al., 2017</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Solomon et al., 2021</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>From the point of view of neurostimulation, future work is needed to extend the current model to a multi-compartment representation of neurites, since axons are known to be preferentially activated by extracellular electrical stimulation (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Rattay et al., 2003</xref></italic></bold>). Specifically, multi-compartment cable models have been developed to investigate spike initiation and propagation by modeling the axon as a series of resistance-capacitance circuits following its trajectory (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Rattay et al., 2003</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Joucla and Yvert, 2012</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ashida and Nogueira, 2018</xref></italic></bold>). These models are particularly suited to study the effects of extracellular stimulation, which are non-intuitive and depend as a first approximation on the second spatial derivative of the electrical potential along the cell membrane (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Rattay, 1986</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Rattay et al., 2003</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">McIntyre et al., 2004</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Rattay et al., 2018</xref></italic></bold>). Here, we have modeled electrical stimulation as an intracellular current applied equally across all neurons in the targeted area, which is extremely simplified but enables computational tractability. Future developments will focus on developing an equivalent multicompartment model with realistic axonal trajectories while making sufficient simplifications to allow for realistic computation times.</p>
<p>Finally, we likened conditions of low theta input to pathological states characteristic of oscil-lopathies such as Alzheimer’s disease, as these conditions disrupted all aspects of theta-gamma oscillations in our model: theta power, gamma power, and theta-gamma PAC <bold><italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref></italic></bold>. However, it should be noted that changes in theta or gamma power in these pathologies are often unclear, and that the most consistent alteration that has been reported in Alzheimer’s disease is a reduction of theta-gamma PAC (for review, see <bold><italic>Kitchigina</italic></bold> (<bold><italic>2018</italic></bold>)). Future work should explore the effects of cellular alterations intrinsic to the hippocampal formation and their impact on theta-gamma oscil-lations.</p>

<sec id="s3c">
<title>Outlook</title>
<p>Overall, this new model of the hippocampal formation represents a methodologically innovative basis to further explore multiple neurostimulation strategies that target hippocampal oscillations. Moreover, the limitations discussed above represent important avenues for future refinements, which will require significant work to overcome the costs in terms of computational tractability (e.g., modeling the whole hippocampus, or using multicompartment models of axonal trajectories and dendritic trees). Ultimately, such model refinements should allow the investigation of the effects of extracellular stimulation using charge-balanced biphasic pulses and multipolar electrode configurations with realistic electrode geometries. Most importantly, we believe that our current work may also serve as an inspiration for future computational models of oscillopathies (not necessarily limited to the hippocampus), which could benefit from interfacing abstract sets of synchronizing oscillators and investigating their interactions with biophysically-realistic neurons.</p>

<title>Overall Architecture</title>
<p>We aimed to develop a computational model of the hippocampal formation that is able to generate theta-nested gamma oscillations and takes into account the dynamic nature of the theta input from the medial septum, i.e., the reset of the theta phase following strong activity in the perforant path or fornix (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Buño et al., 1978</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Williams and Givens, 2003</xref></italic></bold>). To this end, we adapted a previous biophysical model of the human hippocampal formation under fixed sinusoidal input (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Aussel et al., 2018</xref></italic></bold>) and interconnected it with an abstract representation of the medial septum, modeled as an assembly of Kuramoto oscillators (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Kuramoto, 1984</xref></italic></bold>) (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>More precisely, we modeled a 15-mm thick coronal slice of the hippocampal formation which comprises the DG, the CA3 and CA1 subfields of the hippocampus, and the EC, all populated with excitatory and inhibitory Hodgkin-Huxley neurons. For the medial septum, we opted for a simplified representation where the medial septum projects only to the EC, which in turn drives the different subfields of the hippocampus (see also L141-150). In our model, Kuramoto oscillators are therefore connected to the EC neurons and they receive projections from CA1 neurons (see sections below for more details).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4a2">
<title>Medial septum: Kuramoto Oscillators</title>
<p>The medial septum contains pacemaker neurons (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">Varga et al., 2008</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Hangya et al., 2009</xref></italic></bold>) that synchronize with one another and generate a global theta rhythm. In turn, these pacemaker neurons drive downstream areas that receive projections from the medial septum. Here, we modeled the entire medial septum neuronal assembly as a set of coupled phase oscillators following the Kuramoto model (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Kuramoto, 1984</xref></italic></bold>), which generated the driving theta rhythm that was provided to the hippocampal formation through the EC (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Breakspear et al., 2010</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>Kuramoto oscillators have also been used to investigate the effects of neurostimulation on synchronized brain rhythms in the context of Parkinson’s disease or essential tremor (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Tass, 2003</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">Weerasinghe et al., 2019</xref></italic></bold>). Here, each Kuramoto oscillator was described by its phase θ<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, which evolves over time according to the following equation:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="534142v2_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
The term ω<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> denotes the natural frequency of oscillator <italic>i</italic>, and is normally distributed around the center frequency <italic>f</italic><sub>0</sub> and with standard deviation σ. The synchronization parameter <italic>k</italic> represents the coupling strength of the group of oscillators, and <italic>N</italic> is the number of oscillators. Higher values for the synchronization parameter indicate stronger coupling between pairs of oscillators, thus affecting how fast or slow their phases tend to synchronize. The final product <italic>G</italic><sub><italic>reset</italic></sub><italic>X</italic>(<italic>t</italic>)<italic>Z</italic>(θ<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) is used to describe the effects of external inputs on the phase of the oscillators. Here, the only external input originates in the projections from CA1 to the medial septum. It is described by the instantaneous firing rate <italic>X</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) of the CA1 excitatory population. <italic>G</italic><sub><italic>reset</italic></sub> is an arbitrary gain that determines the strength of the CA1 input to the oscillators. Finally, the function <italic>Z</italic>(θ<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) describes how the effects of CA1 inputs on the oscillators depend on the phase of the ongoing theta rhythm.</p>
<p>The coherence and phase of the driving theta rhythm <italic>I</italic><sub>θ</sub> were computed using the order pa-rameter <italic>r</italic> to extract the mean amplitude <italic>A</italic> and the mean phase <italic>ϕ</italic> of the ensemble of Kuramoto oscillators as follows:
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="534142v2_eqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where the mean amplitude <italic>A</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) and the mean phase ϕ(<italic>t</italic>) are derived by taking the real and imaginary part of the order parameter respectively, and the output theta rhythm <italic>I</italic><sub>θ</sub>(<italic>t</italic>) is a rectified cosine, multiplied by a gain <italic>G</italic><sub>θ</sub> that controls the maximum output amplitude (in nA).</p>
<p>To simulate the effect of the projections from CA1 to the medial septum on the phase of the oscillators, an approximation of the instantaneous firing rate of the CA1 excitatory population was used as the term <italic>X</italic>(<italic>t</italic>). To obtain the instantaneous firing rate, we convolved the CA1 population spike train with an exponential kernel using the following equations:
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="534142v2_eqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>t</italic><sup><italic>S</italic></sup> denotes the ordered set of the spike timings, and τ<sub><italic>FR</italic></sub> determines the exponential decay of the kernel, which was set to 10 ms to compute population activity (for single neurons, a typical value is 100 ms) (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Gerstner et al., 2014</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>Hereafter, we call the term <italic>Z</italic>(θ) the phase response function, to distinguish it from the PRC obtained from experimental data or simulations (see section below <italic>“Data Analysis”, “Phase Response Curve”</italic>). Briefly, the PRC of an oscillatory system indicates the phase delay or advancement that follows a single pulse, as a function of the phase at which this input is delivered. The phase response function <italic>Z</italic>(θ) was chosen to mimic as well as possible experimental PRCs reported in the literature (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Lengyel et al., 2005</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Kwag and Paulsen, 2009</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Akam et al., 2012</xref></italic></bold>). These PRCs appear biphasic and show a phase advancement (respectively delay) for stimuli delivered in the ascending (respectively descending) slope of theta. To accurately model this behavior, we used the following equation for the phase response function, where θ<sub><italic>peak</italic></sub> represents the phase at which the theta rhythm reaches its maximum and the parameter ϕ<sub><italic>offset</italic></sub> controls the desired phase offset from the peak:

<title>Hippocampal formation: inputs and connectivity</title>
<p>The hippocampal formation receives most of its external inputs from the EC. Activity from the EC is projected to all hippocampal subfields, starting with the DG. DG granule cells project onto the CA3 pyramidal cells via mossy cell fibers. CA3 projects in turn to CA1 via Schaffer collaterals. These connections form the tri-synaptic pathway. Direct connections from the EC towards the CA3 and CA1 subfields through the monosynaptic pathway are also considered. Pyramidal neurons from CA1 project to pyramidal neurons and interneurons in the EC, closing the hippocampal-entorhinal loop. CA1 pyramidal neurons also project to the medial septum through the fornix. An overview of the connections between areas is presented in panel B of <bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></italic></bold>.</p>
<p>In the current model, EC pyramidal neurons and interneurons receive oscillatory theta input from the medial septum in the form of an excitatory intracellular current as described in <bold><italic><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Equation 2</xref></italic></bold> and <bold><italic><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn5">Equation 5</xref></italic></bold>.

<title>Tuning input gain and connection strengths: targeted firing rates</title>
<p>We adjusted the input gain (<italic>G</italic><sub>θ</sub>) and inter-area connection strengths (<italic>A</italic><sub><italic>inter</italic></sub>) to target an overall oscillatory rhythm <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>osc,targ</italic></sub> at the driving frequency of the input, i.e., 6 Hz, and a mean firing rate of each excitatory population <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>exc,targ</italic></sub> also at 6 Hz (meaning that each excitatory cell should spike on average once per theta cycle). Because of the ratio between excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the model, this resulted in firing rates of about 60 Hz in inhibitory neurons. These targeted values were inspired by literature in behaving rodents showing that hippocampal pyramidal neurons typically fire at rates below 10 Hz, usually between 1 and 2 Hz, and that interneurons fire at rates between 20 and 80 Hz (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Hirase et al., 2001</xref></italic></bold>). In practice, the obtained firing rates were constrained by the simplifications made in the model.</p>
<p>The mean population firing rate <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>exc</italic></sub> was computed by counting the number of spikes in the last second of a 3-s simulation run, to avoid edge effects due to the non-physiological initial conditions, and by averaging this number over time and across neurons. The oscillatory frequency <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>osc</italic></sub> was computed as the mean of the inverse of the timing between all pairs of consecutive peaks in the theta rhythm. Finally, the metric used to adjust parameters (input strength and connection strengths) was calculated as the Euclidean distance between the targeted and obtained firing rate and oscillatory rate:

<title>Tuning input and connection strengths: detailed procedure</title>
<p>The input gain (<italic>G</italic><sub>θ</sub>, <bold><italic><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Equation 2</xref></italic></bold>) and inter-area connection strengths (<italic>A</italic><sub><italic>inter</italic></sub>, <bold><italic><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn15">Equation 15</xref></italic></bold>) were sequentially adjusted using the following heuristics. All simulations were performed for a duration of 3 s, and the first 2 s were excluded from the analysis to avoid edge effects. The network was initialized with membrane voltages uniformly distributed in the range [−70, −60] mV. Our initial point was a fully uncoupled model in which all the connection strengths were set to 0. The tuning procedure was performed in the absence of noise.</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>First, we adjusted the amplitude of the theta input to a value that would produce a mean firing rate of 6 Hz in the excitatory population of the EC. To this end, the input strength was progressively increased from 0 to 0.5 nA in steps of 0.01 nA, and the value that maximized our metric was selected.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>We then adjusted similarly the connection strength from the EC to the DG, increasing it from 0 to 20 in steps of 0.1.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>We repeated the procedure to jointly tune the connection strengths from EC and DG to CA3, assuming an equal contribution from these two areas. These two connection strengths were set to the same value and were increased from 0 to 5 in steps of 0.1.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>We followed the same procedure to jointly tune the connection strengths from CA3 and EC to CA1, assuming again an equal contribution from these two areas.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The last connection from CA1 to EC was more difficult to tune because it closes the feedback loop and induces complex dynamics when too strong. To tune it, we temporarily uncoupled CA1 from all other structures and temporarily added a fixed sinusoidal input at the target frequency of 6 Hz to both excitatory and inhibitory CA1 neurons. We first adjusted this input amplitude to generate a mean firing rate of about 6 Hz in CA1 excitatory neurons. Next, the connection strength from CA1 to EC was adjusted to also achieve a mean firing rate of 6 Hz in EC excitatory neurons.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Because EC receives both an external input and feedback from CA1, we assumed that both these contributions should be decreased for the system to behave in a physiological range in the presence of the feedback loop. We, therefore, decided to divide by two the connection strength from CA1 to EC obtained in step 5. All other connection strengths were then set again to the values tuned in the previous steps, and the temporary external input to CA1 was removed. The external theta input to the EC was reinstated and tuned again as in step 1.</p></list-item>

<p>The MI (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Tort et al., 2008</xref></italic></bold>) was used to estimate the degree of PAC between theta and gamma oscillations in the model. To compute the MI, the normalized firing rate traces were band-pass filtered in the frequency ranges of interest: 3-9 Hz for theta (referred to as the “phase signal”) and 40-80 Hz for gamma (referred to as the “amplitude signal”). Then, the phase and amplitude time series were extracted from the filtered signals using the Hilbert transform. A histogram of the mean amplitude of gamma over the phase of theta was then extracted, using phase bins of 5 degrees. The MI was finally calculated as the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the mean amplitude distribution and the uniform distribution. A higher MI indicates stronger PAC. For a schematic representation regarding the computation of the MI, refer to <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> in <bold><italic>Tort et al</italic></bold>.

<title>Comodulograms</title>
<p>Comodulograms represent the amount of PAC between two ranges of frequencies, used to extract respectively a phase and an amplitude signal. Specifically, we computed the MI between 80% overlapping 1-Hz frequency bands used to compute the phase of the signal (in the theta range), and 90% overlapping 10-Hz frequency bands used to compute the amplitude of the signal (in the gamma range). The resulting distribution of MI values was subsequently plotted as heat maps. An inherent problem with the computation of the MI using simulated data was the lack of frequency components in some frequency bands. Filtering the data within 1-Hz frequency bands thus created a flat signal, resulting in high values of the MI despite the absence of modulation. To overcome this limitation, we added uniform noise to the firing rate signals prior to computing the MI, with an amplitude of approximately 20% of the maximum instantaneous firing rates.

For each narrow gamma range, we binned the amplitude with respect to the phase in a similar way as in the calculation of the MI.

We split a single theta cycle into intervals of width π/8 radians and applied a single stimulation pulse of a given amplitude.

<caption><title>(Figure 1 – Figure Supplement 1) Influence of the number of Kuramoto oscillators on their collective dynamics.</title>
<p><bold>Left</bold>: influence of the number of Kuramoto oscillators (<italic>N</italic>) on the convergence over time of the order parameter (<italic>r</italic>), which is a measure of synchronization of the set of oscillators. The above results were obtained using a synchronization ratio <italic>k</italic>/<italic>N</italic> of 25. Upon initialization, the oscillators’ natural frequencies (ω<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) were normally distributed with a center frequency (<italic>f</italic><sub>0</sub> = 6 Hz). Initial phases were uniformly distributed around the unit circle (<italic>U</italic> ∼ [0, 2π]). <bold>Right</bold>: histograms of the natural frequencies (ω<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>), together with the distribution mean (μ) and standard error of the mean <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534142v2_inline8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. As the number of oscillators increases, the mean frequency appears closer to the desired center frequency of 6 Hz, and the standard error of the mean is reduced. Overall, increasing the number of oscillators past 250 did not yield any substantial change in the convergence of the order parameter or the distribution of natural frequencies. This number of oscillators was therefore chosen for all subsequent analyses.</p></caption>

<p>All panels show the effects of pulsed optogenetic stimulation of specific cell types (<bold>A</bold>. excitatory only, <bold>B</bold>. inhibitory only, <bold>C</bold>. both excitatory and inhibitory cells) at different frequencies, similar to the experiments reported by Cardin and colleagues (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Cardin et al., 2009</xref></italic></bold>). Pulsed stimulation was delivered continuously with a frequency ranging from 10 to 200 Hz. The relative power was calculated similarly to <bold><italic>Cardin et al</italic></bold>. (<bold><italic>2009</italic></bold>). Specifically, for each stimulation frequency, we computed first the power spectral density of the population firing rates using Welch’s method, and then the ratio between the power within a 10-Hz band centered around the stimulation frequency and the total power across all frequencies. <bold>A</bold>. Pulsed stimulation of excitatory cells shows a higher relative power in the stimulated neurons at low frequencies (20 and 40 Hz). <bold>B</bold>. Pulsed stimulation of inhibitory cells reveals neuronal entrainment, i.e., a peak in their relative power, in the high gamma range (80-100 Hz). <bold>C</bold>. Simultaneous pulsed stimulation of both populations reveals a strong entrainment of inhibitory cells in the high gamma range, and a more modest entrainment of excitatory cells at low frequencies.</p></caption>

<caption><title>(Figure 3 – Figure Supplement 2) Quantification of PAC with and without noise. A.</title>
<p>Quantifying PAC in the absence of noise produced inaccurate identification of the coupled frequency bands, due to the complete absence of oscillations at some frequencies. All analyses are based on the CA1 firing rates (top traces) during a representative simulation. Power spectral densities of these firing rates (<bold>left</bold>) indicate that some frequencies have a power of 0. PAC of the excitatory population was assessed using two graphical representations, the polar plot (<bold>middle</bold>) and comodulogram (<bold>right</bold>), and quantified using the MI. The comodulogram was calculated by computing the MI across 80% overlapping 1-Hz frequency bands in the theta range and across 90% overlapping 10-Hz frequency bands in the gamma range and subsequently plotted as a heat map. In the absence of noise, a slow theta frequency centered around 5 Hz is found to modulate a broad range of gamma frequencies between 40 and 100 Hz. The value indicated on the comodulogram indicates the average MI in the 3-9 Hz theta range and 40-80 Hz gamma range. As in <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref></bold>, the polar plot represents the amplitude of gamma oscillations (averaged across all theta cycles) at each phase of theta (theta range: 3-9 Hz, phase indicated as angular coordinate) and for different gamma frequencies (radial coordinate, binned in 1-Hz ranges). <bold>B</bold>. Adding uniform noise to the firing rate (with an amplitude ranging between 15 and 25% of the maximum firing rate) improved the identification of the coupled frequency bands. In this case, the slower theta frequency centered around 5 Hz modulates a gamma band located between 45 and 75 Hz.</p></caption>

<p><bold>A.</bold> Two coupled neural masses (one excitatory and one inhibitory) driven by Kuramoto oscillators, which represent a dynamical oscillatory drive in the theta range, were used to implement a neural mass equivalent to our conductance-based model represented in <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>.

<p>In this article, Vardakalis et al. propose a novel model of hippocampal oscillations whereby an external input (emulating the medial septum) can drive theta rhythms. This model displays phase-amplitude coupling of gamma oscillations, as well as theta resetting, which are known features of physiological theta that have been missing in previous models. The end goal proposed by the authors is to have a framework to explore the mechanisms of neurostimulation, which have shown promising applications in pathological conditions, but for which the underlying dynamics remain largely unknown. To reach this objective, the authors implement an existing biophysical model of the hippocampus that is able to generate gamma oscillations, and receives inputs from a set of Kuramoto oscillators to emulate theta drive originating from the medial septum.</p>
<p>Overall, the hypotheses and results are clearly presented and supported by high quality figures. The study is presented in a didactic way, making it easy for a broad audience to understand the significance of the results. The study does present some weaknesses that could easily be addressed by the authors. First, there are some anatomical inaccuracies: line 129 and fig1C, the authors omit medial septum projections to area CA1 (in addition to the entorhinal cortex). Moreover, in addition to CA1, CA3 also provides monosynaptic feedback projections to the medial septum CA3. Finally, an indirect projection from CA1/3 excitatory neurons to the lateral septum, which in turn sends inhibitory projections to the medial septum could be included or mentioned by the authors. This could be of particular relevance to support claims related to effects of neurostimulations, whereby minutious implementation of anatomical data could be key. If not updating their model, the authors could add this point to their limitation section, where they already do a good job of mentioning some limitations of using the EC as a sole oscillatory input to CA1. The authors test conditions of low theta inputs, which they liken to pathological states (line 112). It is not clear what pathology the authors are referring to, especially since a large amount of 'oscillopathies' in the septohippocampal system are associated with decreased gamma/PAC, but not theta oscillations (e.g. Alzheimer's disease conditions). While relevant for the clinical field, there is overall a missed opportunity to explain many experimental accounts with this novel model. Although to this day, clinical use of DBS is mostly restricted to electrical (and thus cell-type agnostic) stimulation, recent studies focusing on mechanisms of neurostimulations have manipulated specific subtypes in the medial septum and observed effects on hippocampal oscillations (e.g. see Muller &amp; Remy, 2017 for review). Focusing stimulations in CA1 is of course relevant for clinical studies but testing mechanistic hypotheses by focusing stimulation on specific cell types could be highly informative. For instance, could the author reproduce recent optogenetic studies (e.g. Bender et al. 2015 for stimulation of fornix fibers; Etter et al., 2019 &amp; Zutshi et al. 2018 for stimulation of septal inhibitory neurons)? Cell specific manipulations should at least be discussed by the authors.</p>
<p>Beyond these weaknesses, this study has a strong utility for researchers wanting to explore hypotheses in the field of neurostimulations. In particular, I see value in such models for exploring more intricate, phase specific effects of continuous, as well as close loop stimulations which are on the rise in systems neuroscience.</p>

<p>Theta-nested gamma oscillations (TNGO) play an important role in hippocampal memory and cognitive processes and are disrupted in pathology. Deep brain stimulation has been shown to affect memory encoding. To investigate the effect of pulsed CA1 neurostimulation on hippocampal TNGO the authors coupled a physiologically realistic model of the hippocampus comprising EC, DG, CA1, and CA3 subfields with an abstract theta oscillator model of the medial septum (MS). Pathology was modeled as weakened theta input from the MS to EC simulating MS neurodegeneration known to occur in Alzheimer's disease. The authors show that if the input from the MS to EC is strong (the healthy state) the model autonomously generates TNGO in all hippocampal subfields while a single neurostimulation pulse has the effect of resetting the TNGO phase. When the MS input strength is weaker the network is quiescent but the authors find that a single CA1 neurostimulation pulse can switch it into the persistent TNGO state, provided the neurostimulation pulse is applied at the peak of the EC theta. If the MS theta oscillator model is supplemented by an additional phase-reset mechanism a single CA1 neurostimulation pulse applied at the trough of EC theta also produces the same effect. If the MS input to EC is weaker still, only a short burst of TNGO is generated by a single neurostimulation pulse. The authors investigate the physiological origin of this burst and find it results from an interplay of CAN and M currents in the CA1 excitatory cells. In this case, the authors find that TNGO can only be rescued by a theta frequency train of CA1 pulses applied at the peak of the EC theta or again at either the peak or trough if the MS oscillator model is supplemented by the phase-reset mechanism.</p>
<p>The main strength of this model is its use of a fairly physiologically detailed model of the hippocampus. The cells are single-compartment models but do include multiple ion channels and are spatially arranged in accordance with the hippocampal structure. This allows the understanding of how ion channels (possibly modifiable by pharmacological agents) interact with system-level oscillations and neurostimulation. The model also includes all the main hippocampal subfields. The other strength is its attention to an important topic, which may be relevant for dementia treatment or prevention, which few modeling studies have addressed.</p>
<p>The work has several weaknesses. First, while investigations of hippocampal neurostimulation are important there are few experimental studies from which one could judge the validity of the model findings. All its findings are therefore predictions. It would be much more convincing to first show the model is able to reproduce some measured empirical neurostimulation effect before proceeding to make predictions. Second, the model is very specific. Or if its behavior is to be considered general it has not been explained why. For example, the model shows bistability between quiescence and TNGO, however what aspect of the model underlies this, be it some particular network structure or particular ion channel, for example, is not addressed. Similarly for the various phase reset behaviors that are found. We may wonder whether a different hippocampal model of TNGO, of which there are many published (for example [1-6]) would show the same effect under neurostimulation. This seems very unlikely and indeed the quiescent state itself shown by this model seems quite artificial. Some indication that particular ion channels, CAN and M are relevant is briefly provided and the work would be much improved by examining this aspect in more detail. In summary, the work would benefit from an intuitive analysis of the basic model ingredients underlying its neurostimulation response properties. Third, while the model is fairly realistic, considerable important factors are not included and in fact, there are much more detailed hippocampal models out there (for example [5,6]). In particular, it includes only excitatory cells and a single type of inhibitory cell. This is particularly important since there are many models and experimental studies where specific cell types, for example, OLM and VIP cells, are strongly implicated in TNGO. Other missing ingredients one may think might have a strong impact on model response to neurostimulation (in particular stimulation trains) include the well-known short-term plasticity between different hippocampal cell types and active dendritic properties. Fourth the MS model seems somewhat unsupported. It is modeled as a set of coupled oscillators that synchronize. However, there is also a phase reset mechanism included. This mechanism is important because it underlies several of the phase reset behaviors shown by the full model. However, it is not derived from experimental phase response curves of septal neurons of which there is no direct measurement. The work would benefit from the use of a more biologically validated MS model.</p>

<p>We acknowledge that our current model strongly simplifies the interconnections between the medial septum and the hippocampal formation, but including more anatomical details is beyond the scope of this manuscript and would be a topic for future work. Nevertheless, we followed the reviewer’s advice to stress this point in our manuscript. First, we moved a paragraph that was initially in the “methods” section to the “results” section (L.141-150 of the revised manuscript):</p>
<p>“Biologically, GABAergic neurons from the medial septum project to the EC, CA3, and CA1 fields of the hippocampus (Toth et al., 1993; Hajós et al., 2004; Manseau et al., 2008; Hangya et al., 2009; Unal et al., 2015; Müller and Remy, 2018). Although the respective roles of these different projections are not fully understood, previous computational studies have suggested that the direct projection from the medial septum to CA1 is not essential for the production of theta in CA1 microcircuits (Mysin et al., 2019). Since our modeling of the medial septum is only used to generate a dynamic theta rhythm, we opted for a simplified representation where the medial septum projects only to the EC, which in turn drives the different fields of the hippocampus. In our model, Kuramoto oscillators are therefore connected to the EC neurons and they receive projections from CA1 neurons (see methods for more details).”</p>
<p>Second, we expanded the corresponding paragraph in the limitation section to discuss this point further (L.398-415 of the revised manuscript):</p>
<p>“We decided to model septal pacemaker neurons projecting to the EC as the main source of hippocampal theta as reported in multiple experimental studies (Buzsáki, 2002; Buzsáki et al., 2003; Hangya et al., 2009). However, experimental findings and previous models have also proposed that direct septal inputs are not essential for theta generation (Wang, 2002; Colgin et al., 2013; Mysin et al., 2019), but play an important role in phase synchronization of hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, the model does not account for the connections between the lateral and medial septum and the hippocampus (Takeuchi et al., 2021). These connections include the inhibitory projections from the lateral to the medial septum and the monosynaptic projections from the hippocampal CA3 field to the lateral septum. An experimental study has highlighted the importance of the lateral septum in regulating the hippocampal theta rhythm (Bender et al., 2015), an area that has not been included in the model. Specifically, theta-rhythmic optogenetic stimulation of the axonal projections from the lateral septum to the hippocampus was shown to entrain theta oscillations and lead to behavioral changes during exploration in transgenic mice. To account for these discrepancies, our model could be extended by considering more realistic connectivity patterns between the medial / lateral septum and the hippocampal formation, including glutamatergic, cholinergic, and GABAergic reciprocal connections (Müller and Remy, 2018), or by considering multiple sets of oscillators each representing one theta generator.”</p>

<p>1. The authors test conditions of low theta inputs, which they liken to pathological states (line 112). It is not clear what pathology the authors are referring to, especially since a large amount of 'oscillopathies' in the septohippocampal system are associated with decreased gamma/PAC, but not theta oscillations (e.g. Alzheimer's disease conditions).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the manuscript, we referred to “oscillopathies” in a broad sense way as we did not want to overstate the biological implications of the model or the way we modeled pathological states. To our knowledge, several studies have yielded inconsistent results regarding the specific changes in theta or gamma power in Alzheimer’s disease, and the most convincing alteration seems to be the theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) (for review see e.g., Kitchigina, V. F. Alterations of Coherent Theta and Gamma Network Oscillations as an Early Biomarker of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy and Alzheimer’s Disease. Front Integr Neurosci 12, 36 (2018)), as also mentioned by the reviewer.</p>
<p>In this study, the most straightforward way to reduce theta-gamma PAC was to reduce the amplitude of the oscillators’ gain, which affected theta power, gamma power, and theta-gamma PAC (Figure 5 of the revised manuscript). Affecting their synchronization level (i.e., the order parameter) did not affect any of these variables (Figure 5 – Figure Supplement 4).</p>
<p>In order to alter theta-gamma PAC without affecting theta or gamma power, we believe that more complex changes should be performed in the model, likely at the level of individual neurons in the hippocampal formation. For example, cholinergic deprivation has been previously used in a multi-compartment model of the hippocampal CA3 to mimic Alzheimer’s disease and to draw functional implications on the slowing of theta oscillations and the storage of new information (Menschik, E. D. &amp; Finkel, L. H. Neuromodulatory control of hippocampal function: towards a model of Alzheimer’s disease. Artif Intell Med 13, 99–121 (1998)).</p>
<p>This has now been added to the limitations section (L.458-465 of the revised manuscript):</p>
<p>“Finally, we likened conditions of low theta input to pathological states characteristic of oscillopathies such as Alzheimer’s disease, as these conditions disrupted all aspects of theta-gamma oscillations in our model: theta power, gamma power, and theta-gamma PAC (Figure 5). However, it should be noted that changes in theta or gamma power in these pathologies are often unclear, and that the most consistent alteration that has been reported in Alzheimer’s disease is a reduction of theta-gamma PAC (for review, see Kitchigina, 2018). Future work should explore the effects of cellular alterations intrinsic to the hippocampal formation and their impact on theta-gamma oscillations.”</p>

<p>1. While relevant for the clinical field, there is overall a missed opportunity to explain many experimental accounts with this novel model. Although to this day, clinical use of DBS is mostly restricted to electrical (and thus cell-type agnostic) stimulation, recent studies focusing on mechanisms of neurostimulations have manipulated specific subtypes in the medial septum and observed effects on hippocampal oscillations (e.g. see Muller &amp; Remy, 2017 for review).

For instance, could the author reproduce recent optogenetic studies (e.g. Bender et al. 2015 for stimulation of fornix fibers; Etter et al., 2019 &amp; Zutshi et al. 2018 for stimulation of septal inhibitory neurons)? Cell specific manipulations should at least be discussed by the authors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the importance of cell-type-specific manipulation in the septo-hippocampal circuitry. However, our model was designed to study neurostimulation protocols that affect the hippocampal formation, not the medial septum, which is why only the hippocampal formation is composed of biophysically realistic (i.e., conductance-based) neuronal models. To replicate the various studies mentioned by the reviewer (which are all very relevant), we would need to implement a biophysical model of the medial septum, which would be an entirely new project.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we can use the existing model to replicate optogenetic studies that induced gamma oscillations in excitatory-inhibitory circuits, using either ramped photostimulation targeting excitatory neurons (Adesnik et al., 2010; Akam et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2015), or pulsed stimulation driving inhibitory cells in the gamma range (Cardin et al., 2009; Iaccarino et al., 2016). In fact, such approaches have been demonstrated not just in the hippocampus but also in the neocortex, and represent a hallmark of local excitatory-inhibitory circuits. To account for these experimental results and replicate them, we have added 4 new figures (Figure 2 and its 3 figure supplements) and an extensive section in the results part (L.151-217 of the revised manuscript):</p>
<p>“From a conceptual point of view, our model is thus composed of excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) circuits connected in series, with a feedback loop going through a population of coupled phase oscillators. In the next sections, we first describe the generation of gamma oscillations by individual E-I circuits (Figure 2), and illustrate their behavior when driven by an oscillatory input such as theta oscillations (Figure 3). We then present a thorough characterization of the effects of theta input and stimulation amplitude on theta-nested gamma oscillations (Figure 4 and Figure 5). Finally, we present some results on the effects of neurostimulation protocols for restoring theta-nested gamma oscillations in pathological states (Figure 6 and Figure 7).</p>
<p>Generation of gamma oscillations by E-I circuits</p>
<p>It is well-established that a network of interconnected pyramidal neurons and interneurons can give rise to oscillations in the gamma range, a mechanism termed pyramidal-interneuronal network gamma (PING) (Traub et al., 2004; Onslow et al., 2014; Segneri et al., 2020;). This mechanism has been observed in several optogenetic studies with gradually increasing light intensity (i.e., under a ramp input) affecting multiple different circuits, such as layer 2-3 pyramidal neurons of the mouse somatosensory cortex (Adesnik et al., 2010), the CA3 field of the hippocampus in rat in vitro slices (Akam et al., 2012), and in the non-human primate motor cortex (Lu et al., 2015). In all cases, gamma oscillations emerged above a certain threshold in terms of photostimulation intensity, and the frequency of these oscillations was either stable or slightly increased when increasing the intensity further. We sought to replicate these findings with our elementary E-I circuits composed of single-compartment conductance-based neurons driven by a ramping input current (Figure 2 and Figure S2). As an example, all the results in this section will be shown for an E-I circuit that has similar connectivity parameters as the CA1 field of the hippocampus in our complete model (see section “Hippocampal formation: inputs and connectivity” in the methods).</p>
<p>For low input currents provided to both neuronal populations, only the highly-excitable interneurons were activated (Figure 2A). For a sufficiently high input current (i.e., a strong input that could overcome the inhibition from the fast-spiking interneurons), the pyramidal neurons started spiking as well. As the amplitude of the input increased, the activity of the both neuronal populations became synchronized in the gamma range, asymptotically reaching a frequency of about 60 Hz (Figure 2A bottom panel). Decoupling the populations led to the abolition of gamma oscillations (Figure 2B), as neuronal activity was determined solely by the intrinsic properties of each cell. Interestingly, when the ramp input was provided solely to the excitatory population, we observed that the activity of the pyramidal neurons preceded the activity of the inhibitory neurons, while still preserving the emergence of gamma oscillations (Figure S2 A). As expected, decoupling the populations also abolished gamma oscillations, with the excitatory neurons spiking a frequency determined by their intrinsic properties and the inhibitory population remaining silent (Figure S2B).</p>
<p>To further characterize the intrinsic properties of individual inhibitory and excitatory neurons, we derived their input-frequency (I-F) curves, which represent the firing rate of individual neurons in response to a tonic input (Figure S3A). We observed that for certain input amplitudes, the firing rates of both types of neurons was within the gamma range. Interestingly, in the absence of noise, each population could generate by itself gamma oscillations that were purely driven by the input and determined by the intrinsic properties of the neurons (Figure S3B). Adding stochastic Gaussian noise in the membrane potential disrupted these artificial oscillations in decoupled populations (Figure S3C). All subsequent simulations were run with similar noise levels to prevent the emergence of artificial gamma oscillations.</p>
<p>Another potent way to induce gamma oscillations is to drive fast-spiking inhibitory neurons using pulsed optogenetic stimulation at gamma frequencies, a strategy that has been used both in the neocortex (Cardin et al., 2009) and hippocampal CA1 (Iaccarino et al., 2016). In particular, Cardin and colleagues systematically investigated the effect of driving either excitatory or fast-spiking inhibitory neocortical neurons at frequencies between 10 and 200 Hz (Cardin et al., 2009). They showed that fast-spiking interneurons are preferentially entrained around 40-50 Hz, while excitatory neurons respond better to lower frequencies.  To verify the behavior of our model against these experimental data, we simulated pulsed optogenetic stimulation as an intracellular current provided to our reduced model of a single E-I circuit. Stimulation was applied at frequencies between 10 and 200 Hz to excitatory cells only, to inhibitory cells only, or to both at the same time (Figure S4). The population firing rates were used as a proxy for the local field potentials (LFP), and we computed the relative power in a 10-Hz band centered around the stimulation frequency, similarly to the method proposed in (Cardin et al., 2009). When presented with continuous stimulation across a range of frequencies in the gamma range, interneurons showed the greatest degree of gamma power modulation (Figure S4). Furthermore, when the stimulation was delivered to the excitatory population, the relative power around the stimulation frequency dropped significantly in frequencies above 10 Hz, similar to the reported experimental data (Cardin et al., 2009). The main difference between our simulation results and these experimental data is the specific frequencies at which fast-spiking interneurons showed resonance, which was slow gamma around 40 Hz in the mouse barrel cortex and fast gamma around 90 Hz in our model. This could be attributed to several factors, such as differences in the cellular properties between cortical and hippocampal fast-spiking interneurons, or the differences between the size of the populations and their relevant connectivity in the cortex and the hippocampus.”</p>

<p>Emergence of gamma oscillations in coupled excitatory-inhibitory populations under ramping input to both populations. A. Two coupled populations of excitatory pyramidal neurons (NE = 1000) and inhibitory interneurons (NI = 100) are driven by a ramping current input (0 nA to 1 nA) for 5 s. As the input becomes stronger, oscillations start to emerge (shaded green area), driven by the interactions between excitatory and inhibitory populations. The green inset shows the raster plot (neuronal spikes across time) of the two populations during the green shaded period (red for inhibitory; blue for excitatory). When the input becomes sufficiently strong (shaded magenta area), the populations become highly synchronized and produce oscillations in the gamma range (at approximately 50 Hz). The spectrogram (bottom panel) shows the power of the instantaneous firing rate of the pyramidal population as a function of time and frequency. It reveals the presence of gamma oscillations that emerge around 2s and increase in frequency until 4 s, when they settle at approximately 60 Hz. B. Similar depiction as in panel A. with the pyramidal-interneuronal populations decoupled. The absence of coupling leads to the abolition of gamma oscillations, each cell spiking activity being driven by its own inputs and intrinsic properties.</p>

<p>Line 144, the authors mention that their MI values are erroneous in absence of additive noise - could this be due to the non-sinusoidal nature of the phase signal recorded, and be fixed by upscaling model size?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this question and suggestion. The main reason behind the errors in the computation of the MI lies in the complete absence of oscillations at specific frequencies. Filtered signals within specific bands produced a power of 0 (or extremely low values), as seen in the power spectral densities. In such cases, the phase signal was not mathematically defined, but the toolbox we used to compute it still returned a numerical result that was inaccurate (for more details on the computation of the MI see Tort et al., 2010). To mitigate this numerical artefact, we decided to add uniform noise in the computed firing rates. This strategy is illustrated on Figure S6 (Figure 3 – Figure Supplement 2), which we have copied below for reference. Alternative approaches could probably have been used, such as increasing the noise in the membrane potential so that neurons would start spiking with firing rates that show more realistic power spectra, even in the absence of external inputs.</p>

<p>Quantification of PAC with and without noise. A. Quantifying PAC in the absence of noise produced inaccurate identification of the coupled frequency bands, due to the complete absence of oscillations at some frequencies. All analyses are based on the CA1 firing rates (top traces) during a representative simulation. Power spectral densities of these firing rates (left) indicate that some frequencies have a power of 0. PAC of the excitatory population was assessed using two graphical representations, the polar plot (middle) and comodulogram (right), and quantified using the MI. The comodulogram was calculated by computing the MI across 80% overlapping 1-Hz frequency bands in the theta range and across 90% overlapping 10-Hz frequency bands in the gamma range and subsequently plotted as a heat map. In the absence of noise, a slow theta frequency centered around 5 Hz is found to modulate a broad range of gamma frequencies between 40 and 100 Hz. The value indicated on the comodulogram indicates the average MI in the 3-9 Hz theta range and 40-80 Hz gamma range. As in Figure 2, the polar plot represents the amplitude of gamma oscillations (averaged across all theta cycles) at each phase of theta (theta range: 3-9 Hz, phase indicated as angular coordinate) and for different gamma frequencies (radial coordinate, binned in 1-Hz ranges). B. Adding uniform noise to the firing rate (with an amplitude ranging between 15 and 25% of the maximum firing rate) improved the identification of the coupled frequency bands. In this case, the slower theta frequency centered around 5 Hz modulates a gamma band located between 45 and 75 Hz.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p>
<p>The main strength of this model is its use of a fairly physiologically detailed model of the hippocampus. The cells are single-compartment models but do include multiple ion channels and are spatially arranged in accordance with the hippocampal structure. This allows the understanding of how ion channels (possibly modifiable by pharmacological agents) interact with system-level oscillations and neurostimulation. The model also includes all the main hippocampal subfields. The other strength is its attention to an important topic, which may be relevant for dementia treatment or prevention, which few modeling studies have addressed. The work has several weaknesses.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for appreciating our detailed description of the hippocampal formation and the focus on neurostimulation applications that aim at treating oscillopathies, especially dementia.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. First, while investigations of hippocampal neurostimulation are important there are few experimental studies from which one could judge the validity of the model findings. All its findings are therefore predictions. It would be much more convincing to first show the model is able to reproduce some measured empirical neurostimulation effect before proceeding to make predictions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge that the results presented in Figures 4-7 of the revised manuscript cannot be compared to existing experimental data, and are therefore purely predictive. Future experimental work is needed to verify these predictions.</p>
<p>Yet, we would also like to stress that the motivation behind this project was the inadequacy of previous models of theta-nested gamma oscillations (Onslow et al., 2014; Aussel et al., 2018; Segneri et al., 2020) to account for the mechanism of theta phase reset that occurs during electrical stimulation of the fornix or perforant path (Williams and Givens, 2003). Since we could not use these previous models to study the effects of neurostimulation on theta-nested gamma oscillations, we had to modify them to account for a dynamical theta input, which is the main methodological novelty that is reported in our manuscript (Figures 1 and 3 of the revised manuscript).</p>
<p>Despite the scarcity of experimental studies that could confirm the full model, we sought to replicate a few experimental findings that employed optogenetic stimulation to induce gamma oscillations in individual excitatory-inhibitory circuits. Although not specific to the hippocampus, these studies have shown that gamma oscillations can be induced using either ramped photostimulation targeting excitatory neurons (Adesnik et al., 2010; Akam et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2015), or pulsed stimulation driving inhibitory cells in the gamma range (Cardin et al., 2009; Iaccarino et al., 2016). To account for these experimental results and replicate them, we have added 4 new figures (Figure 2 and its 3 figure supplements) and an extensive section in the results part (L.141-217 of the revised manuscript). The added section and related figures are indicated in our response to reviewer 1, comment 3 (p 2-7).</p>

<p>2.1. Second, the model is very specific. Or if its behavior is to be considered general it has not been explained why.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Although the spatial organization and cellular details of the model are indeed very specific, its general behavior, i.e., the production of theta-nested gamma oscillations and theta phase reset, are common to any excitatory-inhibitory circuit interconnected with Kuramoto oscillators. To illustrate this point, we have generalized our approach to the neural mass model developed by Onslow and colleagues (Onslow ACE, Jones MW, Bogacz R. A Canonical Circuit for Generating Phase-Amplitude Coupling. PLoS ONE. 2014 Aug; 9(8):e102591). These results are represented in a new supplementary figure (Figure3 – Figure Supplement 4), and briefly described in a new paragraph of the results section (L.262-268 of the revised manuscript):</p>
<p>“Importantly, our approach is generalizable and can be applied to other models producing theta-nested gamma oscillations. For instance, we adapted the neural mass model by Onslow and colleagues (Onslow et al., 2014), replaced the fixed theta input by a set of Kuramoto oscillators, and demonstrated that it could also generate theta phase reset in response to single-pulse stimulation (Figure S8). These results illustrate that the general behavior of our model is not specific to the tuning of individual parameters in the conductancebased neurons, but follows general rules that are captured by the level of abstraction of the Kuramoto formalism.”</p>

<p>A neural mass model of coupled excitatory and inhibitory neurons driven by Kuramoto oscillators generates theta-nested gamma oscillations and theta phase reset. A. Two coupled neural masses (one excitatory and one inhibitory) driven by Kuramoto oscillators, which represent a dynamical oscillatory drive in the theta range, were used to implement a neural mass equivalent to our conductance-based model represented in Figure 1. Neural masses were modeled using the WilsonCowan formalism, with parameters adapted from Onslow et al. (2014) (𝑊𝐸𝐸 = 4.8, 𝑊𝐸𝐼 = 𝑊𝐼𝐸 = 4, 𝑊𝐼𝐼 = 0). B. The normalized population firing rates exhibit theta-nested gamma oscillations (middle and bottom panels) in response to the dynamic theta rhythm (top panel). A stimulation pulse delivered at the descending phase of the rhythm to both populations (marked by the inverted red triangle) produces a robust theta phase reset, similarly to Figure 3A.</p>

<p>This simplified model is described in more details in the methods (L.694-710 of the revised manuscript). Additionally, the generation of gamma oscillations by individual excitatory-inhibitory circuits is now described in details in the added section “Generation of gamma oscillations by E-I circuits” (L.159-217 of the revised manuscript), which has already been discussed in our response to reviewer 1, comment 3 (p 2-7).</p>

<p>2.2. For example, the model shows bistability between quiescence and TNGO, however what aspect of the model underlies this, be it some particular network structure or particular ion channel, for example, is not addressed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for mentioning this point, which we have now addressed. The “bistable” behavior that we reported occurs for values of the theta input that are just below the threshold to induce selfsustained theta-gamma oscillations (Figure 5 of the revised manuscript, point B).  Moreover, the presence of the Calcium-Activated-Nonspecific (CAN) cationic channel, which is expressed by pyramidal neurons in the entorhinal cortex, CA3, and CA1 fields of the hippocampus, is necessary for this behavior to occur. Indeed, abolishing CAN channels in all areas of the model suppresses this behavior. We have now addressed this point in a new supplementary figure (Figure 5 – Figure Supplement 4) and a short description in the text (L.287-303 of the revised manuscript).</p>
<p>“In the presence of dynamic theta input, the effects of single-pulse stimulation depended both on theta input amplitude and stimulation amplitude, highlighting different regimes of network activity (Figure 5 and Figure S9, Figure S10, Figure S11). For low theta input, theta-nested gamma oscillations were initially absent and could not be induced by stimulation (Figure 5A). At most, the stimulation could only elicit a few bursts of spiking activity that faded away after approximately 250 ms, similar to the rebound of activity seen in the absence of theta drive. For increasing theta input, the network switched to an intermediate regime: upon initialization at a state with no spiking activity, it could be kicked to a state with self-sustained theta-nested gamma oscillations by a single stimulation pulse of sufficiently high amplitude (Figure 5B). This regime existed for a range of septal theta inputs located just below the threshold to induce self-sustained theta-gamma oscillations without additional stimulation, as characterized by the post-stimulation theta power, gamma power, and theta-gamma PAC (Figure 5D). Removing CAN currents from all areas of the model abolished this behavior (Figure S12), which is interesting given the role of this current in the multistability of EC neurons (Egorov et al., 2002; Fransen et al., 2006) and in the intrinsic ability of the hippocampus to generate thetanested gamma oscillations (Giovannini et al., 2017). For the highest theta input, the network became able to spontaneously generate theta-nested gamma oscillations, even when initialized at a state with no spiking activity and without additional neurostimulation (Figure 5C).”</p>

<p>Furthermore, we realized that the terminology “bistable” may not be justified as we could not perform a systematic bifurcation analysis, which is typically carried out in simpler neural mass models (e.g., Onslow et al., 2014; Segneri et al., 2020). Therefore, we decided to rephrase the sentences about “bistability” to keep a more general terminology. The following sentences were revised:</p>
<p>L.20-23: “We showed that, for theta inputs just below the threshold to induce self-sustained theta-nested gamma oscillations, a single stimulation pulse could switch the network behavior from non-oscillatory to a state producing sustained oscillations.”</p>
<p>L.305-309: “Based on the above analyses, we considered two pathological states: one with a moderate theta input (i.e., moderately weak projections from the medial septum to the EC) that allowed the initiation of selfsustained oscillations by single stimulation pulses (Figure 5, point B), and one with a weaker theta input characterized by the complete absence of self-sustained oscillations even following transient stimulation
(Figure 5, point A).”</p>
<p>L.316-317: “In the case of a moderate theta input and in the presence of phase reset, delivering a pulse at either the peak or trough of theta could induce theta-nested gamma oscillations (Figure 6A and 6C).”</p>
<p>L.353-357: “A very interesting finding concerns the behavior of the model in response to single-pulse stimulation for certain values of the theta amplitude (Figure5). For low theta amplitudes, a single stimulation pulse was capable of switching the network behavior from a state with no spiking activity to one with prominent theta-nested gamma oscillations. Whether such an effect can be induced in vivo in the context of memory processes remains an open question.”</p>

<p>2.3. Similarly for the various phase reset behaviors that are found.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to clarify the fact that the observed phase reset curves (reported in Figure 3D) are a direct consequence of the choice of an appropriate phase response function for the Kuramoto oscillators representing the medial septum. This choice is inspired by experimentally measured phase response curves from CA3 neurons. These aspects are described briefly in the introduction and in more details in the methods, as indicated below:</p>
<p>L.101: “This new hybrid dynamical model could generate both theta-nested gamma oscillations and theta phase reset, following a particular phase response curve (PRC) inspired by experimental literature (Lengyel et al., 2005; Akam et al., 2012; Torben-Nielsen et al., 2010).”</p>
<p>L.528-537: “Hereafter, we call the term 𝑍(𝜃) the phase response function, to distinguish it from the PRC obtained from experimental data or simulations (see section below &quot;Data Analysis&quot;, &quot;Phase Response Curve&quot;). Briefly, the PRC of an oscillatory system indicates the phase delay or advancement that follows a single pulse, as a function of the phase at which this input is delivered. The phase response function 𝑍(𝜃) was chosen to mimic as well as possible experimental PRCs reported in the literature (Lengyel et al., 2005; Kwag and Paulsen, 2009; Akam et al., 2012). These PRCs appear biphasic and show a phase advancement (respectively delay) for stimuli delivered in the ascending (respectively descending) slope of theta. To accurately model this behavior, we used the following equation for the phase response function, where 𝜃𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘 represents the phase at which the theta rhythm reaches its maximum and the parameter 𝜙𝑜𝑓𝑓𝑠𝑒𝑡 controls the desired phase offset from the peak:</p>

</fig>
<p>Finally, we would like to acknowledge that the model “is not derived from experimental phase response curves of septal neurons of which there is no direct measurement”, as mentioned by the reviewer in their comment 4 below. Despite the lack of experimental data specific to medial septum neurons, we argue that this phase response function is the only one that mathematically supports the generation of self-sustained theta-nested gamma oscillations in our current model. This statement is illustrated by Figure S7 (Figure 3 – Figure Supplement 3) and is mentioned in the results (L.249-261 of the revised manuscript):</p>
<p>We modeled this behavior by a specific term (which we called the phase response function) in the general equation of the Kuramoto oscillators (see methods, Equation 1). Importantly, introducing a phase offset in the phase response function disrupted theta-nested gamma oscillations (Figure S7), which suggests that the septohippocampal circuitry must be critically tuned to be able to generate such oscillations. The strength of phase reset could also be adjusted by a gain that was manually tuned. In the presence of the physiological phase response function and of a sufficiently high reset gain, a single stimulation pulse delivered to all excitatory and inhibitory CA1 neurons could reset the phase of theta to a value close to its peaks (Figure 3A). We computed the PRC of our simulated data for different stimulation amplitudes and validated that our neuronal network behaved according to the phase response function set in our Kuramoto oscillators (Figure 3D). It should be noted that including this phase reset mechanism affected the generated theta rhythm even in the absence of stimulation, extending the duration of the theta peak and thereby slowing down the frequency of the generated theta rhythm.</p>

Each panel is similar to Figure 3A, but with a different offset added to the phase response function of the Kuramoto oscillators (see methods, Equation 4). The center frequency was set to 6 Hz in all of these simulations. Overall, theta oscillations in these cases are less sinusoidal and show more abrupt phase changes than in the physiological case. A. A phase offset of −𝜋∕2 leads to an overall theta oscillation of 4 Hz, with a second peak following the main theta peak. B. A phase offset of +𝜋∕2 reduces the peak of theta, resetting the rhythm to the middle of the ascending phase. C. A phase offset of 𝜋 or -𝜋 leads to the CA1 output resetting the theta rhythm to the trough of theta.</p>

<p>The highlighted publications, while very important in their findings regarding theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling, focused on specific subfields of the hippocampus. In our work, we aimed to develop a model that includes the different anatomical divisions of the hippocampal formation, while still exhibiting theta-nested gamma oscillations, which is why we decided to expand the model by Aussel et al. (2018). Exploring the behavior of all these different hippocampal models under neurostimulation is beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we have added a new figure (Figure 3 – Figure Supplement 4) showing an adaptation of our modeling approach to a generic neural mass model of theta-nested gamma oscillations (Onslow et al., 2014), which illustrates the generalizability of our findings and is described in details in our response to comment 2.1. Moreover, we have further addressed the comments of the reviewers regarding bistability and phase response curves in our responses to comments 2.2 and 2.3.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have added references to all 6 of these publications in the revised version of the manuscript:</p>
<p>L.43-50: Moreover, the modulation of gamma oscillations by the phase of theta oscillations in hippocampal circuits, a phenomenon termed theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), correlates with the efficacy of memory encoding and retrieval (Jensen and Colgin, 2007; Tort et al., 2009; Canolty and Knight, 2010; Axmacher et al., 2010; Fell and Axmacher, 2011; Lisman and Jensen, 2013; Lega et al., 2016). Experimental and computational work on the coupling between oscillatory rhythms has indicated that it originates from different neural architectures and correlates with a range of behavioral and cognitive functions, enabling the long-range synchronization of cortical areas and facilitating multi-item encoding in the context of memory (Hyafil et al., 2015).&quot;</p>
<p>L.415-426: “In terms of neuronal cell types, we also made an important simplification by considering only basket cells as the main class of inhibitory interneuron in the whole hippocampal formation. However, it should be noted that many other types of interneurons exist in the hippocampus and have been modeled in various works with higher computational complexity (e.g., Bezaire et al., 2016; Chatzikalymniou et al., 2021). Among these various interneurons, oriens-lacunosum moleculare (OLM) neurons in the CA1 field have been shown to play a crucial role in synchronizing the activity of pyramidal neurons at gamma frequencies (Tort et al., 2007), and in generating theta-gamma PAC (e.g., Neymotin et al., 2011; Ponzi et al., 2023). Additionally, these cells may contribute to the formation of specific phase relationships within CA1 neuronal populations, through the integration between inputs from the medial septum, the EC, and CA3 (Mysin et al., 2019). Future work is needed to include more diverse cell types and detailed morphologies modeled through multiple compartments.”</p>

<p>2.5. […] and indeed the quiescent state itself shown by this model seems quite artificial.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to clarify the fact that the “quiescent state” mentioned by the reviewer is a simply a state where the theta input is too low to induce theta-nested gamma oscillations. In this regime, neurons are active only due to the noise term in the membrane potential, which was adjusted based on Figure S3 (Figure 2 – Figure Supplement 2, shown below), at the minimal level needed to disrupt artificial synchronization in decoupled populations. For an input of 0 nA, we acknowledge that this network is indeed fully quiescent (i.e., does not show any spiking activity). However, as soon as the input increases, spontaneous spiking activity starts to appear with an average firing rate that depends on the input amplitude and is characterized by the input-frequency curves (panel A.). Please note that adding more noise could eliminate the observed quiescence in the absence of any input, but that it would not affect qualitatively the reported results.</p>

<p>2.7. In summary, the work would benefit from an intuitive analysis of the basic model ingredients underlying its neurostimulation response properties.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. By addressing the reviewer’s previous comments (reviewer 2, comments 2.1 and 2.2), which overlap partly with the first reviewer (reviewer 1, comment 3), we believe we have improved the manuscript and have provided key information related to the way the model responds to neurostimulation.</p>

<p>3..) Third, while the model is fairly realistic, considerable important factors are not included and in fact, there are much more detailed hippocampal models out there (for example [5,6]). In particular, it includes only excitatory cells and a single type of inhibitory cell. This is particularly important since there are many models and experimental studies where specific cell types, for example, OLM and VIP cells, are strongly implicated in TNGO.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out these interesting avenues for future studies. As indicated in previous responses (reviewer 1, comment 1; reviewer 2, comment 2.4), we have added several paragraphs to discuss these limitations, the rationale behind our simplifications, and potential improvements. In particular, we have added the following paragraphs to discuss our simplifications in terms of connectivity and cell types:</p>
<p>Anatomical connectivity:</p>
<p>L.141-150: “Biologically, GABAergic neurons from the medial septum project to the EC, CA3, and CA1 fields of the hippocampus (Toth et al., 1993; Hajós et al., 2004; Manseau et al., 2008; Hangya et al., 2009; Unal et al., 2015; Müller and Remy, 2018). Although the respective roles of these different projections are not fully understood, previous computational studies have suggested that the direct projection from the medial septum to CA1 is not essential for the production of theta in CA1 microcircuits (Mysin et al., 2019). Since our modeling of the medial septum is only used to generate a dynamic theta rhythm, we opted for a simplified representation where the medial septum projects only to the EC, which in turn drives the different subfields of the hippocampus. In our model, Kuramoto oscillators are therefore connected to the EC neurons and they receive projections from CA1 neurons (see methods for more details).”</p>
<p>Cell types:</p>
<p>L.415-426: “In terms of neuronal cell types, we also made an important simplification by considering only basket cells as the main class of inhibitory interneuron in the whole hippocampal formation. However, it should be noted that many other types of interneurons exist in the hippocampus and have been modeled in various works with higher computational complexity (e.g., Bezaire et al., 2016; Chatzikalymniou et al., 2021). Among these various interneurons, oriens-lacunosum moleculare (OLM) neurons in the CA1 field have been shown to play a crucial role in synchronizing the activity of pyramidal neurons at gamma frequencies (Tort et al., 2007), and in generating theta-gamma PAC (e.g., Neymotin et al., 2011; Ponzi et al., 2023). Additionally, these cells may contribute to the formation of specific phase relationships within CA1 neuronal populations, through the integration between inputs from the medial septum, the EC, and CA3 (Mysin et al., 2019). Future work is needed to include more diverse cell types and detailed morphologies modeled through multiple compartments.”</p>

<p>3.2. Other missing ingredients one may think might have a strong impact on model response to neurostimulation (in particular stimulation trains) include the well-known short-term plasticity between different hippocampal cell types and active dendritic properties.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that plasticity mechanisms are important to include in future work, which we had already mentioned in the limitations section of the manuscript:</p>
<p>L.436-443: “Importantly, we did not consider learning through synaptic plasticity, even though such mechanisms could drastically modify synaptic conduction for the whole network (Borges et al., 2017). Even more interestingly, the inclusion of spike-timing-dependent plasticity would enable the investigation of stimulation protocols aimed at promoting LTP, such as theta-burst stimulation (Larson et al., 2015). This aspect would be of uttermost importance to make a link with memory encoding and retrieval processes (Axmacher et al., 2006; Tsanov et al., 2009; Jutras et al., 2013) and with neurostimulation studies for memory improvement (Titiz et al., 2017; Solomon et al., 2021).”</p>

<p>1. Fourth the MS model seems somewhat unsupported. It is modeled as a set of coupled oscillators that synchronize. However, there is also a phase reset mechanism included. This mechanism is important because it underlies several of the phase reset behaviors shown by the full model. However, it is not derived from experimental phase response curves of septal neurons of which there is no direct measurement. The work would benefit from the use of a more biologically validated MS model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to confirm that the phase reset mechanism is indeed at the core of using Kuramoto oscillators to model a particular system. For more details about our choice of a phase response function and the obtained results in terms of phase response curves, we refer the reader to our response to comment 2.3.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, we chose to use Kuramoto oscillators as it is the simplest model that can provide an oscillatory input to another system while including a phase reset mechanism. This set of oscillators was used to replace the fixed sinusoidal wave that represented theta inputs in previous models (Onslow et al., 2014; Aussel et al., 2018; Segneri et al., 2020). Kuramoto oscillators are a well-established model of synchronization in various fields of physics. They have also been used in neuroscience to model the phase reset of collective rhythms (Levnajić et al. 2010), and the effects of DBS on the basal ganglia network in Parkinson’s disease (Tass et al. 2003, Ebert et al. 2014, Weerasinghe et al. 2019).</p>
<p>More detailed models of the medial septum exist in the literature (e.g., Wang et al. 2002, Hajós et al. 2004) and model the GABAergic effects of the septal projections onto the hippocampal formation. However, it is not trivial to infer the connectivity parameters and the degree of innervation between the hippocampus and the medial septum. Furthermore, the claims made in our study do not necessarily depend on the nature of the projections between the two areas. Therefore, we decided to represent the medial septum in a conceptual way and focus mostly on the effects of these projections rather than replicating them in detail.</p>
