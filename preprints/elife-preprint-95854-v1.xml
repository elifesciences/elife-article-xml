<title>Abstract</title><p>Skeletal muscles connect bones and tendons for locomotion and posture. Understanding the regenerative processes of muscle, bone and tendon is of importance to basic research and clinical applications. Despite their interconnections, distinct transcription factors have been reported to orchestrate each tissue’s developmental and regenerative processes. Here we show that <italic>Scx</italic> expression is not detectable in adult muscle stem cells (also known as satellite cells, SCs) during quiescence. <italic>Scx</italic> expression begins in activated SCs and continues throughout regenerative myogenesis after injury. By SC-specific <italic>Scx</italic> gene inactivation (ScxcKO), we show that <italic>Scx</italic> function is required for SC expansion/renewal and robust new myofiber formation after injury. We combined single-cell RNA-sequencing and CUT&amp;RUN to identify direct Scx target genes during muscle regeneration. These target genes help explain the muscle regeneration defects of ScxcKO, and are not overlapping with <italic>Scx</italic>-target genes identified in tendon development. Together with a recent finding of a subpopulation of <italic>Scx</italic>-expressing connective tissue fibroblasts with myogenic potential during early embryogenesis, we propose that regenerative and developmental myogenesis co-opt the <italic>Scx</italic> gene via different mechanisms.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Regeneration of adult skeletal muscles following injury is initiated by the activation and proliferation of satellite cells (SCs). After extensive proliferation, progenitors undergo differentiation and fusion with each other or existing myofibers to recreate functional muscle tissue(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Yin, Price et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Liu, Nelson et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fukada, Higashimoto et al. 2022</xref>). The intrinsic and extrinsic factors regulating myogenesis have been extensively investigated. The key transcription factors governing this process are largely the same as those deployed during embryogenesis, including paired-homeodomain proteins Pax3 and Pax7, basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) such as Myf5 and MyoD1, and the myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) family; however, their relative contribution or redundancy vary between the two processes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hernandez-Hernandez, Garcia-Gonzalez et al. 2017</xref>). To date, resident Pax7<sup>+</sup> SCs are recognized as the major source of muscle stem cells in adult limb muscles. None of these myogenic transcription factors are known to participate in tendon development or regeneration.</p>
<p>Both muscle and tendon progenitors reside in the somite during embryonic development but are located in different compartments. <italic>Pax3</italic> and <italic>Pax7</italic> are expressed in the dermomyotome, which gives rise to the myotome expressing <italic>Myf5</italic> and/or <italic>MyoD1</italic>. The syndetome, on the other hand, is defined by the expression of the earliest tenogenic progenitor marker <italic>Scx</italic>, and gives rise to tendon and ligament(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Brent, Schweitzer et al. 2003</xref>). Like Myf5 and MyoD1, Scx is a bHLH transcription factor, and they all bind to a DNA sequence motif called the E-box(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cserjesi 1995</xref>). <italic>Scx</italic> expression persists in mature tenocytes, ligaments, and connective tissue fibroblasts (CT)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Murchison, Price et al. 2007</xref>). <italic>Scx</italic> mutant mice have poorly developed tendons with drastically reduced expression of tendon matrix genes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Murchison, Price et al. 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yoshimoto, Takimoto et al. 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Shukunami, Takimoto et al. 2018</xref>). In adult tendon regeneration, the Tppp3<sup>+</sup>Pdgfra<sup>+</sup> tendon stem cell population turn on <italic>Scx</italic> for tendon regeneration(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Harvey, Flamenco et al. 2019</xref>). Lastly, <italic>Scx</italic> function is required in post-natal tendon growth and regeneration(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Howell, Chien et al. 2017</xref>, Sakabe, Sakai et al. 2018, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gumucio, Schonk et al. 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Korcari, Muscat et al. 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Intriguingly, lineage tracing using a constitutive <italic>Scx<sup>Cre</sup></italic> in mouse embryos found descendant cells in cartilage, tendon, ligament, muscle, and muscle interstitial CT(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yoshimoto, Takimoto et al. 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Esteves de Lima, Blavet et al. 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ono, Schlesinger et al. 2023</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Scx</italic> is expressed either in several distinct musculoskeletal subpopulations, or in a common progenitor that gives rise to different fates. Ablation of embryonic Scx<sup>+</sup> cells cause a change in muscle bundling(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ono, Schlesinger et al. 2023</xref>), presumably due to the loss of instructive cues from the tendon (or CT) to form proper muscle pattern(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kardon 1998</xref>). In adult muscles, Hic1<sup>+</sup> quiescent mesenchymal progenitors (MPs) give rise to Scx<sup>+</sup> cells in the muscle interstitial compartment, and ablation of Hic1<sup>+</sup> cells negatively impacts muscle regeneration(Scott, Arostegui et al. 2019). Muscle interstitial Scx<sup>+</sup> cells engrafted into the muscle contribute only to extracellular matrix remodeling(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Giordani, He et al. 2019</xref>). A survey of muscle interstitial CT assigned a sub-population of cells expressing tendon markers (including <italic>Scx</italic>) as paramysial cells - cells lining next to the perimysium that wraps around muscle fascicles(Muhl, Genove et al. 2020). Furthermore, Strenzke and colleagues showed that secretome from Scx overexpressed cells could significantly increase myoblast fusion and metabolic activity <italic>in vitro</italic>(Strenzke, Alberton et al. 2020). Collectively, these data indicate that while some embryonic Scx<sup>+</sup> cells can incorporate into myofibers, adult Scx<sup>+</sup> cells contribute to skeletal muscle architecture and repair/regenerative process in a paracrine manner.</p>
<p>Serendipitously, in the ScxGFP transgenic mouse Tg-ScxGFP(Pryce, Brent et al. 2007), we observed GFP fluorescence in SCs and regenerating myofibers after injury. We conducted a series of experiments to show that endogenous <italic>Scx</italic> is expressed in activated SC after injury. We show that <italic>Scx</italic> is functionally relevant in muscle regeneration by inactivating <italic>Scx</italic> in <italic>Pax7<sup>+</sup></italic> SCs (ScxcKO).We employed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and CUT&amp;RUN to define Scx’s target genes during muscle differentiation and fusion. Down-regulation of Scx’s target genes such as <italic>Mef2a</italic>, <italic>Cflar</italic>, <italic>Capn2</italic>, and <italic>Myh9,</italic> explains the regenerative defects of ScxcKO mice. In contrast to adult Scx<sup>+</sup> muscle CT and embryonic muscle-forming Scx<sup>+</sup> cells, our findings reveal a previously unappreciated role of <italic>Scx</italic> in adult Pax7<sup>+</sup> SCs.</p>

<title>ScxGFP transgene is expressed in the regenerative myogenic lineage</title>
<p>When we analyzed tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of the Tg-ScxGFP (ScxGFP) mice, scattered GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were found in the interstitial space, but not in quiescent Pax7<sup>+</sup> SCs nor in myofibers (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>). Unexpectedly, we found GFP signal in injured muscles. In cardiotoxin (CTX) injured TA muscles of ScxGFP mice at 5 days post-injury (dpi) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1A</xref>), we found GFP colocalized with Pax7<sup>+</sup> SCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1B</xref>). GFP also overlaps with committed myogenic progenitor marker MyoD1, myocyte marker Myogenin (Myog), and myosin heavy chain (MHC) in terminally differentiated myofibers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B-D</xref> for split channels). When we analyzed muscles administered with 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) for 5 days after CTX injury (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), GFP was found to colocalize with proliferated (EdU<sup>+</sup>) Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Thus, ScxGFP is expressed, albeit at varying levels, in the myogenic lineage during regenerative process.</p>

Tg-ScxGFP (ScxGFP) mice were injured by CTX to the TA muscle, followed by daily EdU administration for 5 days (5d), and their TA muscles were harvested for analysis at 5d post-injury (dpi). B. Muscle samples obtained in (A) were sectioned and stained with Pax7 and GFP (for ScxGFP expression) antibody. Arrows indicate Pax7 and ScxGFP double positive cells; 97.77% Pax7<sup>+</sup> SCs were ScxGFP<sup>+</sup> (N = 4 mice; n = 1274 cells). C. Muscle samples obtained in (A) were sectioned and stained in pairs of GFP/Pax7, GFP/MyoD1, GFP/MyoG (N = 4 mice). Asterisks indicate cells double-positive for ScxGFP and each respective myogenic marker. D. Muscle samples obtained in (A) were sectioned and stained for Pax7 and GFP, followed by EdU reaction (N = 4 mice). Arrows indicate Pax7, ScxGFP, and EdU triple-positive SCs. E. Experimental scheme of SC isolation from Tg-ScxGFP hindlimb muscles using four surface markers (CD31<sup>-</sup>, CD45<sup>-</sup>, Sca1<sup>-</sup>, Vcam1<sup>+</sup>) by FACS. Isolated SCs were assayed immediately after isolation (D0; data in (F)), after culture in growth media for 2d (D2(GM); data in (G)), or after cultured for 4d in GM followed by 2d in differentiation media (DM) (D6(DM); data in (H)). F, G. D0 (F) and D2 cultured (G) SCs obtained in (E) were stained with for GFP (i.e. ScxGFP), Pax7, and MyoD. At D0, no Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells were GFP<sup>+</sup> or MyoD<sup>+</sup>. At D2, 95.3% of Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells were GFP<sup>+</sup>, whereas 99.2% of MyoD<sup>+</sup> were GFP<sup>+</sup>. (N = 3 mice; n = 1805 cells at D0; n = 1332 cells at D2). H. D6(DM) cells obtained in (E) were stained for GFP (i.e. ScxGFP) and MHC. 94.58% MHC<sup>+</sup> were GFP<sup>+</sup>. (N= 3 mice; n = 1539 nuclei in MHC<sup>+</sup> domain examined). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue); Scale bars = 20 μm.</p></caption>

<p>We next determined ScxGFP expression in cultured SCs. For this, we employed a four-surface marker fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) scheme (Sca1<sup>-</sup>CD31<sup>-</sup>CD45<sup>-</sup>Vcam1<sup>+</sup>)(Liu, Cheung et al. 2015) to purify SCs from hindlimb muscles of ScxGFP mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>; S1E, F); ∼ 98% of isolated cells were Pax7<sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1G, H</xref>). While Pax7 was detected in the SC immediately after FACS isolation, neither MyoD nor GFP was detected (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). After two days in culture, most cells were Pax7, MyoD and GFP triple positive (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). After switched to differentiation media for 2 days, GFP signal persisted in MHC<sup>+</sup> myotubes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). We therefore conclude that ScxGFP expression is initiated after SC becomes activated and continues into differentiated myofibers <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

<title>Endogenous <italic>Scx</italic> is expressed in activated SCs</title>
<p>To ensure that the ScxGFP expression observed in adult regenerative myogenesis is not caused by mis-expression due to transgene insertion site, we utilized <italic>Scx<sup>CreERT2</sup></italic> for tamoxifen (TMX) inducible lineage tracing with a tdTomato (tdT) reporter (<italic>R<sup>tdT</sup></italic>)(Madisen, Zwingman et al. 2010). Two experimental groups with different tamoxifen (TMX) and injury regimen were designed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>): 1) TMX-induced marking before injury, and 2) TMX-induced marking after injury; muscles were harvested at 14 dpi for analysis. Mice treated with TMX before injury showed little to no tdT<sup>+</sup>Pax7<sup>+</sup> SCs or tdT<sup>+</sup> regenerative muscle fibers (identified by centrally located nuclei). By contrast, mice treated with TMX after injury showed ∼ 30% of Pax7<sup>+</sup> SCs and all regenerated myofibers as tdT<sup>+</sup> at 14 dpi (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C-D</xref>). Pax7<sup>+</sup> SC densities were not different between these two groups (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A</xref>). These data extend the ScxGFP results in that 1) marked interstitial Scx<sup>+</sup> cells prior to injury do not possess myogenic potential, 2) endogenous <italic>Scx</italic> is expressed in activated SCs for regenerative myogenic lineage-marking, and 3) lineage-marked <italic>Scx</italic><sup>+</sup> SCs are capable of renewal as Pax7<sup>+</sup> SCs at 14 dpi. Examination of two published SC bulk RNA-seq data confirmed <italic>Scx</italic> expression in SCs isolated from wild type(Li, Rozo et al. 2019) and <italic>mdx</italic> mice(Madaro, Torcinaro et al. 2019) (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B</xref>). Re-analysis of a published scRNA-seq data set of SCs(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dell’Orso, Juan et al. 2019</xref>) also revealed a wide-spread <italic>Scx</italic> expression at 2.5 dpi (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>; and more below). We conclude that endogenous <italic>Scx</italic>, like ScxGFP, is expressed by activated SCs and regenerative myogenic cells in adult mice.</p>

<title>ScxcKO mice show reduced SC proliferation and renewal</title>
<p>Considering that <italic>Scx</italic> expression is initiated in activated SCs but not in quiescent SCs, and ScxcKO mice have smaller regenerative myofibers, it stands to reason that <italic>Scx</italic> plays a role in their proliferation. At 5 dpi, we noted a ∼ 7-fold reduction in Pax7<sup>+</sup> SCs in the ScxcKO samples (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3E, F</xref>). To show proliferation defect, we administered EdU and assessed cumulative proliferation index over the first 5 days of injury (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, top panel). Compared to the control, the fraction of Pax7<sup>+</sup> ScxcKO SCs that incorporated EdU (i.e., EdU<sup>+</sup>Pax7<sup>+</sup>) was reduced by ∼ 4-fold (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3H</xref>). We did not observe appreciable levels of programmed cell death (PCD) in control and ScxcKO at 5 dpi using an anti-active Caspase3 antibody. We also quantified Pax7<sup>+</sup> SCs number at 14 dpi (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, bottom panel) and found a ∼ 5-fold reduction of renewed SCs in the ScxcKO group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3H, I</xref>). Thus, Scx is autonomously required for SC proliferation and renewal following injury.</p>

<title>Basement membrane-myofiber interaction in control and ScxcKO mice</title>
<p>When we examined laminin (i.e., basement membrane) and MHC in control 5 dpi samples, we found that the laminin boundary juxtaposed the regenerative myofiber surface (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3F</xref>). By contrast, many small ScxcKO MHC<sup>+</sup> fibers did not fill out to the laminin boundary and the laminin-circled areas were smaller than those in the control (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3G</xref>). We suggest that the laminin pattern in the ScxcKO represent left-over basement membranes of dead myofibers (caused by injury), i.e., the ghost fiber(Webster, Manor et al. 2016). The collapsed shrunken appearance is likely due to the small new fibers not able to fill up the space. Ghost fibers are thought to be replaced by basement membranes produced by regenerated fibers over time. At 14 dpi, regenerated myofibers in both control and ScxcKO were tightly surrounded by laminin despite their difference in size (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3H, I</xref>), suggesting that ScxcKO regenerated myofibers are capable of making their own new basement membranes.</p>

<title>Scx is needed for robust proliferation of SC in culture</title>
<p>To examine Scx function in the SC without interactions with other cell types in the injured/regenerative environment, we turned to <italic>in vitro</italic> assays using purified SCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). To simplify FACS isolation of SC, we utilized either the tdT or the YFP fluorescent reporter (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4A, B</xref>). SC purity was assessed by staining for Pax7 immediately after FACS. We were surprised that YFP-marked SCs (YFP-SCs) exhibited higher purity than tdT-marked SCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Murach and colleagues have reported exosomal transfer of tdT mRNA from lineage-marked Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells to other cell types(Murach, Peck et al. 2021). The difference we observed between these 2 reporters suggests that high levels of tdT mRNA produced by a strong promoter/enhancer leads to more tdT<sup>+</sup> non-SCs by exosomal transfer.</p>

<p>As such, we opted to use YFP-marked control and ScxcKO SCs in subsequent studies for higher SC purity. Of note, ScxcKO with YFP reporter had similar regenerative defects as that with tdT reporter (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3J, K</xref>). By EdU incorporation assay, we found that cultured ScxcKO SCs displayed reduced proliferation indices at days 2, 3 and 4. Curiously, the number of ScxcKO cells per imaged area (i.e., cell density) barely increased during this time course, despite EdU incorporation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C, D, E</xref>). We next carried out live imaging (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4C</xref>) to document the behavior of control and ScxcKO SCs. Consistent with EdU incorporation, control SCs showed a faster increase in cell number/density than ScxcKO SCs (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4D, E</xref>). ScxcKO cells also showed a slightly reduced cell mobility (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4F</xref>). As found <italic>in vivo</italic>, we did not detect a difference of PCD (by anti-cleaved Caspase3) between control and ScxcKO SCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). However, we did observe cell loss during live-imaging (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4G, H</xref>): More ScxcKO cells rounded up or appeared necrotic before disappearing. Our results support that Scx acts autonomously in the SC to promote proliferation and migration.</p>

<title>Scx expression by Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq)</title>
<p>To determine the mechanism underlying Scx’s role in the SC-lineage, we employed scRNA-seq using the 10x Chromium platform (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A</xref>). For this, multiple sites of BaCl<sub>2</sub> injection were made to TA and gastrocnemius muscles of control and ScxcKO mice to induce wide-spread injury and activate as many SCs as possible(Morton, Norton et al. 2019). Because the published sc-RNA-seq data(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dell’Orso, Juan et al. 2019</xref>) indicated a widespread <italic>Scx</italic> expression at 2.5 dpi (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>), we chose this time point for investigation.</p>
<p>YFP-marked control and ScxcKO SCs at 2.5 dpi were FACS-isolated and immediately subjected to scRNA-seq (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Data were analyzed using the R package Seurat and unsupervised graph-based clustering(Hao, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hao et al. 2021</xref>). After filtering, 11,388 control and 12,844 ScxcKO cells, respectively (with ∼23,000 detectable genes), were qualified for analysis. We utilized uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) to display all cells in the unified dataset and performed unsupervised shared nearest neighbor (SNN) clustering to partition cells into 18 (0-17) clusters (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5B</xref>). We annotated the cell types by examining the normalized expression level and frequency of canonical cell type-specific genes. The percentages of cells within each cluster in control and ScxcKO were also calculated (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5C</xref>). Clusters 0-2 and 4-11 contained the majority of cells expressing myogenic genes. Clusters 3 and 12-17 represent non-myogenic cell types, including various immune cells, endothelial cells, and Schwann cells (presumably due to exosomal transfer of YFP mRNA). Cluster 13 was assigned as monocytes/macrophages/platelets, but expressed myogenic genes. They are likely the immunomyoblast proposed by Oprescu et al(Oprescu, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Yue et al. 2020</xref>).

<title>sc-RNA-seq confirms <italic>Scx</italic> expression during regenerative myogenesis</title>
<p>Of the 11 myogenic cell clusters, we classified them into four categories: early activated SC, activated SC, myocyte, and mature skeletal muscle (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5B</xref>). Within the categories of early activated SC and activated SC, multiple cell clusters were included and numbered as different states. Here, numbers were arbitrarily assigned and not meant to reflect their temporal sequence. Early activated SC 1 - 3 were represented by clusters 4, 5, 9, and expressed varying levels of <italic>Pax7</italic>, <italic>Myod1</italic>, and <italic>Myf5</italic> (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5B, D, E</xref>). We assigned clusters 0, 1, 2 and 7 as activated SC 1 – 4 respectively as they expressed lower levels of <italic>Pax7</italic> (compared to early activated SC). Further evidencing our assignment as activated SCs, more cells in these clusters expressed <italic>Myod1</italic>, <italic>Myf5</italic>, and <italic>Hspa1a</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Francetic T 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Senf 2013</xref>). Cluster 6 represented early myocyte based on increased expression of <italic>Myog</italic> and <italic>Mef2a</italic>. Cluster 8 cells expressed high levels of <italic>Mymk</italic>, indicating that they are competent for fusion. Cluster 11 cells expressed <italic>Myh1</italic> and <italic>Acta1</italic>, representing mature muscle cell. Cluster 10 cells were unknown myogenic cells for they expressed very low levels of myogenic genes. Among these clusters, the level and cell percentage of <italic>Scx</italic> expression were very low in early activated SCs, and gradually increased from activated SCs to early myocytes, fusion competent myocytes, and mature muscle cells (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5D, F</xref>).</p>
<p>We carried out Monocle 2 trajectory analysis to depict the progression of myogenic cell clusters (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Given that <italic>Scx</italic> expression is very low in the early activated SC category and we observed ScxGFP only in activated SC experimentally, we excluded early activated SC 1-3 from analysis. The trajectory revealed a time line consistent with our assignment, from activated SC 1 to mature muscle cells. Of the 4 activated SC clusters, activated SC 1 cells were distributed throughout the activation time line up to early myocyte stage, activated SC 2 and SC 3 cells were preferentially located in earlier time line, whereas activated SC 4 cells were found in a later time, revealing their different states. Early myocytes, fusion competent myocytes, and mature muscle cells were ordered as expected.</p>

<title>scRNA-seq data help identify myogenic differentiation and fusion defects</title>
<p>To understand the timing of <italic>Scx</italic> action, we compared the relative densities of various cell types/states between the control and ScxcKO cells along the pseudotime (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Relative to control, a higher density of ScxcKO cells, i.e., peak 2 in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>, was noted just before their reduction, i.e., peaks 3 and 4. Peaks 3 and 4 correspond to fusion competent myocytes and mature muscle cells, respectively. This information re-directed us to investigate <italic>Scx</italic> function in fusion and differentiation. For this, control and ScxcKO SCs were isolated, cultured, plated at the same density, and then switched to differentiation medium (DM) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). They were assessed for expression of MyoG (for differentiation index) and MHC (for fusion index) daily over 3 days. More control cells expressed MyoG and MHC when compared to ScxcKO cells at each time point (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E, F, G</xref>). At day 3, ScxcKO cells caught up in differentiation index (still lower than that of control cells), but were still considerably lower in fusion index. This experimental result, aided by pseudotime analysis, supports a role of <italic>Scx</italic> for regenerative myogenic differentiation.</p>

<sec id="s2k">
<title>Molecular pathways governed by <italic>Scx</italic> in regenerative myogenesis</title>
<p>To gain molecular insight, we examined differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between control and ScxcKO cells along the pseudotime-line. We were particularly intrigued by the DEGs in peak 2, as it represents an early time point of difference to capture candidate direct targets of Scx. There were 3956 DEGs in peak 2 – <italic>Scx</italic> exhibited the largest log<sub>2</sub> fold change in ScxcKO (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref> and Table S1). In particular, cyclin-dependent kinases <italic>Cdk1</italic> and <italic>Cdk2</italic> were down-regulated, and CDK-inhibitors <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> and <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> were up-regulated in ScxcKO cells at, and prior to, peak 2 (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5G</xref>). This helps explain the proliferation defects of ScxcKO cells. However, higher cell density with less proliferation potential is somewhat counter-intuitive. We suggest that ScxcKO cells not only proliferate slower but also progress slower towards differentiation and fusion, resulting in their stalling and accumulation at the peak 2 transitional juncture (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p>
<p>Consistent with the phenotype of ScxcKO, Gene Ontology (GO) term analysis of peak 2 DEGs revealed that control cells showed enrichment of up-regulated genes in the categories of muscle differentiation, growth, and development, among other pathways overlapping with cardiac muscles (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>). 17 genes involved in the muscle cell apoptotic process were found, even though we did not detect changes by using anti-cleaved Caspase 3. Unexpectedly, <italic>Mymk</italic> and <italic>Mymx</italic>, indispensable for myocyte fusion, were expressed higher in ScxcKO than control cells (Tables S1, S2), possibly reflecting their compensatory up-regulation due to compromised differentiation/fusion of <italic>Scx</italic>cKO cells. Analyses of peak 3 and 4 DEGs provide additional information about selective differentiation processes being disrupted in ScxcKO cells (see discussion).</p>

<title>Identification of direct targets by CUT&amp;RUN assay</title>
<p>To uncover direct gene targets of Scx that regulate muscle differentiation and/or maturation, we utilized the CUT&amp;RUN(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kaya-Okur, Janssens et al. 2020</xref>) assay to determine Scx bindings sites in the genome. To aid this endeavor, a triple-Ty1 tag (3XTy1) was fused to the C-terminus of Scx to create a <italic>Scx<sup>Ty1</sup></italic> allele (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6A</xref>). <italic>Scx<sup>Ty1/Ty1</sup></italic> mice are viable and fertile without apparent tendon abnormality.

During differentiation time course over 3 days in culture, the largest fraction of cells with detectable Ty1 presented at day 1 (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6E</xref>).</p>
<p>We performed the CUT&amp;RUN using anti-Ty1 on <italic>Scx<sup>Ty1/Ty1</sup></italic> myoblasts (Scx-CUT&amp;RUN) at 12 h after switching them to DM (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6F</xref>); this time point was chosen to uncover early targets. We included two controls: ScxGFP myoblasts with anti-Ty1, and <italic>Scx<sup>Ty1/Ty1</sup></italic> myoblasts with non-specific IgG. A total of 1003 binding peaks were identified in 862 gene loci with 33.4%, 38.88% and 22.44% located in intergenic regions, introns, and promoters respectively, alongside other genomic regions, respectively (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>; Table S3). These peaks were enriched for the bHLH transcription factor binding motif, the E-box: CANNTG (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>), indicating high data quality. By integrating the Scx-CUT&amp;RUN data with DEGs in the scRNA-seq data of ScxcKO cells (specifically those in peak 2 of <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>), we found 207 intersecting genes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>; Table S4). Scx-binding peaks at these gene loci were also enriched for the E-box motif (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>), implicating these genes as direct targets. As expected, GO-term of these genes showed enrichment for processes in muscle differentiation, fusion, and myofibril assembly (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>; Table S5). We also noted the enrichment for processes of mRNA destabilization, catabolism, poly(A) shortening, etc., suggesting that mRNA metabolism is altered in the ScxcKO (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>; Table S5).</p>

<p>Four of the 207 candidate direct target genes provide explanation for the ScxcKO phenotype: <italic>Mef2a</italic>, <italic>Capn2</italic>, <italic>Myh9</italic>, and <italic>Cflar.</italic> The Scx-CUT&amp;RUN peaks at these loci were in either the promoter region or intron (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>; <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6F</xref>). Knocking-out and knocking-down <italic>Mef2a</italic> led to compromised myoblast differentiation <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, respectively (Seok, Tatsuguchi et al. 2011, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Liu, Nelson et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Estrella, Desjardins et al. 2015</xref>, Wang, Yang et al. 2018). Reduced <italic>Mef2a</italic> levels explain the compromised myoblast differentiation of ScxcKO cells. Consistently, several <italic>Mef2a</italic> target genes, such as <italic>Hspb7</italic>, <italic>Atp1a2</italic>, <italic>Tmem182</italic>(Wales, Hashemi et al. 2014) were also down regulated (Table S1, S6). Capn2 is a calpain isoform expressed in the skeletal muscle, and the locus harbors 5 E-boxes and 1 MEF-2 binding sites(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dedieu, Mazeres et al. 2003</xref>). Knocking-down <italic>Capn2</italic> in C2C12 cells led to compromised cell migration and fusion(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Honda, Masui et al. 2008</xref>), as observed for ScxcKO cells. <italic>Myh9</italic> was shown to regulate bi-polar cell morphology and alignment during myocyte fusion <italic>in vitro</italic>(Swailes, Colegrave et al. 2006). Its down regulation is consistent with the defective fusion of ScxcKO cells. Lastly, <italic>Cflar</italic> were shown to proliferation and prevent apoptosis in vascular smooth muscle cells and T lymphocytes(Wang, Prince et al. 2002, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Zhang and He 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Budd, Yeh et al. 2006</xref>, Vesely, Heilig et al. 2009). It may act similarly in the SC to explain reduced proliferation and increased cell loss of ScxcKO cells. These 4 genes displayed reduced expression levels at the early part of the pseudotime trajectory (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H-K</xref>), consistent with them being direct targets. The other 203 genes likely also contribute to aspects of the ScxcKO phenotype in ways yet to be determined. Taken together, Scx directly regulates a set of E-box containing genes, and several of these genes have direct implications to the phenotype observed.</p>

<p>Since the initial description of the <italic>Scx</italic> gene(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cserjesi 1995</xref>), most efforts have been focused on its role in tendon. Its early expression in the syndetome and the limb mesenchyme eventually becomes realized in tendons, ligaments, and CT(Schweitzer, Chyung et al. 2001, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Brent, Schweitzer et al. 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Tozer and Duprez 2005</xref>, Pryce, Brent et al. 2007).

Of relevance, a lineage contribution to myofibers was found. The temporal emergence of Scx<sup>+</sup> cells with myogenic potential was not provided by constitutive Cre-mediated lineage tracing. On the other hand, TMX-inducible lineage tracing mediated by the CT marker gene <italic>Ors1</italic> (i.e., using an <italic>Ors1<sup>CreERT2</sup></italic>) revealed myogenic incorporation competence that declines towards late embryogenesis(Esteves de Lima, Blavet et al. 2021). A Prx1<sup>+</sup> CT population has also been shown to incorporate into the myofiber near the myotendonous junction (MTJ) at neonatal stages(Yaseen, Kraft-Sheleg et al. 2021). Consistently, scRNA-seq of embryonic chick limb mesenchyme identified a cell cluster co-expressing CT and myogenic signatures at multiple stages(Esteves de Lima, Blavet et al. 2021). Whether these bi-potential CT/myogenic cells arise from dermomotyotome, syndetome or a yet-to-be identified origin, remains to be rigorously examined.</p>
<p>We show here that adult SCs express ScxGFP upon injury and culture, and that ScxGFP is co-localized with Pax7, MyoD and MHC. scRNA-seq data confirm endogenous <italic>Scx</italic> expression in multiple regenerative myogenic clusters/states, in which the other CT markers <italic>Twist2</italic>, <italic>Ors1</italic>, and <italic>Pdgfra</italic> are barely detectable. Moreover, only the lineage-marked Scx<sup>+</sup> cells induced after, but not prior to, injury contribute to regenerative muscles and SCs. Together, these results support that muscle interstitial Scx<sup>+</sup> CT (lineage-marked prior to injury) have no myogenic potential, whereas activated Pax7<sup>+</sup> SCs expressing <italic>Scx</italic> (lineage-marked after injury) can contribute to new muscles and SCs. This is consistent with transplanted Scx<sup>+</sup> CT(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Giordani, He et al. 2019</xref>) lacking a contribution to muscle. Adult muscle interstitial CT are highly heterogeneous within a muscle group as well as between muscle groups based on scRNA-seq data, and not all CT express <italic>Scx</italic>(Muhl, Genove et al. 2020). Anatomically, adult muscle interstitial <italic>Scx</italic><sup>+</sup> cells are paramysial cells that line the perimysium(Muhl, Genove et al. 2020). Lineage tracing data showed that Scx<sup>+</sup> CT and MTJ cells were descendants of Hic1<sup>+</sup> MPs, but no myofiber incorporation from the Hic1<sup>+</sup> lineage was noted(Scott, Arostegui et al. 2019). Whether CT/myogenic bipotential progenitors exist in adult muscle is of considerable interest. Regardless, our results strongly support that SCs express <italic>Scx</italic> after activation and require <italic>Scx</italic> function for efficient regeneration.</p>

<p><italic>Scx</italic> has been consider a master regulator of tendon (and ligament) development as <italic>Scx</italic> mutant mice develop severely compromised tendons in the limbs and tail(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Murchison, Price et al. 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yoshimoto, Takimoto et al. 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Shukunami, Takimoto et al. 2018</xref>). <italic>Scx</italic> is required for the expression of multiple tendon matrix protein encoding genes such as <italic>Col1a1</italic>, <italic>Col3a1</italic>, and <italic>Tnmd</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Shukunami, Takimoto et al. 2018</xref>), but not for tendon progenitor specification. Ablation of embryonic Scx<sup>+</sup> cells led to mis-patterned muscle bundles(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ono, Schlesinger et al. 2023</xref>), supporting an interdependence between muscle and tendon for connectivity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kardon 1998</xref>). Retrospectively, the observed muscle mis-pattern by ablating Scx<sup>+</sup> cells likely included ablation of CT/myogenic cells and tendon cells. In adult, <italic>Scx</italic> continues to be required for tendon growth and repair after injury(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Howell, Chien et al. 2017</xref>, Sakabe, Sakai et al. 2018, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gumucio, Schonk et al. 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Korcari, Muscat et al. 2022</xref>). By contrast, we focused on <italic>Scx</italic> function in proliferation, migration, differentiation, and fusion within the Pax7<sup>+</sup> SC lineage for muscle regeneration. GO-term analyses and literature reviews of DEGs from our scRNA-seq and CUT&amp;RUN data sets have also identified genes in many myogenic processes, instead of genes in tenogenic or CT processes, that help understand the role of <italic>Scx</italic> for muscle regeneration.</p>

<title>Scx downstream target genes in tendon versus muscle</title>
<p>Scx binds to E-box as MyoD1 and Myf5. The initial characterization of Scx showed that it could activate reporter genes driven by an E-box derived from the enhancer of the muscle creatine kinase (<italic>MCK</italic>) gene(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cserjesi 1995</xref>). Eventually, the tendon-specific <italic>Tnmd</italic> gene, with multiple functional E-boxes in its promoter, was shown to be a direct target of Scx(Shukunami, Takimoto et al. 2006, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Shukunami, Takimoto et al. 2018</xref>). Recently, bulk-RNA-seq and ChIP-seq were combined to define <italic>Scx</italic> target genes in embryonic tenocytes(Li, Wu et al. 2021). Although their and our data sets are not age-matched and obtained by different methods, we compared them nonetheless. Overall DEGs (including those without Scx-binding sites) between our and their data yielded minimal overlap (0.9%, using the criteria of log2FC &gt; 0.5). Two genes, <italic>Htra3</italic> and <italic>Olfml2b</italic>, are overlapping DEGs (48 genes for tenocytes and 207 genes for myoblasts) with Scx-binding sites, and neither gene has been studied in tendon or skeletal muscle. Lastly, the compiled E-box sequences bound by Scx in tenocytes and myoblasts are not different. Thus, the deployment of <italic>Scx</italic> by adult SCs is not a re-use of its function in the tendon. The distinctiveness of Scx target genes between these two tissues is most likely attributed to chromatin accessibility imposed by different epigenomes.</p>

<title>Indirect target genes of Scx further explain defects of the ScxcKO</title>
<p>Although we emphasized Scx’s direct target genes in peak 2 of <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>, there were many more DEGs that were indirect targets (i.e. without significant Scx-CUT&amp;RUN peaks). Dysregulation of those genes also provide insights to <italic>Scx</italic>-regulated muscle regeneration. For the proliferation defect, we mentioned 4 dysregulated cell cycle regulators in the results section. In addition, <italic>Erk1/2/3</italic> (<italic>Mapk1/3/6</italic>), known for their role in cell growth, also exhibited lower expression levels in ScxCKO cells during the early pseudotime phase (Tables S1, S6). For GO-enrichment in cell migration (20 genes; Table S2), <italic>Itga2</italic> and <italic>Crk</italic> are worth noting as they have been shown to play this role in non-muscle cell contexts(Ren, Zhao et al. 2019, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cai, Guo et al. 2022</xref>),(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chuang, Wu et al. 2018</xref>),(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Huang, Clarke et al. 2015</xref>). They may mediate myogenic cell migration under the umbrella program of <italic>Scx</italic>. For differentiation and fusion at the later pseudotime phase, there are 1942 and 755 DEGs (Tables S6, S7) in peaks 3 and 4 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>), respectively. GO-term analyses identified 74 (in peak 3) and 47 (in peak 4) genes related to muscle differentiation (Tables S8, S9). Several of them have documented roles in myogenic differentiation, e.g., <italic>Hacd1</italic>(Lin, Yang et al. 2012),(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Blondelle, Ohno et al. 2015</xref>)<italic>, Klhl41</italic>(Paxton, Cosgrove et al. 2011, Ramirez-Martinez, Cenik et al. 2017)<italic>, Ehd2</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Doherty, Demonbreun et al. 2008</xref>, Posey, Pytel et al. 2011), and <italic>Lmna</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dubinska-Magiera, Zaremba-Czogalla et al. 2013</xref>, Maggi, Carboni et al. 2016). As these gene products act in different cellular compartments and mediate distinct processes, <italic>Scx</italic> does not appear to govern a singular process for muscle differentiation. How these indirect genes come to be dysregulated in the absence of <italic>Scx</italic> remains to be deciphered.</p>
<p>Together with the embryonic CT/myogenic bipotential cells and the Prx1<sup>+</sup> CT capable of myogenic fusion near the MTJ, our results add an additional layer of complexity and further blur the molecular and cellular boundaries that divide muscle versus tendon/CT identity. The wealth of information of heterogeneous cell types and states obtained by scRNA-seq will continue to break many long-accepted concepts of tissue-restricted functions of transcription factors.</p>

<title>SC isolation by FACS and myoblast culture</title>
<p>SCs were isolated according to the protocol described previously(Liu, Cheung et al. 2015, Yue, Wan et al. 2020) with slight modifications. Briefly, mouse hindlimb muscles were dissected, minced and digested with collagenase II (1000U/ml, Worthington) in wash medium (10% Horse Serum (HS, Invitrogen)) in Ham’s F-10 medium with 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S, Gibco)) for 1.5h followed by centrifugation and washing. Then, the tissue slurry was further digested by collagenase II (100U/ml) and dispase (1.1U/ml, Gibco) in wash medium for 0.5 h to get single cell suspension for cell sorting. The cell suspension was sorted using a BD ARIA III sorter equipped with 375-nm, 488-nm, 561-nm, and 633-nm lasers. For Fluorescence sorting the YFP<sup>+</sup> (tdT<sup>+</sup>) cells are sorted with green fluorescence; FITC channel 488-nm (red fluorescence; PE channel 568-nm). For 4 surface makers labelling, cells were incubated with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and fluorophore-conjugated antibodies (BioLegend) against CD31, CD45, stem cells antigen-1(Sca1) and vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (Vcam1) at 4 °C for 0.5 h. After washing, cells were subjected to FACS (DAPI<sup>-</sup>, CD31<sup>-</sup>, CD45<sup>-</sup>, Sca1<sup>-</sup> and Vcam1<sup>+</sup> cells were collected), and data were collected by FACS Diva software v.6.1.3 (BD Biosciences). A small fraction of sorted cells was immunofluorescence staining for the muscle stem cell markers Pax7. For short-time cell culture, freshly sorted mononuclear SCs were plated on Matrigel (catalogue no. 354248; Corning) coated dishes (37 °C for 1 h) and cultured in SCs culture medium (growth medium: 20% FBS, 5% horse serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% GlutaMAX supplement (Gibco) and 2.5 ng/ml FGF (R&amp;D systems) in DMEM (Gibco)) at 37°C in tissue culture incubators with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Cells were harvested as specified in the text and figure legend; For long-time cell culture to get stable primary myoblast cell line, freshly-isolated satellite cells were cultured in Ham’s F10 (F10, Sigma), 10% HS and 1% P/S for 2 days, then passage the cell into culture medium and expended the cell for 2 more passages. After that the cells were Cryopreserved into liquid nitrogen for later CUT&amp;RUN and myoblast differentiation and fusion assays; For <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation and fusion assay, freshly sorted cells or frozen cells were thawed and cultured in growth medium for 12 h then changed into differentiation medium (2% HS, 1% P/S in DMEM) on Matrigel coated plate and harvested as specified in the figure legend; for EdU labelling, 10μM EdU was added to the SC culture medium for 6hr before harvesting for assay.</p>

Sections were washed and incubated in blocking solution (1 X carbo-free blocking solution (Vector Lab)) and 10% goat serum in 0.05% PBT) for 2 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution overnight at 4°C. Sources and dilution for primary antibodies are provided in Table S11, Sections were then washed with 0.05% PBT 3 times and incubated with appropriate Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1,000 for Alexa 488 and Alexa 568 and 1:500 for Alexa 647; Thermo Fisher) in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were then washed with 0.05% PBT, stained with DAPI (1μg/ml in 0.05% PBT) and mounted in anti-fade diamond solution (Invitrogen). tdT fluorescence was preserved, so no antibody staining was used. This protocol was also used for SCs and myoblasts with two modifications, 1) the cells were fixed for 10 min in 4% PFA and 2) cells were only blocked with blocking buffer (10% goat serum in 0.05% PBT).

For the library preparation and sequencing, ThruPLEX DNA-seq Kit (Takara) was used to construct the CUT&amp;RUN DNA library for sequencing on an Illumina platform. 5-10 ng purified CUT&amp;RUN-enriched DNA was used for the library preparation. The whole process was performed according the protocol with deviations aiming to preserve short DNA fragments (30-80 bp). After the Library Synthesis step (adaptor ligation), 1.8 x volume of AMPure XP beads was added to the reaction to ensure high recovery efficiency of short fragments. 12 cycles of PCR amplification system was used, then the reaction was cleaned up with 1.2 x volume of AMPure XP beads. The libraries were assayed with a High Sensitivity DNA bioanalyzer (Agilent) for quality control and sequenced in the Illumina NextSeq500. To enable determination of fragment length, paired-end sequencing was performed (2×75 bp, 8 bp index). The data is analyzed by nf-core/CUT&amp;RUN pipeline with –seacr stringent parameters (version 2.0)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Ewels, Peltzer et al. 2020</xref>).

Pax7 lineage cells were FACS-isolated by YFP fluorescence. Cells were suspended in PBS and counted by hemocytometer into 1000 cells/μl. Around 17,000 cells per sample were used for single-cell library preparation using the 10x Genomics platform with Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3′ GEM, Library and Gel Bead Kit v.3.1 (PN-1000121, v.3 chemistry), Single Cell 3′ A Chip Kit (PN-1000009) or Chromium Next GEM Chip G Single Cell Kit (PN-1000127), and i7 Multiplex Kit (PN-120262). We followed the 10x protocol exactly to prepare the scRNA-seq library. In brief, for v.3 chemistry, 16.5μl cell suspension and 26.7μl nuclease-free water were mixed with 31.8μl reverse transcription master mix. Of this 75μl mix, 70μl was loaded into the Chromium Next GEM Chip G. After barcoding, cDNA was purified and amplified with 11 PCR cycles.

<title>Analyses of scRNA-seq data</title>
<p>Sequencing reads were processed with the Cell Ranger version 6.0.1 (10X Genomics, Pleasanton, CA) using the mouse reference transcriptome mm10. From the gene expression matrix, the downstream analysis was carried out with R version 4.0.2 (2020-06-22). Quality control, filtering, data clustering and visualization, and the differential expression analysis were carried out using Seurat version 4.0.3 R package(Hao, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hao et al. 2021</xref>). Cells with &lt;1000 UMIs or mitochondrial reads &gt;10% were removed from the analysis. In addition, we removed potential doublets by DoubletFinder (v. 2.0.3)(McGinnis, Murrow et al. 2019). After log-normalizing the data, the expression of each gene was scaled regressing out the number of UMI and the percentage of mitochondrial genes expressed in each cell. The two datasets were integrated with IntegrateData function from Seurat. We performed PCA on the gene expression matrix and used the first 20 principal components for clustering and visualization. Unsupervised shared nearest neighbor (SNN) clustering was performed with a resolution of 0.6 and visualization was done using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP). The Scx expressed myogenic lineage clusters 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, and 11 were subjected to trajectory analysis by monocle 2 (v. 2.16.0)(Qiu, Mao et al. 2017). To organize cells in pseudotime, we performed new dimension reduction and regressed out mitochondrial effects with reduceDimension function and unsupervised cluster them into 5 clusters with clusterCells function. The differentially expressed genes were calculated by differentialGeneTest and the top 500 differentially expressed genes are used to order then used by Monocle for clustering and ordering cells using the DDRTree method and reverse graph embedding.</p>

<p>This manuscript by Bai et al concerns the expression of Scleraxis (Scx) by muscle satellite cells (SCs) and the role of that gene in regenerative myogenesis. The authors report the expression of this gene associated with tendon development in satellite cells. Genetic deletion of Scx in SCs impairs muscle regeneration, and the authors provide evidence that SCs deficient in Scx are impaired in terms of population growth and cellular differentiation. Overall, this report provides evidence of the role of this gene, unexpectedly, in SC function and adult regenerative myogenesis.</p>
<p>There are a few minor points of concern.</p>
<p>(1) From the data in Figure 1, it appears that all of the SCs, assessed both in vitro and in vivo, express Scx. The authors refer to a scRNA-seq dataset from their lab and one report from mdx mouse muscle that also reveals this unexpected gene expression pattern. Has this been observed in many other scRNA-seq datasets? If not, it would be important to discuss potential explanations as to why this has not been reported previously.</p>
<p>(2) A major point of the paper, as illustrated in Fig. 3, is that Scx-neg SCs fail to produce normal myofibers and renewed SCs following injury/regeneration. They mention in the text that there was no increased PCD by Caspase staining at 5 DPI. A failure of cell survival during the process of SC activation, proliferation, and cell fate determination (differentiation versus self-renewal) would explain most of the in vivo data. As such, this conclusion would seem to warrant a more detailed analysis in terms of at least one or two other time points and an independent method for detecting dead/dying cells (the in vitro data in Fig. 4F is also based on an assessment of activated Caspase to assess cell death). The in vitro data presented later in Fig. S4G, H do suggest an increase in cell loss during proliferative expansion of Scx-neg SCs. To what extent does cell loss (by whatever mechanism of cell death) explain both the in vivo findings of impaired regeneration and even the in vitro studies showing slower population expansion in the absence of Scx?</p>
<p>(3) I'm not sure I understand the description of the data or the conclusions in the section titled &quot;Basement membrane-myofiber interaction in control and Scx cKO mice&quot;. Is there something specific to the regeneration from Scx-neg myogenic progenitors, or would these findings be expected in any experimental condition in which myogenesis was significantly delayed, with much smaller fibers in the experimental group at 5 DPI?</p>
<p>(4) The data presented in Fig. 4B showing differences in the purity of SC populations isolated by FACS depending on the reporter used are interesting and important for the field. The authors offer the explanation of exosomal transfer of Tdt from SCs to non-SCs. The data are consistent with this explanation, but no data are presented to support this. Are there any other explanations that the authors have considered and that could be readily tested?</p>
<p>(5) The Cut&amp;Run data of Fig. 6 certainly provide evidence of direct Scx targets, especially since the authors used a novel knock-in strain for analyses. The enrichment of E-box motifs provides support for the 207 intersecting genes (scRNA-seq and Cut&amp;Run) being direct targets. However, the rationale elaborated in the final paragraph of the Results section proposing how 4 of these genes account for the phenotypes on the Scx-neg cells and tissues is just speculation, however reasonable. These are not data, and these considerations would be more appropriate in the Discussion in the absence of any validation studies.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Scx is a well-established marker for tenocytes, but the expression in myogenic-lineage cells was unexplored. In this study, the authors performed lineage-trace and scRNA-seq analyses and demonstrated that Scx is expressed in activated SCs. Further, the authors showed that Scx is essential for muscle regeneration using conditional KO mice and identified the target genes of Scx in myogenic cells, which differ from those of tendons.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Sometimes, lineage-trace experiments cause mis-expression and do not reflect the endogenous expression of the target gene. In this study, the authors carefully analyzed the unexpected expression of Scx in myogenic cells using some mouse lines and scRNA-seq data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Scx protein expression has not been verified.</p>

<p>Thanks for this question regarding data in Figure 1. We did initially use immunofluorescence staining of Pax7 and GFP on muscle sections and primary myoblast cultures prepared from Tg-ScxGFP mice to conclude that Scx was expressed in satellite cells (SCs). In addition to the cited mdx RNA-seq data, we have included a re-analysis of a published scRNA-seq data set in Figure 2E (Dell'Orso, Juan et al., Development, 2019), and our own scRNA-seq data (Figure S5D, F). We have also re-examined an additional scRNA-seq data set of TA muscles at various regeneration time points (De Micheli et al., Cell Rep. 2020), in which Scx expression was detected in MuSC progenitors and mature muscle cells (in addition to tenocytes). Thus, our immunostaining results are consistent with scRNA-seq data from our and two other independent scRNA-seq data sets.</p>
<p>We think that Scx expression in the adult myogenic lineage was not previously reported mainly because its expression level was low, and might be dismissed as spurious detection. Additionally, detecting such low expression levels requires sophisticated detection methods with high capture efficiency. Previous studies have noted limitations in transcript capture or transcription factor dropout in 10x Genomics-based datasets (Lambert et al., Cell, 2018; Pokhilko et al., Genome Res., 2021). Or, Scx was simply not a focus in prior studies amid other genes of interest. Our specific focus on Scx has led us to evaluate its expression in these data sets. We will add the above cited scRNA-seq data set (De Micheli et al., Cell Rep. 2020) and provide a discussion in the revised version.</p>

<p>(2) A major point of the paper, as illustrated in Fig. 3, is that Scx-neg SCs fail to produce normal myofibers and renewed SCs following injury/regeneration. They mention in the text that there was no increased PCD by Caspase staining at 5 DPI. A failure of cell survival during the process of SC activation, proliferation, and cell fate determination (differentiation versus self-renewal) would explain most of the in vivo data. As such, this conclusion would seem to warrant a more detailed analysis in terms of at least one or two other time points and an independent method for detecting dead/dying cells (the in vitro data in Fig. 4F is also based on an assessment of activated Caspase to assess cell death). The in vitro data presented later in Fig. S4G, H do suggest an increase in cell loss during proliferative expansion of Scx-neg SCs. To what extent does cell loss (by whatever mechanism of cell death) explain both the in vivo findings of impaired regeneration and even the in vitro studies showing slower population expansion in the absence of Scx?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate these constructive suggestions. Additional methods and different time points should be helpful in investigating SC cell loss in ScxcKO. Based on the number of available cKO animals, we will carefully choose additional time point(s) to assess PCD, using anti-active Caspase-3 immunostaining and another independent method (e.g., TUNNEL). Although the outcomes are uncertain, we will endeavor to obtain meaningful data from these experiments.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We very much appreciate this comment. We agree that there is unlikely anything specific about the regeneration from Scx-negative myogenic progenitors. Unfilled or empty ghost fibers (basement membrane remnant) are to be expected due to the small fiber and poor regeneration in the ScxcKO mice at 5 dpi. We will correct the subtitle and content accordingly.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for highlighting this phenomenon. We struggled with the SC purity issue for a long time. The project started with using the R26RtdT reporter for tdT’s paraformaldehyde  resistant strong fluorescence (fixation) to aid visualization in vivo. Later, when we used the tdT signal to purify SCs by FACS, we found that only 80% sorted tdT+ cells are Pax7+. We then switched to the R26RYFP reporter, from which we achieved much higher purity (95%) of SCs (Pax7+) by FACS. As such, we also repeated and confirmed many in vivo experimental results using the R26RYFP reporter (included in the manuscript). Due to the low purity of tdT+SCs by FACS, we discontinued that mouse colony after we confirmed the superior utility of the R26RYFP reporter for SC isolation.</p>
<p>We sincerely apologize for not being able to conduct further testable experiments on this intriguing phenomenon. However, this issue has since been addressed and published by Murach et al., iScience, (2021). Like our experience, they found non-satellite mononuclear cells with tdT fluorescence after TMX treatment when SCs were isolated via FACS. To determine this was not due to off-target recombination or a technical artifact from tissue processing, they conducted extensive analyses. They found that the tdT+ mononuclear cells included fibrogenic cells (fibroblasts and FAPs), immune cells/macrophages, and endothelial cells. Additionally, they confirmed the significant potential of extracellular vesicle (EV)-mediated cargo transfer, which facilitates the transfer of full-length tdT transcript from lineage-marked Pax7+ cells to those mononuclear cells. We will modify our text to include and acknowledge their contribution to this important point.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Scx protein expression has not been verified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are aware of this weakness. We had previously used Western blotting (WB) using cultured SCs from control and ScxcKO mice, but did not detect endogenous Scx protein in the control. Hence, we used ScxCreERT2 lineage-tracing, Tg-ScxGFP expression, and ScxTy1 knock-in allele as complementary, even though indirect, ways to address this issue. Following the reviewer’s comment, we will purchase new anti-Scx antibodies and re-perform WB using cultured SCs. If the new antibodies fail to detect endogenous Scx by WB, we will then use immunofluorescence staining to detect endogenous Scx protein.</p>
