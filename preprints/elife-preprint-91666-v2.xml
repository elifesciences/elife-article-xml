<title>Abstract</title><p>Spermiogenesis is a critical, post-meiotic phase of male gametogenesis, in which the proper gene expression is essential for sperm maturation. However, the underlying molecular mechanism that controls mRNA expression in the round spermatids remains elusive. Here, we identify that FBXO24, an orphan F-box protein, is highly expressed in the testis of humans and mice and interacts with the splicing factors (SRSF2, SRSF3, and SRSF9) to modulate the gene alternative splicing in the round spermatids. Genetic mutation of FBXO24 in mice causes many abnormal splicing events in round spermatids, thus affecting a large number of critical genes related to sperm formation that were dysregulated. Further molecular and phenotypical analyses revealed that FBXO24 deficiency results in aberrant histone retention, incomplete axonemes, oversized chromatoid body (CB), and abnormal mitochondrial coiling along sperm flagella, ultimately leading to male sterility. In addition, we discovered that FBXO24 interacts with MIWI and SCF subunits and mediates the degradation of MIWI via K48-linked polyubiquitination. Furthermore, we show that FBXO24 depletion could lead to aberrant piRNA production in testes, which suggests FBXO24 is required for normal piRNA counts. Collectively, these data demonstrate that FBXO24 is essential for sperm formation and piRNA production by regulating mRNA alternative splicing and MIWI degradation during spermiogenesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Spermatogenesis is a dynamic but well-organized process in which germ cells develop in the seminiferous tubules of the testis. Spermatogenesis comprises three phases: mitosis of the spermatogonia, meiosis of spermatocytes, and differentiation of round spermatids into mature sperm. The third phase is also known as spermiogenesis. During spermiogenesis, round spermatids undergo many significant changes, including the loss of cytoplasm, migration of cytoplasmic organelles, formation of the acrosome and flagellum, condensation of nuclei, and reorganization of mitochondria around the sperm midpiece (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). In mice, spermiogenesis is subdivided into 16 steps based on changes in acrosome structure and nuclear compaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Coordinated regulation of gene expressions in the round spermatids is essential for sperm formation. However, the underlying molecular mechanism that controls mRNA expression during spermiogenesis remains elusive.</p>
<p>FBXO24 (F-Box Protein 24) is a member of the F-box protein family characterized by an F-box domain. The F-box proteins constitute one of the subunits of the ubiquitin protein ligase complex called SCF (SKP1-cullin-F-box). The interaction between FBXO24 and the SCF subunits is unknown. The F-box domain recruits the F-box protein to the SCF complex, and the carboxy-terminal domain is a putative protein–protein interaction domain. According to the different substrate recognition domains, F-box protein was generally divided into three subclasses: F-box/WD repeat-containing protein (FBXW), leucine-rich repeat protein (FBXL), and F-box only protein (FBXO) with/without other unknown domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Compared with the studies of FBXW and FBXL, the roles of most members of the FBXO subfamily have yet to be defined. FBXO24 belongs to the FBXO class. Previous studies demonstrated some FBXO proteins could regulate spermatogenesis. For example, FBXO47 has been reported to be essential for meiosis I progression in the spermatocytes of mouse testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>), and FBXO43 was associated with male infertility and teratozoospermia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). In addition, FBXO24 has been reported to recognize deacetylated nucleoside diphosphate kinase A (NDPK-A) to enhance its degradation in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). In H1299 cells, FBXO24 could promote cell proliferation by mediating ubiquitination and degradation of protein arginine methyltransferase 6 (PRMT6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). However, the molecular and biological functions of FBXO24 remain unclear, especially its role in male fertility and sperm formation.</p>
<p>In this study, we find that FBXO24 transcript is abundantly expressed in the testis of humans and mice. The loss function of FBXO24 in mice resulted in male sterility, with sperm possessing a collapsed mitochondrial sheath and uncompacted chromatin. We revealed that FBXO24 interacts with splicing factors (e.g., SRSF2, SRSF3, and SRSF9) to mediate gene expressions during spermiogenesis. Unexpectedly, we discovered that FBXO24 mediates MIWI ubiquitination and regulates the chromatoid body (CB) architecture and piRNA production. Together, our study demonstrated that FBXO24 plays a critical role in controlling gene expression in haploid spermatids and sperm formation during spermiogenesis.</p>

<title>FBXO24 expressed in haploid spermatids during spermiogenesis</title>
<p>Multi-alignment and phylogenetic analysis revealed that <italic>Fbxo24</italic> encodes a highly conserved protein expressed in mammals, including humans and mice (<bold>Figure S1A</bold>). FBXO24 has two domains, F-box and regulator of chromatin condensation 1 (RCC1), which were also highly conserved in humans and mice <bold>(Figure S1B)</bold>. Interestingly, qPCR analysis of multiple mouse organs showed that FBXO24 mRNA was predominantly expressed in mouse testes <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. Consistent with this result, transcription expression of analysis of FBXO24 in various human organs from the GE-mini database revealed FBXO24 also a testis-enriched expression in human testes <bold>(Figure S1C)</bold>. Further qPCR analysis of the testis at different developmental stages and purified testicular cells showed that FBXO24 mRNA was highly expressed in the round spermatids and elongating spermatids <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1B-C</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. We used the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome-editing system to generate a mouse model containing the <italic>Fbxo24</italic> gene with a C-terminal HA epitope tag (<bold>Figure S2A</bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). To examine the protein level of FBXO24 in testes, we then characterized the tissue expression pattern of FBXO24 in various organs from adult <italic>Fbxo24</italic>-HA-tagged transgenic mice. Consistent with the mRNA expression showing a testis-enriched expression of FBXO24, FBXO24<sup>HA-Tag</sup> protein was exclusively expressed in the testes <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1D</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>, suggesting FBXO24 plays a role in sperm formation. To explore the subcellular localization of FBXO24 in male germ cells, we performed immunofluorescence analysis by co-staining of FBXO24<sup>HA-Tag</sup> protein with γ-H2AX (a marker of meiotic DNA damage response) or PNA (an acrosome marker) in adult <italic>Fbxo24</italic>-HA-Tagged transgenic mouse testes. The results showed that FBXO24 <sup>HA-Tag</sup> protein was exclusively localized in the nuclei and cytoplasm of spermatids at stages VI-IX <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1E-F</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>, demonstrating FBXO24 expressed in the round and elongating spermatids at steps 6-9. These results indicate that FBXO24 is an evolutionarily conserved testis-enriched protein specifically expressed in haploid spermatids during spermiogenesis.</p>

<title>FBXO24 deficiency results in defective spermiogenesis and male infertility in mice</title>
<p>To reveal the role of FBXO24 in male germ cell development and sperm formation, we generated <italic>Fbxo24</italic> knockout (KO) mice using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology. Two small guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were designed to target exon 3, which encodes the conserved F-box domain <bold>(Figure S2B)</bold>. To validate nucleotide deletion at the targeted loci, the corresponding genomic regions of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> were evaluated by PCR <bold>(Figure S2C)</bold>. qPCR analysis verified the mRNA expression of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> was almost undetectable in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mouse testes <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. To test the fecundity of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice, we crossed <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice with fertility-proved WT mice for at least 6 months. The fertility test results showed that <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO males were completely infertile, but the <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO females were fertile <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. Interestingly, we observed the testis size and the ratio of testis weight to body weight were comparable between <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO males and controls <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2C</bold></xref> and <bold>Figure S2D)</bold>. Consistent with these observations, histological analysis of adult testes and epididymis showed no obvious abnormalities in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice compared with WT <bold>(Figure S2E)</bold>. However, in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice, we found fewer elongating spermatids (at stages IX-X) and condensing spermatids (at stages XII) and a reduced number of condensed spermatids (at stages II-VIII) <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2D-E</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>, concomitant with increased apoptotic signals detected in late spermatids <bold>(Figure S2F-G)</bold>, which suggesting FBXO24 deficiency could affect spermatid development during spermiogenesis. To further demonstrate the critical function of FBXO24 during spermiogenesis, we attempted to use the <italic>Fbxo24</italic>-HA-tagged transgenic mice to rescue sperm formation and fertility in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO males. As expected, we found that expression of the transgenic FBXO24 could rescue the defects in spermiogenesis and infertility observed in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO male mice <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2F</bold></xref> <bold>and Figure S2H)</bold>, which confirmed the specific targeting of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> in the mutants and the true role of FBXO24 in spermiogenesis. Together, these data indicate that depletion of FBXO24 causes defective spermiogenesis, leading to male infertility.</p>

<title>Ablation of FBXO24 in mice causes disorganized mitochondrial sheath of spermatozoa</title>
<p>To elucidate the causes of sterility in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO males, we examined sperm count, sperm motility, and sperm morphology in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice. The results showed that the sperm count and motility were significantly reduced in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice compared with WT <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3A-B</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. Inspiringly, we found that most of the spermatozoa in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice displayed a disorganized mitochondrial sheath and had abnormal bending of the flagella <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3C</bold></xref>). In WT spermatozoa, the midpiece connected smoothly to the principal piece; however, in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa, a gap in the midpiece can be observed <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3C-D</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>, leading to many sperm with an abrupt bending of the tail in the region of the neck and midpiece <bold>(Figure S3A)</bold>. In addition, we observed the midpiece length was significantly shorter in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mouse spermatozoa compared with WT (21.67 ± 1.524 μm in WT <italic>vs.</italic> 14.80 ± 3.430 μm in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO) <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3E</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. To better reveal spermatozoon abnormalities in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice, we decided to examine the ultrastructure of the spermatozoa using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). In WT spermatozoa, the midpiece was normally populated with many mitochondria in a spiraling fashion. However, in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa, mitochondria near the annulus were absent, resulting in a shorter mitochondrial sheath <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3F</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) further confirmed that mitochondria were not present near the annulus or neck and left apparent gaps along the mitochondrial sheath in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3G</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>, indicating mitochondrial sheath formation was disrupted. In addition, some mitochondria in the midpiece of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa appeared large and vacuolar. To determine whether the failure in the assembly of the mitochondrial sheath could cause disrupted flagellar development, we examined cross-sections of the <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO sperm flagellum. In the midpiece, well-defined outer dense fibers (ODFs) and the axoneme consisting of the typical “9 + 2” microtubules were observed in WT spermatozoa, whereas the <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa displayed incomplete axonemes with missing axonemal microtubules <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3H</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. In the principal piece, the <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa also showed completely or partially lacking ODFs and a typical “9 + 2” microtubular structure <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3H</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. These severe flagellar defects may explain why <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa displayed decreased motility <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3B</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>.</p>

<title>Loss of FBXO24 results in aberrant mRNA alternative splicing in the round spermatids</title>
<p>Since FBXO24 expressed in the nucleus of the round spermatids, we speculated that FBXO24 might interact with the key splicing factors.

The IP-MS results showed many splicing factors, such as SRSF2, SRSF3, and SRSF9, highly enriched in HA-immunoprecipitates (<bold>Table S1</bold>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we identified FBXO24 as a testis-enriched F-box protein conserved in mammals and highly expressed in the round spermatids and elongating spermatids. To define its biological roles <italic>in vivo</italic>, we generated genetically engineered <italic>Fbxo24</italic> knockout and <italic>Fbxo24</italic> HA-tagged transgenic mouse models. Our functional study demonstrated that FBXO24 is essential for spermiogenesis and piRNA production. FBXO24 deficiency leads to remarkable histone retention and the disruption of histone-to-protamine transition in the mature sperm. A growing number of studies have demonstrated impaired chromatin condensation can cause nuclear damages as DNA denaturation or fragmentation often associated with male infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). The molecular basis of nuclear condensation is related to key events such as the expression of testis-specific histone variants, post-translational modifications of histones, and transient DNA strand breaks. Indeed, we found that, in the current study, FBXO24 could modulate the homeostasis of the histone-to-protamine transition regulators PHF7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>), TSSK6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>), and RNF8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), while RNF8 was reported to be independent to the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the abnormalities of mitochondrial sheaths are observed in infertile men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>), the key proteins implicated in sperm mitochondrial sheath formation largely remain unclear due to a lack of good animal models with the typical phenotype. Notably, we found that the round spermatids and spermatozoon of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice have impaired mitochondrial architecture, with mitochondrial size heterogeneity and a more open structure of the mitochondria with less crista. The defective mitochondria were associated with energetic disturbances and reduced sperm motility. Using MitoTracker staining and an electron microscope, we demonstrated the mitochondrial structure is severely disrupted in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa. Previous studies showed abnormalities of the annulus (<italic>Sept4</italic> and <italic>Sept12</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), and chromatid bodies (<italic>Tssk1</italic> and <italic>Tssk2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>) can disrupt abnormal mitochondrial coiling. The chromatoid body was considered to migrate to the caudal end of the developing middle piece of the flagellum, moving in front of the mitochondria that are engaged in mitochondrial sheath morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). This study revealed that FBXO24 regulates spatiotemporal mitochondrial dynamics during spermiogenesis. FBXO24 might serve as a critical protein in regulating sperm mitochondrial sheath formation, which expands the knowledge of sperm mitochondria formation. In addition, we found that FBXO24 is indispensable for proper flagellum formation, such as axoneme and ODFs. Therefore, the reduction of sperm motility of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO male mice observed in this study might attribute to the uncompleted mitochondrial formation of the middle piece and defective flagellum assembling.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that the RNA-seq data of the round spermatids showed that FBXO24 ablation leads to dysregulation in the mRNA expression of many genes related to chromatin, mitochondria, and flagellum. We found mRNA expression changes were related to the mRNA alternative splicing in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO round spermatids. Combined with our immunoprecipitation evidence of molecular interactions between FBXO24 and the key splice factors (SRSF2, SRSF3, and SRSF9), it is reasonable to infer that dysregulation of these splicing factors inevitably would lead to more splicing errors in their target genes, thus amplifying the initial adverse effects and generating a vicious circle of aberrant splicing. Of note, many genetic changes identified in this study have been closely associated with sperm formation. For example, <italic>Zmynd12</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>), <italic>Bbs7</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>), and <italic>Ube2j2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>) were required for flagellum function and male fertility. <italic>Map7d1</italic> facilitates microtubule stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>) and <italic>Mfn1</italic> deficiency leads to defects in mitochondrial activity and male infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). <italic>Phf7</italic> modulates BRDT stability and histone-to-protamine exchange during spermiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). <italic>Kat5</italic> encodes an essential lysine acetyltransferase, which is involved in regulating gene expression and chromatin remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). <italic>Nucb2</italic> suppresses the acrosome reaction in sperm within the mouse epididymis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Therefore, our study, for the first time, provides evidence that FBXO24 interacts with the splicing factors to regulate the alternative splicing of mRNA involved in round spermatid development. However, the exact regulatory mechanism of how FBXO24 facilitates the mRNA alternative splicing needs further study.</p>
<p>MIWI and piRNAs are highly abundant in round spermatids, but their levels start to decline normally in elongating spermatids and are completely eliminated in matured sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Interestingly, Mo-Fang Liu et al. reported that piRNA-triggered MIWI degradation occurs in late spermatids through the APC/C-26S proteasome pathway in vitro, which in turn leads to piRNA elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). As many piRNAs also appear to have the capacity to target diverse mRNA, they demonstrated that piRNAs act extensively as siRNAs to degrade specific mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). Overexpression of a piRNA cluster in the mouse genome can reduce the expression of mRNA required for spermatogenesis, leading to male infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). The level of 29–31nt piRNAs was remarkably increased in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO testes, which raises a possibility that piRNA-related transcriptional repression might contribute to the reduction of mature sperm in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice. In the current study, we identified that testis-enriched FBXO24 could interact with MIWI and mediate its degradation via the K48-linked ubiquitination, which provides new insight into MIWI degradation during spermiogenesis.</p>
<p>In summary, this study revealed a novel role for FBXO24 in controlling mRNA alternative splicing of round spermatids and MIWI/piRNA pathway, and demonstrated that FBXO24 is required for mitochondrial organization and chromatin condensation in mouse spermatozoa <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 10</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. The results disclosed FBXO24 interacts with splicing factors to regulate the mRNA splicing of some essential genes required for spermiogenesis, which probably functionally connects the dysregulation of genes involved in mitochondria migration and histone removal during spermiogenesis. FBXO24 interplays with the subunits of the SCF complex and mediated MIWI degradation. This study extensively expands our understanding of the mechanistic explanation of FBXO24 for the regulation of spermiogenesis.</p>

<title>Generation of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> mutant mice</title>
<p><italic>Fbxo24</italic> knockout (KO) mice were generated by CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Briefly, the two pairs of single-guided RNAs (sgRNAs) with the sequence sgRNA-1: 5’-TGTGGAGGCGCATCTGTCGAAGG-3’ and sgRNA-2 5’-GTCAAAGACTTGGTCGCCCTAGG-3’ were designed for targeting for the third exon of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> gene.

<title>Generation of <italic>Fbxo24</italic>-HA tagged transgenic mice</title>
<p><italic>Fbxo24</italic>-HA-tagged transgenic mice were also generated by CRISPR/Cas9 technology and haploid embryonic stem cell microinjection. The sgRNAs of the C-terminus of the target gene <italic>Fbxo24</italic> (AAGAAGAGGGGTTCAGCTCT) were synthesized, annealed, and ligated to the pX330-mCherry plasmid. For the construction of the HA-tag DNA donor, the sequences encoding the left homologous arm, the HA tag, and the right homologous arm were amplified and ligated to the linear pMD19T. DKO-AG-haESCs were transfected with CRISPR-Cas9 plasmid and HA tag DNA donor. At 24 h after transfection, the mCherry-positive haploid cells were enriched. In 7–8 days after plating, single colonies were picked up, and positive colonies for the HA tag were selected by genomic DNA PCR amplification for Sanger sequencing. DKO-AG-haESCs with <italic>Fbxo24</italic>-C-HA were arrested in M-phase by culturing in a medium containing 0.05 μg/ml demecolcine for 10 h and then used for intracytoplasmic injection as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). Intracytoplasmic AG-haESC injection (ICAHCI) embryos were cultured in KSOM medium for 24 h to reach the two-cell stage. 15–20 two-cell embryos were transferred into each oviduct of pseudo-pregnant females to produce <italic>Fbxo24</italic>-C-HA semi-cloned mice (F0). Then, the F0 female mice were crossed with WT male mice to generate heterozygous <italic>Fbxo24</italic>-C-HA F1 male mice for the experiments.</p>

<p>In this study, Li et al., report that FBXO24 contributes to sperm development by modulating alternative mRNA splicing and MIWI degradation during spermiogenesis. The authors demonstrated that FBXO24 deficiency impairs sperm head formation, midpiece compartmentalization, and axonemal/peri-axonemal organization in mature sperm, which causes sperm motility defects and male infertility. In addition, FBXO24 interacts with various mRNA splicing factors, which causes altered splicing events in Fbxo24-null round spermatids. Interestingly, FBXO24 also modulates MIWI levels via its polyubiquitination in round spermatids. Thus, the authors address that FBXO24 modulates global mRNA levels by regulating piRNA-mediated MIWI function and splicing events in testicular haploid germ cells.</p>
<p>This study is performed with various experimental approaches to explore and elucidate underlying molecular mechanisms for the FBXO24-mediated sperm defects during germ cell development. Overall, the experiments were designed properly and performed well to support the authors' observation in each part. In addition, the findings in this study are useful for understanding the physiological and developmental significance of FBXO24 in the male germ line, which can provide insight into impaired sperm development and male infertility.</p>
<p>In the revised manuscript, the authors address most of the concerns raised in the previous review. The following are representative remaining points.</p>
<p>• Quantification of the defective, vacuolar mitochondria (80%) and missing annulus (30%) was not shown in the figures or described in the results as well as in a few other figures.</p>

<p>Spermatogenesis describes a complex sequence of differentiation events that lead to the development of genetically distinct male germ cells. The final part of spermatogenesis is called spermiogenesis, in which spermatids differentiate into mature sperm by developing an acrosome and a motile flagellum, which are required for reaching and successfully penetrating the oocyte. This process of spermatogenesis is based on a coordinated regulation of gene expressions in round spermatids. In the current study, FBXO24 was identified as a highly expressed protein in human and mouse testis. To define its biological role in vivo, the authors generated genetically engineered Fbxo24 knockout and Fbxo24-HA-labeled transgenic mouse models.</p>
<p>To elucidate the causes of the observed sterility in Fbxo24-KO males, the authors performed molecular and phenotypic analyses that revealed aberrant histone retention, incomplete axonemes, oversized chromatoid bodies (CB), and abnormal mitochondrial coiling along the sperm flagella. These results support the causal role of the FBXO24 gene in sperm motility.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the authors carefully characterized by SEM, TEM and western blot analyses that deletion of FBXO24 leads to incomplete histone-to-protamine exchange and defective chromatin interaction during spermiogenesis. In addition to increased MIWI expression, the authors show that FBXO24 interacts with SCF subunits and mediates the degradation of MIWI via K48-linked polyubiquitination.</p>
<p>This is a solid work demonstrating the role of FBXO24 in modulating alternative mRNA splicing, MIWI degradation and normal spermiogenesis.</p>

<p>This work is carried out by the research group led by Shuiqiao Yuan, who has a long interest and significant contribution in the field of male germ cell development. The authors study a protein for which limited information existed prior to this work, a component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, FBXO24. The authors generated the first FBXO24 KO mouse model reported in the literature using CRISPR, which they complement with HA-tagged FBXO24 transgenic model in the KO background. The authors begin their study with a very careful examination of the expression pattern of the FBXO24 gene at the level of mRNA and the HA-tagged transgene, and they provide conclusive evidence that the protein is expressed exclusively in the mouse testis and specifically in post-meiotic spermatids of stages VI to IX, which include early stages of spermatid elongation and nuclear condensation. The authors report a fully sterile phenotype for male mice, while female mice are normal. Interestingly, the testis size and the populations of spermatogenic cells in the KO mutant mice show small (but significant) reduction compared to the WT testis. Importantly, the mature sperm from KO animals show a series of defects that were very thoroughly documented in this work by scanning and transmission electron microscopy; this data constitutes a very strong point in this paper. FBXO24 KO sperm have severe defects in the mitochondrial sheath with missing mitochondria near the annulus, and missing outer dense fibers. Collectively these defects cause abnormal bending of the flagellum and severely reduced sperm motility. Moreover, defects in nuclear condensation are observed with faint nuclear staining of elongating and elongated spermatids, and reduction of protein levels of protamine 2 combined with increased levels of histones and transition protein 1. All the above are in line with the observed male sterility phenotype.</p>
<p>The authors also performed RNASeq in the KO animal, and found profound changes in the abundance of thousands of mRNAs; changes in mRNA splicing patterns were noted as well. This data reveals deeply affected gene expression patterns in the FBXO24 KO testis, which further supports the essential role that this factor serves in spermiogenesis. Unfortunately, a molecular explanation of what causes these changes is missing; it is still possible that they are an indirect consequence of the absence of FBXO24 and not directly caused by it.</p>
<p>The finding that Miwi protein levels are increased in the FBXO24 KO testis is an important point in this work, and it is in agreement with the observed increased size of the chromatoid body, where most of Miwi protein is accumulated in round spermatids. This finding is well supported with experiments performed in 293T cells showing that Miwi ubiquitination is FBXO24 dependent in this ectopic system. Moreover, the authors detect reduced ubiquitination of endogenous Miwi protein immunoprecipitated from FBXO24 KO testis. Consistent with an increase in Miwi protein levels, Miwi-sized piRNAs show increased abundance in total RNA from FBXO24 KO testis. It has been documented that Piwi proteins stabilize their piRNA cargo, so the increase in piRNA levels in 29-32 nt sizes is most likely not a result of altered biogenesis, but increased half-life of the piRNAs as a result of Miwi upregulation. piRNAs have been involved in the regulation of mRNAs in the post-meiotic spermatid, but it is unclear how increased Miwi protein and its piRNA cargo at the levels observed in this study contribute to the complete infertility phenotype of the FBXO24 KO male mice.</p>
<p>Therefore, a well-reasoned narrative on if and how the absence of FBXO24 as an E3 ubiquitin ligase is responsible for the observed mRNA and protein differential expression is largely absent. If FBXO24-mediated ubiquitination is required for normal protein degradation during spermiogenesis, protein level increase should be the direct consequence of genuine FBXO24 targets in the KO testis. Apart from Miwi, the possible involvement of ubiquitination was not shown for any other proteins that the authors found interact with FBXO24 such as splicing factors SRSF2, SRSF3, SRSF9, or any of the other proteins whose levels were found to be changed (reduced, thus the change in the KO is less likely due to absence of ubiquitination) such as ODF2, AKAP3, TSSK4, PHF7, TSSK6 and RNF8. Interestingly, the authors do observe increased amounts of histones and transition proteins, but reduced amounts of protamines, which directly shows that histone to protamine transition is indeed affected in the FBXO24 KO testis, consistent with the observed less condensed nuclei of spermatozoa. Could histones and transition proteins be targets of the proposed ubiquitin ligase activity of FBXO24, and in its absence, histone replacement is abrogated? Providing experimental evidence to address this possibility would greatly expand our understanding on why FBXO24 is essential during spermiogenesis.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The minor weakness of the study is inconsistent use of terminology throughout the manuscript, occasional logic-jump in their flow, and missing detailed description in methodologies used either in the text or Materials and Methods section, which can be easily rectified.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Importantly, besides the Miwi ubiquitination experiment which is performed in a heterologous and therefore may not be ideal for extracting conclusions, the possible involvement of ubiquitination was not shown for any other proteins that the authors found that interact with FBXO24. Could histones and transition proteins be targets of the proposed ubiquitin ligase activity of FBXO24, and in its absence, histone replacement is abrogated?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comments. The histones and transition proteins were not found in the immunoprecipitates of FBXO24, suggesting they are not the direct targets of FBXO24, shown in Figure S3G.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Miwi should be immunoprecipitated and Miwi ubiquitination should be detected (with WB or mass spec) in WT testis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with this suggestion. In the revision, the expression and ubiquitination of MIWI were detected in WT testis by the immunoprecipitation and ubiquitination assay, as shown in Figure 8H.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Therefore, the claim that FBXO24 is essential for piRNA biogenesis/production (lines 308, 314) is not appropriately supported.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the comment. We have revised the description and modified the claim on page 11.</p>

<p>Reviewing Editor's note for revision</p>
<p>(1) As noted by all three reviewers, as currently written the rationale to focus on MIWI is not entirely clear. A transitional narrative to focus on MIWI needs to be provided as well as an explanation for how the absence of FBXO24 as an E3 ubiquitin ligase is responsible for the observed mRNA and protein differential expression.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your comments. We have supplemented the transitional narrative by focusing on MIWI and explained mRNA and protein differential expression upon FBXO24 deletion, shown on Page 7 and Page 13, respectively.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) As it can be indirect, mass spec detection of MIWI in testis co-IP and MIWI ubiquitination should be detected (with WB or mass spec) in WT testis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the revision, the expression and ubiquitination of MIWI were detected in WT testis by the immunoprecipitation and ubiquitination assay, as shown in Figure 8H.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Please tone down the claim that FBXO24 is essential for piRNA biogenesis/production as it requires further evidence.</p>

<p>(4) Ontology analysis of the genes with abnormally spliced mRNAs to provide an explanation for developmental defects.</p>

<p>In the revision, we have performed the ontology analysis and provided new data regarding the abnormally spliced genes, as shown in Figure S4D.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Major comments</p>
<p>(1) The authors performed mainly with the WT (or knock-in) and Fbxo24-knockout mouse model. Do the heterozygous males and their sperm have any physiological defects like FBXO24-deficient mice?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a good question. We did the phenotype analysis and found that heterozygous males are all fertile, and their sperm do not have any physiological defects.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Fbxo24-KO sperm carries swollen mitochondria. How do the mitochondria affect sperm function?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising this interesting question. Based on our data and published literature, the defective mitochondria were associated with energetic disturbances and reduced sperm motility, as shown on Page 12.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) TEM images show that Fbxo24-KO spermatids carry swollen mitochondria and enlarged chromatoid bodies. How the swollen mitochondria and enlarged chromatid are defective for sperm motility and flagellar development, requires more explanation. In addition, it is unclear how the enlarged diameter of the chromatoid body is critical for normal sperm development.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comments. The chromatoid bodies are considered to be engaged in mitochondrial sheath morphogenesis. Analysis of the chromatoid bodies' RNA content reveals enrichment of PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), further emphasizing the role of the chromatoid bodies in post-transcriptional regulation of spermatogenetic genes. We added this explanation on Page 12-13.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors only show band images to compare the protein amounts between WT and KO sperm and round spermatids. As the blots for loading controls are not clear, the authors should quantify the protein levels and perform a statistical comparison.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We quantified the protein levels and performed a statistical comparison, as shown in Figure S3B.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The authors show the defective sperm head structure from Fbxo24-KO sperm in Figure 5. However, the Fbxo24-KO sperm heads seem quite normal in Figure 3. How many sperm show defective sperm head structure? In addition, the authors observed altered histone-to-protamine conversion in sperm, but it is unclear whether the altered nuclear protein conversion causes morphological defects in the sperm head.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the comments. In our study, we found over 80% of Fbxo24 KO sperm showed defective structure in the sperm head. Altered histone-to-protamine conversion caused the decondensed nucleus of Fbxo24 KO sperm. Notably, in many knockout mice studies, impaired chromatin condensation is frequently associated with abnormal sperm head morphology, as shown in reference 15 of Page 8.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The authors compare the protein levels of RNF8, PHF7, TSSK6, which participate in nuclear protein replacement in sperm. However, considering the sperm is the endpoint for the nuclear protein conversion, it is unclear to compare the protein levels in mature sperm. The authors might want to compare the protein levels in developing germ cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. Yes, we actually detected the protein levels of RNF8, PHF7, and TSSK6 in the testes, not in sperm. We have corrected it in the Figure 5E. We apologize for our carelessness.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7)This reviewer suggests describing more rationales for how the authors focus on the MIWI protein. Also, it is wondered whether MIWI is also detected from testis co-IP mass spectrometry.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with this suggestion. Since MIWI was a core component of CB and also identified as an FBOX24 interacting partner from our immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) (Table S1), we focused on the examination of MIWI expression between WT and Fbxo24 KO testes. We have added this description in the revision (see lines 191-193 on page 7).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) The authors need to provide a more detailed explanation for how the altered piRNA production affects physiological defects in germ cell development. In addition, it will be good to describe more how the piRNAs affect a broad range of mRNA levels.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comments. The previously published studies have demonstrated that piRNAs could act as siRNAs to degrade specific mRNAs during male germ cell development and maturation. We have cited these studies on lines 369-372 of Page 13.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) The authors observed an altered splicing process in the absence of FBXO24. However, it is a little bit confusing how the altered splicing events affect developmental defects. Therefore, the authors should state which mRNAs have undergone abnormal splicing processes and provide ontology analysis for the genes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have performed the ontology analysis and showed the new data in Figure S4D.</p>

<p>Minor comments</p>
<p>(1) Figure 1A-C - Statistical comparison is missed. Numbers for biological replication should be described in corresponding legends.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>The primer information for qPCR was provided, as shown in Table S7.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The authors describe that Fbxo24-KO sperm show abrupt bending of the tail. However, the description is unclear and the sperm shown in Figure 3C seems quite normal. The authors should clarify the abnormal bending pattern of the tail and show quantified results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing out this issue. In Fbxo24 KO sperm, abnormal bending of the sperm tails mainly included neck bending and midpiece bending. We have shown them in Figure S3A.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) The authors mention that Fbxo24-KO sperm have swollen mitochondria at the midpiece, but this is also unclear. How many mitochondria are swollen in Fbxo24-KO sperm?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a good question. However, since it is very difficult to observe all of the mitochondria in each sperm using the electronic microscope, we could not quantify the swollen mitochondria in Fbxo24 KO sperm.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Scale bar information is missed - Fig 3C insets, Fig 3D, Fig 3F insets, 4A insets, Figure 4C insets.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>All the scale bars have been added.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) How many sperm have annulus defects? In Figure 3F, WT sperm does not have an annulus, which could be damaged during sample preparation. Is the annulus defects in Fbxo24-KO sperm consistent?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for asking these questions. Based on our results, about 30% of Fbxo24 KO sperm showed defective annulus structure. Since both TEM (Figure 3F) and SEM (Figure 3G) results clearly showed the defective annulus structure of Fbxo24 KO sperm, we believe the annulus defects are consistent and highly unlikely caused by sample preparation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) A Cross-section image for the endpiece of Fbxo24-KO sperm is not suitable. There is a longitudinal column structure of the principal piece.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comments. It is difficult to observe a completely longitudinal structure of sperm tail under TEM. The cross-section of the endpiece and principal piece allowed us know the structure of the axoneme, ODFs and fibrous sheath (FS).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(11) The endpiece of Fbxo24-KO sperm seems to have a normal axoneme. Do all endpieces of Fbxo24KO sperm have normal axoneme? Also, the authors need to describe whether an axonemal structure is damaged and disrupted in all Fbxo24-KO sperm.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our TEM data showed the axonemal structure was impaired in the endpiece of Fbxo24 KO sperm (See right panels of Figure 3H). Moreover, based on the ultrastructure analysis of TEM, we found over 90% of Fbxo24 sperm had a damaged axonemal structure.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(12) Reference blots in Fig 3I, 3J, 4E (left), 5C and 5E are quite faint. The authors should replace the blot images.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing out this. We have rerun Western blot multiple times but could not obtain better images due to antibody sensitivity. However, we quantified the protein levels and performed a statistical comparison, as shown in Figure S3B, to establish a good readout from these images for the readers.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Major comments</p>
<p>(1) Please provide a schematic of HA-Fbxo24 knock-in construct and strategy together with knockout (Figure S2) or even separately early in Figure S1. The description of using the transgenic mouse is mentioned even earlier than the knockout but there are no citations or methods provided in the text other than that listed in Materials and Methods.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. As suggested, the schematic of the HA-Fbxo24 knock-in strategy has been supplemented in Figure S2A. The description of using the transgenic mouse has been added to the results, as shown on page 4 of lines 102-103.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Also, it is not clear to what extent the phenotypic and molecular characterization of HA-transgenic mice is performed. For example, Lines 134-139: The use of Fbxo24-HA labeled transgenic mice results in the rescue of spermatogenesis and fertility as shown in Figure 2F by measuring the litter size. It is not clear how this observation leads the author to state that this rescues defects in spermiogenesis. Please clarify how and what other measures are taken to support this conclusion. Is the observed infertility due to defects in spermatogenesis or spermiogenesis?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your question. We crossed FBXO24-HATag males with FBXO24−/− females to obtain FBXO24−/−; FBXO24-HATag males. We examined the testes volume and histological morphology of FBXO24−/−; FBXO24-HATag males and found that they were similar to FBXO24+/−; FBXO24-HATag littermates, indicating that spermatogenesis was restored, as shown in Figure S2H.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Line 107 vs Line 114: Please use the terminology spermatogenesis and spermiogenesis consistently throughout the text. Earlier in the introduction, the authors clearly defined that spermatogenesis involves three phases, with the third phase referred to as spermiogenesis. However, the author concludes in the first line that &quot;FBXO24 plays a role during spermatogenesis&quot; while summarizing at the end of the paragraph that this protein is &quot;expressed in haploid spermatids specifically during spermiogenesis&quot;. Therefore, it is not clear whether the authors conclude that FBXO24 is important for all of spermatogenesis (line 107) or only for part of spermiogenesis (line 114). Another example is line 219 vs. 238: At this point in the manuscript, it is again unclear whether the authors want to study molecular changes during spermatogenesis or spermiogenesis upon FBXO24 depletion. Many examples of such cases throughout the text, and it is recommended to be consistent in using more restrictive terminology whenever applicable for a clear interpretation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank you for your careful review. We have double-checked the terminology of spermatogenesis and spermiogenesis and made it consistent throughout the text of the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

<p>I would like to see the description of the FBXO24 immunoprecipitation experiment performed in HEK293T cells. This somatic cell line does not normally express Miwi, so how Miwi was detected in FBXO24 mCherry IP beads? It is not mentioned if Miwi is expressed from a recombinant vector in this experiment. Similarly, I would like to see a better description of the experiment described in the same paragraph towards the end of it with the ubiquitin peptides, it is not clear.</p>

Most of the genome browser views in this image only show affected exons and it is impossible to see if these alone are affected or if the reduced RNAseq coverage in those exons is a result of overall reduced mapped reads in these genes. Also, a fixed Y axis with the same max value should be shown for these genome browser snapshots so that the expression level is comparable between the two genotypes.</p>

<p>Thank you for your comments. Loading control of RT-PCR and scale range of Y axis were added in new Figure 7.</p>

<p>I cannot understand exactly what is shown in Figure 9B. Some elements marked on the X-axis are single base locations (-2K, TSS, +2K) and others are stretches of sequences so they cannot be equivalent. Why there is only an intron shown? There should be a measure of normalized expression on the Y-axis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your questions. The X-axis means that genome segments were scaled to the same size and were calculated the signal abundance, which was analyzed by computeMatrix. Aim to know the piRNA source, piRNA was mapped to the gene body, including introns, CDS and UTRs. The value of the Y-axis is the normalized count.</p>

<p>Figure 6F was used to illustrate the number of different types of mRNA splicing upon FBXO24 deletion in the round spermatids. To better understand the splicing for the reader, we decided to keep it.</p>
