Arrhythmic pathology is rooted in the cardiac conduction system, but the mechanism is complex and not fully understood.

Both genetic reduction of Akh and eliminating the Akh producing cells (APC) rescued HFD-induced arrhythmia, whereas heart rhythm was normal in Akh receptor mutants (<italic>AkhR<sup>null</sup></italic>). Furthermore, we discovered a pair of cardiac neurons that express high levels of Akh receptor. These are located near the posterior heart, make synaptic connections at the heart muscle, and regulate heart rhythm.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Arrhythmia refers to an irregular, decreased (bradycardia), or increased (tachycardia) heartbeat. Temporary disruption is usually benign, however chronic arrhythmia has been linked to significantly increased risks for stroke, heart failure, and cardiac arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kannel et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Nattel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Roberts-Thomson et al., 2011</xref>). Its pathogenesis is rooted in the cardiac conduction system; however, the mechanism is complex and much remains unknown. Two well-established risk factors that directly contribute to the development of cardiovascular disorders and arrhythmia are obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gupta et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Powell-Wiley et al., 2021</xref>) and diabetes mellites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Aune et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Huxley et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). In fact, a longitudinal study into obesity (13.7 years mean follow-up; 5,282 participants) found a 4% increased risk for atrial fibrillation (a form of arrhythmia) per 1-unit increased body mass index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). The other major risk factor, diabetes mellitus has been shown to impact the cardiac conduction system, leading to increased risk of developing atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kannel et al., 1998</xref>). A meta-analysis found that patients with diabetes had a 28-40% increased risk for developing atrial fibrillation, with a 20% risk increase reported for pre-diabetic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Aune et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Huxley et al., 2011</xref>). The relationship between higher blood glucose levels and increased risk for atrial fibrillation was dose-responsive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Aune et al., 2018</xref>). Diabetes mellites, when considered a cause of disrupted metabolism, as well as obesity have been independently associated with increased risk for atrial fibrillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). However, to what extent diabetes, blood glucose, and obesity contribute to atrial fibrillation, independently or collectively, and through which pathomechanism requires further study.</p>
<p>Antagonistic actions by glucagon and insulin regulate glucose metabolism. Besides regulating glucose release from the liver, glucagon facilitates the release of glucose as well as lipids from the fat body, acts as a satiety factor in the central nervous system, affects the glomerular filtration rate, and regulates intra-islet secretion of insulin, glucagon and somatostatin to meet increased energy demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Habegger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Heppner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Vuguin and Charron, 2011</xref>). These glucagon regulatory effects are evident in patient studies that showed that an impaired counter-regulatory glucagon response, observed as increased free plasma insulin levels, contributes to glucose instability in patients with long-term diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Scott et al., 1980</xref>); that consumption of dietary fats leads to increased plasma glucagon levels in healthy volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Radulescu et al., 2010</xref>); and that plasma glucagon levels were significantly higher in people considered obese compared to those considered lean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Stern et al., 2019</xref>). Glucagon has been repeatedly shown to affect heart contraction and heart rate. However, the nature of this effect is complex; whether glucagon acts anti- or pro-arrhythmogenic seems to depend on context, such as a non-failing heart or a heart at acute or chronic failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Neumann et al., 2023</xref>). That said, glucagon-producing tumors, <italic>i.e.</italic>, glucagonomas, can cause tachycardia (a form of arrhythmia defined as &gt;100 heart beats per minute) and heart failure without secondary cause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chang-Chretien et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, glucagonoma tumor resection resulted in a normalized heart rate and a return to typical heart size and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chang-Chretien et al., 2004</xref>). Similarly, glucagon infusion in healthy human volunteers induced arrhythmias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jaca et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Markiewicz et al., 1978</xref>). Thus, while glucagon clearly affects heart rhythm, when considering the underlying mechanism much remains unknown.</p>
<p>The link between high-fat diet (HFD), glucagon, and cardiac arrhythmia is conserved and well-established in animal models. In fact, studies from the 1960s already showed that glucagon increases heart rate in a variety of mammalian species, including dogs, cats, guinea pigs, and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Farah and Tuttle, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lucchesi et al., 1968</xref>). More recently, it was shown in mice that both glucagon and the glucagon receptor (Gcgr) are involved in heart rate regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Mukharji et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Sowden et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> adipokinetic hormone (Akh), the functional equivalent to human glucagon, is expressed in a small cluster of endocrine neurons, Akh producing cells (APC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kim and Rulifson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lee and Park, 2004</xref>). These cells in the corpora cardiaca near the esophagus function similar to islet cells in mammals, including the mechanism that regulates hormone secretion, and are essential for larval glucose homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kim and Rulifson, 2004</xref>). Like glucagon, Akh is known to also mobilize lipids from the fat body to regulate glucose levels, in the form of trehalose, in the circulating hemolymph to accommodate increased energy demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Isabel et al., 2005</xref>). Likewise, increased Akh increases the heart rate in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Noyes et al., 1995</xref>). These studies together suggest that glucagon and glucagon signaling, aside from regulating blood sugar levels, play an evolutionarily conserved role in heart rate regulation.</p>
<p><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> is a well-established model to study heartbeat and heart arrhythmia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Birse et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Ding et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Ocorr et al., 2007</xref>). For example, HFD-fed flies were used to study the genetic mechanisms of cardiac dysfunction in obesity. It found that HFD leads to reduced cardiac contractility and a reduced heart period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Birse et al., 2010</xref>). Notably, this phenotype was attenuated by intervention at the insulin-TOR signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Birse et al., 2010</xref>), thus supporting a connection between obesity, glucagon, insulin and cardiac function. Here, we used <italic>Drosophila</italic> fed a HFD to study heart arrhythmia. HFD led to increased Akh in the APC of the corpora cardiaca. We then identified a hitherto undescribed pair of cardiac neurons near the posterior heart that highly express the Akh receptor (AkhR) and directly innervate the fly heart. We show that these AkhR cardiac neurons (ACN) regulate heart rhythm in the flies and mediate the HFD-induced arrhythmia. Given the conservation of Akh/glucagon signaling, these findings likely have implications for arrhythmia in patients. Given the significance of the vagus nerve in cardiac rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ambache and Lippold, 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cai et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Freeman, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">González et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kharbanda et al., 2023</xref>; van Weperen and Vaseghi, 2023) it could fulfill a similar function.</p>

<title>High-fat diet increases heart rate and arrhythmia index</title>
<p>All flies (<italic>w</italic><sup>1118</sup>) that eclosed (<italic>i.e.</italic>, adults that emerged from pupa) within 8 hours were sorted (females only) and transferred to fresh food vials (25 flies per vial) containing normal fat diet (NFD) or high-fat diet (HFD, NutriFly diet supplemented with 14% fat) for 7 days. At which point, we determined the heartbeat of the flies using optical coherence tomography (OCT) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Flies on a HFD show a significantly reduced heart period and increased arrhythmia index compared to NFD-fed flies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-D</xref>). These findings are in agreement with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Birse et al., 2010</xref>) and indicate that HFD imposes a pathogenic effect on heart function.</p>

<title>High-fat diet up-regulates Akh expression and increases Akh producing cell (APC) activity</title>
<p>The ingestion of superfluous macronutrients has a great impact on metabolism. We observed enlarged crops, the functional equivalent to the human stomach, in the HFD-fed flies (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1</xref>). We asked whether the metabolic signaling pathways contributed to the HFD-caused pathogenic effect on the heart. Akh, the functional equivalent to human glucagon, is expressed by a group of neuroendocrine cells known as APC in the corpora cardiaca (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lee and Park, 2004</xref>). Indeed, flies that carried <italic>Akh-</italic>Gal4 to express GFP showed Akh producing cells at the corpora cardiaca, which attaches to the esophagus, just anterior to the proventriculus (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Quantitative PCR showed that the expression of <italic>Akh</italic> was significantly up-regulated in the flies fed a HFD, compared to NFD-fed flies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, to test whether the HFD-induced increase in Akh in the APC affects APC neuron activity, we used CaLexA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Masuyama et al., 2012</xref>). A basal level of CaLexA fluorescence was observed in the APC of NFD-fed flies, while a significantly higher fluorescence was detected in the APC of HFD-fed flies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C, D</xref>). This shows that HFD increases APC neuron activity. Taken together, our data show that HFD activates Akh expression in the APC and increases APC activity.</p>

<p>To determine the AkhR expression pattern, we used <italic>AkhR-</italic>Gal4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lee et al., 2018</xref>) to drive the expression of GFP. The adipose fat body tissue is a major organ that expresses AkhR at the embryonic and larval stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Grönke et al., 2007</xref>), as well as in the adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bharucha et al., 2008</xref>). Likewise, we observed GFP fluorescence in the fat body in <italic>AkhR-</italic>Gal4<italic>&gt;GFP</italic> flies (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, B). Notably, no fluorescence was detected in the cardiac muscles. However, we did find two neurons with strong GFP fluorescence, indicative of high expression levels of AkhR, located near the posterior end of the heart tube (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). These neurons had elaborate neurites along the heart tube (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B-D</xref>) and formed synaptic connections with heart muscles, as revealed by immunostaining for active zone marker Bruchpilot (Brp) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E, F</xref>). These two neurons likely communicate with the heart muscle via these neuromuscular junctions. Therefore, were refer to these two neurons as AkhR cardiac neurons (ACN).</p>

<title>The role of AkhR, glucagon-like receptor, in regulating heart rate and rhythm</title>
<p>Heart function is dependent on glucose as an energy source. Glucagon converts stored glycogen, in the liver and fat tissue, into glucose that is released into the blood stream/ Its link to cardiac arrhythmia has been well-established. The glucose signaling pathway is conserved across species, including <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kim and Rulifson, 2004</xref>). Like in humans, in flies the glucagon-like hormone Akh regulates the glucose levels in hemolymph (fly equivalent to blood) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kim and Rulifson, 2004</xref>). Under starvation conditions, Akh mobilizes glycogen and lipids to maintain the circulatory glucose levels. The flies become hyperactive and show increased food searching behavior. Flies without Akh, either by depletion or APC elimination, show starvation resistant behavior, suggesting that the behavioral change is mediated by Akh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lee and Park, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Yu et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, in flies fed a HFD, the AkhR expressing neurons in the brain become hypersensitive to Akh stimulation, due to upregulated AkhR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Huang et al., 2020</xref>). Finally, prepupae injected with low pharmacological doses of Akh, <italic>i.e.</italic>, doses higher than physiologically expected, showed increased heart rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Noyes et al., 1995</xref>). Thus, in both humans and flies, heart rate and rhythm respond to nutritional changes (flies, see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), this mechanism likely supports the higher metabolic demands and possibly mediates the switch from glucose to stored lipids as the main energy source.</p>
<p>To date, studies have focused on the direct effect of glucagon on cardiac tissue, based on the notion that cardiomyocytes express glucagon receptors (GCGR). However, evidence of GCGR expression in human heart tissue has been conflicting. No cardiac signal was detected when using radioactively labeled glucagon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bomholt et al., 2022</xref>), results of mRNA data have been inconsistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Aranda-Domene et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bomholt et al., 2022</xref>), and protein data for GCGR to support cardiac expression is lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Neumann et al., 2023</xref>). Here, we identified an endocrine neuron-heart axis using a fly model for high-fat diet-induced arrhythmia. In this fly model (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>), the consumption of a HFD elevates the expression of Akh, a glucagon-like hormone, and activity of the APC. The elevated circulatory Akh is transported to the AkhR cardiac neurons (ACN) located near the posterior end of the heart, where the increased signaling leads to an escalated heart arrhythmia index. These findings revealed a hitherto undescribed regulatory signaling pathway that links the consumption of superfluous macronutrients with heart arrhythmia.</p>

<caption><title>Model: Akh/AkhR mediates the HFD-induced cardiac arrhythmia</title>
<p>A high-fat diet (HFD) upregulates adipokinetic hormone (Akh) levels in the Akh producing cells (APCs) located at the corpora cardiaca adjacent to the anterior esophagus. HFD also increases APC activity, this results in increased Akh section into the circulation. Akh acts on the Akh receptors (AkhR) expressed by the AkhR cardiac neurons (ACN). The ACN are a pair of neurons located at the posterior end of the adult fly heart, that regulate the heartbeat. Through this signaling pathways, increased Akh under HFD conditions leads to increased arrhythmia.</p></caption>

<title>Cardiac regulatory neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic></title>
<p><italic>Drosophila</italic> have a cardiac cycle that consists of alternating retrograde and anterograde heart beats that correlate to the multi-chamber diastole and systole, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dulcis and Levine, 2005</xref>). Accordingly, two signaling systems that innervate the fly heart were identified. The retrograde beat being regulated by glutamatergic innervation. Its transverse nerves run bilaterally along the longitudinal muscle and innervate the cardiac muscles of the conical chamber as well as the alary muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dulcis and Levine, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">2003</xref>). The anterograde heartbeat being regulated by crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP) innervation. Its bipolar neurons (BpN) extent CCAP fibers that innervate each segment of the abdominal heart. Four additional large CCAP-positive neurons innervate the terminal chamber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dulcis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dulcis and Levine, 2003</xref>). These earlier studies, leave the possibility of synaptic input or hormonal regulation of the BpN neurosecretory signals to the heart. The authors comment on the absence of direct descending input from the corpora cardiaca to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> abdominal heart as has been observed in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dulcis and Levine, 2003</xref>). Here, we identified corpora cardiaca released Akh signaling to previously unreported AkhR cardiac neurons (ACN) that could exercise this function in flies. Given their localization at the terminal end of the cardiac chamber, where the four large CCAP-positive neurons are located as well, it is possible that the ACN modulate CCAP signaling at the heart. In fact, the previous study detected synaptotagmin on the BpN (BpN6) cell bodies which suggests the presence of presynaptic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dulcis and Levine, 2003</xref>). We are currently investigating if the BpN and ACN act together, whether in concert or opposingly.</p>

<title>Relevance of findings in fly for humans</title>
<p>This study revealed how glucagon-like hormone Akh is released by APCs in response to HFD and stimulates AkhR cardiac neurons (ACN) to regulate heart rhythm in flies. Like in the flies, glucagon infusion in healthy human volunteers induces arrhythmias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jaca et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Markiewicz et al., 1978</xref>). Moreover, a preliminary study in infants and children demonstrated the potential of glucagon to treat atrioventricular (AV) block, a heart rhythm disorder marked by a slow heart rate caused by dysfunctional electrical conduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hurwitz, 1973</xref>). Clinical guidelines by the American Heart Association recommend the use of glucagon to treat bradycardia due to beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker overdose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kusumoto et al., 2019</xref>). However, the mechanism by which glucagon exerts these beneficial clinical effects remains poorly understood. Our findings implicate a potentially conserved signaling pathway in which elevated glucagon leads to increased cardiac neuronal activity and subsequent increased heart rate and arrhythmia. Multiple trials are investigating the possible benefits of glucagon receptors (GCGR) agonists alone or in combination with GLP-1 agonists to treat arrhythmia, but so far the results have been mixed. An initial trial with a GCGR antagonist in patients with type 2 diabetes was halted prematurely due to the detrimental side effects, which included elevated blood cholesterol and steatosis (liver dysfunction) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agrawal and Gupta, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kazda et al., 2016a</xref>, 2016b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Pearson et al., 2016</xref>). Our findings provide new possible glucagon-related targets for treating obesity-associated cardiac arrhythmia by targeting cardiac neurons receptive to glucagon signaling rather than the cardiomyocytes as had been the leading hypothesis to date. Studies into the human equivalent of ACN would be interesting; possibly the vagus nerve could fulfill a similar function as its importance for cardiac rhythm has been firmly established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ambache and Lippold, 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cai et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Freeman, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">González et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kharbanda et al., 2023</xref>; van Weperen and Vaseghi, 2023).</p>
<p>Finally, while the exact implications of these findings for new therapeutics remain to be seen, they do support the avoidance of a high-fat diet. If unavoidable, for example in the case of a therapeutic ketogenic diet or in the subset of patients with diabetes that have elevated glucagon blood levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">D’Alessio, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Unger et al., 1970</xref>), then targeting the glucagon pathway might protect against harmful cardiac side effects.</p>

<p>This study reports some <bold>useful</bold> information on the mechanisms by which a high-fat diet induces arrhythmias in the model organism Drosophila. Specifically, the authors propose that adipokinetic hormone (Akh) secretion is increased with this diet, and through binding of Akh to its receptor on cardiac neurons, arrhythmia is induced. The presented data, however, <bold>incompletely</bold> support the conclusions, with a number of concerns identified, such as the need for editorial clarifications, issues with experimental design (including additional control experiments), and over or misinterpretation of some of the experimental data. Nonetheless, some of the data will be helpful to those who wish to extend the research to a more complex model system, such as the mouse.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the manuscript submission by Zhao et al. entitled, &quot;Cardiac neurons expressing a glucagon-like receptor mediate cardiac arrhythmia induced by high-fat diet in Drosophila&quot; the authors assert that cardiac arrhythmias in Drosophila on a high-fat diet are due in part to adipokinetic hormone (Akh) signaling activation. High-fat diet induces Akh secretion from activated endocrine neurons, which activate AkhR in posterior cardiac neurons. Silencing or deletion of Akh or AkhR blocks arrhythmia in Drosophila on a high-fat diet. Elimination of one of two AkhR-expressing cardiac neurons results in arrhythmia similar to a high-fat diet.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors propose a novel mechanism for high-fat diet-induced arrhythmia utilizing the Akh signaling pathway that signals to cardiac neurons.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>(1) The authors state, &quot;Arrhythmic pathology is rooted in the cardiac conduction system.&quot; This assertion is incorrect as a blanket statement on arrhythmias. There are certain arrhythmias that have been attributable to the conduction system, such as bradycardic rhythms, heart block, sinus node reentry, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, AV nodal reentrant tachycardia, bundle branch reentry, fascicular ventricular tachycardia, or idiopathic ventricular fibrillation to name a few. However the etiological mechanism of many atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or substrate-based ventricular tachycardia, are not rooted in the conduction system. The introduction should be revised to reflect a clear focus on atrial fibrillation (AF). In addition, AF susceptibility is known to be modulated by autonomic tone, which is topically relevant to this manuscript.</p>
<p>(2) The authors state that &quot;HFD led to increased heartbeat and an irregular rhythm.&quot; In representative examples shown, HFD resulted in pauses, slower heart rate, and increased irregularity in rhythm but not consistently increased heart rate (Figures 1B, 3A, and 4C). Based on the cited work by Ocorr et al (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0609278104">https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0609278104</ext-link>), Drosophila heart rate is highly variable with periods of fast and slow rates, which the authors attributed to neuronal and hormonal inputs. Ocorr et al then describe the use of &quot;semi-intact&quot; flies to remove autonomic input to normalize heart rate. Were semi-intact flies used? If not, how was heart rate variability controlled? And how was heart rate &quot;increase&quot; quantified in high-fat diet compared to normal-fat diet? Lastly, how does one measure &quot;arrhythmia&quot; when there is so much heart rate variability in normal intact flies?</p>
<p>(3) The authors state, &quot;to test whether the HFD-induced increase in Akh in the APC affects APC neuron activity, we used CaLexA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.3109/01677063.2011.642910">https://doi.org/10.3109/01677063.2011.642910</ext-link>).&quot; According to the reference, CaLexA is a tool to map active neurons and would not indicate, as the authors state, whether Akh affects APC neuron activity specifically. It is equally possible that APC neurons may be activated by HFD and produce more Akh. Please clarify this language.</p>
<p>(4) Are the AkhR+ neurons parasympathetic or sympathetic? Please provide additional experimentation that characterizes these neurons. The AkhR+ neurons appear to be anti-arrhythmic. Please expand the discussion to include a working hypothesis of the overall findings on Akh, AkhR, and AkhR+ neurons.</p>
<p>(5) The authors state, &quot;Heart function is dependent on glucose as an energy source.&quot; However, the heart's main energy source is fatty acids with minimal use of glucose (doi: 10.1016/j.cbpa.2006.09.014). Glucose becomes more utilized by cardiomyocytes under heart failure conditions. Please amend/revise this statement.</p>

<p>This manuscript explores mechanisms underlying heart contractility problems in metabolic disease using Drosophila as a model. They confirm, as others have demonstrated, that a high-fat diet (HFD) induces cardiac problems in flies. They showed that a high-fat diet increased Akh mRNA levels and calcium levels in the Akh-producing cells (APC), suggesting there is increased production and release of this hormone in a HFD context. When they knock down Akh production in the APCs using RNAi they see that cardiac contractility problems are abolished. They similarly show that levels of the Akh receptor (Akhr) are increased on a HFD and that loss of Akhr also rescues contractility problems on a HFD.</p>
<p>One highlight of the paper was the identification of a pair of neurons that express a receptor for the metabolic hormone Akh, and showing initial data that these neurons innervate the cardiac muscle. They then overexpress cell death gene reaper (rpr) in all Akhr-positive cells with Akhr-GAL4 and see that cardiac contractility becomes abnormal.</p>
<p>However, this paper contains several findings that have been reported elsewhere and it contains key flaws in both experimental design and data interpretation. There is some rationale for doing the experiments, and the data and images are of good quality. However, others have shown that HFD induces cardiac contractility problems (Birse 2010), that Akh mRNA levels are changed with HFD (Liao 2021) that Akh modulates cardiac rhythms (Noyes 1995), so Figures 1-4 are largely a confirmation of what is already known. This limits the overall magnitude of the advances presented in these figures. Overall, the stated concerns limit the impact of the manuscript in advancing our understanding of heart contractility.</p>

<p>Zhao et al. provide new insights into the mechanism by which a high-fat diet (HFD) induces cardiac arrhythmia employing Drosophila as a model. HFD induces cardiac arrhythmia in both mammals and Drosophila. Both glucagon and its functional equivalent in Drosophila Akh are known to induce arrhythmia. The study demonstrates that Akh mRNA levels are increased by HFD and both Akh and its receptor are necessary for high-fat diet-induced cardiac arrhythmia, elucidating a novel link. Notably, Zhao et al. identify a pair of AKH receptor-expressing neurons located at the posterior of the heart tube. Interestingly, these neurons innervate the heart muscle and form synaptic connections, implying their roles in controlling the heart muscle. The study presented by Zhao et al. is intriguing, and the rigorous characterization of the AKH receptor-expressing neurons would significantly enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying HFD-induced cardiac arrhythmia.</p>
<p>Many experiments presented in the manuscript are appropriate for supporting the conclusions while additional controls and precise quantifications should help strengthen the authors' augments. The key results obtained by loss of Akh (or AkhR) and genetic elimination of the identified AkhR-expressing cardiac neurons do not reconcile, complicating the overall interpretation.</p>
<p>It is intriguing to see an increase in Akh mRNA levels in HFD-fed animals. This is a key result for linking HFD-induced arrhythmia to Akh. Thus, demonstrating that HFD also increases the Akh protein levels and Akh is secreted more should significantly strengthen the manuscript.</p>
<p>The experiments employing an AkhR null allele nicely demonstrate its requirement for HFD-induced cardiac arrhythmia. Depletion of Akh in Akh-expressing cells recapitulates the consequence of AkhR knockout, supporting that both Akh and its receptor are required for HFD-induced cardiac arrhythmia. Given that RNAi is associated with off-target effects and some RNAi reagents do not work, testing multiple independent RNAi lines is the standard procedure. It is also important to show the on-target effect of the RNAi reagents used in the study.</p>
<p>The most exciting result is the identification of AkhR-expressing neurons located at the posterior part of the heart tube (ACNs). The authors attempted to determine the function of ACNs by expressing rpr with AkhR-GAL4, which would induce cell death in all AkhR-expressing cells, including ACNs. The experiments presented in Figure 6 are not straightforward to interpret. Moreover, the conclusion contradicts the main hypothesis that elevated Akh is the basis of HFD-induced arrhythmia. The results suggest the importance of AkhR-expressing cells for normal heartbeat. However, elimination of Akh or AkhR restores normal rhythm in HFD-fed animals, suggesting that Akh and AkhR are not important for maintaining normal rhythms. If Akh signaling in ACNs is key for HFD-induced arrhythmia, genetic elimination of ACNs should unalter rhythm and rescue the HFD-induced arrhythmia. An important caveat is that the experiments do not test the specific role of ACNs. ACNs should be just a small part of the cells expressing AkhR. The experiments presented in Figure 6 cannot justify the authors' conclusion. Specific manipulation of ACNs will significantly improve the study. Moreover, the main hypothesis suggests that HFD may alter the activity of ACNs in a manner dependent on Akh and AkhR. Testing how HFD changes calcium, possibly by CaLexA (Figure 2) and/or GCaMP, in wild-type and AkhR mutants could be a way to connect ACNs to HFD-induced arrhythmia. Moreover, optogenetic manipulation of ACNs will allow for specific manipulation of ACNs, which is crucial for studying the specific role of ACNs in controlling cardiac rhythms.</p>
<p>Interestingly, expressing rpr with AkhR-GAL4 was insufficient to eliminate both ACNs. It is not clear why it didn't eliminate both ACNs. Given the incomplete penetrance, appropriate quantifications should be helpful. Additionally, the impact on other AhkR-expressing cells should be assessed. Adding more copies of UAS-rpr, AkhR-GAL4, or both may eliminate all ACNs and other AkhR-expressing cells. The authors could also try UAS-hid instead of UAS-rpr.</p>
