<title>Abstract</title>
<p>As the deepest vertebrate in the ocean, the hadal snailfish (<italic>Pseudoliparis swirei</italic>), which lives at a depth of 6,000~8,000m, is a representative case for studying adaptation to extreme environments. Despite some preliminary studies on this species in recent years, including their loss of pigmentation, visual and skeletal calcification genes, and the role of TMAO in adaptation to high-hydrostatic pressure, it is still unknown how they evolved and why they are among the few vertebrate species that have successfully adapted to the deep sea environment. Using genomic data from different trenches, we found that the hadal snailfish may have entered and fully adapted to such extreme environments only in the last few million years. Meanwhile, phylogenetic relationships show that they spread into different trenches in the Pacific Ocean within a million years. Comparative genomic analysis has also revealed that the genes associated with perception, circadian rhythms, and metabolism have been extensively modified in the hadal snailfish to adapt to its unique environment. More importantly, the tandem duplication of a gene encoding ferritin significantly increased their tolerance to reactive oxygen species, which may be one of the important factors in their adaptation to high-hydrostatic pressure.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since its capture in 2014 the hadal snailfish (<italic>Pseudoliparis swirei</italic>) has captured the attention of biologists and public as the deepest known vertebrate on Earth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Fujii, Jamieson, Solan, Bagley, &amp; Priede, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mackenzie E. Gerringer, Linley, Jamieson, Goetze, &amp; Drazen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mackenzie E. Gerringer, Linley, &amp; Nielsen, 2021</xref>). The hadal zone, 6 kilometers below the sea surface where this species lives, and after which the species is named, is characterized by high-hydrostatic pressure (HHP), complete darkness, barrenness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">A. Jamieson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">A. J. Jamieson, 2011</xref>). This special organism that survives and thrives in the hadal zone provides us with an unusual case of adaptation to an extreme environment. After several years of anatomical and genomic research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">M. E. Gerringer, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">M. E. Gerringer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">K. Wang et al., 2019</xref>), it’s now known that the hadal snailfish has degraded vision and a lack of melanin in its skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">K. Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Previous studies have also revealed that having more unsaturated fatty acids in the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Cossins &amp; MacDonald, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Fang, Barcelona, Nogi, &amp; Kato, 2000</xref>) and high levels of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) in the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">P. H. Yancey, Gerringer, Drazen, Rowden, &amp; Jamieson, 2014</xref>) may have played important roles in resistance to HHP. However, much remains to be discovered about this species; our lack of knowledge can be categorized into three principal areas.</p>
<p>The first concerns the origin of hadal snailfish. They have been observed in several Trenches in the Northwest Pacific Ocean, including the Mariana (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">K. Wang et al., 2019</xref>), Yap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Mackenzie E. Gerringer et al., 2021</xref>), Kuril–Kamchatka (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">M. E. Gerringer et al., 2017</xref>) and Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Mackenzie E. Gerringer et al., 2021</xref>) Trenches. The question arises: Do they have the ability to migrate across trenches, or do they enter the hadal zone independently? Furthermore, it has been shown that the divergence time between hadal snailfish and Tanaka’s snailfish (a closely related species distributed in shallow areas) is about 20 million years ago (Mya) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">K. Wang et al., 2019</xref>); but when did the hadal snailfish enter the hadal zone and how long did they take to complete their adaptation to this ecological niche? The second aspect concerns its morphological and physiological characteristics. For example, in such a dark environment, what do hadal snailfish rely on to sense the world: is it smell, taste or something else? Do they still have circadian rhythms in the absence of sunlight? Does darkness and HHP have any effect on their behavior? The last area concerns the mechanisms by which they tolerate HHP. If unsaturated fatty acids and TMAO are common in marine fish, why have only a few species such as hadal snailfish been observed to reach such depths? Some studies suggest that certain genetic alterations may confer tolerance to HHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">K. Wang et al., 2019</xref>), but if so, how do these alterations help hadal snailfish to adapt to this environment, and which alterations are most critical?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these questions have not been well resolved because it is difficult for us to make long-term observations of deep-sea organisms <italic>in situ</italic>. During 2018 to 2019, we collected multiple samples of hadal snailfish from the Mariana Trench and Tanaka’s snailfish from the Yellow Sea. Based on more data and more refined genome, we have been able to trace the genomic signals left by adaptive evolution in an attempt to more fully understand the evolutionary processes and key changes in this special organism.</p>

<title>Improved genome assembly for Mariana hadal snailfish</title>
<p>A total of four hadal snailfish (<italic>Pseudoliparis swirei</italic>) and four Tanaka’s snailfish (<italic>Liparis tanakae</italic>) individuals were collected for this study (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data21">Supplementary file 1</xref></bold>). Using a combination of ONT long reads, BGI short reads, and Hi-C sequencing technologies, we generated a chromosome-level genome assembly for hadal snailfish (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data22">Supplementary file 2</xref></bold>). The genome assembly comprised 1,173 contigs (total length = 626.44 Mb, contig N50 = 4.22Mb), organized into 24 chromosomes with an anchoring rate of 98.24%. The new assembly filled 1.26 Mb of gaps that were present in our previous assembly and have a much higher level of genome continuity and completeness (with complete BUSCOs of 96.0 %) than the two previous assemblies (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data1">Figure 1-figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data2">2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data23">Supplementary file 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data24">4</xref></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Mu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">K. Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, the genome redundancy caused by mis-assembly is also largely reduced in the new assembly (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data3">Figure 1-figure supplements 3</xref></bold>), which ensures the reliability of the subsequent analysis. Meanwhile, we generated a high-quality chromosomal level genome assembly for Tanaka’s snailfish for a comparative evolutionary study. We noticed that there is no major chromosomal rearrangement between hadal snailfish and Tanaka’s snailfish, while the stickleback had undergone several independent chromosomal fusion events (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data4">Figure 1-figure supplements 4</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Based on the new genome assemblies, we re-examined the genetic changes that occurred in the common ancestor of hadal snailfish in combination with the new resequencing and transcriptome data. After a thorough scan and careful inspection, we identified 51 absent genes, 19 unitary pseudogenes, 21 lineage-specific expanded genes, 33 genes with insertions and deletions (with a length ≥ 3 amino acids) in coding regions, and 33 <italic>de novo</italic> originated new genes (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data28">Supplementary file 8</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data32">12</xref></bold>). Most of them have not been previously reported and we discuss them in the following sections.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Cross-trench distribution and high level of genetic diversity</title>
<p>Combining the eight new sequenced individuals (four hadal snailfish and four Tanaka’s snailfish) with five previously reported individuals (four hadal snailfish and one Tanaka’s snailfish), we have been able to form an initial perspective of the hadal snailfish at the population level. The principal component analysis (PCA), neighbor-joining tree and genetic clustering analysis shows that the eight hadal snailfish individuals can be divided into two populations, the first with seven individuals and the second with one individual (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-C</xref></bold>). Interestingly, the first population includes samples from both the Mariana and Yap trenches. Using the mitochondrial data, we found that the divergence time of these individuals from different trenches appears to be only about 44,000 years (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data5">Figure 1-figure supplements 5</xref></bold>). Combined with additional publicly available mitochondrial data, we noticed that the sample from the Kermadec Trench (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">M. E. Gerringer et al., 2017</xref>), about 6,400 kilometers away from the Mariana Trench, is also clustered with individuals from the first population, and the divergence time was estimated to be 1.0 Mya (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data6">Figure 1-figure supplements 6</xref></bold>). These results suggest that hadal snailfish have successfully spread to multiple trenches in the Pacific Ocean over the course of a million years. And this dispersal may have been caused by population expansion or deep circulation.</p>

<p>Genetic diversity of hadal snailfish is about 3.48 times higher than Tanaka’s snailfish. The <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> between the two species is close to 0.91, indicating a large genetic divergence (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data7">Figure 1-figure supplements 7</xref></bold>). That most polymorphisms are unique to each species, and that they share only 6% of their SNPs, is consistent with this observation. In addition, we also estimated the demographic history of hadal snailfish at the population level and observed a significant expansion in the last 60,000 years (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data8">Figure 1-figure supplements 8</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Preserved <italic>rh1</italic> gene suggests rapid adaptation to hadal zone</title>
<p>Based on the mitochondrial data, the closest known species related to the hadal snailfish were found to be from the genera <italic>Careproctus, Crystallias, Rhodichthys</italic> and <italic>Paraliparis</italic>, which contain many species living at approximately 1000 m depth (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data33">Supplementary file 13</xref></bold>). The divergence time between hadal snailfish and these species was estimated to be about 9.9 Mya, close to the formation time (8 Mya) of the deepest trough of the Mariana Trench (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Oakley, Taylor, Moore, &amp; Goodliffe, 2009</xref>). We might therefore speculate that the ancestor of hadal snailfish adapted to the deep-sea environment around 1000 m at about 9.9 Mya, and subsequently gradually adapted to greater depths in the formed or forming trench. The upper and lower limits of the time for hadal snailfish to enter the hadal zone were estimated to be 9.9 Mya (divergence time between hadal snailfish and its closest relatives) and 1.0 Mya (divergence time between different hadal snailfish individuals), respectively. Interestingly, the vision-related genes also confirms a rapid adaptation to hadal zone.</p>
<p>Fish that inhabit different depths of the sea rely on different vision-related genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Musilova et al., 2019</xref>). Since light with longer wavelengths is absorbed more quickly than those with shorter wavelengths, (except for the shortest UV wavelengths) high energy light with shorter wavelengths, such as blue, is able to penetrate to greater depths (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). The genes responsible for absorbing these shorter wavelengths (<italic>sws2</italic> and <italic>rh2</italic>) are therefore much more important to deep-sea species in the photic zone (above 200m) than those that absorb longer wavelengths (<italic>lws</italic>). Similarly, the genes providing monochromatic vision in very dim light (<italic>rh1</italic> and <italic>gnat1</italic>) have been proven to be important for deep-sea species of the disphotic zone (from 200m to 1000m) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Musilova et al., 2019</xref>). Along with the expression data, we noticed that these genes exhibit a different level of relaxation of natural selection in hadal snailfish (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data9">Figure 2-figure supplements 1</xref></bold>). The <italic>lws</italic> gene (long wavelength) has been completely lost in both hadal snailfish and Tanaka’s snailfish; <italic>rh2</italic> (central wavelength) has been specifically lost in hadal snailfish (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 2C</xref></bold>); <italic>sws2</italic> (short wavelength) is still present in hadal snailfish but is hardly expressed; while <italic>rh1</italic> and <italic>gnat1</italic> (perception of very dim light) is both still present and expressed in hadal snailfish (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref></bold>). A previous study has also proven the existence of rhodopsin protein in the eyes of hadal snailfish using proteome data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Yan, Lian, Lan, Qian, &amp; He, 2021</xref>). These results show an interesting phenomenon that genes responsible for the perception of light in deeper regions will have a lower degree of relaxation of selection. The preservation and expression of genes for the perception of very dim light suggests that they are still subject to natural selection, at least in the recent past.</p>

<title>Highly expressed auditory genes</title>
<p>Do hadal snailfish compensate for the lack of vision when perceiving the external environment? The genes associated with the olfactory and auditory systems were investigated using both comparative genomic and transcriptomic methods. While the number of olfactory receptors was largely reduced (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data10">Figure 3-figure supplements 1</xref></bold>), we found that the majority of the auditory genes were well preserved in hadal snailfish. Many of the auditory genes also tended to be significantly more upregulated in the brain of hadal snailfish than in Tanaka’s snailfish (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data34">Supplementary file 14</xref></bold>). The upregulated genes involve many aspects of the auditory system, including the development and tethering of otoliths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Kang, Stevenson, Yau, &amp; Kollmar, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Stooke-Vaughan, Obholzer, Baxendale, Megason, &amp; Whitfield, 2015</xref>), the development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Iyer &amp; Groves, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Kozlowski, Whitfield, Hukriede, Lam, &amp; Weinberg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Riley, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">L.

(<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). Of these, the most significant upregulated gene is <italic>tmc1</italic>, which plays an important role in auditory perception as a component for mechanical-transduction in hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Maeda et al., 2014</xref>) and some mutations in this gene have been found to be associated with hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Kitajiri, Makishima, Friedman, &amp; Griffith, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Riahi et al., 2014</xref>).

<p>Moreover, the gene involved in lifelong otolith mineralization, <italic>cldnj</italic>, has three copies in hadal snailfish, but only one copy in other teleost species (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hardison, Lichten, Banerjee-Basu, Becker, &amp; Burgess, 2005</xref>). This may be important for hadal snailfish because calcium carbonate, the inorganic component in otoliths, is thought not to accumulate efficiently below the carbonate compensation depth (CCD; &gt; 4,000 m - 5,000 m) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">A. Jamieson, 2015</xref>). It should be noted that the hadal snailfish survive at depths far beyond the limits of CCD, but their otoliths still maintain densities similar to those of sea-surface species(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">M. E. Gerringer et al., 2021</xref>). Although we do not know how the hadal snailfish breaks the depth limitation on calcium carbonate deposition, it is likely that the expansion of <italic>cldnj</italic> contributes to otolith mineralization. This may be the reason why it is able to become one of the few species of teleost in hadal zone.</p>

<title>Circadian rhythm decoupled from sunlight and dark adaptation</title>
<p>There is growing evidence that persistent darkness challenges the physiology and behavior of animals, leading to disrupted circadian rhythms, neurological damage and depressive-behavioral phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Fisk et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with previous research in cavefish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Policarpo et al., 2021</xref>), we noticed that many of the circadian rhythm genes (<italic>per2a, cry1a, cry3, cry5</italic> and <italic>gpr19</italic>) are lost or have undergone pseudogenization in the hadal snailfish (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data12">Figure 4-figure supplements 1</xref></bold>). Despite that, we noticed that the essential clock control genes are present and expressed in the hadal snailfish, indicating the rhythm cycle is retained, although it is likely to have been largely uncoupled from sunlight. Moreover, <italic>gpr19</italic> deficiency has been reported to prolong the cycle of circadian locomotor activity rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Yamaguchi et al., 2021</xref>), so hadal snailfish may have an extended rhythm cycle like cavefish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cavallari et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Yamaguchi et al., 2021</xref>).</p>

<p>In addition, in the teleosts closely related to hadal snailfish, there are usually two copies of <italic>grpr</italic> encoding the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor; we noticed that in hadal snailfish one of them is absent and the other is barely expressed (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref></bold>). It has been reported that <italic>grpr</italic> deficient mice show significantly increased locomotor activity in dark conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Wada et al., 1997</xref>). We might therefore speculate that the absence of that gene might in some way benefit the activity of hadal snailfish under complete darkness.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the above-mentioned missing genes are not sufficient to exhibit the full range of changes that occur in the nervous system of hadal snailfish. Previous studies suggest that HHP suppressed the compound action potential in nerve trunks of fishes from shallow areas but not from deep areas, and can perturb the function of G protein-coupled receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Siebenaller &amp; Murray, 1995</xref>). From our transcriptome data, we also observed that the brain is one of the most divergent organs regarding expression levels between hadal snailfish and Tanaka’s snailfish (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data13">Figure 4-figure supplements 2</xref></bold>). In line with this observation, one of our previous studies showed that zebrafish brains have the highest number of differentially expressed genes than the other investigated organs when exposed to HHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">M. L. Hu et al., 2022</xref>). We also identified 15 <italic>de novo</italic> new genes in hadal snailfish that are highly expressed in the brain (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data13">Figure 4-figure supplements 2</xref></bold>). The adaptation of the nervous system to HHP deserves more in-depth study in the future.</p>

<title>Possible survival strategy of storing energy</title>
<p>In a previous study, it was noticed that the individual hadal snailfish we investigated retained a large amount of intact food in its stomach and had larger eggs than might otherwise be expected(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">M. Gerringer, Popp, Linley, Jamieson, &amp; Drazen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">K. Wang et al., 2019</xref>). It appears that the hadal snailfish have a survival strategy of storing energy, which is often found in species that need to cope with occasional starvation. Here we find another clue that hints at the existence of this possibility: the pseudogenization of the gene <italic>gpr27</italic> in hadal snailfish (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data14">Figure 4-figure supplements 3</xref></bold>). It has been reported that the knockout of <italic>gpr27</italic> increases the expression of key enzymes in the carnitine shuttle complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Nath et al., 2020</xref>), especially <italic>cpt1</italic>, which is essential for the beta-oxidation of lipid metabolism. The transcriptome data further confirm that the gene <italic>cpt1</italic> is significantly upregulated in the liver of hadal snailfish. As lipid mobilization is thought to be a common metabolic response to short-term starvation in fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Liao et al., 2017</xref>), the inactivation of <italic>gpr27</italic> could help hadal snailfish to better survive periods of food deficiency. Although previous surveys have shown that various types of organisms live in the hadal zone, and that the hadal snailfish can survive by eating amphipods and occasionally polychaetes and decapod shrimp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Yan et al., 2021</xref>), short-term starvation is still possible because although energy sources are limited by complete darkness, but organisms usually tend to “over-reproduce”.</p>

<title>Reduced bone mineralization</title>
<p>Vitamin D synthesis is dependent on UV light, with phytoplankton being the origin of vitamin D in food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Björn &amp; Wang, 2000</xref>). Whether and how vitamin D reaches the hadal zone through various pathways, for instance as particulate organic matter, is still unknown. By investigating the genes associated with vitamin D metabolic pathways, we found that these genes are well conserved in the genome of hadal snailfish and are similarly expressed in both hadal snailfish and Tanaka’s snailfish (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data15">Figure 4-figure supplements 4</xref></bold>), suggesting that vitamin D may not be a limiting factor for hadal zone vertebrates.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, micro-CT scans have revealed shorter bones and reduced bone density in hadal snailfish, from which it has been inferred that this species has reduced bone mineralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">M. E. Gerringer et al., 2021</xref>); this may be to maintain neutral buoyancy or it may be the result of HHP. The gene <italic>bglap</italic>, which regulates bone mineralization, had been found to be a pseudogene in hadal fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">K. Wang et al., 2019</xref>), which may contribute to this phenotype. Here, we found two more lost genes specific to hadal snailfish, <italic>tmem251</italic> and <italic>tmem263</italic>, that contribute to reduced bone mineralization (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data16">Figure 4-figure supplements 5</xref></bold>). These two genes encode transmembrane proteins, and loss-of-function mutations have now been found that may affect bone mineral deposition and thus bone development and body growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ain et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Z. Wu et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, many genes that determine chondrocyte differentiation and bone mineralization were found to be differentially expressed in the bones of hadal snailfish and Tanaka’s snailfish. However, it should be noted that this result derives from a single bone sample of a hadal snailfish and needs further verification.</p>

As for the stability of the protein structure, previous studies have suggested that the high level of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) content could help the marine fishes in resistance to the inhibitory effects of high pressure on numerous proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Ma, Pazos, &amp; Gai, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Paul H Yancey, Blake, &amp; Conley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">P.

<p>We further examined the known ROS-related genes in hadal snailfish, but found that they were not significantly altered in sequence or expression (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data17">Figure 5-figure supplements 1</xref></bold>). Interestingly, however, when we analyzed the genes that were both expanded and highly expressed in most tissues, we identified only one gene, <italic>fthl27</italic> (encoding a ferritin heavy chain-like protein), which has 14 copies (most of which are tandem duplicates) in hadal snailfish as opposed to 3 copies in Tanaka snailfish (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref></bold>). It has also been suggested that ferritin helps control ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">ORINO et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Salatino et al., 2019</xref>). The expansion of <italic>fthl27</italic> was validated in all the eight resequencing individuals by reads mapping (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data18">Figure 5-figure supplements 2</xref></bold>), indicating that the tandem duplication event occurred at least before the differentiation of these individuals. To test whether the <italic>fthl27</italic> can resist oxidative stress, we cultured 293T cells with or without <italic>fthl27</italic>-overexpression plasmid in cell culture medium supplemented with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) for 4h, and subsequently measured intracellular ROS levels as well as cell viability.

Meanwhile, the <italic>fthl27</italic>-overexpression cells were also found to had significantly higher cell viability (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref></bold>). Therefore, we hypothesize that the expansion and high expression of this gene may be an important mechanism of resistance to HHP induced ROS in hadal snailfish.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The more sequenced individuals provide us with more details about the evolutionary history about the hadal snailfish. For example, given that the divergence time of the hadal snailfish and the other species of the family Liparidae living at a depth of 1,000 m was about 9.9 million years ago (Mya), and the divergence time between different sequenced hadal snailfish individuals was about 1.1 Mya, it is known that the hadal snailfish entered the hadal zone between 1.1 and 9.9 Mya. Then consider the fact that the genes that are responsible for detecting light in dark environment are well preserved in the hadal snailfish, it is likely that this species have only entered a completely light-free environment in the last millions of years, after the full completion of the Mariana Trench (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Oakley et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, the phylogenetic relationships between different individuals clearly indicate that they have successfully spread to different trenches within 1.0 Mya (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data6">Figure 1-figure supplements 6</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>The comparative genomic analysis revealed that the complete absence of light had a profound effect on the hadal snailfish. In addition to the substantial loss of visual genes, many rhythm-related genes were also absent, although some rhythm genes were still present and expressed. The gene loss may not only come from relaxation of natural selection, but also for better adaptation. For example, the <italic>grpr</italic> gene copies are absent or down-regulated in hadal snailfish, which could in turn increased their activity in the dark, allowing them to survive better in the dark environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Wada et al., 1997</xref>). The loss of <italic>gpr27</italic> may also increase the ability of lipid metabolism, which is essential for coping with short-term food deficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Nath et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>The most interesting question about the hadal snailfish is why this is currently one of the very few observed vertebrate species capable of surviving and reproducing at such depths. TMAO, which is able to maintain protein function under high pressure, is thought to be a limiting factor in determining the depth at which fish can survive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">P. H. Yancey et al., 2014</xref>). Results from our previous analysis suggested that positive selection on <italic>fmo3</italic> may be important in promoting TMAO synthesis; but after an updated genome and rigorous FDR correction, we found that these genes had not undergone any particular or significant alteration in the amino acid sequences, although this does not exclude the possibility of a small number of amino acids (three species-specific mutations in all the five copies) having an effect on enzyme activity (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data20">Figure 5-figure supplements 4</xref></bold>). Since the expression of all five copies of <italic>fmo3</italic> are similar among the various tissues of Tanaka’s snailfish and hadal snailfish (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data25">Supplementary file 15</xref></bold>), it seems more likely that the mechanism associated with TMAO degradation is altered in hadal snailfish, although we do not yet have any additional evidence to support this because the genes associated with TMAO degradation are still unclear.</p>
<p>However, the levels of TMAO are not sufficient for us to understand why only the hadal snailfish can tolerate such high hydrostatic pressure, since this substance is widely present in marine fishes. In contrast, the tandem duplication events of two genes may play a more critical role in the adaptation of the hadal snailfish. The first event is the tandem duplication of <italic>cldnj</italic>, a gene essential for otolith formation (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hardison et al., 2005</xref>). The two more copies may help the hadal snailfish to maintain the densities of their otoliths far beyond the limits of CCD. Since the dissolution rate of calcium carbonate increases with higher pressure, the otoliths stability may be one of the reasons limiting fishes to dive to even deeper regions. The second event is the massive expansion and high expression of <italic>fthl27</italic>. Our cellular experiments proved that this gene could help cells to resist ROS burst and protect it from various damages caused by oxidative stress. Meanwhile, comparative transcriptomic analysis observed multiple genes associated with DNA repair are significantly more highly expressed in all tissues of hadal snailfish than in other fishes, which also coincides with the presence of oxidative stress.</p>
<p>In summary, we provide chromosome-level genomes of hadal snailfish and Tanaka’s snailfish, as well as additional transcriptome and resequencing data. We report here further advances in our understanding of the origin, specific characteristics and adaptive mechanisms of the hadal snailfish.</p>

<p>The repeat masked genome was used for the gene annotation. We used a combination of <italic>ab initio</italic> gene predictions, homologous gene predictions, and direct gene models produced by transcriptome assembly to identify protein-coding genes structure on the genome as follows.</p>
<p>Step 1: Augustus v3.2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Stanke, Diekhans, Baertsch, &amp; Haussler, 2008</xref>) was used to generate <italic>ab initio</italic> predictions with internal gene models.</p>
<p>Step 2: The protein sequences from seven species, medaka, Atlantic cod, flatfish, stickleback, zebrafish, turbot, and fugu and the transcriptome predicted protein sequences were used to align genomic sequences with BLAT v. 35 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data26">Supplementary file 6</xref></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kent, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Step 3: The psl files obtained in the previous step were integrated and the protein sequences that were aligned to the overlapping region of the genome were scored and sorted based on the alignment results using a custom script to filter out the best aligned protein sequences in this region. Then, GeneWise v2.4.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Birney, Clamp, &amp; Durbin, 2004</xref>) was used to predict gene models with the aligned sequences as well as the corresponding query proteins. The custom scripts have been deposited in GitHub (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/wk8910/bio_tools/tree/master/42.prediction">https://github.com/wk8910/bio_tools/tree/master/42.prediction</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Step 4: The Evidence Modeler (EVM) v1.1.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Haas et al., 2008</xref>) was used to integrate the prediction results with different weights for each.</p>
<p>The integrated gene set was translated into amino acid sequences using InterProScan v5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Jones et al., 2014</xref>) to annotate motifs and domains in protein sequences by searching publicly available databases (including Pfam, PRINTS, PANTHER, ProDom and SMART) and the genes were further annotated using the KEGG databases.</p>

<p>Short reads of seven Mariana hadal snailfish, one Yap hadal snailfish and five Tanaka’s snailfish (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data21">Supplementary file 1</xref></bold>) were mapped to the hadal snailfish genome assembled in this study with BWA v0.7.12-r1039 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Li, 2013</xref>); then SAMtools v1.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Li et al., 2009</xref>) was used to sort and obtain BAM files. To analyze population genetics, we focused on SNPs and small indels (1–10 bp) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>).

<title>Gene loss and duplication</title>
<p>Here, we applied an improved read mapping-based method to identify gene loss and duplication, which is effective in reducing false positives and false negatives caused by genome assembly and annotation errors as well as multi-species sequence alignments. The custom scripts have deposited in GitHub (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/wenjie-xu-nwpu/hadal_snailfish">https://github.com/wenjie-xu-nwpu/hadal_snailfish</ext-link>). Although this method may have limitations for identifying gene loss and duplication in species with long divergence times, the divergence times of hadal snailfish and Tanaka’s snailfish are about 20 million years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">K. Wang et al., 2019</xref>), and at least 88% of the reads in all hadal snailfish individuals can be well compared to Tanaka’s snailfish genome, indicating that this method is applicable to this study.</p>
<p>For gene loss, the following methods were used for identification. (1) Short reads of eight hadal snailfish and five Tanaka’s snailfish (~30X) were compared to the stickleback and Tanaka’s snailfish genome using BWA v0.7.12-r1039 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Li, 2013</xref>) and subsequently sorted by Samtools v1.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Li et al., 2009</xref>) to obtain the BAM files. (2) We obtained the reads depth for each sites in the gene coding region based on the annotation information of the reference genome, and subsequently classified the depths we had on individual loci into 3 types (“HIGH” for greater than half of the average coverage, “LOW” for less than 3, and “MID” for the rest). We defined sites with “HIGH” for Tanaka’s snailfish and “LOW” for hadal snailfish as hadal snailfish-specific lost sites (SLS). Then, the genes with SLSs accounting for at least 40% of the coding sequence length were selected as the candidate specific loss genes. (3)The protein sequences of the genes selected in the previous step were used as a reference to search through the genome of hadal snailfish by BLAT v. 35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kent, 2002</xref>) and predict the gene structure using GeneWise v2.4.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Birney et al., 2004</xref>) to determine the genes that were completely lost or partially lost in this species. (4) The synteny alignment between the hadal snailfish, Tanaka’s snailfish and stickleback were plotted for partial or fully lost of the gene.</p>
<p>For gene duplication, the following methods were used for identification.

(2) The homologous sites whose average value of reads depth of all hadal snailfish individuals were greater than 1.5 the average value of the Tanaka’s snailfish individuals were retained and defined as hadal snailfish specific high-copy sites (HCS). Then, the genes with HCSs accounting for at least 50% of the coding sequence length were selected as the candidate high-copy genes. (3) We searched for the location of this gene on the hadal snailfish genome by BLAT v. 35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kent, 2002</xref>) and predicted the gene structure by GeneWise v2.4.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Birney et al., 2004</xref>) to determine its copy number. (4) Finally, the expansion of this gene was determined by constructing a gene tree of the protein sequences of this gene family from nine species, hadal snailfish, Tanaka’s snailfish, medaka, Atlantic cod, flatfish, stickleback, zebrafish, turbot, and fugu.</p>

<title>Identification of unitary pseudogenes</title>
<p>Unitary pseudogenes are non-functional genes that decay at their original location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Tutar, 2012</xref>), and we suggest that some missing homologs will exist in hadal snailfish genome as unitary pseudogenes during their adaptation to the special environment of the hadal zone.</p>
<p>We obtained pseudogenes in hadal snailfish by following five steps. (1) Using the stickleback genome sequence as a reference, we performed synteny alignment for three species (hadal snailfish, Tanaka’s snailfish and stickleback) with Last v956 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Kiełbasa, Wan, Sato, Horton, &amp; Frith, 2011</xref>) using the parameters ‘-E0.05’, generating a total of 382 Mb (of which 290 Mb was informative for all species) of one-to-one alignment sequences with Multiz v1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Blanchette et al., 2004</xref>) using the default parameters. (2) Genes with at least 70% of the coding sequences of stickleback or Tanaka’s snailfish present in the MAF and not present in the corresponding regions of hadal snailfish were selected as alternative unitary pseudogene datasets. (3) We used BLAST v2.9.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Altschul, Gish, Miller, Myers, &amp; Lipman, 1990</xref>) to determine if this gene was present in other regions of the hadal snailfish genome.

Next, For the genes specifically present in hadal snailfish selected in the previous step, we used BLAST v2.9.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Altschul et al., 1990</xref>) to align them with the genomes of eight other fishes (Tanaka’s snailfish, medaka, Atlantic cod, flatfish, stickleback, zebrafish, turbot, and fugu) and screened for genes with a matching region &lt; 0.4.

Next, the protein sequences of the selected genes were aligned using MAFFT v7.471 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Katoh &amp; Standley, 2013</xref>), and a custom script was used to select regions that were consistent in other species and had contiguous specificity at sites greater than 3 bp in hadal snailfish, and that had at least 90% sequence identity for each 5 bp region before and after this variant region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">B.

StringTie v1.3.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Pertea, Kim, Pertea, Leek, &amp; Salzberg, 2016</xref>) was then used to count the number of reads paired for each gene with the help of gene annotation information of the species, and then TPM values were calculated for each gene in both species. Next, we identified 17281 one-to-one orthologues of hadal snailfish and Tanaka’s snailfish using the RBH method.

<p>This manuscript provides an important case study for in-depth research on the adaptability of vertebrates in deep-sea environments. Through analysis of the genomic data of the hadal snailfish, the authors found that this species may have entered and fully adapted to extreme environments only in the last few million years. Additionally, the study revealed the adaptive features of hadal snailfish in terms of perceptions, circadian rhythms and metabolisms, and the role of ferritin in high-hydrostatic pressure adaptation. Besides, the reads mapping method used to identify events such as gene loss and duplication avoids false positives caused by genome assembly and annotation. This ensures the reliability of the results presented in this manuscript. Overall, these findings provide important clues for a better understanding of deep-sea ecosystems and vertebrate evolution.</p>

<p>This paper presents improved, chromosome level assemblies of the hadal snailfish and Tanaka's snailfish. This is an extension and update of previous work from the group on the hadal snailfish genome. The chromosomal assemblies allow comparisons of genome architecture between a shallow water snailfish and the hadal snailfish to aid inference on timing of colonization of trenches and genomic changes that may have been adaptive for that move.</p>
<p>The comparisons in genomic architecture are compelling: genes present in Tanaka's snailfish that are lost in hadal snailfish that involve whole regions of the genome that no longer map even though adjacent regions do map between the species and across a large evolutionary distance to stickleback. Or genes that are duplicated in hadal snailfish but only appear as single copy in other fishes. The paper focuses on genes in the eye, in hearing, in circadian rhythms, and in ROS scavaging. These are all functions that could play a role in adapting to the hadal environment.</p>
<p>The genomic comparisons all seem sound. Stylistically I would prefer if the authors could introduce the gene product and protein function every time they introduce a gene locus. They introduce a gene and general function, but don't usually note what the protein encoded by the gene is and what it's specific function is.</p>
<p>I found the paper generally well written, and the data compelling and creatively displayed. There is room for improvement in places where additional details could be added (e.g. the choice to show expression data as TPMs) and the writing could be clarified.</p>
