<title>Abstract</title><p>Bacterial growth characteristics intrinsic to each strain can impact and influence gene expression, antibiotic susceptibility, and disease pathogenesis. However, little is known about specific genomic variations that influence these bacterial growth features. Here, we investigate the impact of <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> genetics on its <italic>in vitr</italic>o growth features to shed light on genes that may be important targets in the development of vaccines and therapeutics. We use statistical models to estimate growth features and show that they varied significantly across capsular serotypes and lineages, strongly correlated with the phylogeny, and were highly heritable, highlighting a strong genetic basis. Despite this, genome-wide association studies revealed no specific genomic loci statistically associated with the growth features independently of the genetic background, including those in the capsular polysaccharide synthesis locus. Our findings show that the serotype and lineage, and possibly a combination of genomic loci, influence intrinsic pneumococcal growth kinetics, which may have implications on pneumococcal disease pathogenesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Once termed “the captain of the men of death” by Sir William Osler in the 20<sup>th</sup> century, <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, or the pneumococcus, remains a significant cause of life-threatening invasive diseases, such as sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>, despite the widespread implementation of life-saving serotype-specific polysaccharide pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. The high capsular diversity, amounting to ∼100 serotypes with varying potential for colonising the nasopharynx and causing invasive diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> and mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, demonstrates the remarkable genetic diversity of the pneumococcus. Such high genetic diversity reflects the plasticity of the pneumococcal genome, which readily swaps genetic material with other strains through recombination and horizontal gene transfer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. However, the impact of pneumococcal genomic variation on its phenotypes, especially those associated with disease pathogenesis and clinical manifestations, remains less understood.</p>
<p>The pneumococcus possesses an arsenal of virulence factors. The extracellular polysaccharide capsule is the main virulence factor critical for transmissibility, survival, and pathogenicity in the human host<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Recent studies in the pneumococcus and other bacterial pathogens suggest that variability in growth kinetics impacts disease pathogenesis, clinical manifestation, and antibiotic therapy. For example, differential pneumococcal growth features appear to correlate with fitness for colonisation and invasive disease,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> clinical manifestation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> and response to environmental conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Studies of other bacterial pathogens suggest that growth rate influences gene and protein expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, adhesion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, bacterial competition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, plasmid replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, bacteriophage dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, and antibiotic accumulation and efficacy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Similarly, experimental and mathematical modelling studies have demonstrated that bacterial growth correlates with bacterial load and host-mediated cell lysis and impacts dispersal to different host cells and tissues during systemic infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Previous studies of pneumococcus and other bacteria have suggested the influence of environmental factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> and bacterial-specific factors, including capsular serotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> and the presence of plasmids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> on bacterial growth phenotypes. These growth phenotypes may consequently impact invasive pneumococcal disease pathogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. However, the specific pneumococcal genomic variations affecting growth kinetics remain less understood.</p>
<p>Studying bacterial growth kinetics sheds light on the influence of genes, genomic variation, and growth media conditions on bacterial fitness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. However, studying bacterial growth kinetics <italic>in vivo</italic> remains intrinsically challenging due to the complexity of the conditions in the hosts, although innovative approaches are being developed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. On the other hand, <italic>in vitro</italic> methods provide a valuable alternative for assessing the impact of specific bacterial and environmental factors on bacterial fitness. Although these <italic>in vitro</italic> methods have revealed remarkable insights on bacterial fitness, these experiments have mostly yielded strain-specific rather than population-level insights due to the analysis of a small number of isolates from few genetic backgrounds.</p>
<p>Here, we studied the impact of pneumococcal genetics on <italic>in vitro</italic> growth kinetics to understand the influence of bacterial genetic variation on pneumococcal pathogenesis. Specifically, we performed high-throughput quantification of the <italic>in vitro</italic> growth kinetics and whole genome sequencing of 348 invasive pneumococcal isolates from the Netherlands to determine the impact of genomic variation on growth kinetics. We conducted growth curve experiments on 348 isolates in blood-like media conditions, and absorbance was monitored over 15 hours. Growth features were determined from these curves using statistical models, and we assessed the impact of capsular serotype and genetic background on the estimated growth features and tested their association with the phylogeny of the isolates. In addition, we used a genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach to identify specific genomic loci associated with the growth features independent of the genetic background. Finally, we calculated the variability in the growth features explained by pneumococcal genetics. Our study suggests that the capsular serotype, genetic background or lineage, and a combination of genetic loci may influence pneumococcal growth kinetics, a fundamental trait potentially influencing nasopharyngeal colonisation, invasive disease pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations.</p>

<title>Population structure of a diverse collection of Dutch invasive pneumococcal isolates and derivation of their growth kinetics</title>
<p>We aimed to understand the impact of the capsular serotype, genetic background, and specific genomic loci, independent of the clonal population structure, on the pneumococcal growth features (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and Supplementary Data 1). Therefore, we investigated the <italic>in vitro</italic> growth kinetics of 348 pneumococcal isolates collected from patients with invasive pneumococcal diseases via the Pneumococcal Bacteraemia Collection Nijmegen (PBCN) cohort study at two hospitals in Nijmegen, the Netherlands before (2000-2006) and after (2007-2011) the introduction of the seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) [PCV7] into the Dutch paediatric immunisation programme<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Our isolates represent 34 capsular serotypes, 40 pneumococcal lineages, defined based on the global pneumococcal sequence cluster (GPSC) nomenclature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, and 99 sequence types (STs) defined by the pneumococcal multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. An interactive and annotated maximum likelihood phylogeny of the isolates used in this study is available online at the Microreact platform for open data visualisation and sharing for genomic epidemiology (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://microreact.org/project/wxmdblfgprepwugvbbtaq7">https://microreact.org/project/wxmdblfgprepwugvbbtaq7</ext-link>). We estimated a Simpson diversity index of 0.932 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.924 to 0.940), 0.937 (95% CI: 0.928 to 0.945), and 0.958 (95% CI: 0.949 to 0.966) for the serotypes, lineages, and STs, respectively. The high richness and diversity of pneumococcal serotypes and lineages highlighted a substantial population-level diversity of the study isolates in the Netherlands.</p>

<caption><title>Schematic overview of high-throughput quantification of <italic>in vitro</italic> pneumococcal growth kinetics and the genome-wide discovery of individual genomic variation influencing <italic>in vitro</italic> pneumococcal growth.</title><p>Population genomic approaches using genome-wide association study (GWAS) offer a robust way to identify genomic variation influencing the growth dynamics of the pneumococcus. First, we collected 348 pneumococcal blood culture isolates that were obtained from 348 patients admitted to the hospital with invasive pneumococcal disease. The isolates were inoculated in a liquid medium in a highly standardised manner followed by measurement of the growth kinetics after every ten minutes for slightly over 15 hours using a microplate reader<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. We then fitted a logistic function (see methods) to measure growth features, namely, the average growth rate (<italic>r</italic>), maximum growth density (<italic>H<sub>max</sub></italic>) defined as <italic>L<sub>max</sub></italic>, lag phase duration, and maximum growth change (<italic>ΔH</italic>), defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum density (<italic>L<sub>max</sub></italic>-<italic>L<sub>min</sub></italic>). Additionally, genomic DNA was extracted from the cultured isolates for whole genome sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq 4000 sequencing platform. The generated sequencing data was used to reconstruct a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of the isolates for downstream analyses, for example, the assessment of phylogenetic signals for the estimated growth features. We also performed <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of the sequencing reads to generate contigs, which were used to map against the ATCC 700669 pneumococcal reference genome (GenBank accession: NC_011900) to identify consensus single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We also generated presence, and absence patterns for unitigs or variable length <italic>k-</italic>mer sequences based on the draft assembled contigs. The SNPs were used to generate the phylogeny of the isolates while the unitigs were used in a GWAS to identify variants associated with the estimated pneumococcal growth features.

<title>Capsular serotype and genetic background significantly impact pneumococcal growth kinetics</title>
<p>To explore the impact of capsular serotype and genetic background or lineage on the pneumococcal growth features estimated from a fitted growth curve, namely lag-phase duration, maximum growth density (<italic>H<sub>max</sub></italic>), maximum growth change (<italic>ΔH</italic>), and average growth rate (<italic>r</italic>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, and Supplementary Data 1), we assessed the relationship between these growth features and serotypes and lineages associated with the study isolates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>).

We used the nonlinear optimisation algorithm to identify a combination of parameters with the best fit to a logistic curve based on the lowest residual sum of squares for the predicted value based on the model relative to the observed growth data (see methods). We fitted separate curves based on a subset of points for each replicate up to the end of the stationary phase or end of the experiment, whichever came first. We did this to get a better fit for the logistic curve during the growth phase, as it does not allow for negative growth, which happened after the stationary phase. We fitted the curves to infer the growth features for each of the six replicates. The averaged estimates for each replicate were then used for the downstream analyses.

<p>Recombination and horizontal gene transfer may lead to the replacement of part or the entire capsule biosynthesis locus resulting in the production of a polysaccharide capsule distinct from the original one, a phenomenon called capsule-switching<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Consequently, some lineages are associated with multiple serotypes, and similarly, a single serotype can be expressed in distinct genetic backgrounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Examples of lineages containing multiple serotypes included GPSC3, GPSC4, and GPSC7, and likewise, serotypes, including 3, 19A, and 19F, were expressed in multiple genetic backgrounds, which also express other serotypes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). Overall, the average growth rate for serotypes expressed in different genetic backgrounds broadly showed similar patterns. For example, lineages expressing serotype 14 had consistently higher average growth rates. In contrast, lineages expressing serotype 3 showed lower rates, consistent with the notion that capsule production interferes with pneumococcal growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). Therefore, we investigated the impact of the capsular serotype and genetic background on the estimated pneumococcal growth features.</p>
<p>First, we identified lineages that expressed multiple serotypes and serotypes found across multiple lineages. To ensure robust statistical comparison, we only focused on serotype-lineage combinations with at least three sequenced isolates in our study. We found two lineages, with enough sequenced isolates for comparison, GPSC3 and GPSC7, which expressed multiple serotypes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3j</xref> and Supplementary Data 2). We noted higher growth rates for serotype 33F than serotype 8 (<italic>P</italic>=0.0007; Kruskal-Wallis test).</p>
<p>In contrast, we found no statistically significant differences in the growth rates between serotypes 23A and 23F in lineage GPSC7 (<italic>P=</italic>0.2568; Kruskal-Wallis test). We speculated that the absence of statistically significant differences between serotypes 23A and 23F reflected their presence in the same serogroup, therefore, had similar capsule properties. Interestingly, we observed similar patterns for the maximum growth density, maximum growth change, and lag phase duration features between serotypes on the GPSC3 and GPSC7 lineages (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3k-m</xref> and Supplementary Data 2). Next, we investigated the growth rates of the same serotypes expressed in distinct genetic backgrounds. Although some serotypes showed similar growth rates across distinct genetic backgrounds, such as serotype 3 (<italic>P</italic>=0.4599; Kruskal-Wallis test), others showed different growth rates across different lineages, as seen with serotypes 14 (<italic>P</italic>=0.0006; Kruskal-Wallis test) and 19F (<italic>P</italic>=0.0105; Kruskal-Wallis test). We noted similar patterns for the other growth features: maximum growth density, maximum growth change, and lag phase duration (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3n-q</xref>, Supplementary Data 2).</p>
<p>These findings demonstrate that the capsular serotype and genetic background significantly impact pneumococcal growth kinetics. The resultant growth features likely depend on the interaction between these factors, whereby some combinations may result in more pronounced growth effects than others.</p>

<title>Pneumococcal growth kinetics show heritability and correlation with the phylogeny of the isolates</title>
<p>Based on the findings that both capsular serotype and genetic background are associated with growth kinetics, we hypothesised that the estimated pneumococcal growth features exhibit a high phylogenetic signal. We assessed the phylogenetic signal for each growth feature using Pagel’s λ statistic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, which evaluates the correlation between given traits and the phylogenetic tree of the isolates, with values close to zero and one indicating weaker and stronger phylogenetic signals, respectively. By reconstructing the estimated growth features on the internal nodes of the phylogeny, we found high but variable associations between the mapped features and different genetic backgrounds, which suggested potentially strong phylogenetic signals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 2 and 3, and Supplementary Data 3).</p>

<p>To quantify the variability in the pneumococcal growth kinetics explained by the genotype, we calculated the narrow-sense heritability (<italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup>) for the four normal-transformed estimated growth features and the maximum growth rate from Arends et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>.

<p>Altogether, these findings demonstrate a substantial impact of the serotype and lineage on the variation of the pneumococcal growth features, whereby most serotypes tend to have similar characteristics regardless of the genetic background. Similarly, some genetic backgrounds tend to show similar phenotypic patterns irrespective of the serotypes, but the serotype appears to have a more significant influence on the growth characteristics.</p>

<title>No individual genomic loci are associated with pneumococcal growth features</title>
<p>Having found moderate to high narrow-sense heritability of the growth features, we then undertook a GWAS analysis to identify specific genomic loci associated with these features independent of the strains’ genetic background using a linear mixed-effects model. We performed separate GWAS analyses of the maximum growth change, maximum growth density, maximum growth change, and lag phase duration phenotypes derived from the growth curve. We conducted the GWAS using variable-length <italic>k-</italic>mer sequences or unitigs to capture genetic variation in the pneumococcal genomes at different levels, including SNPs, multi-allelic sites, and insertions and deletions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. We found no individual unitigs associated with the derived growth feature phenotypes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>, Supplementary Data 4). Furthermore, repeating the GWAS analyses adjusting for the serotype revealed no statistically significant hits associated with the derived growth phenotypes, suggesting that the variants in the pneumococcal strains are correlated with the growth kinetics independent of the serotype (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>, Supplementary Data 4).

<title>Average <italic>in vitro</italic> growth rates are not strongly correlated with a serotype’s invasiveness or its prevalence in carriage or disease</title>
<p>Previous studies have elucidated that bacterial growth rate may influence colonisation and disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, including systemic dissemination during infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> and disease manifestations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.

<p>Second, we hypothesized that the average <italic>in vitro</italic> growth rate of the serotypes is positively associated with the prevalence of the serotypes in the nasopharyngeal carriage as fitter strains would grow faster than less fit strains.

We repeated the analysis after excluding serotype 3 and found no evidence of an association between growth rate and carriage prevalence (Spearman correlation=0.38, <italic>P</italic>=0.0925) which suggests that serotype 3 alone was driving the previously observed association. Finally, we tested the hypothesis that the growth rate is positively associated with the invasiveness of the serotypes.

<p>Bacterial growth kinetics impact several traits, including gene and protein expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, antibiotic accumulation and efficacy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, cell surface adhesion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, intra- and inter-specific competition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, response to environmental conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, plasmid replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, bacteriophage dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, colonisation and disease pathogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, including clinical manifestation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Whilst previous studies have attempted to understand bacterial, host, and environmental factors influencing bacterial growth, a major drawback has been a narrow focus on a small subset of strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Therefore, the insights gained from these studies have mostly been for specific strains, as they ignored potential variability across different genetic backgrounds. These population-level studies are critical for genetically diverse bacterial pathogens with highly structured populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, substantial antigenic diversity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, and recombination rates, such as the pneumococcus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Here, we examine the association between pneumococcal genetics and growth kinetics using a combination of high-throughput quantification of <italic>in vitro</italic> pneumococcal growth, whole-genome sequencing, and population genomic analyses employing a bacterial GWAS approach. Notably, our findings reveal a strong influence of the capsular serotype compared to the genetic background, and the absence of specific individual genomic loci modulating pneumococcal growth kinetics, particularly the <italic>in vitro</italic> growth rate. These findings may partially explain why some serotypes and lineages colonise and cause invasive diseases better than others and may have implications for developing measures to prevent and control pneumococcal infections.</p>
<p>Our findings suggest that the capsular serotype and genetic background influence pneumococcal growth kinetics. The findings are generally consistent with results from experimental studies by others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, which used capsule-switched strains to exclude the impact of the genetic background and showed an alternation of growth dynamics due to the capsule, although there may be potential differences in the growth media and conditions. Specifically, encapsulated strains showed higher growth rates than unencapsulated strains in nutrient-rich conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. These findings suggest that the capsule is crucial for pneumococcal growth, but its effect depends on nutrient availability – promoting and interfering with growth when nutrients are abundant and limited, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. A recent study by Tóthpál et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> suggested that the serotype partially explains pneumococcal growth and suggested the genetic backgrounds, which vary in their ability to colonise the nasopharynx and cause invasive diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>, may also play a role. However, the authors did not fully quantify the impact of the genetic background since the isolates were not sequenced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Our study confirms the strong influence of both the pneumococcal capsular serotype and genetic background or lineage on the growth kinetics of the isolates. The influence of the serotype appeared to be higher than the genetic background for the average growth rate, while the other growth features appeared to show an opposite trend. These findings suggest that the respective influence of the capsular serotype and lineage varies by specific derived pneumococcal growth features.</p>
<p>Interestingly, although our findings revealed that the capsular serotype and genetic background influence pneumococcal growth kinetics, statistical analysis showed that the variance attributed to the capsular serotype was higher than the genetic background. Specifically, the capsular serotype exhibits a more pronounced growth rate, maximum growth change, and maximum growth density than the genetic background. In contrast, the genetic background had a higher effect on the lag phase duration than the serotype. We acknowledge that our comparison of growth features in the same genetic background could also mean a large amount of genetic variation for some of the lineages, some of which could be responsible for changes in growth. These findings illustrate the importance of the capsular serotype and genetic background on pneumococcal growth kinetics, which may partially explain their variable prevalence in carriage and disease.</p>
<p>Previous studies have revealed individual bacterial genomic loci that impact other phenotypes, including pathogenicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>, virulence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>, host, niche, and environmental adaptation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>, conjugation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>, and antimicrobial resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>, independent of the genetic background. Our GWAS findings revealed no elevated signals in specific genomic loci, suggesting that individual variants may not significantly influence pneumococcal growth kinetics independent of the genetic background and serotype. Previous studies have shown that mutations in other capsule biosynthesis genes (<italic>wchA</italic> or <italic>cpsE</italic>) encoding a protein that links activated glucose phosphates to lipid carriers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> also influence the growth dynamics of the pneumococcus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. However, our results are contrary to our speculation that genetic variation in the capsule polysaccharide synthesis genes would be strongly associated with pneumococcal growth features. These findings suggest that specific genomic loci in the pneumococcal genome do not strongly influence pneumococcal growth kinetics, hinting at the potential impact of the overall genetic background and several loci possibly with small effects individually. While it’s possible that such follow-up studies are needed to provide additional support for the importance of these variants on pneumococcal growth kinetics.</p>
<p>In contrast to findings in a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, we found no robust evidence for the association between the <italic>in vitro</italic> growth rates and the population-level prevalence of the serotypes in nasopharyngeal carriage. However, this may have occurred as a result of a limitation of our study, since we studied a collection of randomly sampled invasive isolates, and the growth experiments were conducted in conditions similar to that of blood, while the Hathaway et al. study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> used a non-random selection of both carriage and disease isolates. It is likely that isolates have adaptations to the environmental conditions in which they were isolated, and so <italic>in vitro</italic> growth characteristics for any given isolate may be different under experimental conditions simulating different niches. In addition, the <italic>in vitro</italic> growth environment cannot fully represent <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions and fails to consider the impact of selective pressures coming from the serotype-specific responses (antibody) or non-specific responses (phagocytic) and potential interactions with other pathogens. Presumably, the lack of association between the invasiveness and prevalence of serotypes in invasive disease and carriage, and the growth rates could reflect that the conditions in the <italic>in vitro</italic> growth environment do not fully represent <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions. Collectively, these findings may suggest that these and other factors may substantially influence the complex pneumococcal disease pathogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>The strength of this study is the analysis of an extensive collection of well-phenotyped natural isolates and the combination of phenotyping, and estimation of growth features using statistical models and statistical genetics to determine the association between the growth features and genetic variation across the entire genome. As previously noted by Tothpal et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, the culturing history of the isolates may impact the growth kinetics. In our study, we consistently cultured all the isolates after isolation from patients using standardised culturing procedures (single assay, identical initial concentration, environmental conditions or temperature, and equipment to measure the optical density and repeat measurements to spot technical variability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>). Compared to the present study, future studies would benefit from larger sample sizes and may find more results as we only explained some of the heritability of the growth features. We also acknowledge that the methods used to estimate heritability may also sometimes perform poorlyon some bacteria species, therefore, more robust methods are needed to further validate our findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>. Because we conducted our experiments for a relatively short duration (∼15 hours), we could not robustly characterise the kinetics at the stationary phase due to incomplete data or the observed high variability of its kinetics. Therefore, we recommend increasing the culturing time from 15 to &gt;24 hours in follow-up studies, as done elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, to characterise the stationary phase kinetics of the cultured isolates robustly. Furthermore, since the pneumococcus invades different niches and systemic tissues with varying conditions, including oxygen concentration and temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, future studies should investigate the effect of these environmental conditions on pneumococcal growth and identify pneumococcal genomic variants associated with growth kinetics for each condition. Considering that our dataset contained only a third of the &gt;100 known pneumococcal serotypes globally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>; due to the geographical variation in the distribution of pneumococcal serotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>, future studies should investigate all serotypes to provide further insights on the impact of different serotypes in pneumococcal growth kinetics. Additionally, considering that we generated the phylogeny of the entire pneumococcal species rather than isolates belonging to a single strain or lineage, as defined by several approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>, we did not remove recombinations using widely used methods designed for clonal bacterial populations, such as Gubbins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>. Therefore, there is a possibility that some branch lengths in the phylogeny used for the ancestral trait reconstruction analysis may be less accurate although the topology is usually robust to recombination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>. Furthermore, there may be other variants that potentially influence the pneumococcal growth kinetics which are regarded as not statistically significant in this study based on our conservative genome-wide significance threshold. As more and more similar studies are conducted, particularly those utilising much larger datasets, potential variants associated with pneumococcal growth kinetics, may be discovered.</p>
<p>Our analysis of population-level genomic and high-throughput <italic>in vitro</italic> pneumococcal growth data suggests that the capsular serotype and lineage influence pneumococcal growth. However, although some growth features are highly heritable, there appears to be no specific genetic variants which strongly influence these phenotypes suggesting that a combination of genomic loci with small effects individually or the entire genetic background may play a greater role in pneumococcal growth kinetics. Overall, our study provides a proof-of-concept for combining phenotyping and population genomics to understand the genetic basis for pneumococcal growth, an approach which can be applied to study other bacteria of clinical significance and those used in bioengineering, genetics, and the food industry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>. Ultimately, we anticipate that applying our approach will have implications for devising strategies to reduce life-threatening bacterial infections and improve food production and safety.</p>

<title>Ethics statement</title>
<p>The isolates used in this work were collected through an observational cohort study Pneumococcal Bacteraemia Collection Nijmegen (PBCN)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. The non-applicability of the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO) on the study design was confirmed by the Regional Ethics Committee, and the local medical ethics committees of the participating hospitals in the Netherlands approved the study procedures.</p>

<title>Sample characteristics and whole-genome sequencing</title>
<p>Three hundred and forty-eight (n=348) pneumococcal isolates collected from patients with invasive pneumococcal diseases through the PBCN observational cohort study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> were available for the study. We included a single isolate per patient as invasive pneumococcal infections are typically clonal, so a single isolate is sufficient. The consecutive blood isolates were collected at two hospitals in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, before (2000-2006) and after (2007-2011) the introduction of the PCV7 vaccine into the Dutch paediatric immunisation programme<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Most of the bacteremia cases (97%) concerned adults. Additional information on the PBCN study and collected clinical variables have been previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup>. To generate whole genome sequences, we sequenced a single isolate per patient using an Illumina HiSeq sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). We then assembled the generated reads using SPAdes genome assembler (version 3.14.0)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup>, and evaluated the draft assemblies using assembly-stats (version: 1.0.1) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/assembly-stats">https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/assembly-stats</ext-link>). In addition, we used a combination of metrics, including genome size and the number of contigs, to assess the quality of the draft assemblies for inclusion in the analysis.</p>

<title>Measurement of <italic>in vitro</italic> pneumococcal growth kinetics and derivation of growth features</title>
<p>We measured the pneumococcal growth kinetics for slightly over 15 hours as described by Arends et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. In short, we incubated a frozen aliquot of standardised pneumococcal inoculum in 1.5 ml of blood-like medium (50% M17, 50% casamino acids tryptone [CAT] medium, 0.25% glucose). We measured growth kinetics at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> every 10 min for over 15 hours at OD<sub>620</sub> with use of a humidity cassette by microplate reader (Spark 10M, Tecan, Switzerland). We added 15 μL of inoculum was added to 1.5 mL of prewarmed rich growth medium (45% M17, 45% CAT, 0.225% glucose, 10% fetal calf serum [Greiner Bio-one], 26 U/mL catalase [Sigma-Aldrich C1345]) in each well of a sterile flat-bottomed 48-well plate (Nunclon Surface, Nunc, Denmark). The growth medium was supplemented with catalase. We chose these nutrient-rich conditions to bring forward differences in the growth features of the pneumococcus. We performed six repeat measurements on three separate days for each isolate. To understand the growth kinetics of the invasive Dutch pneumococcal isolates, we fitted a modified logistic growth curve function, i.e., <italic>L</italic><sub>0</sub> + <italic>L<sub>max</sub></italic>/(<italic>1</italic> + <italic>e</italic><sup>−<italic>r</italic></sup>(<italic>t</italic>−<italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub>)), separately to the growth data for each isolate for each replicate, using the “optim” function in stats (version 4.3.2) R package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.R-project.org/">https://www.R-project.org/</ext-link>). We then averaged the inferred values for each replicate to obtain average estimates for each parameter. The parameter <italic>L</italic><sub>0</sub> captures the initial cell density measured as absorbance or optical density at a wavelength of 620 nm (OD<sub>620</sub>); <italic>L<sub>max</sub></italic> is the maximum cell density; <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub> is the initial time, and <italic>r</italic> is the average growth rate. We fitted two curves in total for each isolate based on the averaged data from the six replicates using the limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS-B) optimisation algorithm by minimising the residual sum of squares<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup>. We fitted the first curve on all the data points and the second curve on the data measured until the start of the end of the stationary phase or the beginning of the death phase, whichever came earlier. We defined the end of the stationary phase or the start of the death phase as the time when the optical cell density decreased by &gt;5% from the maximum cell density. The curve fitted based on the data measurements collected up to the end of the stationary phase or death phase, or the end of the experiment, if none of these phases had been reached, captured the growth dynamics better than the curve fitted using all the data points to accurately estimate the growth rate and the maximum cell density corresponding to the peak of the pneumococcal growth curve, especially for growth curves with observably short stationary phases and rapid autolysis. Therefore, parameters for the downstream analyses were inferred from the curves fitted to the reduced dataset.</p>
<p>We determined four growth phenotypes for each pneumococcal isolate estimated from the fitted growth curve, namely the lag-phase duration, maximum growth density (<italic>H<sub>max</sub></italic>), i.e., captured by parameter <italic>L<sub>max</sub></italic>, maximum growth change (<italic>ΔH</italic>) corresponding to the difference of the maximum and minimum density (<italic>L<sub>max</sub></italic>-<italic>L</italic><sub>0</sub>), and average growth rate (<italic>r</italic>). We defined the lag-phase duration as the time when the optical cell density was at least 1.5-fold higher than the starting initial cell density, as described by Arends and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Due to the challenges of characterising the kinetics at the stationary or death phase, partly due to the high strain-to-strain variability or short study period, we did not derive the growth features capturing these phases, including the duration of the stationary and death phases. The logistic growth curves showed an excellent fit for the data, which provided an opportunity to investigate the impact of capsular serotype and genetic background or lineages and specific genomic loci, independent of the genetic background, on the estimated growth parameters or features.</p>

<title>Molecular typing of sequenced isolates</title>
<p>Molecular typing of the isolates to determine capsular serotypes and sequence types (STs) was done <italic>in silico</italic> using Pathogenwatch (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pathogen.watch/">https://pathogen.watch/</ext-link>), a global platform for genomic surveillance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup>.

<title>Construction of multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic tree</title>
<p>The generated draft assemblies for each isolate were mapped to the pneumococcal ATCC 700669 reference genome (GenBank accession: NC_011900) using Snippy (version 4.6.0) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/tseemann/snippy">https://github.com/tseemann/snippy</ext-link>). We identified 155,305 SNPs in the generated alignment using SNP-sites (version 2.3.2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup> and then used them to construct a maximum-likelihood phylogeny using IQ-TREE (version 2.0.3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup>. We used the alignment of variable sites by mapping to a reference genome to generate a maximum-likelihood phylogeny using IQ-TREE as it has been to produce more accurate phylogenies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup>. The general time reversible (GTR) nucleotide substitution model and Gamma heterogeneity of the substitution rates among sites. We assessed branch support with ultrafast bootstrap approximation using “-B 1000” option<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></sup>. We optimised bootstrapped trees by nearest neighbour interchange on bootstrap alignment by specifying the “--bnni” option. We rooted the phylogenetic tree of the pneumococcal isolates using <italic>Streptococcus oralis</italic> as an outgroup (not shown in the phylogeny). An annotated and interactive version of the phylogeny is available on the Microreact web tool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://microreact.org/project/wxmdblfgprepwugvbbtaq7">https://microreact.org/project/wxmdblfgprepwugvbbtaq7</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Quantifying the phylogenetic signal</title>
<p>To assess the correlation between the estimated growth features and pneumococcal phylogeny, we used models of continuous character evolution to estimate the phylogenetic signal using Pagel’s λ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> implemented in the “phylosig” function in phytools package (version 2.1.1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref></sup>. Pagel’s λ transforms the internal branches relative to the terminal branches and generates values ranging from zero to one, with smaller values indicating no phylogenetic signal or independent evolution of the phenotype from the phylogeny. In comparison, higher values close to one show a high phylogenetic signal or a decreased phenotype variability among genetically similar taxa at the tips of the phylogeny. First, we transformed the estimated growth features to a normal distribution using a rank-based inverse normal transform implemented in the RNOmni package (version 1.0.1.2) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RNOmni/">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RNOmni/</ext-link>). Next, we mapped the estimated continuous growth feature values onto the phylogeny using fast estimation of maximum likelihood for ancestral states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Bacterial GWAS</title>
<p>We identified the presence and absence patterns of unitig sequences To capture genetic variation in the pneumococcal genomes included in this study for the GWAS analysis. We identified unitig sequences from 31bp <italic>k-</italic>mers using Bifrost (version 1.0.6)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref></sup>. First, we inferred unitig sequences from a compacted De Bruijn graph constructed using <italic>k-</italic>mers of length 31 using draft assemblies of all the pneumococcal isolates included in this study. We then generated De Bruijn graphs for each isolate and queried them with the unitig sequences found in the entire dataset to identify the presence and absence of each unitig found in each sequenced genome. We considered a unitig present when 100% of the <italic>k</italic>-mer was presented in the De Bruijn graph. We combined the presence and absence patterns of the unitig sequences from all the isolates to construct a single matrix.</p>
<p>Since the linear mixed effects models require the tested continuous phenotype to be normally distributed, we used the normalised growth features after applying the rank-based inverse normal transformation using the RNOmni package (version 1.0.1.2) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RNOmni/">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RNOmni/</ext-link>). We performed GWAS analysis of the pneumococcal growth features using robust linear mixed effects models implemented in Pyseer (version 1.3.7-dev)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref></sup>. A kinship matrix specifying the variances and covariances of the random effects for each isolate was generated using the “similarity_pyseer” script in Pyseer. Using this kinship matrix, Pyseer fits an unobserved random effect for each isolate to account for the clonal population structure in the GWAS. We excluded unitigs with &lt;5% minimum allele frequency and &gt;95% maximum allele frequency. The inferred statistical significance for each variant was adjusted to correct for multiple testing using the Bonferroni correction. We estimated the total number of unique unitig presence and absence patterns in the dataset using a script included in Pyseer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/mgalardini/pyseer/blob/master/scripts/count_patterns.py">https://github.com/mgalardini/pyseer/blob/master/scripts/count_patterns.py</ext-link>), and used the obtained value when adjusting for multiple testing using the Bonferroni correction approach. Therefore, we defined the genome-wide statistical significance threshold as <italic>P</italic> &lt;2.58×10<sup>-07</sup>, i.e., α/G, where α=0.05 and G=194,053 is the number of unique unitig presence and absence patterns while the suggestive threshold as <italic>P</italic>&lt;5.15×10<sup>-06</sup>, whereby α=1. To check potential issues arising from the population structure, we generated quantile-quantile (QQ) plots from the output of GWAS analysis for each growth feature to compare the expected and observed <italic>P-</italic>values using qqman (version 0.1.7)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref></sup>. The overall proportion of phenotypic variability explained by variation in the genome (narrow-sense heritability [<italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup>]) was estimated using GEMMA (version 0.98.1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref></sup> and Pyseer. The input files for GEMMA were prepared based on the unitig presence and absence data using PLINK (version 1.90b4) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref></sup>. To identify variants associated with the growth features independently of the serotype, we repeated the GWAS by including the serotype as a covariate.</p>

<title>Annotation of variants identified by the GWAS analysis</title>
<p>To annotate the unitig sequences with statistical significance values below the suggestive and genome-wide significance threshold, we used a custom BioPython <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref></sup> wrapper script for BLASTN (version 2.5.0+)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref></sup> to identify genomic features in the ATCC 700669 reference genome (GenBank accession: NC_011900) and other complete pneumococcal genomes downloaded from GenBank<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref></sup>. The GWAS results were summarised and visualised using Manhattan plots using R (version 4.0.3) [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.R-project.org/">https://www.R-project.org/</ext-link>].</p>

<title>Other statistical analysis</title>
<p>We compared the growth features between serotypes and lineages using the Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test. The distribution of the growth features was plotted using violin plots using the vioplot package [version 0.4.0] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=vioplot">https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=vioplot</ext-link>). To assess the contribution of serotype and lineage to the variability in the pneumococcal growth features, we used linear mixed-effects models implemented in the lme4 package (version 1.1.35.1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref></sup> were used, with each growth feature specified as the outcome and the serotype and lineage as random effects. The statistical significance for the linear mixed model was inferred using the lmerTest package [version 3.1.3] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lmerTest">https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lmerTest</ext-link>). To assess the contribution of the serotype and lineage to the variability of each growth feature, we calculated the proportion of variance for the serotype and lineage components to the total variance. We calculated the average invasiveness of the serotypes based on a meta-analysis of data collected in different countries in infants before the introduction of the PCVs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> using the random-effects model implemented in the metafor package [version 2.4.0] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=metafor">https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=metafor</ext-link> We defined invasiveness as the odds ratio of detecting a pneumococcal serotype among isolates causing invasive disease compared to nasopharyngeal carriage. We added a value of one to cells with zero counts. Due to the unavailability of the nasopharyngeal carriage data, we imputed the prevalence of the serotypes in the carriage by dividing the prevalence in invasive disease by the average invasiveness of each serotype. Next, we used a Spearman correlation test to assess the association between the mean prevalence of serotypes in the nasopharyngeal carriage and invasive disease and average invasiveness with the average <italic>in vitro</italic> pneumococcal growth rate.</p>

<p>This is an <bold>important</bold> study that examines the impact of Streptococcus pneumoniae genetics on its in vitro growth kinetics, aiming to identify potential targets for vaccines and therapeutics. The study identified significant variations in growth characteristics among capsular serotypes and lineages, linked to phylogeny and high heritability, but genome-wide association studies did not reveal specific genomic loci associated with growth features independent of the genetic background. The evidence supporting these findings is <bold>solid</bold>.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript uses a diverse isolate collection of Streptococcus pneumoniae from hospital patients in the Netherlands to understand the population-level genetic basis of growth rate variation in this pathogen, which is a key determinant of S. pneumoniae within-host fitness. Previous efforts have studied this phenomenon in strain-specific comparisons, which can lack the statistical power and scope of population-level studies. The authors collected a rigorous set of in vitro growth data for each S. pneumoniae isolate and subsequently paired growth curve analysis with whole-genome analyses to identify how phylogenetics, serotype, and specific genetic loci influence in vitro growth. While there were noticeable correlations between capsular serotype and phylogeny with growth metrics, they did not identify specific loci associated with altered in vitro growth, suggesting that these phenotypes are controlled by the collective effect of the entire genetic background of a strain. This is an important finding that lays the foundation for additional, more highly-powered studies that capture more S. pneumoniae genetic diversity to identify these genetic contributions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The authors were able to completely control the experimental and genetic analyses to ensure all isolates underwent the same analysis pipeline to enhance the rigor of their findings.</p>
<p>(2) The isolate collection captures an appreciable amount of S. pneumoniae diversity and, importantly, enables disentangling the contributions of the capsule and phylogenetic background to growth rates.</p>
<p>(3) This study provides a population-level, rather than strain-specific, view of how genetic background influences the growth rate in S. pneumoniae. This is an advance over previous studies that have only looked at smaller sets of strains.</p>
<p>(4) The methods used are well-detailed and robust to allow replication and extension of these analyses. Moreover, the manuscript is very well written and includes a thoughtful and thorough discussion of the strengths and limitations of the current study.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) As acknowledged by the authors, the genetic diversity and sample size of this newly collected isolate set are still limited relative to the known global diversity of S. pneumoniae, which evidently limits the power to detect loci with smaller/combinatorial contributions to growth rate (and ultimately infection).</p>
<p>(2) The in vitro growth data is limited to a single type of rich growth medium, which may not fully reflect the nutritional and/or selective pressures present in the host.</p>
<p>(3) The current study does not use genetic manipulation or in vitro/in vivo infection models to experimentally test whether alteration of growth rates as observed in this study is linked to virulence or successful infection. The availability of a naturally diverse collection with phylogenetic and serotype combinations already identified as interesting by the authors provides a strong rationale for wet-lab studies of these phenotypes.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study by Chaguza et al. presents a novel perspective on pneumococcal growth kinetics, suggesting that the overall genetic background of Streptococcus pneumoniae, rather than specific loci, plays a more dominant role in determining growth dynamics. Through a genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach, the authors propose a shift in how we understand growth regulation, differing from earlier findings that pinpointed individual genes, such as wchA or cpsE, as key regulators of growth kinetics. This study highlights the importance of considering the cumulative impact of the entire genetic background rather than focusing solely on individual genetic loci.</p>
<p>The study emphasizes the cumulative effects of genetic variants, each contributing small individual impacts, as the key drivers of pneumococcal growth. This polygenic model moves away from the traditional focus on single-gene influences. Through rigorous statistical analyses, the authors persuasively advocate for a more holistic approach to understanding bacterial growth regulation, highlighting the complex interplay of genetic factors across the entire genome. Their findings open new avenues for investigating the intricate mechanisms underlying bacterial growth and adaptation, providing fresh insights into bacterial pathogenesis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study exemplifies a holistic approach to unraveling key factors in bacterial pathogenesis. By analyzing a large dataset of whole-genome sequences and employing robust statistical methodologies, the authors provide strong evidence to support their main findings. Which is a leap forward from previous studies focused on a relatively smaller number of strains. Their integration of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) highlights the cumulative, polygenic influences on pneumococcal growth kinetics, challenging the traditional focus on individual loci. This comprehensive strategy not only advances our understanding of bacterial growth regulation but also establishes a foundation for future research into the genetic underpinnings of bacterial pathogenesis and adaptation. The amount of data generated and corresponding approaches to analyze the data are impressive as well as convincing. The figures are convincing and comprehensible too.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Despite the strong outcomes of the GWAS approach, this study leaves room for differing interpretations. A key point of contention lies in the title, which initially gives the impression that the research addresses growth kinetics under both in vitro and in vivo conditions. However, the study is limited to in vitro growth kinetics, with the assumption that these findings are equally applicable to in vivo scenarios-a premise that is not universally valid. To more accurately reflect the study's scope and avoid potential misrepresentation, the title should explicitly specify &quot;in vitro&quot; growth kinetics. This clarification would better align the title with the study's actual focus and findings.</p>
<p>This study suggests that the entire genetic background significantly influences bacterial growth kinetics. However, to transform these predictions into established facts, extensive experimental validation is necessary. This would involve &quot;bench experiments&quot; focusing on generating and studying mutant variants of serotypes or strains with diverse genomic variations, such as targeted deletions. The growth phenotypes of these mutants should be analyzed, complemented by complementation assays to confirm the specific roles of the deleted regions. These efforts would provide critical empirical evidence to support the findings from the GWAS approach and enhance understanding of the genetic basis of bacterial growth kinetics.</p>
<p>In the discussion section, the authors state that &quot;the influence of serotype appeared to be higher than the genetic background for the average growth rate&quot; (lines 296-298). Alongside references 13-15, this emphasizes the important role of capsular variability, which is a key determinant of serotypes, in influencing growth kinetics. However, this raises the question: why isn't a specific locus like cps, which is central to capsule biogenesis, considered a strong influencer of growth kinetics in this study?</p>
<p>One plausible explanation could be the absence of &quot;elevated signals&quot; for cps in the GWAS analysis. GWAS relies on identifying loci with statistically significant associations to phenotypes. The lack of such signals for cps may indicate that its contribution, while biologically important, does not stand out genome-wide. This might be due to the polygenic nature of growth kinetics, where the overall genetic background exerts a cumulative effect, potentially diluting the apparent influence of individual loci like cps in statistical analyses.</p>

<p>This study provides insights into the growth kinetics of a diverse collection of Streptococcus pneumoniae, identifying capsule and lineage differences. It was not able to identify any specific loci from the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that were associated with the growth features. It does provide a useful study linking phenotypic data with large-scale genomic population data. The methods for the large part were appropriately written in sufficient detail, and data analysis was performed with rigour. The interpretation of the results was supported by the data, although some additional explanation of the significance of e.g. ancestral state reconstruction would be useful. Efforts were made to make the underlying data fully accessible to the readers although some of the supplementary material could be formatted and explained a bit better.</p>
