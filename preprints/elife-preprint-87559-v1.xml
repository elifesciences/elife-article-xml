<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Quinidine has been used as an anticonvulsant to treat patients with KCNT1-related epilepsy by targeting gain-of-function KCNT1 pathogenic mutant variants. However, the detailed mechanism underlying quinidine’s blockade against KCNT1 (Slack) remains elusive. Here, we report a functional and physical coupling of the voltage-gated sodium channel Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 and Slack. Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 binds to and highly sensitizes Slack to quinidine blockade. Homozygous knockout of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 reduces the sensitivity of native sodium-activated potassium currents to quinidine blockade. Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-mediated sensitization requires the involvement of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6’s N- and C-termini binding to Slack’s C-terminus, and is enhanced by transient sodium influx through Na<sub>V</sub>1.6. Moreover, disrupting the Slack-Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 interaction by viral expression of Slack’s C-terminus can protect against Slack<sup>G269S</sup>-induced seizures in mice. These insights about a Slack-Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 complex challenge the traditional view of “Slack as an isolated target” for anti-epileptic drug discovery efforts, and can guide the development of innovative therapeutic strategies for KCNT1-related epilepsy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The sodium-activated potassium (K<sub>Na</sub>) channels Slack and Slick were first identified in guinea pig cardiomyocytes, and were subsequently found to be encoded by two genes of the <italic>Slo2</italic> family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Slack channels encoded by the <italic>Slo2.2</italic> (<italic>KCNT1</italic>) gene are gated by Na<sup>+</sup>, while Slick channels encoded by the <italic>Slo2.1</italic> (<italic>KCNT2</italic>) gene are more sensitive to Cl<sup>-</sup> than Na<sup>+</sup>. Slack channels are expressed at high levels in the central nervous system (CNS), especially the cortex and brainstem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Activation of Slack channels by intracellular sodium ions forms delayed outward currents in neurons, contributes to slow afterhyperpolarization (AHP) following repeated action potentials, and modulates the firing frequency of neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Mutations in the <italic>KCNT1</italic> gene have been implicated in a wide spectrum of epileptic disorders, including early-onset epilepsy (<italic>e.g.</italic>, epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS), non-EIMFS developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, and autosomal dominant or sporadic sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (ADSHE))<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Over 50 mutations related to seizure disorders have been identified, typically displaying a gain-of-function (GOF) phenotype in heterologous expression systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. The prescribed antiarrhythmic drug, quinidine, has emerged as a precision therapy for KCNT1-related epilepsy by blocking Slack mutant variants <italic>in vitro</italic> and conferring decreased seizure frequency and improved psychomotor development in clinical treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. However, clinical quinidine therapy has shown limited success and contradictory therapeutic effects, probably due to poor blood–brain barrier penetration, dose-limiting off-target effects, phenotype-genotype associations, and rational therapeutic schedule<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Slack requires high intracellular free Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations ([Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>in</sub>) for its activation in neurons (K<sub>d</sub> of ~66 mM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. However, previous investigations have shown that the [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>in</sub> at resting states (~10 mM) is much lower than the [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>in</sub> needed for effective Slack activation (<italic>e.g.</italic>, K<sub>d</sub> value)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Therefore, native Slack channels need to localize with Na<sup>+</sup> sources within a nanodomain to be activated and exert physiological function. Slack channels are known to be functionally coupled with sodium-permeable ion channels in neurons, such as voltage-gated sodium (Na<sub>V</sub>) channels and AMPA receptors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. A question arises as to whether these known Na<sup>+</sup> sources modulate Slack’s sensitivity to quinidine blockade.</p>
<p>Here, we found that Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 sensitizes Slack to quinidine blockade. Slack and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 form a complex that functions in Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-mediated transient sodium influx to sensitize Slack to quinidine blockade in HEK293 cells and in primary cortical neurons. The widespread expression of these channel proteins in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum supports that the Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-Slack complex is essential for the function of a wide range of electrically excitable neurons, and moreover, that this complex can be viewed as a vulnerable target for drug development to treat KCNT1-related disorders.</p>

<title>Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 sensitizes Slack to quinidine blockade</title>
<p>Slack currents are activated by sodium entry through voltage-gated sodium (Na<sub>V</sub>) channels and ionotropic glutamate receptors (<italic>e.g.</italic> AMPA receptors)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. To investigate potential modulators of Slack’s sensitivity to quinidine blockade, we initially focused on the known Na<sup>+</sup> sources of Slack. Working in HEK293 cells, we co-expressed Slack with AMPA receptor subunits (GluR1, GluR2, GluR3, or GluR4) or Na<sub>V</sub> channel α subunits (Na<sub>V</sub>1.1, Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, Na<sub>V</sub>1.3, or Na<sub>V</sub>1.6), which are highly expressed in the central nervous system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. The sensitivity of Slack to quinidine blockade was assessed based on the detected inhibitory effects of quinidine on delayed outward potassium currents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Interestingly, all neuronal Na<sub>V</sub> channels significantly sensitized Slack to 30 μM quinidine blockade, whereas no effect was observed upon co-expression of Slack with GluR1, GluR2, GluR3, or GluR4 (Fig. S1).</p>
<p>When co-expressing Slack with Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 in HEK293 cells, Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 sensitized Slack to quinidine blockade by nearly 100-fold (IC<sub>50</sub> = 85.13 μM for Slack expressed alone and an IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.87 μM for Slack upon co-expression with Na<sub>V</sub>1.6) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1A,B,D,F</xref>). Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 also exhibited &gt;10-fold selectivity in sensitizing Slack to quinidine blockade against Na<sub>V</sub>1.1, Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, and Na<sub>V</sub>1.3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C,F</xref>, and Supplementary Table 1). When we co-expressed the cardiac sodium channel Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 with Slack, we observed only ~3-fold sensitization of Slack to quinidine blockade (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1E,F</xref>). These results together indicate that the apparent functional coupling between Slack and Na<sub>V</sub> channels is Na<sub>V</sub>-channel-subtype-specific, with Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 being particularly impactful in Slack’s responsivity to quinidine blockade.</p>

<p>Slack and Slick are both K<sub>Na</sub> channels (with 74% sequence identity) and adopt similar structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, and Slick is also blocked by quinidine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. We next assessed whether Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 sensitizes Slick to quinidine blockade and observed that, similar to Slack, co-expression of Slick and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 in HEK293 cells resulted in a sensitization of Slick to quinidine blockade (7-fold) (Fig. S2A,B). These results support that Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 regulates both Slack and Slick and that Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 can sensitize K<sub>Na</sub> channels to quinidine blockade <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
<p>We also asked whether Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 sensitizes native K<sub>Na</sub> channels to quinidine blockade <italic>in vivo</italic>. We performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in primary cortical neurons from Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-knockout C3HeB/FeJ mice and the wild-type littermate controls. K<sub>Na</sub> currents (I<sub>KNa</sub>) were isolated by replacing sodium ions with equivalent lithium ions in the bath solution (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G,H</xref>). 3 μM quinidine significantly blocked native I<sub>KNa</sub> (44%) in wild-type neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I,K</xref>), while the same concentration of quinidine had no significant effect on I<sub>KNa</sub> in Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-knockout (Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-KO) neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J,K</xref>). These results support that Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 is required for the observed high sensitivity of native K<sub>Na</sub> channels to quinidine blockade.</p>

<title>Transient sodium influx through Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 enhances Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-mediated sensitization of Slack to quinidine blockade</title>
<p>We next investigated the biomolecular mechanism underlying Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-mediated sensitization of Slack to quinidine blockade. Considering that Slack currents are activated by sodium influx<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, we initially assessed the effects of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-mediated sodium influx on sensitizing Slack to quinidine blockade. We used 100 nM tetrodotoxin (TTX) to block Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-mediated sodium influx (Fig. S3A,B)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. In HEK293 cells expressing Slack alone, 100 nM TTX did not affect Slack currents; nor did it affect Slack’s sensitivity to quinidine blockade (IC<sub>50</sub> = 83.27 μM) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A,B</xref> and Fig. S3C,D). In contrast, upon co-expression of Slack and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 in HEK293 cells, bath-application of 100nM TTX significantly reduced the effects of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 in sensitizing Slack to quinidine blockade (IC<sub>50</sub> = 25.04 μM) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A,B</xref>). These findings support that sodium influx through Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 contributes to Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-mediated sensitization of Slack to quinidine blockade.</p>

<p>It is known that Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-mediated sodium influx involves a transient inward flux that reaches a peak before subsequently decaying to the baseline within a few milliseconds; this is termed a transient sodium current (I<sub>NaT</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. A small fraction of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 currents are known to persist after the rapid decay of I<sub>NaT,</sub> and these are termed persistent sodium currents (I<sub>NaP</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. We isolated I<sub>NaT</sub> and I<sub>NaP</sub> to explore their potential contributions in sensitizing Slack to quinidine blockade. We selectively inactivated I<sub>NaT</sub> using a depolarized prepulse of −40mV (Fig. S4A) and selectively blocked I<sub>NaP</sub> by bath- application of 20 μM riluzole, which is a relatively specific I<sub>NaP</sub> blocker that is known to stabilize inactivated-state Na<sub>V</sub> channels and delay recovery from inactivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Our findings ultimately confirmed that the 20 μM riluzole selectively blocked I<sub>NaP</sub> compared to I<sub>NaT</sub> in HEK293 cells co-expressing Slack and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 (Fig. S4B) and that 20 μM riluzole had no effect on Slack currents when expressed alone (Fig. S4C,D).</p>
<p>Consistent with previous investigations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, inactivating I<sub>NaT</sub> reduced whole-cell Slack currents by 20%, and blocking I<sub>NaP</sub> reduced Slack currents by 40% (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C,D,F,G</xref>), supporting that Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-mediated sodium influx activates Slack. Interestingly, inactivating I<sub>NaT</sub> resulted in a &gt; 20-fold decrease in Slack’s sensitization to quinidine blockade (IC<sub>50</sub> = 22.26 μM) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C,E</xref>). In contrast, blocking I<sub>NaP</sub> had no effect on Slack’s sensitization to quinidine blockade (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.60 μM) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F,H</xref>). These findings indicate that Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 sensitizes Slack to quinidine blockade via I<sub>NaT</sub> but not I<sub>NaP</sub>.</p>
<p>Given that Slack current amplitudes are sensitive to sodium influx, and considering that quinidine is a sodium channel blocker, we examined whether Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 has higher sensitivity to quinidine blockade than other Na<sub>V</sub> channel subtypes, which could plausibly explain the observed increased strength of sensitization. We used whole-cell patch-clamping to assess the sensitivity of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1, Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, Na<sub>V</sub>1.3, Na<sub>V</sub>1.5, and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 to quinidine blockade. These sodium channels exhibited similar levels of quinidine sensitivity (IC<sub>50</sub> values in the range of 35.61-129.84 μM) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I,J</xref> and Supplementary Table 3), all of which were at least 40-fold lower than the Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-mediated sensitization of Slack to quinidine blockade (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). Additionally, co-expressing Slack with Na<sub>V</sub>1.1, Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, Na<sub>V</sub>1.3, Na<sub>V</sub>1.5, or Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 in HEK293 cells did not change the sensitivity of these Na<sub>V</sub> channel subtypes to quinidine blockade (Fig. S5 and Supplementary Table 3). Thus, differential quinidine affinity for specific Na<sub>V</sub> channel subtypes cannot explain the large observed Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-mediated sensitization of Slack to quinidine blockade. Moreover, it is clear that Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-mediated sensitization of Slack to quinidine blockade is directly mediated by I<sub>NaT</sub>, rather than through some secondary effects related to Na<sub>V</sub>1.6’s higher sensitivity to quinidine blockade.</p>

<p>We found that the specific voltage-gated sodium channel blocker TTX did not completely abolish the effects of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 on sensitizing Slack to quinidine blockade (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), so it appears that a sodium-influx-independent mechanism is involved in the observed Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-mediated sensitization of Slack to quinidine blockade. We therefore investigated a potential physical interaction between Slack and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6. We initially assessed the cellular distribution of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, Na<sub>V</sub>1.6, and Slack in the hippocampus and the neocortex of mouse.

<p>To assess the interaction between Slack and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 inside living cells, we performed a FRET assay in transfected HEK293T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Briefly, we genetically fused mTFP1 and mVenus to the C-terminal regions of Slack and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Upon imaging the emission spectra cells co-expressing Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-mVenus and Slack-mTFP1 (measured at the plasma membrane region) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>), we detected positive FRET signals, indicating a Slack-Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 interaction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F,H</xref>). The plasma membrane regions from HEK293T cells co-transfected with Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 and Slack showed FRET efficiency values much larger than a negative control (in which standalone mVenus and mTFP1 proteins were co-expressed) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G,H</xref>), indicating that Slack channels reside in close spatial proximity (less than 10 nm) to Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 channels in membranes of living cells.</p>
<p>We next characterized the consequences of the Slack-Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 interaction in HEK293 cells using whole-cell recordings. Slack increased the rate of recovery from fast inactivation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 (Fig. S6E), with no significant effects on the steady-state activation, steady-state fast inactivation, or ramp currents (Fig. S6C,D,F and Supplementary Table 3). Additionally, we found that Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 had no significant effects on the activation rate or the current-voltage (I-V) relationship of Slack currents (Fig. S6A,B). These results indicate that the physical interaction between Slack and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 produces functional consequences.

<p>To investigate which interacting domains mediate Na<sub>V</sub>1.6’s sensitization of Slack to quinidine blockade, we focused on Na<sub>V</sub>1.6’s cytoplasmic fragments, including its N-terminus, inter domain linkers, and C-terminus (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Whole-cell recordings from HEK293 cells co-expressing Slack with these Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 fragments revealed that the N-terminus and C-terminus of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 significantly enhanced the sensitivity of Slack to quinidine blockade (IC<sub>50</sub> = 31.59 μM for Slack upon co-expression with Na<sub>V</sub>1.6’s N-terminus and IC<sub>50</sub> = 43.70 μM for Slack upon co-expression with Na<sub>V</sub>1.6’s C-terminus); note that the inter domain linkers had no effect (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>Subsequent co-immunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull down assays of HEK293T cell lysates experimentally confirmed that Na<sub>V</sub>1.6’s N- and C-termini each interact with Slack (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref> and Fig. S7). Additionally, whole-cell recordings using an [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>in</sub> of 5 mM again showed that Na<sub>V</sub>1.6’s N-terminus and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6’s C-terminus sensitize Slack to quinidine blockade (IC<sub>50</sub> = 27.87 μM) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). And inside-out recordings using an [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>in</sub> of 140 mM showed that co-expression of Slack, Na<sub>V</sub>1.6’s N-terminus, and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6’s C-terminus resulted in obvious sensitization of Slack to quinidine blockade, with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 2.57 μM (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>)—thus fully mimicking the aforementioned effects of full-length Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 2.91 μM) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). These findings support that the binding of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6’s N- and C-termini to Slack is required for Na<sub>V</sub>1.6’s sensitization of Slack to quinidine blockade.</p>
<p>Recalling that Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 had the least pronounced effect in sensitizing Slack to quinidine blockade among all examined Na<sub>V</sub> channels (IC<sub>50</sub> = 29.46 μM) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref> and Supplementary Table 1). We constructed Na<sub>V</sub>1.5-1.6 chimeras to test the roles of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6’s N- and C-termini in sensitizing Slack to quinidine blockade. The replacement of both the N- and C-termini of Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 with Na<sub>V</sub>1.6’s N- and C-termini (namely Na<sub>V</sub>1.5/6<sup>NC</sup>) fully mimicked effects of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 in sensitizing Slack to quinidine blockade (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.13 μM) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G-I</xref>). We also found that replacement of Na<sub>V</sub>1.5’s N-terminus with Na<sub>V</sub>1.6’s N-terminus (namely Na<sub>V</sub>1.5/6<sup>N</sup>) fully mimicked the effects of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.18 μM) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G-I</xref>). Consistently, Na<sub>V</sub>1.5’s C-terminus sensitized Slack to quinidine blockade (IC<sub>50</sub> = 37.59 μM), whereas Na<sub>V</sub>1.5’s N-terminus had no effect on Slack sensitization (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). These findings support that Na<sub>V</sub>1.6’s N-terminus is essential for sensitizing Slack to quinidine blockade.</p>
<p>Having demonstrated that Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 sensitizes Slack via Na<sub>V</sub>1.6’s cytoplasmic N- and C-termini, we investigated which domains of Slack interact with Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 and focused on Slack’s cytoplasmic fragments, including Slack’s N-terminus and C-terminus (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). In HEK293 cells co-expressing Na<sub>V</sub> and Slack, Na<sub>V</sub>-mediated sensitization of Slack to quinidine blockade was significantly attenuated upon the additional expression of Slack’s C-terminus, but not of Slack’s N-terminus (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B,C</xref>), suggesting that Slack’s C-terminus can disrupt the Slack-Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 interaction by competing with Slack for binding to Na<sub>V</sub>1.6.

In HEK293 cells co-expressing epilepsy-related Slack mutant variants (G288S, R398Q)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> and Na<sub>V</sub>, expression of Slack’s C-terminus significantly reduced whole-cell current densities of Slack<sup>G269S</sup> and Slack<sup>R398Q</sup> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A,B</xref>), supporting that disrupting the Slack-Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 interaction can indeed reduce current amplitudes of Slack mutant variants, which may protect against seizures induced by Slack mutant variants.</p>

<p>We next induced an <italic>in vivo</italic> epilepsy model by introducing a Slack G269S variant into C57BL/6N mice using adeno-associated virus (AAV) injection to mimic the human Slack mutation G288S<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Specifically, we delivered stereotactic injections of AAV9 containing expression cassettes for Slack<sup>G269S</sup> (or GFP negative controls) into the hippocampal CA1 region of 3-week-old C57BL/6N mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C,D</xref>). At 3-5 week intervals after AAV injection, we quantified the seizure susceptibility of mice upon the induction of a classic kainic acid (KA) model of temporal lobe epilepsy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. In this model, seizures with stage IV or higher (as defined by a modified Racine, Pinal, and Rovner scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>) are induced in rodents by intraperitoneal administration of 28 mg/kg KA.</p>
<p>We assessed a time course of KA-induced seizure stages at 10-min intervals and found that viral expression of Slack<sup>G269S</sup> resulted in faster seizure progression in mice compared to control GFP expression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>). We calculated the total seizure score per mouse to assess seizure severity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Slack<sup>G269S</sup>-expressing mice showed significantly higher seizure severity than GFP-expressing mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref>). The percentage of mice with stage VI~IX seizures also increased, from 9.1% in GFP-expressing control mice to 58.3% in the Slack<sup>G269S</sup>-expressing mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G</xref>). These results support that viral expression of Slack<sup>G269S</sup> significantly increases seizure susceptibility in mice.</p>
<p>To evaluate the potential therapeutic effects of disrupting the Slack-Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 interaction, we delivered two AAV9s (one for Slack<sup>G269S</sup> and one for Slack’s C-terminus [residues 326-1238]) into the CA1 region of mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). Viral expression of Slack’s C-terminus in Slack<sup>G269S</sup>-expressing mice significantly decreased seizure progression, seizure severity, and the percentage of mice experiencing stage VI~IX seizures (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E-G</xref>). These results support that viral expression of Slack’s C-terminus can prevent Slack<sup>G269S</sup>-induced seizures in mice, thus showcasing that using Slack’s C-terminus to disrupt the Slack-Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 interaction is a promising therapeutic intervention to treat KCNT1-related epilepsy.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We here found that Na<sub>V</sub>1.6’s N- and C-termini bind to Slack’s C-terminus and sensitize Slack to quinidine blockade via Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-mediated transient sodium currents. These results suggest that the pharmacological blocking effects of a channel blocker are not exclusively mediated by the channel <italic>per.se</italic>., but modulated by channel’s interacting proteins. Moreover, we show that viral expression of Slack’s C-terminus can rescue the increased seizure susceptibility and confer protection against Slack<sup>G269S</sup>-induced seizures in mice.</p>
<p>At resting membrane potential, the intracellular sodium concentration ([Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>in</sub>) in neurons (equal to ~10 mM) is too low to effectively activate Slack (K<sub>d</sub> of 66 mM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Slack is functionally coupled to sodium influx, which is known to be mediated by ion channels and receptors, including Na<sub>V</sub>, AMPARs, and NMDARs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Such Na<sup>+</sup> sources can provide both the membrane depolarization and the Na<sup>+</sup> entry known to be required for Slack activation, enabling Slack to contribute both to action potential repolarization during neuronal high-frequency firing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> and to regulating excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) at post-synaptic neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Our results support that Slack and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 form a channel complex, while also implying that Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-mediated sodium influx increases the Na<sup>+</sup> concentration in the close vicinity of Slack to activate Slack. As a low threshold Na<sub>V</sub> channel subtype, Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 has been reported to dominate the initiation and propagation of action potentials in axon initial segments (AIS) in excitatory neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. The activation of Slack by Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 at AIS has multiple impacts, including ensuring the timing of the fast-activated component of Slack currents, regulating the action potential amplitude, and apparently contributing to intrinsic neuronal excitability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>An interesting question arises from our observation that Slack’s sensitivity to quinidine blockade is enhanced by I<sub>NaT</sub> but not I<sub>NaP</sub>: what can explain the distinct I<sub>NaT</sub> and I<sub>NaP</sub> contributions? We speculate that with physical modulation by Na<sub>V</sub>1.6, I<sub>NaT</sub> may elicit a specific open conformation of Slack that brings its quinidine binding pocket into a high affinity state, which could lead to a substantial increase in Slack’s sensitivity to quinidine blockade. The possibility of this hypothetical open conformation is supported by previous reports of the presence of subconductance states detected in single-channel recordings of <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes expressing Slack channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, which implies that there are multiple open conformations of Slack. Although only one open conformation of Slack has been observed in cryo-EM, the gap between maximum conformational open probability (~1.0) and maximum functional open probability (~0.7) implies a subclass within this class of open channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, gain-of-function Slack mutant variants have been linked to a broad spectrum of epileptic disorders that are accompanied by intellectual disabilities and both psychomotor and developmental defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Given that many patients are refractory or non-responsive to conventional anticonvulsants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>, and considering the limited success of quinidine in clinical treatment of KCNT1-related epilepsy, inhibitors targeting Slack are needed urgently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Several small-molecule inhibitors against Slack have been reported, providing informative starting points for drug development efforts with KCNT1-related epilepsy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. However, our discovery of the Slack-Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 complex challenges the traditional view that Slack acts as an isolated target in KCNT1-related epilepsy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Indeed, our study supports that co-expression of Slack and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 in heterologous cell models should be performed when analyzing clinically relevant Slack mutations and when screening anti-epileptic drugs for use in treating KCNT1-related disorders.</p>
<p>Genotype-phenotype analysis has shown that ADSHE-related mutations are clustered in the regulator of conductance of K<sup>+</sup> (RCK2) domain; while EIMFS-related mutations do not show a particular pattern of distribution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. All functionally tested Slack mutant variants show gain-of-function phenotypes, with increased Slack currents <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Further, the epilepsy-related Slack mutant variants confer their gain-of-function phenotypes through two molecular mechanisms: increasing maximal channel open probability (P<sub>max</sub>) or increasing sodium sensitivity (K<sub>d</sub>) of Slack<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Both P<sub>max</sub> and K<sub>d</sub> are highly sensitive to [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>in</sub>; these are respectively analogous to the efficacy and potency of [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>in</sub> on Slack currents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Notably, several Slack mutant variants show gain-of-function phenotypes only at high [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>in</sub> (<italic>e.g.</italic> 80 mM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. These results indicate that the gain-of-function phenotype of epilepsy-related Slack mutant variants is aggravated by high [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>in</sub>. Our discovery of functional coupling between Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 and Slack presents a plausible basis for how Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-mediated sodium influx can increase [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>in</sub> and thus apparently aggravate the gain-of-function phenotype of Slack mutant variants. Therefore, it makes sense that disruption of the Slack-Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 interaction by overexpressing Slack’s C-terminus reduces the current amplitudes of gain-of-function Slack mutant variants (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A,B</xref>). Our successful demonstration that viral expression of Slack’s C-terminus prevents epilepsy-related Slack<sup>G269S</sup>-induced seizures in mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E-G</xref>) warrants further translational evaluation for developing therapeutic interventions to treat KCNT1-related epilepsy.</p>

<p>The plasmids expressing full-length or fragments of Slack and Na<sub>V</sub> channels (excluding full-length Na<sub>V</sub>1.6) were co-transfected into HEK293 cells using lipofectamine 2000 (Introvigen). To co-express Slack with Na<sub>V</sub>1.6, the plasmid expressing Slack was transfected into a stable HEK293 cell line expressing Na<sub>V</sub>1.6. 18-36 h after transfection, voltage-clamp recordings were obtained using a HEKA EPC-10 patch-clamp amplifier (HEKA Electronic) and PatchMaster software (HEKA Electronic). For all whole-cell patch clamp experiments in HEK cells except for data presented in Fig. S2d, the extracellular recording solution contained (in mM): 140 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl2, 5 glucose, 10 HEPES, 1 Tetraethylammonium chloride (310 mOsm/L, pH 7.30 with NaOH).

<title>Acute slice preparation and current-clamp recordings</title>
<p>Horizontal slices containing hippocampus were obtained from 6-8 weeks old heterozygous Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 knockout (Scn8a<sup>+/−</sup>) C3HeB/FeJ mice and the wild-type littermate controls. In brief, animals were anesthetized and perfused intracardially with ice-cold modified “cutting solution” containing (in mM): 110 choline chloride, 2.5 KCl, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 7 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 10 glucose; bubbled continuously with 95%O<sub>2</sub>/5%CO<sub>2</sub> to maintain PH at 7.2.

<p>Slices were subsequently transferred to a submerged chamber containing “recording solution” maintained at 34-36 °C. Whole-cell recordings were obtained from hippocampal CA1 neurons under a ×60 water-immersion objective of an Olympus BX51WI microscope (Olympus). Pipettes had resistances of 5-8 MΩ.

<p>In our whole-cell current-clamp recordings with an Axon 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices), we initially applied a 100 ms, 20 pA test pulse to the recording neurons right after breaking into the whole-cell configuration. A fast-rising component and a slow-rising component of voltage response were clearly visible. Then we zoomed into the fast-rising component of the voltage responses and turned up the pipette capacitance neutralization slowly to shorten the rise time of the fast-rising component until the oscillations of voltage responses appeared. Subsequently, we decreased the capacitance compensation just until the oscillations disappeared. For bridge balance of current-clamp recordings, we increased the value of bridge balance slowly until the fast component of the voltage response disappeared, and the slow-rising component appeared to rise directly from the baseline. Series resistance and pipette capacitance were compensated using the bridge balance and pipette capacitance neutralization options in the Multiclamp 700B command software (Molecular Devices). The bridge balance value was between 20 and 30 MΩ and the pipette capacitance neutralization value was between 3 and 5 pF. For in vitro experiments, the cells were selected by criteria based on hippocampal CA1 cell morphology and electrophysiological properties in the slices. Electrophysiological recordings were made using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices). Recordings were filtered at 10 kHz and sampled at 50 kHz. Data were acquired and analyzed using pClamp10.0 (Molecular Devices). Series resistance was in the order of 10–30 MΩ and was approximately 60–80% compensated. Recordings were discarded if the series resistance increased by more than 20% during the time course of the recordings.</p>

<title>Fluorescence Imaging and FRET Quantification</title>
<p>The spectroscopic imaging was built upon a Nikon TE2000-U microscope. The excitation light was generated by an Ar laser. The fluorescent protein mVenus fused to Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 and mTFP1 fused to Slack were excited by laser line at 500 and 400-440 nm, respectively. The duration of light exposure was controlled by a computer-driven mechanical shutter (Uniblitz). A spectrograph (Acton SpectraPro 2150i) was used in conjunction with a charge coupled device (CCD) camera (Roper Cascade 128B). In this recording mode two filter cubes (Chroma) were used to collect spectroscopic images from each cell (excitation, dichroic): cube I, D436/20, 455dclp; cube II, HQ500/20, Q515lp. No emission filter was used in these cubes. Under the experimental conditions, auto fluorescence from untransfected cells was negligible. Fluorescence imaging and analysis were done using the MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging). User-designed macros were used for automatic collection of the bright field cell image, the fluorescence cell image, and the spectroscopic image. Emission spectra were collected from the plasma membrane of the cell by positioning the spectrograph slit across a cell and recording the fluorescence intensity at the position corresponding to the membrane region (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>, dotted lines in red); the same slit position applied to both the spectrum taken with the mTFP1 excitation and the spectrum taken with the mVenus excitation Using this approach, the spectral and positional information are well preserved, thus allowing reliable quantification of FRET efficiency specifically from the cell membrane. Spectra were corrected for background light, which was estimated from the blank region of the same image.</p>
<p>FRET data was quantified in two ways. First, the FRET ratio was calculated from the increase in mVenus emission due to energy transfer as described in the previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> Briefly, mTFP1 emission was separated from mVenus emission by fitting of standard spectra acquired from cells expressiring only mVenus or mTFP1. The fraction of mVenus-tagged molecules that are associated with mTFP1-tagged molecules, Ab, is calculated as
<disp-formula id="eqn7">

</disp-formula>
where <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> is the dissociation constant and [Dfree] is the concentration of free donor molecules. Note that</p>
<disp-formula id="eqn8">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="532982v1_eqn8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
<p>Regression analysis was used to estimate Ab in individual cells. From each cell, the FRET ratio<sub>exp</sub> was experimentally determined. The predicted Ab value was then computed by adjusting two parameters, FRET Ratio<sub>max</sub> and apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>. Ab was in turn used to give a predicted FRET ratiopredicted. By minimizing the squared errors (FRET ratio<sub>exp</sub> – FRET ratio<sub>predicted</sub>)<sup>2</sup>, <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> was determined.</p>
<p>Second, apparent FRET efficiency was also calculated from the enhancement of mVenus fluorescence emission due to energy transfer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup> using a method as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup> Briefly, Ratio A<sub>0</sub> and Ratio A were measured to calculate FRET efficiency. Ratio A<sub>0</sub> represents the ratio between tetramethylrhodamine maleimide emission intensities (in the absence of fluorescein maleimide) upon excitation at the donor and acceptor excitation wavelengths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>, and was calculated in the present study at the mVenus peak emission wavelength. A particular advantage of quantifying Ratio A<sub>0</sub> for FRET measurement is that changes in fluorescence intensity caused by many experimental factors can be cancelled out by the ratiometric measurement. A similar ratio, termed Ratio A, was determined in the presence of mTFP1 in the same way as Ratio A<sub>0</sub>. If FRET occurred, the Ratio A value should be higher than Ratio A<sub>0</sub>; the difference between Ratio A and Ratio A<sub>0</sub> was directly proportional to the FRET efficiency by the factor of extinction coefficient ratio of mTFP1 and mVenus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup></p>

<p>The authors report that an interaction between the sodium-activated potassium channel Slack and Nav1.6 sensitizes Slack to inhibition by quinidine. This is an <bold>important</bold> finding because it contributes to our understanding of how the antiseizure drug quinidine affects epilepsy syndromes arising from mutations in the Slack-encoding gene KCNT1. The results are largely <bold>compelling</bold>, although additional data would strengthen the claims of a direct channel-channel interaction in vivo.</p>

<p>Despite numerous studies on quinidine therapies for epilepsies associated with GOF mutant variants of Slack, there is no consensus on its utility due to contradictory results. In this study Yuan et al. investigated the role of different sodium selective ion channels on the sensitization of Slack to quinidine block. The study employed electrophysiological approaches, FRET studies, genetically modified proteins and biochemistry to demonstrate that Nav1.6 N- and C-tail interacts with Slack's C-terminus and significantly increases Slack sensitivity to quinidine blockade in vitro and in vivo. This finding inspired the authors to investigate whether they could rescue Slack GOF mutant variants by simply disrupting the interaction between Slack and Nav1.6. They find that the isolated C-terminus of Slack can reduce the current amplitude of Slack GOF mutant variants co-expressed with Nav1.6 in HEK cells and prevent Slack induced seizures in mouse models of epilepsy. This study adds to the growing list of channels that are modulated by protein-protein interactions, and is of great value for future therapeutic strategies.</p>
<p>I have a few comments with regard to how Nav1.6 sensitize Slack to block by quinidine.</p>
<p>It is not clear to me if the Slack induced current amplitude varies depending on the specific Nav subtype. To this end, it would be valuable to test if Slack open probability is affected by the presence of specific Nav subtypes. Nav induced differences in Slack current amplitude and open probability could explain why individual Nav subtypes show varied ability to sensitize Slack to quinidine blockade.</p>
<p>It has previously been shown that INaP (persistent sodium current) is important for inducing Slack currents. Here the authors show that INaT (transient sodium current) of Nav1.6 is necessary for the sensitization of Slack to quinidine block whereas INaP surprisingly has no effect. The authors then show that the N-tail together with C-tail of Nav1.6 can induce same effect on Slack as full-length Nav1.6 in presence of high intracellular concentrations of sodium. However, it is not clear to me how the isolated N- and C-tail of Nav1.6 can induce sensitization of Slack to quinidine by interacting with C-terminus of Slack, while sensitization also is dependent on INaT. The authors speculate on different slack open conformation, but one could speculate if there is a missing link, such as an un-identified additional interacting protein that causes the coupling.</p>

<p>This is a very interesting paper about the coupling of Slack and Nav1.6 and the insight this brings to the effects of quinidine to treat some epilepsy syndromes.</p>
<p>Slack is a sodium-activated potassium channel that is important to hyperpolarization of neurons after an action potential. Slack is encoded by KNCT1 which has mutations in some epilepsy syndromes. These types of epilepsy are treated with quinidine but this is an atypical antiseizure drug, not used for other types of epilepsy. For sufficient sodium to activate Slack, Slack needs to be close to a channel that allows robust sodium entry, like Nav channels or AMPA receptors. but more mechanistic information is not available. Of particular interest to the authors is what allows quinidine to be effective in reducing Slack.</p>
<p>In the manuscript, the authors show that Nav, not AMPA receptors, are responsible for Slack's sensitization to quinidine blockade, at least in cultured neurons (HeK293, primary cortical neurons). Most of the paper focuses on the evidence that Nav1.6 promotes Slack sensitivity to quinidine.</p>
<p>The paper is very well written although there are reservations about the use of non-neuronal cells or cultured primary neurons rather than a more intact system. I also have questions about the figures. Finally, riluzole is not a selective drug, so the limitations of this drug should be discussed. On a minor point, the authors use the term in vivo but there are no in vivo experiments.</p>

<p>Yuan et al., set out to examine the role of functional and structural interaction between Slac and NaVs on the Slack sensitivity to quinidine. Through pharmacological and genetic means they identify NaV1.6 as the privileged NaV isoform in sensitizing Slac to quinidine. Through biochemical assays, they then determine that the C-terminus of Slack physically interacts with the N- and C-termini of NaV1.6. Using the information gleaned from the in vitro experiments the authors then show that virally-mediated transduction of Slack's C-terminus lessens the extent of SlackG269S-induced seizures. These data uncover a previously unrecognized interaction between a sodium and a potassium channel, which contributes to the latter's sensitivity to quinidine.</p>
<p>The conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported by data, but some aspects of functional and structural studies in vivo as well as physically interaction need to be clarified and extended.</p>
<p>1. Immunolabeling of the hippocampus CA1 suggests sodium channels as well as Slac colocalization with AnkG (Fig 3A). Proximity ligation assay for NaV1.6 and Slac or a super-resolution microscopy approach would be needed to increase confidence in the presented colocalization results. Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation studies on the membrane fraction would bolster the functional relevance of NaV1.6-Slac interaction on the cell surface.</p>
<p>2. Although hippocampal slices from Scn8a+/- were used for studies in Fig. S8, it is not clear whether Scn8a-/- or Scn8a+/- tissue was used in other studies (Fig 1J &amp; 1K). It will be important to clarify whether genetic manipulation of NaV1.6 expression (Fig. 1K) has an impact on sodium-activated potassium current, level of surface Slac expression, or that of NaV1.6 near Slac.</p>
<p>3. Did the epilepsy-related Slac mutations have an impact on NaV1.6-mediated sodium current?</p>
<p>4. Showing the impact of quinidine on persistent sodium current in neurons and on NaV1.6-expressing cells would further increase confidence in the role of persistent sodium current on sensitivity of Slac to quinidine.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Despite numerous studies on quinidine therapies for epilepsies associated with GOF mutant variants of Slack, there is no consensus on its utility due to contradictory results. In this study Yuan et al. investigated the role of different sodium selective ion channels on the sensitization of Slack to quinidine block. The study employed electrophysiological approaches, FRET studies, genetically modified proteins and biochemistry to demonstrate that Nav1.6 N- and C-tail interacts with Slack's C-terminus and significantly increases Slack sensitivity to quinidine blockade in vitro and in vivo. This finding inspired the authors to investigate whether they could rescue Slack GOF mutant variants by simply disrupting the interaction between Slack and Nav1.6. They find that the isolated C-terminus of Slack can reduce the current amplitude of Slack GOF mutant variants co-expressed with Nav1.6 in HEK cells and prevent Slack induced seizures in mouse models of epilepsy. This study adds to the growing list of channels that are modulated by protein-protein interactions, and is of great value for future therapeutic strategies.</p>
<p>I have a few comments with regard to how Nav1.6 sensitize Slack to block by quinidine.</p>
<p>(1) It is not clear to me if the Slack induced current amplitude varies depending on the specific Nav subtype. To this end, it would be valuable to test if Slack open probability is affected by the presence of specific Nav subtypes. Nav induced differences in Slack current amplitude and open probability could explain why individual Nav subtypes show varied ability to sensitize Slack to quinidine blockade.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for raising this point. In order to address whether the whole-cell current amplitudes of Slack varies depending on the specific NaV subtype, we examined Slack current amplitudes upon co-expression of Slack with specific NaV subtypes in HEK293 cells. The results have shown that there are no significant differences in Slack current amplitudes upon co-expression of Slack with different NaV channel subtypes (Author response image 1), suggesting whole-cell Slack current amplitudes cannot explain the varied ability of NaV subtypes to sensitize Slack to quinidine blockade. To investigate the effect of different NaV channel subtypes on Slack open probability, we will perform the single-channel recordings in the future studies.</p>

<p>(2) It has previously been shown that INaP (persistent sodium current) is important for inducing Slack currents. Here the authors show that INaT (transient sodium current) of Nav1.6 is necessary for the sensitization of Slack to quinidine block whereas INaP surprisingly has no effect. The authors then show that the N-tail together with C-tail of Nav1.6 can induce same effect on Slack as full-length Nav1.6 in presence of high intracellular concentrations of sodium. However, it is not clear to me how the isolated N- and C-tail of Nav1.6 can induce sensitization of Slack to quinidine by interacting with C-terminus of Slack, while sensitization also is dependant on INaT. The authors speculate on different slack open conformation, but one could speculate if there is a missing link, such as an un-identified additional interacting protein that causes the coupling.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully agree the importance of investigating the detailed mechanism underlying the sensitization of Slack to quinidine blockade mediated by the N- and C-termini of NaV1.6. Regarding the possibility of additional interacting proteins (“missing link”) that mediate the coupling between Slack and NaV1.6, our GST-pull down assays involving Slack and the N- and C-termini of NaV1.6 (Fig. S7) suggest a direct interaction between Slack and NaV1.6 channels. This finding leads us to consider the possibility of additional interacting proteins might be excluded. In order to further address these questions, we plan to employ structural biological methods, such as cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>This is a very interesting paper about the coupling of Slack and Nav1.6 and the insight this brings to the effects of quinidine to treat some epilepsy syndromes.</p>
<p>Slack is a sodium-activated potassium channel that is important to hyperpolarization of neurons after an action potential. Slack is encoded by KNCT1 which has mutations in some epilepsy syndromes. These types of epilepsy are treated with quinidine but this is an atypical antiseizure drug, not used for other types of epilepsy. For sufficient sodium to activate Slack, Slack needs to be close to a channel that allows robust sodium entry, like Na channels or AMPA receptors. but more mechanistic information is not available. Of particular interest to the authors is what allows quinidine to be effective in reducing Slack.</p>
<p>In the manuscript, the authors show that Nav, not AMPA receptors are responsible for Slack activation, at least in cultured neurons (HeK293, primary cortical neurons). Most of the paper focuses on the evidence that Nav1.6 promotes Slack sensitivity to quinidine.</p>
<p>(1)    The paper is very well written although there are reservations about the use of non-neuronal cells or cultured primary neurons rather than a more intact system.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's positive evaluation of our work. We acknowledge that utilizing a more intact system would provide valuable insights into the inhibitory effect of quinidine on Slack-NaV1.6. However, there are certain challenges associated with studying Slack currents in their entirety.</p>
<p>First, in our experiments, isolating Slack currents from Na+-activated K+ currents in an intact system is challenging as selective inhibitors for Slick are currently unavailable. To address this, we propose using Slick gene knockout mice to specifically measure Slack currents under physiological conditions in the future investigations. Second, we have observed that the interaction between Slack and NaV1.6 primarily occurs at the axon initial segment of neurons. This poses a difficulty when using brain slices for measurements, as employing the whole-cell voltage-clamp technique to assess Slack at the axon initial segment may introduce systemic errors.</p>
<p>We believe that testing the pharmacological effects of quinidine on Slack-NaV1.6 in primary neurons remains the optimal approach. Although non-neuronal cells or cultured primary neurons may not fully replicate the complexity of an intact system, they still provide valuable insights into the interactions between Slack and NaV1.6, and the effects of quinidine.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2)    I also have questions about the figures.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will make the necessary modifications and clarifications based on the reviewer's comments:</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3)    Finally, riluzole is not a selective drug, so the limitations of this drug should be discussed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. We will discuss the limitations of riluzole in our revised version of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4)    On a minor point, the authors use the term in vivo but there are no in vivo experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thanks the reviewer for raising this point. In our experiments, although we did not conduct experiments directly in living organisms, our results demonstrated the co-immunoprecipitation of NaV1.6 with Slack in homogenates from mouse cortical and hippocampal tissues (Fig. 3C). This result may support that the interaction between Slack and NaV1.6 occurs in vivo.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Yuan et al., set out to examine the role of functional and structural interaction between Slack and NaVs on the Slack sensitivity to quinidine. Through pharmacological and genetic means they identify NaV1.6 as the privileged NaV isoform in sensitizing Slack to quinidine. Through biochemical assays, they then determine that the C-terminus of Slack physically interacts with the N- and C-termini of NaV1.6. Using the information gleaned from the in vitro experiments the authors then show that virally-mediated transduction of Slack's C-terminus lessens the extent of SlackG269S-induced seizures. These data uncover a previously unrecognized interaction between a sodium and a potassium channel, which contributes to the latter's sensitivity to quinidine.</p>
<p>The conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported by data, but some aspects of functional and structural studies in vivo as well as physically interaction need to be clarified and extended.</p>
<p>(1) Immunolabeling of the hippocampus CA1 suggests sodium channels as well as Slack colocalization with AnkG (Fig 3A). Proximity ligation assay for NaV1.6 and Slack or a super-resolution microscopy approach would be needed to increase confidence in the presented colocalization results. Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation studies on the membrane fraction would bolster the functional relevance of NaV1.6-Slac interaction on the cell surface.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for good suggestions. We acknowledge that employing proximity ligation assay and high-resolution techniques would significantly enhance our understanding of the localization of the Slack-NaV1.6 coupling.</p>
<p>At present, the technical capabilities available in our laboratory and institution do not support high-resolution testing. However, we are enthusiastic about exploring potential collaborations to address these questions in the future. Furthermore, we fully recognize the importance of conducting co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays from membrane fractions. While we have already completed Co-IP assays for total protein and quantified the FRET efficiency values between Slack and NaV1.6 in the membrane region, the Co-IP assays on membrane fractions will be conducted in our future investigations.</p>

<p>(2) Although hippocampal slices from Scn8a+/- were used for studies in Fig. S8, it is not clear whether Scn8a-/- or Scn8a+/- tissue was used in other studies (Fig 1J &amp; 1K). It will be important to clarify whether genetic manipulation of NaV1.6 expression (Fig. 1K) has an impact on sodium-activated potassium current, level of surface Slack expression, or that of NaV1.6 near Slack.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. In Fig. 1G,J,K, primary cortical neurons from homozygous NaV1.6 knockout (Scn8a-/-) mice were used. We will clarify this information in the revised manuscript. In terms of the effects of genetic manipulation of NaV1.6 expression on IKNa and surface Slack expression, we compared the amplitudes of IKNa measured from homozygous NaV1.6 knockout (NaV1.6-KO) neurons and wild-type (WT) neurons. The results showed that homozygous knockout of NaV1.6 does not alter the amplitudes of IKNa (Author response image 2). The level of surface Slack expression will be tested further.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer’s question. We examined the amplitudes of NaV1.6 sodium current upon expression alone or co-expression of NaV1.6 with epilepsy-related Slack mutations (K629N, R950Q, K985N).

<p>1. Showing the impact of quinidine on persistent sodium current in neurons and on NaV1.6-expressing cells would further increase confidence in the role of persistent sodium current on sensitivity of Slack to quinidine.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s question. Previous studies have shown that quinidine can inhibit persistent sodium currents at low concentrations1. In our experiments, blocking persistent sodium currents by application of riluzole in the bath solution showed no significant effects on the sensitivity of Slack to quinidine blockade upon co-expression of Slack with NaV1.6 (Fig. 2F,H). This result suggested that persistent sodium currents were not involved in the sensitization of Slack to quinidine blockade.</p>
