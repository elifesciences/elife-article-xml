<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Influenza neuraminidase is a crucial target for protective antibodies, yet the development of recombinant neuraminidase protein as a vaccine has been held back by instability and variable expression. We have taken a pragmatic approach to improving expression and stability of neuraminidase by grafting antigenic surface loops from low-expressing neuraminidase proteins onto the scaffold of high-expressing counterparts. The resulting hybrid proteins retained the antigenic properties of the loop donor while benefiting from the high-yield expression, stability, and tetrameric structure of the loop recipient. These hybrid proteins were recognised by a broad set of human monoclonal antibodies elicited by influenza infection or vaccination, with X-ray structures validating the accurate structural conformation of the grafted loops and the enzymatic cavity. Immunisation of mice with neuraminidase hybrids induced inhibitory antibodies to the loop donor and conferred protected against lethal influenza challenge. This pragmatic technique offers a robust solution for improving the expression and stability of influenza neuraminidase proteins for vaccine development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Influenza neuraminidase (NA) is an important target for protective antibodies and therapeutic drugs against influenza viruses. Currently, influenza subunit vaccines focus on haemagglutinin and contain minimal amounts of NA, despite emerging evidence from multiple studies indicating NA’s importance as an independent protective antigen <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> (reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>). However, recombinant NA protein expression is often bedevilled by low yield and poor stability, with substantial variation in NA protein yields across different virus strains (Supplementary Table 1). With the ExpiCHO transient expression system (Thermo Fisher), we have found that yields of the N1 subtype NA varied from undetectable (H1N1/2019) to a maximum of 380 mg per L of culture (H5N1/2021).</p>
<p>We have applied structural and epitope information to devise a solution to improve the expression and stability of our recombinant NAs. NA is a mushroom shaped type II homotetrameric protein <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>). The polypeptide chain of the NA monomeric head folds into six, topologically identical, four-stranded, antiparallel β-sheets which are arranged like the blades of a propeller <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Each of the six β-sheet blades, numbered B1-B6, is composed of four anti-parallel β-strands in a W-shape numbered S1-S4. The β-strands in the “W” are connected at the top and bottom by loops (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). The loop between the fourth strand of the preceding beta sheet and the first strand of the following sheet (L01), and the loop between the second and third strands (L23) form most of the top surface and the active site of the NA and were delineated in the first crystal structure of the N2 NA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> and in subsequent structures (reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>). As there are six β-sheets in each NA monomer, there are six L01 and six L23 loops that together form most of the top surface of each identical NA monomer with a final contribution from the C-terminal domain of ∼17 amino acids (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Surface antigenic loops transfer method to design NA-hybrid protein.</title><p><bold>a) NA Anatomy.</bold> Each monomer of the tetrameric NA head is composed of a six-bladed propeller-like structure. Each blade unit consists of a β-sheet composed of four β-strands connected by loops arranged in a W-shape. The loop preceding β-strand 1 is termed Loop01 and the loop connecting β-strands 2 and 3 is termed Loop23. The twelve 01 and 23 loops in each monomer point up and surround and contribute to the enzyme active site. <bold>b) Antigenic surface formation.</bold> The key antigenic surface on the top of each NA monomer is formed by the twelve 01 and 23 loops from the six β-sheet units and the C-terminal domain. The twelve loops and the C-terminal domain in one monomer are coloured to show the top surface surrounding the active site. The remaining four Beta strands and the Loops 12 and 34 we refer to as the “scaffold”. Oseltamivir is shown in red in the sialic acid receptor binding site. A calcium ion at its binding site is shown as a green circle. <bold>c) Hybrid NA design.</bold> Loops 01 and 23 and the C-terminal domain, and the scaffold are shown separately. Oseltamivir and the binding residues are included for reference. The surface antigenic loops 01 and 23 of an NA of interest were transferred on to the scaffold of a high-expressing NA candidate to improve the protein yield and stability.

<p>The L01 and L23 loops encircle the cavity forming the NA enzyme active site that binds sialic acid. NA cleaves off host sialic acids, aiding the release of newly formed virions from infected cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. While the loop residues contributing to the active site of NA are completely conserved, the remaining sequence of these loops can be highly variable. Many antibodies that inhibit enzyme activity and are protective in vivo bind to these loops (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, Supplementary Fig. 1, 2). Multiple studies have also shown that the majority of, but not all (Supplementary Fig. 1), monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to NA select resistant viruses with amino acid replacements in the L01 and L23 loops. Analysis of the evolution of NAs has shown that the great majority of sequence change over time occurs at the surface exposed residues of NA, which include the residues of the L01 and L23 loops <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We assumed that the interactions between monomers in the NA tetramer are likely to make a major contribution to the stability and efficiency of expression of recombinant tetrameric NA in vitro. From known crystal structures Ellis et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> identified forty-four residues that may contribute to these contacts in the N1 protein, ten of which occurred in loops L01 and L23 (as defined by Varghese et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>). In their final design of the stabilised sNAp-155 N1 2009 NA they replaced ten of these forty-four amino acids, of which only two residues (conserved in N1 NA) were in the surface loops B2L01 and B2L23. Thus, the majority of intermonomer contacts are <italic>not</italic> in the L01 and L23 surface loops. In addition, the tertiary structure of NA is highly conserved. Within a NA subtype the Cα atoms of the NA head (including surface loops), are superimposable with average root mean square deviation (RMSD) between the Cα atoms of less than 0.37 Å for N1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. From these observations we reasoned that it might be possible to combine the antigenic features of a poorly expressed NA with the expression and stability properties of a high expressing NA by grafting the L01 and L23 loops from the former onto the structural “scaffold” of the latter, particularly within an NA subtype.</p>

<title>Design of loop-grafted NA hybrid proteins</title>
<p>NA proteins were expressed in a transient mammalian ExpiCHO expression system using a gene construct comprising the N-terminus signal sequence, purification tags, SpyTag, a tetrabrachion tetramerization domain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> and the NA head ectodomain (Supplementary Fig. 3a, see Methods). The protein was purified from clarified supernatants and analysed using size-exclusion chromatography, SDS-PAGE with BS3 cross linking, thermal unfolding, and enzymatic assays. We found that H5N1 A/mute swan/England/053054/2021 NA (mSN1) expressed at ∼380 mg/L as a tetramer with minimal aggregation, exhibiting high enzymatic activity and a high melting temperature (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). However, H1N1 A/California/07/2009 NA (N1/09) expressed at ∼15 mg/L with a tendency to form aggregates, and H1N1 A/Wisconsin/588/2019 NA (N1/19) had a variable expression from undetectable to low (performed twice).</p>
<p>Using the PDB 1NN2 (H2N2 A/Tokyo/3/1967) structure and the top surface loop annotations by Varghese et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> as a guide, we annotated the twelve L01 and L23 loops of the N1 neuraminidases (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 a,b</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 4, Supplementary Table 2). We transferred 12 dissimilar residues within the loops of N1/09 and 16 dissimilar residues of N1/19 to the H5N1/2021 scaffold (mSN1) to create N1/09 and N1/19 hybrids (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). From now on the protein containing the N1/09Loops on the mS scaffold and N1/19 Loops on the mS scaffold will be referred to as the N1/09 hybrid and N1/19 hybrid, respectively. The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the final ∼17 amino acids of the N1 protein also forms part of the top surface. However, in these N1 NAs the CTD was conserved.</p>

The sequence conservation is shown by green bars. The numbering here is based on N1 numbering as used in the annual Crick Reports (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2022-10/Crick%20report%20Sep2022%20for%20SH2023_to%20post.pdf">https://www.crick.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2022-10/Crick%20report%20Sep2022%20for%20SH2023_to%20post.pdf</ext-link>). Loops 01 and 23 that form the top antigenic surface are highlighted. Loops annotation is based on Varghese et al. (see Supplementary Table 2 and supplementary Figure 4 for detailed information). Residues that form the catalytic site (8 residues) and conserved framework residues for the catalytic site (11 residues) of the enzymatic cavity are annotated with red and orange bars respectively. These residues are highly conserved between NA subtypes and the majority are part of the surface loops - 7/8 catalytic residues and 8/11 catalytic site framework residues. Two catalytic site framework residues are at the edge of loop B2L01.

<title>N1/09 and N1/19 hybrid proteins expressed at higher level as stable tetramers</title>
<p>There was a substantial increase in protein yield for both N1/09 and N1/19 hybrid proteins (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). These hybrids expressed as tetramers with negligible aggregation, as demonstrated by size-exclusion chromatography (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>) and a BS3 cross-linked tetrameric complex of ∼250 kDa resolved on SDS-PAGE (Supplementary Fig. 3b). The hybrids were enzymatically active in both small substrate MUNANA (580 Da) and large substrate fetuin (49 kDa) based assays. The N1/09 hybrid showed an 8°C improvement in its melting temperature T<sub>m</sub> to 64.4°C compared to the N1/09 protein (56.4°C), while the T<sub>m</sub> of the N1/19 hybrid (72.4°C) surpassed the H5N1 mSN1 scaffold donor (68.7°C). The 4.3°C difference in melting temperature between the mSN1 protein (68.7°C) and the N1/09 hybrid (64.4°C) may indicate that the sequence variation in the loops also contributes to stability of the tetramer.</p>

<caption><title>Characteristics of NA hybrid proteins including epitope specificity.</title><p><bold>a) Characteristics of NA proteins.</bold> NA proteins were expressed in a transient mammalian ExpiCHO expression system. Gene constructs including affinity purification tags, SpyTag and an artificial tetramerisation domain tetrabrachion at N-terminus were cloned in the pcDNA3.1-vector. Proteins were purified using the 6His tag and Nickel-sepharose HisTrap purification columns. See supplementary figure 2 for constructs design and SDS-PAGE of purified proteins. N1/09 hybrid means residues of loops 01 and 23 of N1/2009 grafted to mSN1 (H5N1/2021) scaffold. N1/19 hybrid means loops 01 and 23 of N1/2019 grafted to mSN1 (H5N1/2021) scaffold. The expression yield of NA proteins and their hybrid forms is included in the 2<sup>nd</sup> column. N1/19 protein didn’t express in ExpiCHO cells in two instances. Size-exclusion chromatography graphs are shown in the 3<sup>rd</sup> column. Elution volume of 10-14 mL indicates tetrameric form of the protein. MUNANA and ELLA activity of the NA proteins are in 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> columns and the nanoDSF thermal melting temperature is in final column. The sharp narrow peak and the higher melting temperature indicate higher protein stability. <bold>b) Epitope specificity has been transferred with loops.</bold> Human monoclonal antibodies, previously published and some new, were titrated for ELISA binding of NA proteins. Areas under the curve were ranked after normalisation with one of the strongest binding mAb (see Supplementary Fig. 6a) ‘+++’ denotes &gt;70% binding, ‘++’ 40-70% binding, ‘+’ 10-40%, and ‘-’ &lt;10% as a non-binder. Loops cross-reactive mAbs AG7C, AF9C, Z2B3 and 1G01, all defined by crystal structures, show full binding to all NA proteins. Seven mAbs (NmAb) do not bind mSN1 but bind to N1/09, N1/19 and their hybrid forms. NmAb-03 is specific to N1/19 surface Loops. mAb CD6 is a scaffold dependent mAb that shows binding to N1/19 hybrid protein but does not bind the N1/19 protein on the cell surface (see Supplementary Fig. 5b). mAb Z2C2 is specific for mSN1 and N1/09, hence did not bind N1/19 or its hybrid form.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="617814v2_fig3.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>Binding by mAb CD6 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> was also informative as CD6 binds across two protomers of the tetrameric NA and makes contacts with both loop and scaffold residues (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Ellis et al have shown that binding of CD6 is dependent on the formation of compact closed conformation tetramers, whereas a more open conformation N1 2009 tetramer failed to bind CD6 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Further, we compared the binding of CD6 to N1/09-VASP (with human vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein tetramerisation domain) and N1/09-TB [with tetrabrachion (TB) tetramerisation domain] proteins expressed in ExpiCHO cells and found that CD6 recognised only the latter (Supplementary Fig. 5b). CD6 bound better to N1/09 infected cells than to the recombinant N1/09-TB protein (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 6a). This aligns with Ellis et al.’s findings that the 2009 N1 protein (with a VASP tetramerisation domain) predominantly formed open tetramers that failed to bind CD6. Our recombinant N1/09 protein with the TB tetramerisation domain may have formed a mixture of open and closed tetramers, also suggested by the appearance of aggregates on size-exclusion chromatography and the relatively low T<sub>m</sub> of 56.4°C (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). In contrast, CD6 bound strongly to the N1/09 hybrid protein, which had a higher T<sub>m</sub> of 64.4°C. CD6 also bound strongly to mSN1 scaffold donor.</p>
<p>The CD6 epitope was lost on seasonal H1N1 viruses isolated after 2015 (unpublished observation) so CD6 bound to cells infected with N1/09 but not N1/19 virus, but CD6 bound to the N1/19 hybrid protein strongly, suggesting that CD6’s binding to the N1/19 hybrid depended on the scaffold residues donated by the msN1 protein, and that the N1/19 hybrid protein had formed a compact tetramer compatible with the N1/19 hybrid’s higher T<sub>m</sub> of 72.4°C (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>).</p>

<title>N1/09 and N1/19 hybrid proteins retained epitope specificity and enzyme activity</title>
<p>Next, we assessed the NA hybrid proteins for the epitopes recognised by monoclonal antibodies isolated from humans infected with influenza virus or vaccinated with inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine. A comprehensive analysis was done using a collection of twenty-five human mAbs, isolated by us or synthesized in the laboratory based on published sequences (see Methods; Supplementary Fig. 3a). Results from the binding titration of fifteen mAbs on mSN1 and hybrid proteins and NA on the virus-infected cell membrane are depicted in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>. These included a set of five broadly reactive mAbs, including four, 1G01 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, Z2B3 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, AG7C and AF9C (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> and manuscript in preparation) with crystal structures showing binding to the L01 and L23 loops, and nine strain specific mAbs that distinguished between loop donor and recipient. Cross-reactive mAbs showed full binding to all proteins -mSN1, loop-donors, and hybrid proteins. Seven mAbs which did not bind the mSN1 protein but bound N1/09, also bound to the N1/09 hybrid protein, showing their specificity for the transferred loops. Similarly, NmAb-03, displaying specific binding to N1/19 NA on infected cells, exclusively bound to the N1/19 hybrid protein. By contrast, mAb Z2C2 which is specific for mSN1 and N1/09, bound neither N1/19-infected cells nor the N1/19 hybrid protein.</p>
<p>These results showed that for a wide collection of cross reactive and specific mAbs, isolated from influenza infected or vaccinated humans, binding was retained on the hybrid proteins. Together these results suggested that the tertiary structure of the loops had been retained after grafting onto the msN1 scaffold.</p>
<p>NA inhibiting drugs, oseltamivir and zanamivir, inhibited the NA activity of the hybrid proteins (Supplementary Fig. 3c). Similarly, mAb 1G01, a known catalytic site targeting mAb also inhibited the activity of mSN1 and N1/09 hybrid but not N1/19 hybrid. This result was expected since the mAb 1G01 lost its inhibitory activity on 2019 H1N1 seasonal influenza <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> due to the substitution N222K (N1 numbering) located within the loop B3L01 (unpublished observation, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 3c). While enzyme inhibition was lost, detectable binding of 1G01 was retained to N1/19 cells and N1/19 hybrid proteins (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 6a).</p>

<title>mSN1, N1/09 hybrid and N1/19 hybrid crystal structures are nearly identical</title>
<p>To assess whether loop grafting influenced the local or overall structure of the neuraminidase, we determined high resolution crystal structures of mSN1, the N1/09 hybrid, and the N1/19 hybrid (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, Supplementary Table 3). Overlay analysis revealed that N1/09 hybrid and N1/19 hybrid were nearly identical in structure to mSN1, with overall root-mean-square (RMS) deviations of &lt;0.25 Å across equivalent Cα atoms upon overlay (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>.

All segments of the scaffold region in both NA hybrids superposed extremely well onto mSN1, with RMS deviation values of less than 0.5 Å between the most distantly aligned Cα residue pairs. Minor deviations were observed in the B1L23 (150-loop) and B6L23 (430-loop) regions bordering the active-site cavity, with the RMS deviation distances of up to ∼1.0 Å between aligned Cα residue pairs. The remaining loops showed RMS deviation values of less than 0.5 Å.</p>

<p>While the scaffold is structurally conserved across the three resolved structures, each possess unique active site conformations, which are primarily influenced by the L01 and L23 loops surrounding the active site cavity. Analysis of mSN1, N1/09 hybrid, and N1/19 hybrid structures revealed some variability in active site conformations, with the greatest variability existing between the cavities of two msN1 molecules within the asymmetric unit of the crystal, reflecting different trajectories of the B1L23 (150-loop) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). Additionally, we observed that the Y344N substitution in the N1/09 and N1/19 hybrids slightly widened the enzymatic cavity compared to msN1.</p>
<p>The structural and monoclonal antibody binding data thus showed that the twelve or sixteen substitutions in loops matching the 2009 and 2019 seasonal N1s grafted onto the avian N1 scaffold did not affect the protein fold.

However, N1/09 protein did not induce a cross-reactive response against mSN1, although the N1/09 hybrid did elicit antibodies that inhibited mSN1. This difference may have been due to improved structural integrity of the N1/09 hybrid, or possibly due to induction of inhibitory antibodies to the mSN1 scaffold.</p>

<p>The mSN1 and the N1/19 hybrid both induced strong inhibitory antibodies to themselves, but the sera to mSN1 failed to cross-inhibit the enzyme activity of N1/19-like virus (Supplementary Fig. 7b,c) and the N1/19 hybrid protein did not generate a cross-inhibitory NAI antibody response to mSN1. So, in this case the common mSN1 scaffold did not generate cross-inhibitory antibodies. N1/19 had four significant additional amino acid substitutions (see discussion) compared to N1/09 in the transferred L01 and L23 loops which may have been responsible for the loss of cross reactivity between 2019 N1 with the 2021 avian mSN1. However, the N1/19 hybrid did generate antibodies that cross-inhibited N1/09 virus, so all four immunogens mSN1, N1/09, N1/09 hybrid and, N1/19 hybrid induced antibodies that could inhibit 2009 viral neuraminidase.</p>

<title>Murine Challenge Studies</title>
<p>We challenged immunised DBA/2 mice with a lethal dose of H1N1/2009 (X-179A) virus and monitored weights for at least 14 days.

Vaccination with all the tested NA proteins mSN1, N1/09, N1/09 hybrid and N1/19 hybrid protected mice from severe weight loss on challenge with X-179A. These results mirrored several studies in the literature which showed that immunisation with the 2009 N1 could provide at least partial protection in mice and ferrets to the avian H5N1 challenge <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, and is compatible with the well characterised human mAbs that cross-inhibit broadly within the N1 subtype (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>).</p>

Ten cross-reactive mAbs showed full binding to all proteins - PR8 N1 and mSN1 and their loops-exchanged hybrids.

CD6 is a scaffold-dependent mSN1 binder and did not bind to PR8 N1 NA.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our Loop-grafting concept is straightforward and may be broadly applicable within other NA subtypes. The concept is based on three simple assumptions: 1) the majority of protective epitopes for the antibody response are present in the L01 and L23 loops on the top surface of the NA head as defined by Varghese and Colman <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, 2) the stability of the NA tetramer depends mainly on interactions between monomers encoded in the remainder of the NA sequence (the “scaffold”), and 3) the structure of the loops will be maintained when grafted from one scaffold to another, at least within an NA subtype <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>The role of the tetramerisation domain</title>
<p>In preliminary experiments we compared the VASP and Tetrabrachion (TB) tetramerisation domains for expression and immunisation with the 2009 N1 protein. We found that the VASP domain supported the formation of a NA tetramer but the tetrameric protein did not bind the CD6 antibody that binds across two monomers (Supplementary Figure 5b), confirming results of Ellis et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. By contrast the N1/09-TB did bind CD6 and protected mice against matched viral challenge, as shown here. This result suggested that, while the VASP-linked 2009 N1 does form tetramers as defined by size-exclusion and cross-linking, the protein may not be in an optimal state for vaccination. We therefore have used the tetrabrachion domain to form tetramers throughout this report.</p>

<title>The basis for stable tetramer formation</title>
<p>The hybrid proteins we produced all appeared to form stable tetramers as defined by SEC, BS3 crosslinking and melting temperature. They were all active in ELLA (large substrate) and MUNANA (small substrate) enzyme activity assays and were inhibited by standard small molecule inhibitors. We tested a wide range of virus specific and cross-reactive human mAbs and with few exceptions the antibodies bound to the hybrid proteins. In addition, the CD6 antibody, that binds across two monomers and only to fully formed tetramers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, bound to our hybrid proteins held together by the TB tetramerization domain. Finally, the crystal structures of our hybrid N1 proteins confirmed that the grafted loops had retained their expected conformations. Together these data suggested that the hybrid proteins had folded correctly and, in most pairs, combined the expression and stability characteristics of the scaffold donor with the antigenic properties of the loop donor.</p>
<p>Ellis et al. defined forty-four residues that form contacts between N1 2009 monomers that could be involved in maintaining the stability of a tetramer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. In their final design of the stabilised sNAp-155 N1 2009 NA they replaced ten of these forty-four amino acids, to obtain a stable 2009 N1 tetramer supported by a VASP tetramerization domain (Supplementary Fig. 9). In our hybrids, tetramerized with TB, these ten residues are completely conserved between the scaffold and loop donors, so the source of stability for our hybrid proteins must lie elsewhere.</p>

<title>The distribution of epitopes on Neuraminidase</title>
<p>Varghese, Laver, and Colman described the structure of L01 and L23 loops on the top surface of N2 NA and showed that these loops contribute largely to the active site, notably including seven of eight conserved residues in the catalytic site and eight of eleven conserved framework residues that support the site <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Also, in the L01 and L23 loops surrounding the active site they noted multiple variable residues that vary seasonally associated with antigenic drift, and that can be selected for viral resistance by monoclonal antibodies in vitro. Resistance mutations selected for by three N2 murine mAbs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> and N9 mAbs were within loops B3L01, B5L01 and B5L23 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.

In supplementary figure 1 we have collected a set that identifies thirty-one sites of amino acid substitution selected by monoclonal antibodies in independent experiments. Twenty-five of these are in Loops 01 and 23, with three additional sites in immediate neighbor positions to these loops (90% altogether). Three additional sites of selection can be assigned to the underside of the NA head at the interface of stalk and head (position 88), B4 Loop 12 (position 285), B4 Loop34 (position 309). In addition, a recent study of human sera identified position 386 on B5 loop 34 as responsible for an antigenic change between N1/1977 and N1/1986 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Crystal structures of bound Fab fragments give further information on the footprints of protective antibodies (Supplementary Fig. 2). The majority describe binding to the L01 and L23 loops, with recent examples also confirming binding to the side (CD6, NA-22) and underside of NA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. The majority of antibodies defined by crystallography bind within the surface of a single monomer, with recent structural evidence that a few mAbs binds across two monomers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Finally, several structures of antibodies that bind within the active sites of a broad range of NAs have been described, all of which contact the L01 and L23 loops <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. From these data we suggest that most antibodies generated by NA that are likely to be protective bind to the L01 and L23 loops, while a minority bind to epitopes on the underneath and side of the NA head that are not included within the L01 and L23 loops.</p>

<title>Definition of Loops</title>
<p>To align the top surface loops in N1 proteins, we relied on loop annotations from the N2 NA structure resolved to 2.9 Å by Varghese et al. as a reference <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. The loop definitions in the structure later resolved to 2.2 Å differed slightly <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> Supplementary Fig. 4). We suggest that loop annotations for a grafting experiment should not be rigid and requires some judgement, particularly for residues at the margins of loops, taking into consideration solvent accessibility in crystal structures, evidence for evolutionary selection, viral resistance mutations selected with mAbs in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 1), and defined crystal structures of bound antibodies (Supplementary Fig. 2). For instance, in our N1/19 hybrid design, residue N200S, could have been considered as part of loop B2L23 (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). In addition the C-terminal domain (CTD) contributes to surface residues and may be suitable for grafting, since residues within this section of NA have been selected by mAbs in vitro and clearly evolve over time <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, and (Supplementary Fig. 1,2). However, the CTD of N1 was conserved in all of our examples.</p>

<sec id="s3e">
<title>Vaccination with hybrid NAs</title>
<p>Our NA vaccination strategy is based on our earlier evidence that linking tetrameric NAs to the mi3 vaccine-like particle (valency of sixty) via a SpyTag/SpyCatcher covalent linkage results in enhanced immunogenicity and dose sparing, with doses as low as 0.1 μg of NA protein able to induce NAI antibody <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. This compares well to the higher doses of pure protein used in the majority of studies of NA immunity (reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>). In the present experiments we opted for two doses of 0.5 μg of mi3 linked NA that gave full protection in preliminary experiments (not shown), comparable to recent results from Pascha et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In our first set of grafting experiments between N1/2009 and mSN1 (H5N1 2021) we found that while protein expression was greatly improved, antisera from animals were cross reactive for NA inhibition between the scaffold H5N1 donor, the hybrid (with 12 amino acid replacements in the L01 and L23 loops) and the 2009 Loop donor. In addition, all immunised animals were protected from challenge with 2009 H1N1 virus. These results were consistent with evidence that within the N1 subtype there is broad cross-reactivity for antibodies and that immunisation with 2009 N1 provides at least partial protection against an avian H5N1 (reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>). Cross-reactivity could have been for epitopes anywhere within the NA structure.</p>
<p>The sequence difference in the loops between 2019 N1 donor and the H5N1 recipient was greater (16 amino acids), sufficient to provide an antigenic distance that prevented cross inhibition by antisera from animals immunised with these two NAs. The NA inhibitory activity of the antisera was predominantly specific for the L01 and L23 loops. N1/19 had four significant additional amino acid substitutions compared to N1/09 in the transferred L01 and L23 loops: N222K (B3L01), N244D (B3L23), N270K (B4L01) and K432E (B6L23). All four of these residues have been selected for resistance by inhibitory mAbs in vitro (see Supplementary Fig. 1), or form contacts with mAbs demonstrated in crystal structures (Supplementary Fig. 2), so these residues are likely to have been responsible for the loss of cross reactivity between N1/2019 and mSN1. We do not have a challenge model for the 2019 H1N1 virus, so we could not look for in vivo protection specific to the 2019 N1 loops.</p>
<p>The lack of cross inhibition between sera raised to the avian mSN1 and the seasonal N1/19 showed that cross reactivity of antisera to the N1 NAs is not universal, and reflects the results of Lu et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> who found minimal cross reactivity of rabbit sera raised to a seasonal N1 from A/Beijing/262/1995 and an avian N1 from A/Hong Kong/ 483/1997 that we note differed by seventeen amino acids in the L01 and L23 Loops.</p>
<p>We found that the NA of mouse-virulent H1N1 virus A/PR/8/1934 (Cambridge strain) differed by 18 amino acids in the L01 and L23 loops from the mS H5N1 scaffold donor. We therefore prepared two further hybrids in which the loops were exchanged between these two NAs. The relevant hybrids induced NA inhibitory sera that were largely loop specific, and protection against a high dose challenge with A/PR/8/34 was now dependent on matched L01 and L23 loops. In this case antibodies to the scaffold could not have been protective, and protection correlated with the NA inhibition activity induced, mirroring the evidence from human challenge and vaccination studies (reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>).</p>
<p>Taken together these results suggest caution should be exercised in designing vaccination strategies that rely on cross-protection between seasonal NAs and future pandemic NAs.</p>

<sec id="s3f">
<title>Limitations of the study</title>
<p>The three assumptions listed at the start of the discussion may not always hold. Clear examples exist of protective monoclonal antibodies that bind to epitopes in the NA scaffold, including those that bind epitopes on the side <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> and underneath of the head domain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. If these formed the majority of the response to vaccination our approach would fail due to the first assumption. However, we have found that at least for the N1 subtype the transferred loops induce both NA inhibiting antibody and provide protection against viral challenge in the mouse. In addition, loops on the underside of NA could also be exchanged. The second assumption may also be sensitive to exceptions. Ellis et al. identified forty-four residues that may contribute to the contacts between NA monomers, ten of which we note are in loops L01 and L23 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. If the latter were variable and turned out to be critical for stability of the tetramer our approach would fail. We note that one of the hybrids we produced (mS hybrid with PR8 scaffold) expressed at a lower level than either parent. Finally, the assumption that the tertiary structure of the loops is maintained after grafting may not completely hold as we have found occasional mAbs that alter their binding to the hybrid protein. However, the great majority of NA inhibitory and protective antibodies isolated from humans bound the four hybrid NAs we have made. In addition, crystal structures revealed that the transferred loops of 2009 and 2019 NA donors were virtually superposable on those of the H5N1 recipient.</p>
<p>While we acknowledge these potential shortcomings of our approach, we recommend the loop-grafting strategy as a simple and pragmatic method to improve the yield and stability of NA protein vaccine antigens. NA loop grafting can also serve as a useful starting point for analytical methods aimed at further improvement <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Computationally-optimised sequences <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> designed for cross-protection might also be improved by focusing attention on the variation within the L01 and L23 loops.</p>

<title>Impact</title>
<p>Purified NA has been safely administered to humans as a vaccine candidate <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> and NAI antibodies to NA have been shown to be an independent correlate of protection against influenza infection (reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>). Enhancing current vaccines with NA proteins could substantially boost their effectiveness. A major challenge has been the production of NA at optimal yields. In this study, we developed an innovative solution via loop-grafting to produce stable and immunogenic NA protein at high yields that addresses this critical issue. Moreover, this study presents an epitope-based vaccine design and protein engineering for generating protective immunity, which could potentially be applied to other antigens.</p>

<p>ExpiCHO cells were used for the production of NA proteins and monoclonal antibodies. They were handled according to the manufacturer’s protocol. MDCK-SIAT1 (Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells stably transfected with human α 2,6-sialyltransferase, SIAT1) cells were used for the production of viruses, and for virus infection for epitope specificity assays <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Cells were maintained in D10 medium [Dulbeccoʹs Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) foetal calf serum (Sigma-Aldrich, F9665), 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin], with incubation in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> 37 °C incubator. DMEM supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 10 mM HEPES, 0.1% BSA, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin was used for virus growth and virus dilution.

<title>NA enzymatic activity assays</title>
<p>The enzymatic activity of NA proteins was measured using ELLA (Enzyme-linked lectin assay; large substrate fetuin Mw: 49 kDa) and MUNANA (small fluorescent substrate 20-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-a-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid Mw: 489 Da) assays.</p>
<p><bold>ELLA:</bold> ELLA assays were performed as previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. In brief, serially-diluted heat-inactivated sera were incubated with pre-titrated virus (NA source) or recombinant NA protein for 1 h. The dilution medium was DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 10 mM HEPES, 0.1% (w/v) BSA, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin. The virus or NA concentration was pre-determined by titrating to measure the lowest concentration at top plateau, ensuring at least a 5-fold signal-to-noise ratio. The mixture was transferred to a Nunc Immunoassay ELISA plate (Thermo Fisher, 439454) pre-coated overnight with 25 μg/mL fetuin (Sigma-Aldrich, F3385). The plate was incubated for 18-20 h at 37 °C with 5% (v/v) CO2 in a tissue culture incubator. The NA enzymatic activity was detected by adding HRP-conjugated peanut agglutinin (Sigma-Aldrich, L7759) at 1 μg/mL after washing the plates 3 times with PBS and then developing with 50 µL TMB substrate (SeraCare). The enzymatic reaction was stopped after 5-10 min using 50 µL 1 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and the absorbance was read at 450 nm using a CLARIOstar plate reader (BMG Labtech).</p>
<p><bold>MUNANA:</bold> The protocol from the WHO Worldwide Influenza Centre, Crick Institute was adapted. The sialidase activity of NA proteins or viruses were measured by incubation of serially-diluted NA (50 uL) in 32.5 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer pH 6.5 containing 4 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> with 50 uL of 100 µM MUNANA substrate. The reaction mix was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and stopped by adding 50 uL stop solution (0.1 M glycine, 25% ethanol, pH 10.7). Changes in fluorescence was measured at 460 nm (excitation 355 nm) using a CLARIOstar. The NA concentration giving fluorescence intensity of 40-60K units (∼100-fold signal from background) was used in NA inhibition assays. NA inhibition titres of anti-sera or mAbs were determined by incubation of serially diluted sera/mAbs with NA/viruses for 1 h before the addition of MUNANA substrate.</p>
<p>% NA activity was calculated as {(X—Min)/(Max—Min)}×100 where X = measurement value, Min = buffer only, Max = NA or virus alone. The 50% inhibiting titre/concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) was determined using non-linear regression curve fit on GraphPad Prism. Kruskal-Wallis test was used for statistical analysis.

NanoDSF monitors changes in the intrinsic tryptophan or tyrosine fluorescence resulting from alterations in the 3D structure of proteins as a function of temperature. Capillaries were filled with 10 μL of NA protein at 0.4 mg/mL, placed into the sample holder and the temperature was increased from 20 to 90°C at a ramp rate of 1°C/min, with one fluorescence measurement taken per 0.1°C. The fluorescence intensity ratio (Em<sub>350 nm</sub>/Em<sub>330 nm</sub>) and its first derivative were calculated using the manufacturer’s software. Two measurements were taken for each experiment, and the means are shown. The experiment was repeated to ensure reproducibility.</p>

Antibody binding was detected using a secondary goat-anti human HRP antibody. The area under the curve was measured for each mAb’s titration curve and normalised as a percentage of relative binding to one of the highest binding mAb for comparison.

<title>Mice immunisation and virus challenge</title>
<p>Animal experiments were conducted in compliance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act Project License (PP9362617), following the principles of the 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement). Female BALB/c OlaHsd or DBA/2 OlaHsd mice (7-8 weeks old at the start of the experiment) were obtained from Envigo and housed in individually vented cages in a specialised unit for infectious diseases. The mice were housed in accordance with the UK Home Office ethical and welfare guidelines, fed standard chow, and had access to water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (Abbott) and immunised via intramuscular injections with two doses of 0.5 µg of NA-VLP immunogens adjuvanted with AddaVax<sup>TM</sup> 1:1 vol/vol, administered 3 weeks apart. Serum samples were collected 3 weeks after the booster dose: intermediate samples were obtained via tail vein and terminal samples via cardiac puncture of euthanised mice. Whole blood collected in microtainer SST tubes (BD) was allowed to clot at room temperature for 1-2 h before centrifugation at 10,000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min.

<p>The authors describe an approach to construct hybrid neuraminidase molecules that express epitopes (loops) of a specific neuraminidase grafted onto another neuraminidase. The loops (epitopes) are from low-expressing neuraminidases and the scaffold is derived from a high-expressing neuraminidase. This paper is an <bold>important</bold> contribution giving new insights into the structure, function, and immunogenicity of influenza virus neuraminidases. The paper presents <bold>convincing</bold> evidence supporting the conclusions arrived at by the authors.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript described a structure-guided approach to graft important antigenic loops of the neuraminidase to a homotypic but heterologous NA. This approach allows the generation of well-expressed and thermostable recombinant proteins with antigenic epitopes of choice to some extent. The loop-grafted NA was designated hybrid.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The hybrid NA appeared to be more structurally stable than the loop-donor protein while acquiring its antigenicity. This approach is of value when developing a subunit NA vaccine which is difficult to express. So that antigenic loops could be potentially grafted to a stable NA scaffold to transfer strain-specific antigenicity.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, major revisions to better organize the text, and figure and make clarifications on a number of points, are needed. There are a few cases in which a later figure was described first, data in the figures were not sufficiently described, or where there were mismatched references to figures.</p>
<p>More importantly, the hybrid proteins did not show any of the advantages over the loop-donor protein in the format of VLP vaccine in mouse studies, so it's not clear why such an approach is needed to begin with if the original protein is doing fine.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for their helpful comments. We have incorporated feedback from the authors to improve the manuscript. Please see our point-by-point response.</p>
<p>The purpose of loop-grafting between H5N1/2021 (a high-expressor) and the PR8 virus was not to improve the expression of PR8, which is already a good expressing NA. Instead, the loop-grafting and the <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments were done to show the loop-specific protection following a lethal PR8 virus challenge.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>In their manuscript, Rijal and colleagues describe a 'loop grafting' strategy to enhance expression levels and stability of recombinant neuraminidase. The work is interesting and important, but there are several points that need the author's attention.</p>
<p>Major points</p>
<p>(1) The authors overstress the importance of the epitopes covered by the loops they use and play down the importance of antibodies binding to the side, the edges, or the underside of the NA. A number of papers describing those mAbs are also not included.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have discussed the distribution of epitopes on NA molecule in the Discussion section &quot;The distribution of epitopes in neuraminidase&quot; (new line number 350). In Supplementary Figures 1 and 2, we have compiled the epitopes reported by polyclonal sera and mAbs via escape virus selection or crystal structural studies. There are 45 residues examples of escape virus selection, and we found that approximately 90% of the epitopes are located within the top loops (Loops 01 and Loops 23, which include the lateral sides and edges of NA). We have also included the epitopes of underside mAbs NDS.1 and NDS.3 in Supplementary Figure 2. Some of the interactions formed by these mAbs are also within the L01 and L23 loops. All relevant references are cited in Supplementary Figures 1 and 2.</p>
<p>A new figure has been added [Figure 1b (ii)] to illustrate the surface mapping of epitopes on NA.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The rationale regarding the PR8 hybrid is not well described and should be described better.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We described the rationale for the PR8 hybrid (new lines 247-250). For clarity, we have added the following sentence within the section &quot;Loop transfer between two distant N1 NAs:....&quot;</p>
<p>(new lines 255-258):</p>
<p>&quot;mSN1 showed sufficient cross-reactivity to N1/09 to protect mice against virus challenge. Therefore, we performed loop transfer between mSN1 and PR8N1, which differ by 18 residues within the L01 and L23 loops and show no or minimal cross-reactivity, to assess the loop-specific protection.&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Figure 3B and 6C: This should be given as numbers (quantified), not as '+'.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have included the numerical data in Supplementary Figure 6. The data is presented in semi-quantitative manner for simplification. To improve clarity, we have now added the following sentence to the Figure 3c legend: &quot;Refer to Supplementary Figure 6 for binding titration data&quot;.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Figure 5A and 7A: Negative controls are missing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A pool of Empty VLP sera was included as a negative control, showing no inhibition at 1:40 dilution. In the figure legends, we have stated &quot;Pooled sera to unconjugated mi3 VLP was negative control and showed no inhibition at 1:40 dilution (not included in the graphs)&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The authors claim that they generate stable tetramers. Judging from SDS-PAGE provided in Supplementary Figure 3B (BS3-crosslinked), many different species are present including monomers, dimers, tetramers, and degradation products of tetramers. In line 7 for example there are at least 5 bands.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Tetrameric conformation of soluble proteins is evidenced by the size-exclusion chromatographs shown in Figures 3a and 6b. The BS3 crosslinked SDS-PAGE are only suggestive data, indicating that the protein is a tetramer if a band appears at ~250 kDa. However, depending on the reaction conditions, lower molecular weight bands may also be observed if crosslinking is incomplete.</p>
