<title>Abstract</title>
<p>We would rather decline an effortful option, but when compelled, will move only slowly to harvest. Why should economic variables such as reward and effort affect movement vigor? In theory, both our decisions and our movements contribute to a measure of fitness in which the objective is to maximize rewards minus efforts, divided by time. To explore this idea, we engaged marmosets in a foraging task in which on each trial they decided whether to work by making saccades to visual targets, thus accumulating food, or to harvest by licking what they had earned. We varied the effort cost of harvest by moving the food tube with respect to the mouth. Theory predicted that the subjects should respond to the increased effort costs by working longer, stockpiling food before commencing harvest, but reduce their movement vigor to conserve energy. Indeed, in response to the increased effort costs of harvest, marmosets increased their work duration but reduced their movement vigor. These changes in decisions and movements coincided with changes in pupil size. As the effort cost of harvest declined, work duration decreased, the pupils dilated, and lick and saccade vigor increased. Thus, when acquisition of reward became effortful, there was a global change in the state of the brain: the pupils constricted, the decisions exhibited delayed gratification, and the movements displayed reduced vigor.</p></abstract>

<p>Why do economic variables such as reward and effort affect both the decision-making and the motor-control circuits of the brain? Our results suggest that as the brainstem neuromodulatory circuits that control pupil size respond to effort costs, they alter computations in the brain regions that control decisions, encouraging work and delaying gratification, and the brain regions that control movements, suppressing energy expenditure and reducing vigor.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>During foraging, animals work to locate a food cache and then spend effort harvesting what they have found. As they forage, their decisions appear to maximize a measure that is relevant to fitness: the sum of the rewards acquired, minus the efforts expended, divided by time, termed the capture rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). For example, a crow will spend effort extracting a clam from a sandy beach, but if the clam is small, it will abandon it because the additional time and effort required to extract the small reward --dropping it repeatedly from a height onto rocks -- can be better spent finding a bigger prize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). In other words, if going to the bank entails waiting in a long line, one should go infrequently, but make each transaction a large amount.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, reward expectation not only affects decisions, it also affects movements: we prefer the less effortful option, and move vigorously to obtain it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). This modulation of movement vigor can be justified if we consider that movements require expenditure of time and energy, which discount the value of the promised reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Thus, from a theoretical framework, it seems rational that the brain should have a mechanism to coordinate control of decisions with control of movements so that both contribute to maximizing a measure of fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>).</p>
<p>To study this coordination, we designed a task in which marmosets decided how long to work before they harvested their food. On a given trial, they made a sequence of saccades to visual targets and received an increment of food as their reward. However, the increment was small, and its harvest was effortful, requiring inserting their tongue inside a small tube. Theory predicted that in order to maximize the capture rate, harvest should commence when the reward magnitude justified the required effort. Indeed, the subjects chose to complete a few successive trials, stockpiling food, and only then initiated their harvest.</p>
<p>On some days the effort cost of harvest was low: the tube was placed close to the mouth. On other days the same amount of work, i.e., saccade trials, produced food that had a higher effort cost: the tube was located farther away. The theory made two interesting predictions: as the effort cost increased, the subjects should choose to work more trials, delaying their harvest so to stow more food, but reduce their movement vigor, thus saving energy. Indeed, when marmosets encountered an increased effort cost, they extended their work period, stockpiling food, but reduced their vigor. They slowed their saccades during the work period and slowed their licks during the harvest period.</p>
<p>What might be a neural basis for this coordinated response of the decision-making and the motor-control circuits? During the work and the harvest periods, momentary changes in pupil size closely tracked the changes in vigor: pupil dilation accompanied increases in vigor, while pupil constriction accompanied decreases in vigor, regardless of whether the movement that was being performed was a saccade, or a lick. Moreover, in response to the increased effort cost, the pupils exhibited a global change, constricting during both the work and the harvest periods.</p>
<p>If we view the changes in pupil size as a proxy for activity in the brainstem noradrenergic circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), our results suggest that as these circuits respond to effort costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>), they affect computations in the brain regions that control decisions, encouraging work and delayed gratification, and the brain regions that control movements, promoting sloth and energy conservation.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We tracked the eyes and the tongue of head-fixed marmosets as they performed visually guided saccades in exchange for food (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Each successful trial consisted of 3 visually guided saccades, at the end of which we delivered an increment of food (a slurry mixture of apple sauce and monkey chow). Because the reward amount was small (0.015-0.02 mL), the subjects rarely harvested following a single successful trial. Rather, they worked for a few trials, allowing the food to accumulate, then initiated their harvest by licking (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). The key variables were how many trials they chose to work before starting harvest, and how vigorously they moved their eyes and tongue during the work and the harvest periods.</p>

</fig>
<p>Over the course of 2.5 years, we recorded 56 sessions in subject M (29 months) and 56 sessions in subject R (23 months). A typical work period lasted about 10 seconds, during which the subjects attempted ∼8 trials, and succeeded in 4-5 trials (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>) (a successful trial was when all three saccades were within 1.25° of the center of each target). The work period ended when the subjects stopped tracking the targets and initiated harvest, which lasted about 6 seconds, resulting in 16-18 licks. Subject M completed an average of 909.5 ± 61 successful trials per session (mean ± SEM), producing an average of 241 ± 13.9 work-harvest pairs, and subject R completed an average of 1431 ± 65 successful trials, producing an average of 263 ± 8.9 work-harvest pairs.</p>
<p>We delivered food via either the left or the right tube for 50-300 consecutive trials, and then switched tubes. We tracked the motion of the tongue using DeepLabCut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>), as shown for a typical session in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>. The licks required precision because the tube was just large enough (4.4 mm diameter) to allow the tongue to penetrate. As a result, about 30% of the reward-seeking licks were successful and contacted food (30±1.6% for subject M, 28±2.5% for subject R), as shown in Video 1. Example of licks that failed to contact food are shown in Video 2, Video 3, and Video 4.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Theory and predictions</title>
<p>We imagined that our subjects coordinated their decisions and movements to maximize the sum of rewards acquired, minus efforts expended, divided by time, i.e., a capture rate. During a work period, they decided to complete a number of saccade trials <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>, a fraction β<sub><italic>s</italic></sub> of which were successful, earning food increment α, but expending effort <italic>c</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> and consuming time <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> for each trial. They then stopped working and initiated harvest, producing a number of licks <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>l</italic></sub>, a fraction β<sub><italic>l</italic></sub> of which succeeded, expending effort <italic>c</italic><sub><italic>l</italic></sub> and consuming time <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>l</italic></sub> for each lick. These actions produced the following capture rate:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="527146v2_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
In the numerator of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eq. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>)</xref>, the first term represents the fact that the food cache increased linearly with successful trials and was then consumed gradually with successful licks. The second term represents the effort expenditure of licking, and the third term represents the effort expenditure of working. Notably, the effort expenditure of work, <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="527146v2_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, grows faster than linearly as a function of trials. This nonlinearity is essential to reflect the idea that following a long work period, the capture rate must be more negative than following a short work period (i.e., more work trials produce a greater loss).</p>
<p>A control policy describes how long to work and harvest, and an optimal policy produces periods of working and harvesting, <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="527146v2_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, that maximizes <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eq. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>)</xref>. A closed-form solution for the optimal policy can be obtained (<italic>Mathematica</italic> notebook simulations.nb) and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> provides an example. As the work period concludes and the harvest period beings (<italic>n</italic><sub><italic>l</italic></sub> = 0), the capture rate is negative. This reflects the fact that the subject has performed a few trials and stockpiled food, thus expended effort but has not been rewarded yet. The capture rate rises when licking commences. Critically, the peak capture rate is not an increasing function of the work period. Rather, there is an optimal work period (<inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="527146v2_inline3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, red trace, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) associated with a given effort cost of licking <italic>c</italic><sub><italic>l</italic></sub>. If we now move the tube further, that is, increase <italic>c</italic><sub><italic>l</italic></sub>, the peak of the capture rate shifts and the optimal work period changes: the proper response to an increased effort cost of licking is to work longer, stowing more food before commencing harvest.</p>

<label>Figure 2.</label>
<caption><p>Simulation results. <bold>A</bold>. Capture rate (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eq. 1</xref>) is plotted during the harvest period as a function of lick number <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>l</italic></sub> following various number of work trials <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>. When the effort cost of licking is low (left plot, <italic>c</italic><sub><italic>l</italic></sub> = 0. 5), the optimal work period is <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="527146v2_inline14.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> (red trace). When the effort cost is higher (right plot, <italic>c</italic><sub><italic>l</italic></sub> = 2), it is best to work longer before initiating harvest. <bold>B</bold>. The metabolic cost of licking (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq. 2</xref>) is minimized when a lick has a specific duration. Tube distance varied from 0.1 to 0.3. Optimal duration that minimizes lick cost grows linearly with tube distance. <bold>C</bold>. Optimal number of work trials <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="527146v2_inline15.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and licks <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="527146v2_inline16.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> as a function food tube distance <italic>d</italic>. As the effort cost of harvest increases, one should respond by working longer, delaying harvest. <bold>D</bold>. Optimal lick duration <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="527146v2_inline17.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> as a function of food tube distance. The lick duration <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="527146v2_inline18.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> that maximizes the capture rate is smaller than the one that minimizes the lick metabolic cost (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). That is, it is worthwhile moving vigorously to acquire reward. However, <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="527146v2_inline19.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> grows faster than linearly as a function of tube distance. Thus, as the tube moves farther, it is best to reduce lick vigor. Hunger should promote work and increase vigor, while effort cost of harvest (tube distance) should promote work but reduce vigor. Parameter values for all simulations: β<sub><italic>s</italic></sub> = 0. 5, β<sub><italic>l</italic></sub> = 0. 3, <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> = 1, <italic>k</italic> = 1, α = 20 (low food value, less hunger), α = 25 (high food value, hungry).</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="527146v2_fig2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>Notably, the higher cost of licking inevitably reduces the maximum capture rate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). This should impact movement vigor: animals tend to respond to a reduced capture rate by slowing their movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), which can be viewed as an effective way to save energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). To incorporate vigor into the capture rate, we tried to define the effort cost of a single lick <italic>c</italic><sub><italic>l</italic></sub> in terms of its metabolic cost, a relationship that is currently unknown. Fortunately, other movements provide a clue: the metabolic cost of reaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>), as well as the metabolic cost of walking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), are both concave upward functions of the movement’s duration. That is, from an energetic standpoint, there is a reach speed, and a walking speed, that minimizes the energetic cost of each type of movement. If we generalize these empirical observations to licking, a reasonable energetic cost associated with a single lick emerges:
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="527146v2_eqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
In <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>)</xref>, the lick is aimed at a tube located at distance <italic>d</italic>, and has a duration <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>l</italic></sub>. The lick duration that minimizes the energetic cost is <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="527146v2_inline4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. Thus, for an energetically optimal lick, duration grows linearly with tube distance (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). However, our objective is not to minimize the cost of licking, but to maximize the capture rate. To do so, we insert <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>)</xref> into <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eq. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>)</xref> and find the optimal policy <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="527146v2_inline5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, which now depends on the distance of the food tube to the mouth (<italic>Mathematica</italic> notebook simulations.nb).</p>
<p>The theory predicts that to maximize the capture rate (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eq. 1</xref>), the response to an increased effort cost of harvest (i.e., tube distance) should be as follows: <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="527146v2_inline6.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> should increase (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="527146v2_inline7.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> should decrease (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="527146v2_inline8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> should increase (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Notably, the rate of increase in <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="527146v2_inline9.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> as a function of tube distance is faster than linear, while from an energetic point of view (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq. 2</xref>), increase in distance should produce a linear increase in lick duration. Thus, as the harvest becomes more effortful, the subject should work longer to stockpile food, but move slower.</p>
<p>To test our theory further, we thought it useful to have a way to alter decisions in one direction (say work longer) but change movement vigor in the opposite direction (move faster). In theory, this is possible: if the subject is hungry (darker lines in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>), i.e., the reward is more valuable, then they should work longer before initiating harvest. Paradoxically, they should also move faster.</p>
<p>In summary, this simple theory made two sets of predictions: in response to an increased cost of harvest, one should work longer, but move with reduced vigor. In response to an increased reward value, as in hunger, one should also work longer, but now move with increased vigor.</p>

<title>Increased effort cost of harvest promoted work but reduced saccade vigor</title>
<p>To vary the effort cost of harvest, we altered the tube distance to the mouth but kept this distance constant during each session. Varying tube distance affected the decisions of the subjects: when the tube was placed farther, they lengthened their work duration before starting harvest (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, left subplot): they attempted more trials during each work period (ANOVA, subject M: F(2,7908)=41.5 p=5.2×10<sup>−25</sup>, subject R: F(2,10948)=88.2 p=7×10<sup>−50</sup>), and produced more successful trials per work period (ANOVA, subject M: F(2,7908)=63 p=2.8×10<sup>−24</sup>, subject R: F(2,10948)=163 p&lt;10<sup>−50</sup>). This policy of delayed gratification was present throughout the recording session (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, middle plot). That is, when the harvest required more effort, the subjects worked longer, stockpiling food before initiating their harvest (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, right plot, effect of tube distance on food cached: subject M: F(2,9566)=176 p&lt;10<sup>−50</sup>, subject R: F(2,8907)=204 p&lt;10<sup>−50</sup>).</p>

</fig>
<p>During the work period the subjects made saccades to visual targets and accumulated their food. They also made saccades that were not toward visual targets and thus were not eligible for reward. For each animal we computed the relationship between peak saccade velocity and saccade amplitude across all sessions and then calculated the vigor of each saccade: defined as the ratio of the actual peak velocity with respect to the expected peak velocity for that amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). For example, a saccade that exhibited a vigor of 1.10 had a peak velocity that was 10% greater than the average peak velocity of the saccades of that amplitude for that subject. As expected, the reward-relevant saccades, i.e., saccades made to visual targets (primary, corrective, and center saccades) were more vigorous than other saccades (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, 2-way ANOVA, effect of saccade type, subject M: F (1,391459)=7248 p&lt;10<sup>−50</sup>, subject R: F (1,355839)=13641 p&lt;10<sup>−50</sup>).</p>
<p>As a work period began, the reward-relevant saccades exhibited high vigor, but then trial-by-trial, this vigor declined, reaching a low vigor value just before the work period ended (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref> vigor). Remarkably, on days in which the tube was placed farther, saccade vigor was lower (RMANOVA, effect of tube distance, subject M: F(2,59033)=224 p&lt;10<sup>−50</sup>, subject R: F(2,50103)=75.51 p=1.8×10<sup>−33</sup>). Thus, increasing the effort cost of extracting food during the harvest period produced reduced saccade vigor during the work period.</p>
<p>By definition, a more vigorous saccade had a greater peak velocity. This might imply that high vigor saccades should suffer from inaccuracy due to signal dependent noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). However, we observed the opposite tendency: as saccade vigor increased, both the magnitude and the variance of the endpoint error decreased (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, 2-way ANOVA, effect of vigor on error magnitude, subject M: F(8,59046)=480 p&lt;10<sup>−50</sup>, subject R: F(8,50184)=252 p&lt;10<sup>−50</sup>, effect of vigor on error variance, subject M: F(8,2673)=18200 p&lt;10<sup>−50</sup>, subject R: F(8,2673)=4170 p&lt;10<sup>−50</sup>). That is, reducing the effort costs of harvest not only promoted movement vigor, it also facilitated accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>).</p>
<p>Cognitive signals such as effort requirements of the task and stimulus value are associated with changes in pupil size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), as well as transient activation of brainstem neuromodulatory circuits in locus coeruleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). We wondered if the changes in tube position altered the output of these neuromodulatory circuits, as inferred via pupil size. For each reward-relevant saccade, we measured the pupil size during a ±250 ms window centered on saccade onset, and then normalized this measure based on the distribution of pupil sizes that we had measured during the entire recording for that session in that subject, resulting in a z-score.</p>
<p>At the onset of each work period the pupils were dilated, but as the subjects performed more trials, the pupils constricted, exhibiting a trial-by-trial reduction that paralleled the changes in saccade vigor (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Notably, the effort cost of harvest affected pupil size: during the work period the pupils were more dilated if the tube was placed closer to the mouth (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, RMANOVA, effect of tube distance, subject M: F(2,60502)=20 p=2×10<sup>−9</sup>, subject R: F(2,50431)=23.8 p=4.9×10<sup>−11</sup>). That is, when the effort cost of harvest was lower, the pupils dilated, and the saccades were invigorated.</p>
<p>In summary, when we increased the effort cost of harvest, the subjects responded by changing their decisions and movements. They delayed harvest onset, stockpiling more food before initiating their licking bout, and reduced their saccade vigor. These changes accompanied constriction of the pupil.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Increased effort cost of harvest reduced lick vigor</title>
<p>The work period ended when the subject chose to stop tracking the target and initiated harvest via a licking bout. As in saccades, we defined lick vigor via the ratio of the actual peak velocity of the lick with respect to the expected velocity for that lick amplitude. Lick peak velocity increased with amplitude during both protraction and retraction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Some of the licks were reward seeking and directed toward the tube, while others were grooming licks, cleaning the tongue and the area around the mouth (Video 5). Reward-seeking licks were more vigorous than grooming licks (2-way ANOVA, effect of lick type, protraction, subject M: F(1,272233)=66 p=4.5×10<sup>−16</sup>, subject R: F(1,229052)=698 p&lt;10<sup>−50</sup>), and retraction was more vigorous than protraction (reward seeking licks, retraction vs. protraction, subject M: t(241145)=532 p&lt;10<sup>−50</sup>, subject R: t(213674)=665 p&lt;10<sup>−50</sup>).</p>

</fig>
<p>As the harvest began, the first lick was very low vigor, but lick after lick, the movements gathered velocity, reaching peak vigor by the 3<sup>rd</sup> or the 4<sup>th</sup> lick (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). As the harvest continued, lick vigor gradually declined. Like saccades, licks had a lower vigor in sessions in which the tube was placed farther from the mouth (RMANOVA, effect of tube distance, subject M: F(2,59033)=222.5 p&lt;10<sup>−50</sup>, subject R: F(2,133502)=224 p&lt;10<sup>−50</sup>), and this pattern was present during the entire recording session (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, left subplot). Thus, an increased effort cost of harvest promoted sloth: reduced vigor of saccades during the work period, reduced vigor of licks during the harvest period.</p>
<p>For each reward seeking lick, we measured pupil size during a ±250ms window centered on the moment of peak tongue displacement. During licking, the pupil size changed with a pattern that closely paralleled lick vigor: as the harvest began, pupil size was small, but it rapidly increased during the early licks, then gradually declined as the harvest continued (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, right subplot). Importantly, the pupils were more dilated in sessions in which the tube was closer to the mouth (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, right subplot, effect of tube distance, subject M: F(2,166742)=583 p&lt;10<sup>−50</sup>, subject R: F(2,130493)=118 p&lt;10<sup>−50</sup>). As a result, when the effort cost of reward increased, the pupils constricted, and the vigor of both saccades and licks decreased.</p>
<p>While the theory predicted that moving the tube farther would result in a longer work period and reduced movement vigor, it also predicted that the subjects would reduce their harvest duration (reduced licks, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). That is, it predicted that the subjects would work longer, stowing more food, but leave more of it behind. This last prediction did not agree with our data (see Discussion). For Subject R, the number of licks were approximately the same across the various tube distances, and for Subject M the number of licks increased with tube distance (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, within a harvest period, lick vigor rapidly increased and then gradually declined. Simultaneous with the changes in vigor, the pupils rapidly dilated and then gradually constricted. In sessions where the tube was placed farther from the mouth, the licks had lower vigor, and the pupils were more constricted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Expectation of greater reward increased lick vigor</title>
<p>During the work period, as the subjects performed trials and accumulated food, they increased the magnitude of the available reward. To check whether reward magnitude affected movement vigor, for each tube distance we computed the average lick vigor during the harvest as a function of the number of trials completed in the preceding work period. Indeed, if a work period had included many completed trials, then the movements in the ensuing harvest period were more vigorous (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, 2-way ANOVA, effect of trials, subject M: F(4, 164242)=353 p&lt;10<sup>−50</sup>, subject R: F(4,123411)=152 p&lt;10<sup>−50</sup>). Thus, the licks were invigorated by the amount of food that awaited harvest.</p>
<p>Because the tube was small, many of the licks missed their goal and failed to contact the food. The success or failure of a lick affected both the vigor of the subsequent lick, and the change in the size of the pupil. Following a successful lick there was a large increase in lick vigor (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>, subject M: t(85182)=40 p&lt;10<sup>−50</sup>, subject R: t(81378)=104 p&lt;10<sup>−50</sup>), and a large increase in pupil size (subject M: F(84969)=57 p&lt;10<sup>−50</sup>, subject R: t(80318)=94 p&lt;10<sup>−50</sup>). In contrast, following a failed lick the subjects either reduced or did not increase their lick vigor (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>, subject M: t(114159)=0.88 p=0.37, subject R: t(97164)=-44 p&lt;10<sup>−50</sup>). This failure also produced a smaller increase in pupil size (comparison to successful lick, two sample t-test, subject M: t(198722)=14.8 p=4.3×10<sup>−50</sup>, subject R: t(176044)=53 p&lt;10<sup>−50</sup>). Thus, a single successful lick led to acquisition of reward, which then was followed by a relatively large increase in pupil size, and an invigorated subsequent lick.</p>

<title>Hunger promoted work and increased vigor</title>
<p>Our theory predicted that it should be possible to change decisions in one direction (say work longer), while altering movement vigor in the opposite direction (move faster). An increase in the subjective value of reward, as might occur when the subject is hungry, should have two effects: increase the number of trials that one chooses to work before commencing harvest, and increase movement vigor.</p>
<p>We did not explicitly manipulate the weight of the subjects. Indeed, to maintain their health, we strived to keep their weights constant during the roughly 2.5-year period of these experiments. However, there was natural variability, which allowed us to test the predictions of the theory.</p>
<p>We found that when their weight was lower than average, the subjects chose to work a greater number of trials before commencing harvest (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, two sample t-test, subject M: t(11052)=7.9 p=3.4×10<sup>−25</sup>, subject M: t(12549)=10.1 p=9.3×10<sup>−24</sup>). This result was similar to the effect that we had seen when the effort cost of harvest was increased. However, the theory had predicted that the effect on vigor should be in the opposite direction: if hunger increased reward valuation, then one should speed up to hasten food acquisition. Notably, weight did not have a consistent effect on saccade vigor across the two subjects (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>), yet during the harvest, both subjects licked with greater vigor when their weight was lower (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, subject M: t(219752)=88 p&lt;10<sup>−50</sup>, subject R: t(205163)=22 p&lt;10<sup>−50</sup>).</p>

<title>Pupil size variations strongly correlated with changes in decisions and movements</title>
<p>Finally, we considered the data across both the work and the harvest periods and asked how well movement vigor tracked pupil size. The results demonstrated that in both the work and the harvest periods, for both saccades and licks, an increase in pupil size was associated with an increase in vigor (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>, reward-relevant saccades, subject M: r=0.989 p=7.7×10<sup>−9</sup>, subject R: r=0.97 p=7.1×10<sup>−7</sup>, reward-seeking protraction licks, subject M: r=0.969 p=9.8×10<sup>−7</sup>, subject R: r=0.989 p=6.3×10<sup>−9</sup>). Moreover, when the pupil was dilated, the work periods tended to be shorter (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>, subject M: r=-0.90 p=0.00014, subject R: r=-0.97 p=6.3×10<sup>−7</sup>), while harvest durations tended to be longer (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>, subject M: r=0.894 p=0.00021, subject R: r=0.935 p=2.4×10<sup>−5</sup>). Thus, pupil dilation was associated with choosing to work less, while moving faster.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>What we choose to do is the purview of the decision-making circuits of our brain, while the implicit vigor with which we perform that action is the concern of the motor-control circuits. From a theoretical perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), these two forms of behavior should be coordinated because both the act that we select, and its vigor, dictate expenditure of time and energy, contributing to a capture rate that contributes to longevity and fecundity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Does the brain coordinate decisions and movements to maximize a capture rate? If so, how might the brain accomplish this coordination?</p>
<p>Here, we designed a foraging task in which marmosets worked by making saccades, accumulating food for each successful trial, then stopped working and harvested their cache by licking. On every trial they decided whether to work, or to harvest. Their decision was carried out by the motor system, producing either a visually guided saccade, or a lick, each exhibiting a particular vigor. The theory predicted that to maximize the capture rate, the appropriate response to an increased effort cost of harvest was to do two things: on the one hand work longer to store more food, but on the other hand reduce vigor to conserve energy.</p>
<p>We varied the effort costs by moving the food tube with respect to the mouth. This changed the effort cost of harvest but not the effort cost of work. The subjects responded by altering how they worked as well as how they harvested. When the harvest was more effortful, they performed more saccade trials to stockpile food. They also slowed their movements, reducing saccade velocity during the work period, and lick velocity during the harvest period. Notably, the most vigorous saccades were also the most accurate: as saccade vigor increased, so did endpoint accuracy.</p>
<p>The theory made a second prediction: as the value of reward increased, the subjects should again choose to work a longer period before initiating harvest, but unlike the effort costs, now respond by moving more vigorously. We did not directly manipulate the subjective value of reward, but rather relied on the natural fluctuations in body weight and assumed that when the weight was relatively low, there would be a greater hunger for reward. Indeed, when their weight was low, the subjects chose to not only work longer before initiating harvest, but also elevate their vigor during their harvest.</p>
<p>Finally, we quantified the effect of reward magnitude on vigor. In a given session, lick vigor increased robustly as a function of the number of trials completed in the preceding work period.</p>
<p>Notably, some of the predictions of the theory did not agree with the experimental data. An increased effort cost did not accompany a reduction in the duration of harvest, and hunger did not increase saccade vigor robustly. Indeed, earlier experiments have shown that if the effort cost of harvest increases, animals who expend the effort will then linger longer to harvest more of the reward that they have earned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). This mismatch between observed behavior and theory highlights some of the limitations of our formulation. For example, our capture rate reflected a single work-harvest period, rather than a long sequence. Moreover, the capture rate did not consider the fact that the food tube had finite capacity, beyond which the food would fall and be wasted. This constraint would discourage a policy of working more but harvesting less. Finally, if we assume that a reduced body weight is a proxy for increased subjective value of reward, it is notable that we observed a robust effect on vigor of licks, but not saccades. A more realistic capture rate formulation awaits simulations, possibly one that describes capture rate not as the ratio of two sums (sum of gains and losses with respect to sum of time), but rather the expected value of the ratio of each gain and loss with respect to time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>).</p>
<p>What might be a neural basis for this coordination of decisions and movements? A clue was the fact that the pupils were more constricted in sessions in which the effort cost of harvest was greater. This global change in pupil size accompanied delayed harvest and reduced vigor across sessions, but surprisingly, even within a session, transient changes in vigor accompanied changes in pupil size. During the work period the trial-to-trial reduction in saccade vigor accompanied trial-to-trial constriction of the pupil, and within a harvest period, the rapid rise and then the gradual fall in lick vigor paralleled a rapid dilatation then gradual constriction of the pupil.</p>
<p>Pupil dilation is a proxy for activity in the brainstem neuromodulatory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>) and is a measure of arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Control of pupil size is dependent on spiking of norepinephrine neurons in locus coeruleus (LC-NE): an increase in the activity of these neurons produces pupil dilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Some of these neurons show a transient change in their activity when acquisition of reward requires expenditure of physical effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). It is possible that in the present task, as the effort cost of harvest increased, LC-NE neurons decreased their activity, producing pupil constriction. If so, the reduced NE release may have had two simultaneous effects: encourage work and promote delayed gratification in brain regions that control decisions, discourage energy expenditure and promote sloth in brain regions that control movements. Thus, the idea that emerges is that the response of NE to economic variables, as inferred via changes in pupil size, might act as a bridge to coordinate the computations in the decision-making circuits with the computations in the motor-control circuits, aiming to improve the capture rate.</p>
<p>In addition to NE, the basal ganglia, and in particular the neurotransmitter dopamine, are likely the key contributors to the coordination of decisions with actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). When the effort price of a preferred food increases, animals choose to work longer, pressing a lever a greater number of times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). This desire to expend effort to acquire a valuable reward is reduced if dopamine is blocked in the ventral striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Hunger activates circuits in the hypothalamic nuclei, disinhibiting dopamine release in response to food cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Dopamine concentrations in the striatum drop when the effort price of a food reward increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>), and dopamine release before onset of a movement tends to invigorate that movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Thus, the presence of dopamine is likely to not only alter decisions by encouraging expenditure of effort, but also modify movements by promoting vigor.</p>
<p>Experiments of Hayden et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>) and Barack et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>) suggest that the decision of when to stop work and commence harvest may rely on computations that are carried out in the cingulate cortex. They found that as monkeys deliberated between the choice of staying and acquiring diminishing rewards, or leaving and incurring a travel cost, these neurons encoded a decision-variable that reflected the value of leaving the patch. The prediction that emerges from our work is that the rate of rise of these decision variables may be modulated by the presence of NE.</p>
<p>From a motor control perspective, a surprising aspect of our results was that an increase in saccade vigor accompanied improved accuracy (i.e., reduced endpoint variance). The high vigor saccades were produced at a time when the pupils were dilated, possibly implying an increased release of NE. Control of saccade accuracy appears to depend on the coordinated activity of Purkinje cells in the oculomotor region of the cerebellar vermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). LC projects to the cerebellum, and stimulation of LC neurons increases the sensitivity of Purkinje cells to their inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). An intriguing possibility that remains to be tested is that movement accuracy is controlled in the cerebellum via activities among populations of Purkinje cells, which in turn are modulated by the NE projections from LC.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Behavioral and neurophysiological data were collected from two marmosets (<italic>Callithrix Jacchus</italic>, male and female, 350-390 g, subjects R and M, 6 years old). The neurophysiological data focused on the cerebellum and are described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). Here, our focus is on the behavioral data.</p>
<p>The marmosets were born and raised in a colony that Prof. Xiaoqin Wang has maintained at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine since 1996. The procedures on the marmosets were evaluated and approved by the Johns Hopkins University Animal Care and Use Committee in compliance with the guidelines of the United States National Institutes of Health.</p>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Data acquisition</title>
<p>Following recovery from head-post implantation surgery, the animals were trained to make saccades to visual targets and rewarded with a mixture of apple sauce and lab diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). They were placed in a monkey chair and head-fixed while we presented visual targets on an LCD screen (Curved MSI 32” 144 Hz - model AG32CQ) and tracked both eyes at 1000 Hz using an EyeLink-1000 system (SR Research, USA). Timing of target presentation on the video screen was measured using a photodiode. Tongue movements were tracked with a 522 frame per second Sony IMX287 FLIR camera, with frames captured at 100 Hz.</p>
<p>Each trial began with a saccade to the center target followed by fixation for 200 ms, after which a primary target (0.5×0.5 deg square) appeared at one of 8 randomly selected directions at a distance of 5-6.5 deg. Onset of the primary target coincided with presentation of a tone. As the animal made a saccade to the primary target, that target was erased, and a secondary target was presented at a distance of 2-2.5 deg, also at one of 8 randomly selected directions. The subject was rewarded if following the primary saccade it made a corrective saccade to the secondary target, landed within 1.5 deg radius of the target center, and maintained fixation for at least 200 ms. Onset of reward coincided with presentation of another tone. Following an additional 150-250 ms period (uniform random distribution), the secondary target was erased, and the center target was displayed, indicating the onset of the next trial. Thus, a successful trial consisted of a sequence of 3 saccades: center, primary, and corrective, after which the subject received a small increment of food (0.015 mL).</p>
<p>The food was provided in two small tubes (4.4 mm diameter), one to the left and the other to the right of the animal (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). A successful trial produced a food increment in one of the tubes and would continue to do so for 50-300 consecutive trials, then switch to the other tube. Because the food increment was small, the subjects naturally chose to work for a few consecutive trials, tracking the visual targets and allowing the food to accumulate, then stopped tracking and harvested the food via a licking bout. The licking bout typically consists of 15-40 licks. The subjects did not work while harvesting. As a result, the behavior consisted of a work period of targeted saccades, followed by a harvest period of targeted licking, repeated hundreds of times per session.</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>All saccades, regardless of whether they were instructed by presentation of a visual target or not, were identified using a velocity threshold. Saccades to primary, secondary, and central targets were labeled as reward-relevant saccades, while all remaining saccades were labeled as task irrelevant.</p>
<p>We analyzed tongue movements using DeepLabCut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Our network was trained on 89 video recordings of the subjects with 15-25 frames extracted and labeled from each recording. The network was built on the ResNet-152 pre-trained model, and then trained over 1.03×10<sup>6</sup> iterations with a batch size of 8, using a GeForce GTX 1080Ti graphics processing unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). A Kalman filter was further applied to improve quality and smoothness of the tracking, and the output was analyzed in MATLAB to quantify varying lick events and kinematics.</p>
<p>We tracked the tongue tip and the edge of the food in the tube, along with control locations (nose position and tube edges). We tracked all licks, regardless of whether they were aimed toward the tube (reward seeking), or not (grooming). Reward seeking licks were further differentiated based on whether they aimed to enter the tube (inner-tube licks), hit the outer edge of the tube (outer-edge licks), or fell below the tube (under tube). If any of these licks successfully contacted the tube, we labeled that lick as a success (otherwise, a failed lick).</p>
<p>Pupil area was measured during a ±250 ms period centered at the onset of each reward-relevant saccade, and the onset of each lick. We then normalized the pupil measurements by representing it as a z-score over that session.</p>

<title>Saccade and tongue vigor</title>
<p>We relied on previous work to define vigor of a movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Briefly, if the amplitude of a movement is <italic>x</italic> and the peak speed of that movement is <italic>ν</italic>, then for each subject the relationship between the two variables can be described as:
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="527146v2_eqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
In the above expression, α, β≥0 and are subject-specific parameters. For a movement with amplitude <italic>x</italic>, its vigor was defined as the ratio of the actual peak speed with respect to the expected value of its peak speed, i.e.,<inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="527146v2_inline10.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. Expected value was computed by fitting <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3">Eq. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>)</xref> to all the data acquired across all sessions. When vigor is greater than 1, the movement had a peak velocity that was higher than the mean value associated with that amplitude.</p>

<title>Simulations</title>
<p>The optimal policy specifies the decisions and movements that for the effort cost defined in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>)</xref>, maximizes the capture rate defined in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eq. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>)</xref>. This policy selects the number of saccade trials <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> to perform during the work period, the number of licks <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>l</italic></sub> to perform during the harvest period, and the vigor of each lick, represented by the average duration of a lick <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>l</italic></sub>. To compute the optimal policy, we found the derivative of the capture rate with respect to each policy variable <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>, <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>l</italic></sub>, and <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>l</italic></sub>, then set each derivative equal to zero, producing three simultaneous nonlinear equations. In all three cases, we were able to solve for the relevant control variable analytically (see Mathematica notebook <italic>simultatons</italic>.<italic>nb</italic> for the derivations). We found that if the solution was a real number, an increase in <italic>d</italic> produced an increase in <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="527146v2_inline11.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, decrease in <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="527146v2_inline12.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, and increase in <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="527146v2_inline13.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. To generate the plots in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, we used the following parameter values: α = 20, β<sub><italic>s</italic></sub> = 0. 5, β<sub><italic>L</italic></sub> = 0. 3, <italic>c</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> = 0. 5, <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> = 1, <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub> = 0. 2, <italic>c</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub> = 0. 5 (low effort), <italic>c</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub> = 2. 5 (high effort). For the plots in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>, we used the same parameter values, but <italic>c</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub> was defined via <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>)</xref>. Thus, tube distance <italic>d</italic> varied, and <italic>T</italic> was unknown and was solved for. In <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>)</xref>, <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub> = 1. In the simulations, to describe state of hunger, we set α = 20 for a sated state and α = 25 for a hungry state.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Hypothesis testing was performed using functions provided by the <italic>MATLAB Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox</italic>. For t-tests, across the one-sample, paired-sample, and two-sample conditions, p values were computed using the <italic>ttest</italic> and <italic>ttest2</italic> functions with data that was combined across sessions, separated by condition. For ANOVA tests, in the one-way condition, p values were computed using a nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test, using the <italic>kruskalwallis</italic> function. In the 2-way condition, the <italic>anovan</italic> function was used to compute p values, accounting for an unbalanced design resulting from a varied number of samples across conditions. In both cases, like in the t-tests, data was combined across sessions, separated by condition. In the repeated measures condition, each session was treated as a subject with multiple repeated measures representing a given variable (i.e., lick vigor per lick in a harvest period). To fit a repeated measures model, the <italic>fitrm</italic> function was used, then analyzed using the <italic>ranova</italic> function. In all cases of repeated measures ANOVA, compound symmetry assumptions were tested using the Mauchly sphericity test with the <italic>maulchy</italic> function. In cases where the assumption was violated (Maulchy test p &lt; 0.05), epsilon adjustments were used, with the <italic>epsilon</italic> function, to compute corrected p values (for ε &gt; .75, use Huynh-Feldt p value and for ε &lt; .75, use Greenhouse-Geisser p values). For correlation analyses, Pearson’s correlation coefficient, r, and corresponding p values were computed using the <italic>corrcoef</italic> function.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study unravels the interaction between effort cost, pupil-indexed brain state, and movement (saccadic) vigor during foraging decisions in marmoset monkeys. Based on a computational model, the authors derive the prediction that anticipated effort should affect both decisions and movement vigor during foraging; and then provide <bold>solid</bold> behavioural and pupillometric evidence for this prediction in a foraging task. This paper will be of interest to decision and motor neuroscience as well as to all researchers studying animal behavior.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Hage et al. presents interesting results from a foraging behavior in Marmosets that explores the interactions of saccade and lick vigor with pupil dilation and performance as well as a marginal value theory and foraging theory-inspired value-based decision-making model thereof. The results are generally robust and carefully presented and analyses, particularly of vigor, are carefully executed.</p>
<p>The authors constructed a model that makes two predictions: &quot;In summary, this simple theory made two sets of predictions: in response to an increased cost of harvest, one should work longer, but move with reduced vigor. In response to an increased reward value, as in hunger, one should also work longer, but now move with increased vigor.&quot; Their behavioral data meets these predictions. It is not clear if the model was designed and tweaked in order to make those predictions and match the data, or derived from principles. Furthermore, it is not clear what other models would make similar predictions. It would help to assess what is predicted by other simple models, as well as different functional forms for the effort costs in their model.</p>
<p>Line 37 page 6; the link of pupil to NE/LC is tenuous. Other modulators systems and circuits may be equally important and should be mentioned (e.g. Reimer, Jacob, Matthew J. McGinley, Yang Liu, Charles Rodenkirch, Qi Wang, David A. McCormick, and Andreas S. Tolias. &quot;Pupil fluctuations track rapid changes in adrenergic and cholinergic activity in cortex.&quot; Nature communications 7, no. 1 (2016): 13289.)</p>
<p>
Line 35 page 6-page 7 line 10 emphasizes a cognitive interpretation of the pupil dilations they is emphasized, in relation to effort costs. But there are also concomitant more vigorous movements. Could all of their pupil results be explained by motor correlates? This should be tested and ruled out before making cognitive interpretations.</p>
<p>
Page 7, line 37-42: How would the model need to be modified in order to account for this discrepancy with the data? Ideally, this would be tested.</p>
<p>
Page 9, line 2-11: In this section, it would help to also consider 'baseline' pupil size (in between trials). This would give a signal that is not 'contaminated' by movements, and may reflect control state. Relatedly, changes in control state may impact and confound the movement-related dilation magnitudes due to e.g. floor and ceiling effects on pupil size, which has a strong tendency for reversion to the mean.</p>
<p>
Page 10 line 21-32 presents a dated view of pupil that has/had little data supporting it. They should mention other neuromodulators (Reimer et al., 2016) and related interpretations.</p>
<p>
The hunger-related and reward-size related analyses are both heavily confounded since they were not manipulated directly and could co-vary with many latent factors. For example, why might a given Marmoset be lower weight on a given day? Could it affect sleep, stress, activity, or other factors during the preceding 24 hours? If so, could these other variables be driving the results that are interpreted as 'hunger?' Relatedly, since the reward size is determined by the animals behavior on each trial (how much they worked), factors (internal brain state, external noises, etc.) that alter how much they worked will influence the subsequent reward size. Therefore interpretations about reward expectancy are confounded. Both of these issues should be discussed and manipulations of them (different feeding schedules and reward size-work functions proposed, respectively.</p>
<p>
A major issue is a lack of alternative models. The authors seem to have constructed a particular model designed to capture the behavioral patterns they observed in the data. The model fails in some instances, as they point out. Even more importantly, there are no results or discussion about how other plausible models could or couldn't fit the data. The lack of model comparisons makes it difficult to interpret the conclusions or put the results in a broader context.</p>

<p>Hage et al examine how the foraging behavior of marmoset monkeys in a laboratory setting systematically takes into account the reward value and anticipated effort cost associated with the acquisition and consumption of food. In an interesting comprehensive framework, the authors study how experimental and natural variation of these factors affect both the decisions and actions necessary to gather and accumulate food, as well as the actions necessary to consume the food.</p>
<p>The manuscript proposes a computational model of how the monkeys may guide all these aspects of behavior, by maximizing a food capture rate that trades off the food that can be gathered with the effort and duration of the underlying actions. They use this model to derive qualitative predictions for how monkeys should react to an increase in the effort associated with food consumption: Monkeys should work longer before deciding to consume the accumulated food, but should move more slowly. The model also predicts that monkeys should show a different reaction to an increase in reward value of the food, also working longer but moving faster. The authors test these predictions in an interesting experimental setup that requires monkeys to collect small increments of food rewards for successful eye movements to targets. The monkeys can decide freely when to interrupt work and consume the accumulated food, and the authors measure the speed of the eye movements involved in the food acquisition as well as the tongue movements involved in the food consumption.</p>
<p>By and large, the behavioral findings fall in line with the qualitative model predictions: When the effort involved in food consumption increases, monkeys collect more food before deciding to consume it, and they move slower both during food acquisition and food consumption. In a second test, the authors approximate the effects of reward value of the food at stake, by comparing monkey behavior during different days with natural variations in body weight. These quasi-experimental increases in the reward value of food also lead to longer work times before consumption, but to faster movements during food consumption. Finally, the authors show that these effects correlate with pupil size, with pupils dilating more for low-effort foraging actions with increased saccade speed and decreased work duration. The authors conclude that the effort associated with anticipated actions can lead to changes in global brain state that simultaneously affect decisions and action vigor.</p>
<p>The paper proposes an interesting model for how one unified action policy may simultaneously affect multiple types of decisions and movements involved in foraging. The methods employed to measure behavior and test these predictions are generally sound, and the paper is well written. While the model and paper in their present form can clearly inspire researchers to consider this integrated perspective, and trigger further research employing such a framework, there are some conceptual and methodical shortcomings that reduce the conclusiveness of the results and the usefulness of the proposed model.</p>
<p>(1) The model proposed in the paper takes a very specific functional form that is neither motivated by the previous literature nor particularly useful for indexing the behavioral tendencies of individual monkeys (or of the same monkey in different contexts). For example, while it is clear that the saccade effort cost will need to outgrow the increase in the utility of the accumulated food for the monkey to start feeding, it is unclear why this needs to be modeled with a fixed quadratic exponent on the number of saccades? Similarly, why do licks deplete the food stash with the specific rate hard-coded in the model? Finally, the proportion of successful saccades and lick events is assumed to be fixed, even though it very likely to be directly influenced by movement speed (speed-accuracy trade-off), which is also contained in the model. It would strongly increase the plausibility and potential impact of the model if the authors could clearly state where these hard-coded model terms come from. Ideally, they would formulate the model in more general terms and also consider other functional forms, as briefly suggested in the discussion. This latter point would be particularly important since not all model predictions were actually borne out in the data.</p>
<p>(2) The authors derive qualitative predictions, by simulating their model with apparently arbitrary parameters. They then test these qualitative predictions with conventional statistics (e.g., t-tests of whether monkeys lick more for high vs low effort trials). The reader wonders why the authors chose this route, instead of formulating their model with flexible parameters and then fitting these to data. This would allow them (and future researchers) to test their model not just qualitatively but also quantitatively, and to compare the plausibility of different functional forms. The authors certainly have enough data and power to do this, given the vast number of sessions the monkey completed.</p>
<p>(3) The effort manipulation chosen by the authors (distance of food tube) goes hand in hand with a greater need for precision since the monkey's tongue needs to hit an opening of similar size, but now located at a greater distance. This raises the question of whether the monkeys moved slower to enhance its chance of collecting the food (in line with a speed-accuracy trade off). The manuscript would benefit from an explicit test of this possibility, for example by reporting whether for each of the two conditions, the speed of tongue movements on a trial-by-trial basis predicts the probability of food collection? At the very least, the manuscript should explicitly discuss this issue and how it affects the certainty with which effects of tube distance can be linked to anticipated effort cost alone.</p>
<p>(4) The authors report most of the effects on the different measures (work duration, movement vigor, lick vigor, etc) in separate analyses. However, their model predicts that all of these measures result from the same action policy (maximization of the capture rate) and should therefore be related on a trial-by-trial basis. This is so far hardly tested in the presented analyses (with the exception of the pupil correlations in Figure 5). The model's assumed action policy would appear more plausible if the authors could demonstrate these trial-by-trial interrelations with some tests of association (e.g., correlations/regressions as already done for pupil measures in Figure 5) or possibly with dimensionality reduction of the multivariate data.</p>
<p>(5) The manuscript measures pupil dilation in a time period ranging from -250ms before to 250 ms after saccade onset. However, the pupil changes strongly during saccade execution relative to the preceding baseline, leaving doubts as to whether the aggregated measure blurs several interesting and potentially different effects. It would be more conclusive if the manuscript could report the analyses of pupil size separately for a period prior to saccade onset and during/after the saccade.</p>
