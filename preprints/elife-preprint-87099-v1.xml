<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Pattern formation originates during embryogenesis by a series of symmetry-breaking steps throughout an expanding cell lineage. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, classic work has shown that the embryo segmentation is established by morphogens within a syncytium, and the subsequent action of the gap, pair-rule, and segment polarity genes. This classic model however does not translate directly to species that lack a syncytium – such as <italic>C. elegans</italic> – where cell fate is specified by cell-autonomous cell lineage programs and their inter-signaling. Previous single-cell RNA-Seq studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> have analyzed cells from a mixed suspension of cells from many embryos to study late differentiation stages, or individual early stage embryos to study early gene expression in the embryo. To study the intermediate stages of early and late gastrulation (28- to 102- cells stages) missed by these approaches, here we determine the transcriptomes of the 1- to 102-cell stage to identify 119 embryonic cell-states during cell-fate specification, including ‘equivalence-group’ cell identities. We find that gene expression programs are modular according to the sub-cell lineages, each establishing a set of stripes by combinations of transcription factor gene expression across the anAterior-posterior axis. In particular, expression of the homeodomain genes establishes a comprehensive lineage-specific positioning system throughout the embryo beginning at the 28-cell stage. Moreover, we find that genes that segment the entire embryo in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have orthologs in <italic>C. elegans</italic> that exhibit sub-lineage specific expression. These results suggest that the <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo is patterned by a juxtaposition of distinct lineage-specific gene regulatory programs each with a unique encoding of cell location and fate. This use of homologous gene regulatory patterning codes suggests a deep homology of cell fate specification programs across diverse modes of development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Developmental toolkit genes constitute the genomic repertoire that underlies the pathways patterning the organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Carroll, 2008</xref>). These genes are generally involved in signaling transduction modules and transcription factors (TFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Degnan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Gerhart, 1999</xref>). Their assembly into specific temporal and spatial gene regulatory pathways leads to the specification of cell fates in the embryo. For example, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> endoderm is specified by a cascade of TFs operating sequentially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Maduro and Rothman, 2002</xref>). Identifying the principles of gene regulation has been a central endeavor in developmental biology.</p>
<p>John Sulston and colleagues elucidated the 1,340 cells generated throughout the embryogenesis of the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>, leading to a hatched worm with 558 cells, each with a described name, lineage, and fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Sulston et al., 1983</xref>). The cell lineage is delineated into a germ-line lineage – P – and five ‘founder’ somatic cell lineages – AB, MS, E, C, and D – as their each have characteristic cell-cycle timings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Deppe et al., 1978</xref>) and cell fates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). All founder cell lineages are present by the 28-cell stage, when gastrulation initiates, and by the 102-cell stage the progeny of most of the cells have a single fate.</p>

<p>The invariant cell lineage of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo provides an opportunity to systematically study developmental gene pathways. Overall, there are 934 annotated TFs in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, with 40% having experimentally studied DNA-binding specificities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Narasimhan et al., 2015</xref>). The overall set can be classified into families according to their DNA-binding domain, including the homeodomain, bHLH, bZIP, T-box, C2H2 zinc finger, and the very large nuclear hormone receptor domain. While mapping the location of signaling pathways is difficult from gene expression data, its effects on the transcriptional output are detectable and consequently studying TF expression provides an entry point into gene expression pathway characterization.</p>
<p>Here, we use single-cell RNA-Seq to identify the transcriptomes of each of the cells up to the 102-cell stage. We find that homeodomain genes are expressed in stripes along the anterior-posterior axis, as early as the 28-cell stage. Interestingly, each founder-cell lineage – AB, MS, C and E – establishes its own regionalization code. These <italic>Drosophila</italic>–like stripe patterns suggest a deep homology in cell fate specification between the embryogenesis of non-segmented and segmented animals, despite differences in syncytium-based and cell-cleavage-based modes of development.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Previous studies analyzed cells from a mixed suspension of cells from different <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Packer et al., 2019</xref>). However, this approach does not ensure sampling of each of the individual cells of the early stages, where it is difficult to dissociate the cells. A complementary approach is to manually collect cells by mouth pipette thus ensuring that all cells are collected. Other works employed this approach to study the early stages however only arrived at the 15-cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hashimshony et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Tintori et al., 2016</xref>). Up to this stage, few new expressions occur and the transcriptome is dominated by the maternal deposit. As we were interested in studying early specification events in the embryo, we thus manually isolated individual cells from dissociated embryos and processed them for scRNA-Seq (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1a</xref>). Overall, we studied 840 cells from 38 embryos up to the 102-cell stage, collecting all or most cells of each embryo (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Table S1</xref>).</p>
<p>Analyzing the transcriptomes, we found that embryo-to-embryo variation could be efficiently normalized by standardizing each gene’s expression across all cells collected from the same embryo (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., mean of zero and standard deviation of one; see Methods). This is another benefit of the manual collection approach. A dimensional reduction map of the examined cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>) reveals the unfolding of development with cells from the early stages occupying the center while cells from later stages occupy the periphery. We found that cells followed developmental trajectories according to their founder cell origin, each identified by the expression of genes known to be expressed in a lineage-specific manner: <italic>ceh-51</italic> (MS), <italic>elt-7</italic> (E), <italic>pal-1</italic> (C,D and P), <italic>pes-1</italic> (D) and <italic>nos-2</italic> (P) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Broitman-Maduro et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hunter and Kenyon, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Maduro and Rothman, 2002</xref>). As also observed by other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Packer et al., 2019</xref>), the founder cell lineage trajectories are oriented according to cell fates, with similar cell fates converging between lineages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b,d</xref>): the cells of the ecto-mesoderm producing C lineage formed a bi-lobed cloud with the muscle part adjacent to that of the MS and D lineages. Similarly, MS cells that will form the pharynx orient towards the pharynx producing portion of the AB lineage.</p>
<p>In order to infer the precise identity of each cell, we first organized the embryos into eight developmental stages: the 1-, 2-, 4-, 8-, 15-, 28-, 51-, and 102-cell stages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). For each stage, we studied cells from multiple embryos and identified clusters of cells according to differential gene expression. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref> demonstrates this analysis for the 15-cell stage and <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1b</xref> for all other stages. The identified clusters contain cells from each of the individual embryos, thus confirming our underlying assumption that embryo to embryo gene expression variation is minimal relative to the coherence of the cell states within an embryo. Finally, we inferred the cell identity of each cluster with reference to known gene markers from the literature (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS2">Tables S2</xref>,3). <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref> illustrates our approach for the cells of the 28-cell stage (see <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref> for all other stages). New markers were required to distinguish some of the cell identities.</p>

</fig>
<p>Studying <italic>F19F10</italic>.<italic>1</italic> by single molecule FISH, we found that this previously uncharacterized ets-factor is expressed in the posterior daughter cell through 2 cell cycle divisions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). We further tested for the robustness of the cell identity assignments and ensured that each cell is most similar to its assigned identity (computed with itself excluded, <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>, bottom of each subfigure). We identified 5,433 genes as being differentially expressed within a stage, collectively across all of the stages (see Methods). Of these, 395 are TFs during this period of cell specification (Table S6).</p>
<p>For some cell identities within a stage we were not able to distinguish distinct transcriptomes, and we thus denoted these as composing ‘equivalence groups’. These may either be attributed to daughter cells whose transcriptomes have yet to diverge, such as cells Ca and Cp in the 15-cell state, or to sets of cousins whose sub-lineages form repeating units, such as cells ABplp and ABprp (also of the 15-cell stage) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Sulston et al., 1983</xref>). In the first case, this indicates that sister-cells are transcriptomically very similar shortly after division. Altogether we describe 119 cell identities with distinct transcriptome profiles, which by stage are as follows: 1 (1-cell), 2 (2-cell), 4 (4-cell), 6 (8-cell), 11 (15-cell), 20 (28-cell), 38 (51-cell), and 37 (102-cell), with 64 of these representing equivalence groups of at least two cell states (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>, Table S5, and <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>). For each cell state that we assigned, we have an average of seven replicate cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS4">Table S4</xref>). We validated our annotations by imaging GFP reporters and found good correspondence, as illustrated for <italic>ceh-43, dmd-4</italic> and <italic>unc-30</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref> and <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>). The delay between the GFP-expression and the mRNA detected here is expected as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Murray et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>We next asked if the genes that are members of the same gene family have similar spatial and temporal expression arrangements. To test for this mode of expression, we considered groups of genes with the same DNA binding domain, as annotated by the PFAM database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Finn et al., 2016</xref>). For each cell, we queried for enrichments or depletions of genes of specific domain families, among its expressed TFs. As an example, the ‘ABplppp’ cell differentially expresses 14 TFs according to our analysis, including seven homeobox domain (HDs) TFs, though overall HDs only account for 11% of the TFs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). We used the hypergeometric distribution to compute a significance of <italic>P</italic> = 0.00015 for this overlap, given the overall number of TFs and the number of HD and ‘ABplppp’ TFs. Conversely, only two of the 69 TFs expressed by the Eala cell are HDs, a significant depletion (<italic>P</italic>=0.01, Hypergeometric distribution). <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref> shows the overall pattern of enrichments and depletions of HDs across all of the examined cells, indicating enrichment of HDs in the 51-cell stage, in particular in the ABp lineage, and depletion in the E lineage. For the GATA type zinc factors we found enrichment in the E lineage, as well as some of the AB cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="527193v1_fig3.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>Examining the pattern of such biases, we found that TF families showed significant enrichments across lineages and developmental stages (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d-e</xref>). Four TF gene families are enriched in the AB lineage: the T-box domain, the helix-loop-helix (HLH) DNA-binding domain, the HD domain, and the high mobility group (HMG) box domain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). Each of these families also has enrichments for specific AB stages, from early expression (T-box and HLH) to later expression (HD and HMG).</p>
<p>From the <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> analysis we concluded that the homeodomain (HD) TF family in particular exhibited lineage-specific expression. Studying this in more detail, we observed that in the 28-cell stage, each of the 16 AB cells contains expression of at least one homeodomain gene, with 8 distinct cell state patterns (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). This is mostly also apparent in the 51- and 102-cell stages. The expression patterns of all homeodomain genes across the lineage are not mono-phyletic. For example, <italic>ceh-43</italic> is expressed in nine of the sixteen AB cells at the 28-cell stage in a complex pattern (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Thus, continuous symmetry breaking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Zacharias and Murray, 2016</xref>), does not appear to be a mechanism by which differential expression is generally established.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="527193v1_fig4.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>We asked if the relative spatial location of the cells within the embryo can provide insight into the observed homeodomain expression patterns. For this analysis, we mapped the binarized expression of genes onto the known three dimensional locations of cells in the embryo. Studying the 28-cell stage, we found that the homeodomain genes expressed in each lineage revealed dorsal-ventral stripes along the anterior-posterior axis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). For example, the <italic>ceh-43</italic>-expressing cells, deriving from distinct AB sub-lineages, are physically proximate. Clustering the AB lineage cells into eight groups according to their binarized expression, we mapped the gene expression combinations of each stripe. One stripe, for example, includes the expression of <italic>unc-30, ceh-36</italic>, and <italic>ceh-13</italic>; the adjacent stripe has expression of <italic>unc-30, ceh-36</italic>, and <italic>mec-3</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). At the 51-cell stage, 4 new homeodomain genes are expressed in the AB lineage, and again position along the anterior-posterior axis correlates with gene expression. In the 102-cell stage, expression becomes more complicated as the AB lineage forms an external shell around the gastrulating non-AB cells. Generalizing this approach, we also found distinct positional systems for the MS and C lineages (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b,c</xref>). For the MS lineage, <italic>ceh-32</italic> and ceh-51 are in the anterior and posterior, respectively, while for the C lineage <italic>vab-7</italic> (even-skipped) and <italic>hmbx-1</italic> are in the anterior and posterior, respectively. We thus provide evidence that distinct regionalization codes occur across the embryonic sub-lineages.</p>
<p>To compare the patterning code elucidated for <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryogenesis to the well-studied patterning pathway in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we also studied the expression of <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologous genes. <italic>Drosophila</italic> development proceeds through a series of molecular events which partition the syncytial embryo along the anterior-posterior axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Wolpert et al., 2019</xref>). We found that the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genes such as <italic>nos-1,2</italic> (<italic>nanog</italic>) and <italic>puf</italic> genes (<italic>pumilo</italic>) which are maternal genes in both systems – are restricted to the primary germ cell lineage in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Moreover, gap and pair-rule genes, such as <italic>pal-1</italic> (<italic>caudal</italic>) and <italic>cwn-1</italic> (<italic>wg</italic>), show C lineage and sub-lineage restriction, respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Thus, it is evident that while <italic>Drosophila</italic> patterning follows in a lineage-independent manner, in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, lineage-dependency is co-incident with specific expression of patterning genes across the founder-cell lineages (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Collectively, our analysis reveals that during embryogenesis, in between the early signaling period – involving <italic>Notch</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Priess, 2005</xref>) and <italic>Wnt</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Rocheleau et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Thorpe et al., 1997</xref>)– and the later cell-fate differentiation period – involving myogenic factors such as <italic>myoD/hlh-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chen et al., 1992</xref>) and <italic>GATA/elt-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Fukushige et al., 1998</xref>) – there is a period of lineage-specific patterning. Three of the homeodomain genes whose expression we have described – <italic>ceh-13, php-3</italic>, and <italic>nob-1</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) – are members of the HOX sub-family, known to provide regionalization during embryogenesis in bilaterians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Carroll et al., 2004</xref>). Indeed, we observed that expression of these HOX genes transcends the founder lineages and patterns the posterior region in multiple lineages (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). However, we find 51 other homeodomain genes that pattern the lineages and set up locations in the embryo. This is an increased genetic repertoire relative to <italic>Drosophila</italic> (97 to 104, respectively) despite the higher complexity of the latter in terms of cell-types and total number of cells. Thus, in species where regionalization is under lineage control, as opposed to morphogen gradients, there is a greater necessity for distinct positional systems across distinct sub-lineages – here the founder-cell lineages. We find lineage-specific gene expression stripes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), suggesting that such a developmental patterning mechanism may not be restricted to segmented organisms but is rather a fundamental feature of animal embryogenesis. The centrality of homeodomain genes to this system highlights the adaptability of this TF family to both lineage-dependent and position-dependent functions. It will be interesting to further compare other species at the single-cell level in order to trace the evolutionary origin of gene expression developmental patterning codes.</p>

<title>Cell isolations</title>
<p>Embryos were isolated from adult worms and removed from their egg shells as described in Edgar and Goldstein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Edgar and Goldstein, 2012</xref>). Individual embryos were manually dissociated by gentle pipetting through progressively smaller glass-bore pipettes in Calcium/Magnesium free EGM. Cell losses during dissociation were noted and single dissociated cells from an individual embryo were counted, collected as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hashimshony et al., 2012</xref>), and stored at -80C until further processing.</p>

<sec id="s4b">
<title>Single-cell RNA-Seq</title>
<p>Individual embryo, multiplexed single-cell RNA sequencing libraries were produced following the CEL-Seq2 protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hashimshony et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, individually harvested cells were barcoded with a reverse transcription reaction, and RNA molecules were tagged with unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Kivioja et al., 2011</xref>). All barcoded cells from a single embryo were then combined into a single IVT amplification reaction which was used to generate an Illumina library for sequencing. Multiple sequencing libraries with compatible Illumina sequencing indexes were sequenced together on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 using standard paired-end sequencing protocols. For Read 1, used to determine the barcode, the first 15 bp were sequenced and for Read 2, used to determine the identity of the transcript, the first 35 bp were sequenced. The CEL-Seq2 pipeline is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/yanailab/CEL-Seq-pipeline">https://github.com/yanailab/CEL-Seq-pipeline</ext-link>. Mapping of the reads used BWA33, version 0.6.1, against the C. elegans WBCel215 genome (bwa aln -n 0.04 -o 1 -e -1 -d 16 -i 5 -k 2 -M 3 -O 11 -E 4). Read counting used htseq-count version 0.5.3p1 defaults, against WS230 annotation exons.</p>

<sec id="s4c">
<title>Initial processing of the CEL-Seq2 data</title>
<p>Gene expression values were calculated as UMI-corrected reads normalized to the number of transcripts per 50,000; only cells with more than 10,000 mapped reads were included in the analysis. In order to compare gene expression patterns between embryos, gene expression was first standardized among the cells of an individual embryo (such that the mean expression for each gene across the cells of the embryo is 0 and the standard deviation is 1), and these standardized expression profiles were used for comparisons between embryos.</p>

<title>Cell clustering</title>
<p>t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008</xref>) was performed on full dataset using the top 1000 most variable genes (according to the fano factor), with 20 initial dimensions and perplexity set at 50. For reproducibility, a non-random initiation of the objective function was set (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/">https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Cell identity inference</title>
<p>For each of the eight examined stages – 1-cell, 2-cell, 4-cell, 8-cell, 15-cell, 28-cell, 51-cell, and 102-cell – the isolated cells were first clustered according to their position on a tSNE plot using genes of known expression patterns (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS2">Table S2</xref>). We next manually and iteratively accepted clusters based upon their homogenous embryo composition, by removing the accepted cluster and re-clustering the remaining cells. These clusterings were based upon the restricted set of genes with known cell identity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS2">Table S2</xref>). Cell state was then annotated to the clusters by comparing the average gene expression of the cluster with a collated database of known gene expression patterns (Table S3). The robustness of the clustering was tested by only retaining cells whose expression is most similar to the mean expression of each cluster, computed without it (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). The cell state transcriptome was then computed as the average expression of all members, together with standard deviation (Table S6).</p>

<title>FISH analysis</title>
<p>Custom Stellaris FISH probe sets were designed against the entire coding sequence of <italic>F19F10</italic>.<italic>1</italic> (25 non-overlapping probes labeled with CAL Fluor Orange 560 Dye) and pal-1 (25 non-overlapping probes labeled with C3-Fluorescein Dye), using the Stellaris FISH Probe Designer (Biosearch Technologies, Inc., Petaluma, CA: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biosearchtech.com/stellarisdesigner">www.biosearchtech.com/stellarisdesigner</ext-link>). Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed according to the protocol available on the Stellaris web-site (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biosearchtech.com/support/resources/stellaris-protocols">https://www.biosearchtech.com/support/resources/stellaris-protocols</ext-link>) for fixation of embryonic <italic>C. elegans</italic> material, with the following modification: all steps were performed in 1.5mL Eppendorf tubes. Hybridization of two non-overlapping probe sets was performed using 125 nM of each probe set contemporaneously. Within 48hrs from completing the hybridization protocol, embryos were mounted on glass slides under #0 coverglass (85-115 uM thickness), supported on each corner by small amounts of plasticine to avoid crushing the embryos. Slides were imaged immediately after mounting with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope.</p>

<title>Lineage tracing and single-cell fluorescence quantification</title>
<p>Embryo mounting and live imaging were performed as previously described45. Briefly, 2-4 cell stage embryos were mounted between two cover slips in M9 buffer containing 20 μm microspheres (Polyscience). Dual-color 3D time-lapse imaging was performed using a Spinning disc confocal microscopy. Images were acquired with 30 focal planes at 1 μm Z resolution for every 75 seconds during a six-hour duration of embryogenesis. Ubiquitously expressed mCherry was used for automated cell identification and lineage tracing using StarryNite program followed by systematic manual correction of errors(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Santella et al., 2014</xref>). Protein fusion GFP was used to quantify expression level of corresponding gene in each cell using a previous established method(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Murray et al., 2008</xref>). GFP intensity was measured by calculating the average GFP intensity for each cell and then with the local background intensity subtracted. GFP intensity at different time point for a same cell was averaged to quantify expression level of a gene in a cell.</p>

<title>Differential gene expression analysis</title>
<p>For each gene, at each stage, we identified differential gene expression using the following approach. We compared the standardized gene expression values across the cell states of the stage, and identified the two groups of cell states that correspond to the most significantly different groups, assayed by a t-test P-value. In order to establish the significance, we then asked if that P-value is better than that expected by shuffling the expression values across states. To find the two groupings with the best P-value, we began by computing a t-test between the expression values for each cell state and the rest of the expression levels of the remaining states. The cell state with the best P-value was used to seed a group and we next computed the P-value of a super-group composed of this cell state in turn with each other cell state, comparing with the expression values of the remaining cell states. If one of these super-groups had a better P-value than the original best P-value state alone, we selected it and continued this process, iteratively adding to the super-group until the P-value can no longer improve. This process results in a one cell state or a super-group of cell states with expression and a group without expression. Each gene will thus have a binary profile and an associated P-value. To select the genes with sufficiently significant P-values we repeated the procedure on 10,000 shuffled sample to cell state assignments. Sorting the P-values from the shufflings, the P-value at 1% of this list was used as the threshold, for a false discovery rate of 1%. We excluded differential expression of genes expressed in more than 50% of the cells of a given stage, and also restricted differential expression to those genes whose maximum expression is at least three quarters of a log<sub>10</sub> TPM unit greater than the minimum expression at the given stage.</p>

<title>Enrichments and depletions of TF families in cells</title>
<p>For each cell, we computed both the enrichment and depletion of the set of genes in a given TF family among its expressed TFs. The enrichment and depletion is computed as the cumulative hypergeometric P-value with and without subtracted from unity, respectively. The smallest number between these two tests distinguishes an enrichment from a depletion (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>), and we multiplied the –log10 P value by 1 and -1, to distinguish these in the plots shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b,c</xref>. To compute the significance of enrichments for particular lineages and stages, we used the T-test on the –log10 P-values of the enrichment values.</p>

<p>C. elegans is a pre-eminent model for developmental genetics, and its invariant lineage makes it possible in theory to define molecular features such as gene expression comprehensively and at single cell resolution across the organism.</p>
<p>Previously published single-cell RNA-seq studies have mapped gene expression across the lineage through the 16-cell stage (Tintori et al 2017, Hashimshony et al 2016), and at later stages (Packer et al 2019, with good coverage starting at the 100-cell stage and some coverage at the ~50-cell stage). This left the critical period around gastrulation (~28-cell and ~50-cell) without comprehensive transcriptome data. This study covers this gap with a heroic effort involving the manual isolation and analysis of over 800 cells from embryos of known stage, combined with painstaking curation using known markers from small scale studies and larger imaging-based expression atlases. Importantly, the dataset overlaps at early and late stages with data from prior studies.</p>
<p>The data quality and overlap with Tintori and Packer datasets both appear high, but to make this inference required additional analysis from Supplemental Table 6 by this reviewer as it is not explored or described in the manuscript. Analyses demonstrating continuity with these datasets would greatly increase the value of the resource.</p>
<p>The authors show that specific lineages and stages preferentially express TFs with different classes of DNA binding domains. This extends previous work implicating homeodomains as preferentially involved in nervous system patterning and as enriched in neural and muscle progenitors in mid-stage embryos.</p>
<p>They also show that C. elegans homologs of Drosophila early embryonic regulators (which function based on spatial position in that system) tend to also be patterned in early C. elegans embryos, but with lineage-specific patterns. This conserved use of regulators would be fairly remarkable given the dramatically different developmental modes in these two species, although this observation is not backed up by quantitative analyses.</p>
<p>Finally, there is an argument that combinations of TFs expressed in lineage-specific patterns give rise to &quot;stripe&quot; patterns. This section is also not based on statistical analyses but suggests the possibility that lineage and positional regulation may be more convoluted than was previously thought.</p>

<p>The C. elegans embryo has been model system of study for more than 30 years because of the ease of doing forward and reverse genetics, coupled with its nearly invariant lineage which allows a description of development at high resolution. 4D time lapse imaging coupled with spatially resolved gene expression has enabled identification of transcriptional signatures of cells in space and time, and in the past decade this has been advanced with single-cell transcriptomics methods, using individually isolated embryonic cells (which can retain their identity) or by deconvolving complex mixtures of early cells. Recent work using these methods has resolved spatiotemporal expression patterns for many genes, defining cells up to gastrulation stage, but then changing to more tissue-specific patterns during morphogenesis. A key paradigm of specification in C. elegans and other systems is that early maternal factors initiate or restrict patterns of transcription factor expression from the zygotic genome. Combinatorial expression patterns and some symmetries broken by autonomous or extrinsic cell inductions ultimately program lineages towards their fates. To date, only simple networks have been elucidated, as the increasing complexity of these networks and the high level of redundancy has made functional dissection of such pathways difficult. Hence, almost all of the work in recent years has been descriptive.</p>
<p>In this work the authors fill a knowledge gap from the early embryo (~16 cells) to the ~100-cell stage and describe new patterns of gene expression. They reconcile their findings with that of others who have defined expression patterns using other methods, such as scRNA-Seq from complex mixtures of cells, and from transcription factor expression analyses. The resulting description of embryonic develop is the most precise to date, and offers a potentially useful resource for other researchers.</p>
<p>
The authors attempt to use their results to find patterns of gene expression that could hint at phylogenetic conservation of specification mechanisms. They find some supporting evidence that expression of homeobox genes occurs in anterior-posterior stripes, which recalls the elaborate A/P patterning system elucidated in the Drosophila embryo, which belongs to the sister phylum Arthropoda in the Ecdysozoan clade of molting animals. It felt as if the authors chose the Hox genes they need to support this conclusion.</p>
<p>Some caveats exist to the work. The expression patterns seem to be well-validated, and following prior work from the Yanai group are likely to be strongly correlated with expression in living embryos. When cells are separated, they could lose some expression patterns that require cell-cell interactions, so it is expected that there might be a small minority of expression patterns that are more complex than what has been documented here.</p>
<p>A major caveat is the idea of the stripes of Hox expression. I just did not find these arguments to be compelling. Seeing these 'stripes' requires organizing the data in a way that maximizes their appearance, for one. Since there is not a lot of movement of cells away from their birth in the early embryo, the AB descendants are anterior to those of MS, anterior to those of E, anterior to those of C, D, and P4. Lineage-specific expression will just naturally fall into 'stripes'. Second, the conservation of Hox expression patterns typically comes with collinearity of the genes along the length of a chromosome (i.e. the so-called Hox clusters) with expression along the body axis, as well as posterior-to-anterior fate transformations when Hox specification is disrupted.</p>
<p>A minor note is the detection of an enrichment of GATA factors in the early E lineage. This has now been found to be a derived condition even within the genus (see Broitman-Maduro et al. Development 149 (21): dev200984, as other species like C. angaria show only a simpler network of elt-3 -&gt; elt-2. This suggests that many of the other patterns of gene expression, particularly in the early embryo, could be highly derived as well; some caution is warranted in generalizing the results as being conserved with arthropods as some of this could be convergent.</p>
<p>Given what the authors are proposing about Hox stripes, some omissions of prior work were surprising (or maybe I missed them). For example, a comprehensive study of Hox genes in C. elegans by Hench et al. (2015) (PLoS One 10(5): e0126947) evaluated all the homeobox genes and examined their genomic locations and expression patterns in the embryo at high spatiotemporal resolution. Work from the Hobert lab (Nature 2020, 584(7822):595-601) showed how homeobox codes specify classes of C. elegans neurons, and the Murray lab (PLoS Genet. 18(5):e1010187) examined Hox control of posterior lineage specification at high resolution, with functional assays.</p>
<p>The Discussion section of the paper is brief, consistent with the descriptive nature of the work overall, but it would have been nice to see the findings related to other published studies as indicated above.</p>

<p>The authors claim that this dataset covers a timepoint of embryogenesis that is not well covered in the other published single cell datasets (Tintori et al 2016 and Packer et al 2019). The Tintori data indeed do not cover the 28-102-cell stages sufficiently, but it is unclear how the data presented here compare to the Packer et al data. It is true that the Packer et al data have fewer cells at earlier timepoints than at later ones, but given that they sequenced tens of thousands of cells, they report that they still have ~10,000 cells &lt;210 min of embryogenesis. If the authors want to make any claims about how their data enables exploration of a stage that was previously not accessible, this would require a better comparison to the available data.</p>
<p>The authors provide thorough support for how they assigned cell identities in their data. It is surprising though that at the 102-cell stage they only identify 37 unique cell identities. They suggest that this is because there are many equivalence groups at this stage. However, I would strongly encourage the authors to perform a similar analysis or otherwise compare their obtained identities with the data from Packer et al. 2019. It seems possible that given the low number of cells in this dataset, the authors are missing certain identities and it would be important to know this.</p>
<p>The main analysis the authors perform is to look at expression patterns of various classes of TFs and ask whether they are enriched in particular lineages or at specific timepoints. This analysis is interesting but would be more informative if the authors provided in Figure 3d the numbers of each class of TFs. The authors then focus on the homeodomain class of TFs as they display interesting lineage-specific expression patterns, which when mapped on the embryo form stripes. The stripe pattern however is not that obvious, at least not as shown in Figure 4b (for example all three darker shades of blue looks indistinguishable). Perhaps separate embryo schematics showing the different TF expression patterns would show this more clearly. Moreover, given the relatively small number of cell identities found in this dataset (particularly at the 102-cell stage), a similar analysis using the Packer data would provide further support to these patterns. The localization of cells with shared expression patterns does show a stripe pattern at the 28-cell stage, but also not so clearly beyond this timepoint.</p>
<p>I am also unsure about the validity/value of the comparison of the stripes to Drosophila and the centrality of homeodomain TFs to anterior-posterior positional identity. First, it would be important to map other TFs, very likely there are several other TFs that correlate with positional identity. Also, even if the expression of the homeodomain TFs in C. elegans form stripes, there are still several cells within that stripe that do not express these TFs, it is thus unclear whether these TFs encode positional information or the identity of cells with different positions in the embryo.</p>

<p>This is an admirable piece of work. The authors build on a previous dataset they assembled, but expand it to include all stages of early development in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Cell collection was done manually, which is very impressive, and is clearly far better than pooled unidentified cells. I will not comment on the specific sequencing and analysis, since this is not my expertise, but will comment on the general conclusions and comparative framework in which the authors place their results.</p>
<p>While the Introduction and Discussion sections are actually fairly short, much of the presentation of the results is based on a certain comparative framework, which is explicitly a comparison between C. elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. This is an important perspective, but I feel the authors' interpretation is in some places exaggerated and in other places almost trivial.</p>
<p>Drosophila and C. elegans are two of the main models for developmental biology. However, it has been clear for over two decades that both species are highly derived and specialized and therefore, treating them as representative for their taxa is problematic. Much of the authors' discussion hinges on the question of comparing syncytial and lineage-dependent development. The syncytial early development of Drosophila is very specific and is clearly a recent innovation within a restricted group of flies. The canonical Drosophila segmentation cascade is mostly a novelty and most elements within the cascade are recent (the authors are invited to browse my 2020 review in Curr. Top. Dev. Biol.) Specifically, the expression of gap genes in regional stripes is not found very broadly. Conversely, the polarizing role of Caudal is very ancient and is probably found in all Bilateria. When making comparisons with a distantly related species, it is important to keep this in mind. Not as much is known about development of other nematodes, but the little that is known indicates that C. elegans is also unusual, and specifically, the eutelic development (conserved cell lineages in development) is not found in all nematodes.</p>
<p>The authors suggest that regional expression of transcription factors in stripes is a conserved characteristic of development. This is true for Hox genes and has been known for decades. The regional expression they show for other genes is not convincing as &quot;stripes&quot;. It is no surprise that developmental transcription factors are regionalized, but linking this to the stripes of Drosophila gap genes and even more so to Drosophila pair-rule and segment-polarity genes is a bit far-fetched. Yes, many genes are expressed in restricted domains along the A-P axis, but that is all that can be said based on the data. Calling them &quot;Drosophila-like&quot; is unfounded.</p>
<p>Beyond these broad homology statements, the rest of the presentation is fine and I have no major comments.</p>
