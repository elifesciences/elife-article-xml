<title>Summary</title><p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) often results in persistent learning and memory deficits, likely due to disrupted hippocampal circuitry underlying these processes. Precise temporal control of hippocampal neuronal activity is important for memory encoding and retrieval and is supported by oscillations that dynamically organize single unit firing. Using high-density laminar electrophysiology, we discovered a loss of oscillatory power across CA1 lamina, with a profound, layer-specific reduction in theta-gamma phase amplitude coupling in injured rats. Interneurons from injured animals were less strongly entrained to theta and gamma oscillations, suggesting a mechanism for the loss of coupling, while pyramidal cells were entrained to a later phase of theta. During quiet immobility, we report decreased ripple amplitudes from injured animals during sharp-wave ripple events. These results reveal deficits in information encoding and retrieval schemes essential to cognition that likely underlie TBI-associated learning and memory impairments, and elucidate potential targets for future neuromodulation therapies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cognitive deficits, including learning and memory impairments, are one of the most common consequences of TBI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. These deficits occur when complex, heterogeneous TBI pathologies affect circuits that support these processes. Local circuits within the hippocampus are especially important for learning and memory, as are interactions between the hippocampus and connected brain regions. Because these networks are dispersed, it is not surprising that TBI-associated learning and memory deficits have been reported both in the presence and absence of hippocampal pathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Neuronal pathology in hippocampal afferents such as the medial septum and para-hippocampal cortical regions can affect hippocampal processing supporting cognition, as can axonal damage along connecting pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Additionally, other coalescing pathological changes such as neurotransmitter dysregulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, blood brain barrier breakdown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, and metabolic dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, as well as changes in intrinsic neuronal and circuit excitability and synaptic plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> are all thought to contribute to hippocampal dysfunction following TBI. However, it is unclear how these pathological changes collectively affect information processing in the intact hippocampus. Studying this process in awake subjects is important since network level physiological processes in the hippocampus have been shown to support learning and memory functions, and these electrophysiological processes can be predictive of animal behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Despite our understanding that hippocampal neuronal activity underlies many aspects of learning and memory, surprisingly few studies have investigated how TBI affects these processes in awake animals. Prior studies have reported a loss of oscillatory power in CA1 or broad changes in the firing properties of pyramidal cells post injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. However, no studies have examined how TBI affects the timing of single unit activity in relation to local oscillations, a process called spike-field coherence or entrainment. This process is important as hippocampal oscillations dynamically organize the firing of populations of neurons into cell ensembles, and the precise temporal control of cell ensemble firing is important for plasticity mechanisms underlying learning and memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Hippocampal oscillations coordinate ensembles in a complex manner, nesting high frequency gamma oscillations within a dominant lower frequency theta oscillation during active exploration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Theta oscillations are important for synchronizing neuronal activity both within and across brain structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>, while gamma oscillations are thought to reflect local processing within a brain region and are supported by local interneurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Importantly the amplitude of gamma oscillations changes as a function of theta phase, a process known as theta-gamma phase amplitude coupling (PAC), which provides a mechanism whereby local processing across distributed networks can be temporally coordinated on a theta timescale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. Appropriate PAC and single unit entrainment to hippocampal oscillations are thought to be essential for cognition and have been directly linked to memory performance in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Additionally, higher frequency sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) are known to support working memory processes and memory consolidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>, however, the effects of TBI on these processes have not been investigated.</p>
<p>We therefore utilized high-density laminar electrodes to characterize layer-specific pathophysiological changes to hippocampal oscillations and single unit activity from freely moving rats following the well-characterized lateral fluid percussion injury (<sub>L</sub>FPI) model of TBI. We found that injured rats had decreased oscillatory power, PAC, and ripple amplitudes in CA1 compared to controls. Additionally, we report changes in single unit entrainment to theta and gamma oscillations post-injury. These results reveal TBI-associated coding disruptions to processes that are fundamental to cognitive processing in the hippocampus. These disruptions likely underlie learning and memory deficits following TBI and can provide physiological targets for future neuromodulation therapies.</p>

<title><sub>L</sub>FPI decreases theta and gamma power across CA1 lamina</title>
<p>Hippocampal recordings were obtained from freely moving rats to characterize differences in CA1 physiology in freely moving sham (n=4) and injured (n=5) animals. Rats were subjected to <sub>L</sub>FPI (1.68-1.78 atm) or sham surgery then chronically implanted with multi-shank, high-density laminar electrodes in the CA1 region of the hippocampus ipsilateral to the injury/sham site. Recordings were obtained on three separate days within 6-11 days post-injury. On the first day of recording rats freely explored a familiar environment, followed by a novel environment. On the subsequent two recording days, electrodes were slowly advanced, then recordings were obtained in the familiar environment. The use of laminar electrodes allowed us to localize electrode contacts across different CA1 lamina specifically <italic>stratum oriens</italic>, <italic>pyramidale</italic> (<italic>st. pyr</italic>), and <italic>radiatum</italic> (<italic>st. rad</italic>). To maximize single unit yields, most electrodes were localized to <italic>st. oriens</italic> and <italic>st.</italic> pyr on the first day thus driving on subsequent days allowed us to reach <italic>st. rad</italic>.</p>
<p>For each recording, electrodes from individual shanks were independently assessed to determine if they were localized to <italic>st. pyr</italic> or <italic>st. rad</italic>. The <italic>st. pyr</italic> channel was defined as the channel with maximum power in the ripple frequency range (100-250 Hz; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). As expected, individual pyramidal cells were localized around this channel (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> shows the mean SWR waveform and associated current source density (CSD) recorded from this shank. The <italic>st. rad</italic> channel was defined as the local maximum of the CSD sink (not present in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref> but visible in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>). Due to the curvature of the hippocampus and position of our electrode array, each shank sampled a slightly different depth of the CA1 lamina, but recordings could be localized based on physiological properties such as ripple frequency power, SWR CSD, and single unit locations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>).</p>

<p>After determining electrode positions, we sought to compare hippocampal oscillatory power between sham and injured rats. Theta and gamma oscillations have been well-characterized in the rat hippocampus and can be readily observed while rats are actively moving and exploring the environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Importantly, these oscillations change in power and phase along the CA1 lamina (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>), thus it is essential to localize electrodes to specific layers before comparing across animals or groups. To compare oscillatory power between sham and injured rats, power spectra were computed from channels localized to <italic>st. pyr</italic> or <italic>st. rad</italic> while rats were actively moving (&gt;10 cm/sec). Power spectra were extracted in the familiar environment, averaged across shanks and recording days to obtain a mean for each animal, then averaged across sham and TBI conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>). In <italic>st. pyr</italic>, injured rats had decreased power from 3.5-85.1 Hz, and in <italic>st. rad</italic>, they had decreased power from 7.1-12.7 Hz, 13.7-19.7 Hz, 30.1-33.8 Hz, and 35.1-86.8 Hz (t-test; p&lt;0.01 for multiple comparisons).</p>
<p>Data were then separated into well-described, physiologically relevant theta (5-10 Hz) and low-gamma (30-59 Hz) bands and power in these bands was compared across sham and TBI rats in both <italic>st. pyr</italic> and <italic>st. rad</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G</xref>). In <italic>st. pyr</italic> of TBI rats, both theta and low-gamma power were significantly decreased compared to shams (sham theta=-7.65±0.09 log<sub>10</sub>V<sup>2</sup>, injured theta=-8.38±0.10 log<sub>10</sub>V<sup>2</sup>, p=0.001; sham gamma=-7.64±0.05 log<sub>10</sub>V<sup>2</sup>, injured gamma=-7.90±0.04 log<sub>10</sub>V<sup>2</sup>, p=0.009; mean±SEM; t-test). In <italic>st. rad</italic>, both theta and low-gamma power were also significantly decreased in TBI rats compared to shams (sham theta=-7.15±0.04 log<sub>10</sub>V<sup>2</sup>, injured theta=-7.51±0.07 log<sub>10</sub>V<sup>2</sup>, p=0.001; sham gamma=-7.20±0.05 log<sub>10</sub>V<sup>2</sup>, injured gamma=-7.42±0.07 log<sub>10</sub>V<sup>2</sup>, p=0.022; mean±SEM; t-test). Overall, injured rats have decreased oscillatory power spanning a range of frequencies that includes theta and gamma, and this loss of power is more pronounced in <italic>st. pyr</italic> than in <italic>st. rad</italic>.</p>

<title><sub>L</sub>FPI decreases theta-gamma PAC in st. pyr but not st. rad</title>
<p>Theta-gamma PAC (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>) is a well-characterized phenomenon important for the selection and coordination of cell ensembles that support spatial coding and memory processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. To assess the effects of TBI on theta-gamma PAC, we computed the modulation index<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup> across discrete frequency bands during epochs in which the rat was moving (&gt;10cm/sec) in the familiar environment, then constructed PAC heatmaps for channels localized to <italic>st. pyr</italic> and <italic>st rad</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). Sham rats showed strong theta-gamma PAC in the pyramidal cell layer which was drastically reduced in injured rats. This reduction was specific to <italic>st. pyr</italic>, as the strength of PAC in <italic>st. rad</italic> was similar between sham and injured rats, though there was a slight shift in coupling to a lower frequency phase and amplitude. Both the loss of PAC strength in <italic>st. pyr</italic> and the frequency shift in <italic>st. rad</italic> can be visualized by subtracting PAC heatmaps of injured animals from sham animals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>).</p>

<p>To quantify differences in theta-gamma PAC between sham and injured rats, we extracted the phase and amplitude from broadband theta (5-10 Hz) and low-gamma (30-59 Hz) filtered signals respectively and compared the magnitude and phase preference of PAC.

<title><sub>L</sub>FPI minimally affects single unit firing rates but increases recruitment of pyramidal cells</title>
<p>To compare neuronal firing properties between sham and injured animals we isolated single units (see methods) then clustered them into one of 3 categories: putative pyramidal cells, putative interneurons, and unclassified (putative identifiers henceforth removed for writing clarity). Cells within ±80 µm of the defined <italic>st. pyr</italic> channel were manually clustered based on each unit’s spike width, firing rate, and 1<sup>st</sup> moment of the autocorrelogram (a measure of burstiness) as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A,B</xref>). Pyramidal cells typically have larger spike widths, lower firing rates and are more bursty (lower 1<sup>st</sup> moment of the autocorrelogram) compared to interneurons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A,B</xref>). Importantly, there was a 95.47% overlap between manual clustering and automated k-means consensus clustering of cells within ±80 µm of the defined <italic>st. pyr</italic> channel when unclassified cells were excluded from the comparison (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Sup Fig 1</xref>). We chose to use manual clustering because the inclusion of the unclassified group allowed for a more conservative classification, and manual clustering is more robust to outliers than automated clustering (see <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Sup Fig 1</xref>). Cells located &gt;80 µm above the defined <italic>st. pyr</italic> channel were classified as interneurons as anatomically these cells would be located in <italic>st. oriens</italic>. When the location of each shank was centered to the defined <italic>st. pyr</italic> channel, cells are visibly distributed into the distinct <italic>st. oriens</italic> and <italic>st. pyr</italic> cell layers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). Importantly, cells classified as interneurons based on their anatomical location had firing properties that clustered with other interneurons further supporting their classification (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Sup Fig 2</xref>).</p>

<title><sub>L</sub>FPI disrupts spike field coherence and impairs single unit entrainment to theta oscillations</title>
<p>To assess potential mechanisms for the loss of oscillatory power and PAC in injured rats, we investigated whether there were changes in single unit entrainment to local oscillations. Many CA1 neurons are entrained to local oscillations and are more likely to fire around a specific phase of the oscillation (example of an interneuron entrained to theta shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). Proper entrainment of cells is essential for temporal coding supporting learning and memory functions of the hippocampus. We first assessed entrainment strength by calculating the mean vector length (MVL) of spike times across a range of discrete frequency bands in <italic>st. pyr</italic> for interneurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>) and pyramidal cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>) while the rat was either still (&lt;10 cm/sec) or moving (&gt;10 cm/sec).

<p>To investigate single unit entrainment to physiologically relevant hippocampal oscillations, we calculated the percentage of cells that were significantly entrained to broadband filtered theta (5-10 Hz) and gamma (30-59 Hz) oscillations in <italic>st. pyr</italic> using circular shuffling (see methods). There was no difference in the percentage of interneurons significantly entrained to theta between sham and injured rats when animals were still (sham=97.44%, injured=91.53%, p=0.315, Fisher’s exact test) or moving (sham=97.44%, injured=91.53%, p=0.315, Fisher’s exact test), but a lower percentage of interneurons were entrained to gamma in injured rats compared to shams both while animals were still (sham=89.74%, injured=67.80%, p=0.006, Fisher’s exact test) and moving (sham=89.74%, injured=65.54%, p=0.002, Fisher’s exact test; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). For pyramidal cells, there was no difference in the percentage of cells significantly entrained to theta while rats were still (sham=71.57%, injured=67.17%, p=0.454, Fisher’s exact test) or moving (sham=58.82%, injured=65.28%, p=0.277, Fisher’s exact test); however, a larger percentage of pyramidal cells were significantly entrained to gamma in injured rats compared to shams while animals were still (sham=25.49%, injured=37.74%, p=0.028, Fisher’s exact test), but not while they were moving (sham=29.41%, injured=30.19%, p&gt;0.999, Fisher’s exact test; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>).</p>
<p>Because a similar percentage of interneurons were significantly entrained to theta across sham and injured animals, we next investigated the apparent reduction in entrainment strength of interneurons in the theta frequency band seen in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>. To quantify this, we extracted only cells that were significantly entrained to theta and compared their entrainment strength and phase preference across all conditions. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> shows entrainment strength cumulative distributions for interneurons significantly entrained to theta.

<p>Overall, the percentage of interneurons significantly entrained to theta was similar across sham and injured animals, but the entrainment strength of significantly entrained interneurons was decreased in injured rats. Additionally, a lower percentage of interneurons were significantly entrained to gamma in injured animals compared to shams. For pyramidal cells, the percentage of cells significantly entrained to theta was similar between sham and injured animals as was the entrainment strength of significantly entrained pyramidal cells. However, pyramidal cells were entrained to a later phase of theta in injured rats. In both interneurons and pyramidal cells, theta entrainment strength drastically increased when rats began moving in injured but not sham animals. Together, these results reveal disruptions to temporal coding in the hippocampus presumed to underlie information encoding and retrieval.</p>

In one animal the temporoparietal hemorrhage extended into the lateral aspect of the ipsilateral hippocampus. APP immunoreactive axonal pathology was also observed consistently post-injury. Injured axons displayed abnormal morphologies including varicose swellings and axon bulbs indicative of transport interruption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup> (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Sup Fig 3C,D</xref>). Consistent with prior descriptions of the model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, axonal pathology was observed in a multifocal distribution post-injury including within the perilesional cortex, corpus callosum, thalamus, angular bundle (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Sup Fig 3C</xref>), and fimbria-fornix (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Sup Fig 3D</xref>). Notably, the fimbria-fornix and angular bundle serve as two major input/output pathways connecting the hippocampus to other structures. Degenerating cells, identified via Fluoro-Jade C staining were observed within the peri-lesional cortex and thalamus (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Sup Fig 3F</xref>). While cell degeneration was also identified in the dentate granule cell layer in both animals, no cell degeneration was observed in CA1 (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Sup Fig 3G</xref>) or hilus of the hippocampus, or entorhinal cortex. In one injured animal, minimal neuronal cell death was observed in CA2-3. No axonal pathology, cell death or hemorrhage was observed in the sham animal in any region examined (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Sup Fig 3E,H</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Learning and memory deficits are common following TBI, however it remains poorly understood how TBI-associated pathological changes disrupt information processing in brain regions important for these cognitive processes. Therefore, we utilized high-density electrophysiology to record from the hippocampus in freely moving animals following a well-characterized rat model of TBI. We took advantage of laminar probes to characterize layer-specific pathophysiology across CA1 lamina following TBI and found a loss of theta and gamma power across <italic>st. pyr</italic> and <italic>st. rad</italic> in injured animals, along with a drastic reduction in PAC that was specific to <italic>st. pyr</italic>. Interneurons from TBI rats were less entrained to theta and gamma, providing a potential mechanism for the loss of oscillatory power and coupling. Pyramidal cells from injured animals were more strongly recruited to fire across different environments and were entrained to a later phase of theta. Additionally, sharp wave ripples (SW-Rs) in injured rats had decreased amplitudes compared to shams, suggesting a desynchronization of the CA1 network even in the non-theta state. Taken together, these results reveal disruptions to electrophysiological processes essential for learning and memory, potentially providing a mechanism through which TBI-associated pathological changes collectively disrupt cognition.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Layer Specific Changes</title>
<p>A loss of hippocampal oscillatory power in awake animals following TBI has previously been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, however, these studies used either monopolar electrodes or twisted wires which are difficult to localize to specific lamina. Localization of electrodes within lamina is important when examining oscillations, as power varies greatly across layers. The use of high-density laminar probes in this study allowed us to precisely localize electrodes to both <italic>st. pyr</italic> and <italic>st. rad</italic> in CA1 revealing a loss of oscillatory power in injured animals from both layers that was more pronounced in <italic>st. pyr</italic>, and a dramatic reduction in PAC in injured rats that was specific to <italic>st. pyr</italic>. The more pronounced loss of power and PAC from <italic>st. pyr</italic> suggests TBI-associated disruptions to cells and circuits specifically targeting this layer.</p>
<p>One cell type implicated in these disruptions are parvalbumin positive (PV<sup>+</sup>) basket cells, which provide strong peri-somatic inhibition to CA1 pyramidal cells that can tightly control the timing of pyramidal cell firing through shunting inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup>. PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons as a class are entrained to theta and gamma oscillations and can entrain pyramidal cells to these oscillations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>. Here we found that interneurons from injured animals were less entrained to theta and gamma oscillations, and pyramidal cells from TBI rats were entrained to a different angle of theta. These combined results support a model in which TBI reduces the entrainment strength of basket cells, which then results in a change in the angle of entrainment of pyramidal cells. Because basket cells target the soma of pyramidal cells, this model would predict a loss of theta and gamma power and PAC in <italic>st. pyr</italic> matching our observed results. Additionally, PV<sup>+</sup> basket cells are strongly recruited to fire during SWRs and support ripple generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup>, thus the decrease in ripple power during SWR events may also suggest PV<sup>+</sup> basket cell dysfunction. While hippocampal PV<sup>+</sup> interneuron loss and dysfunction has previously been reported in a variety of injury models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref></sup>, it is likely that TBI also disrupts other interneuron populations which could contribute to the observed deficits especially the loss of oscillatory power in <italic>st. rad</italic>. Future studies recording from specifically identified interneuron classes would be needed to address whether TBI preferentially disrupts distinct interneuron subpopulations.</p>

<sec id="s3b">
<title>Loss of Afferent Input</title>
<p>Disruptions to afferent input from CA3 and EC to CA1 can also contribute to electrophysiological deficits observed following TBI. CA3 pyramidal neurons are prone to excitotoxicity and are susceptible to cell loss in the <sub>L</sub>FPI model, and human cases of TBI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref></sup>. Additionally, axonal injury has been demonstrated in pathways connecting CA3 and EC to CA1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref></sup>. Axonal injury is known to cause action potential conduction delays and may therefore lead to desynchronization of CA1 afferent input<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref></sup>. This deafferentation of CA1 may also contribute to circuit hyperexcitability in TBI which been reported in both DG and CA1 in brain slices across different TBI models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Compensatory mechanisms following TBI and/or deafferentation can alter the intrinsic properties of cells in CA1 and also disrupt long term potentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Additionally, TBI has been shown to disrupt hyperpolarization-activated cation nonselective (HCN) channels responsible for <italic>I</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref></sup> which can affect cell excitability and could disrupt theta generation especially in the apical dendrites where these channels are expressed in large numbers. TBI-associated changes in oscillatory power, PAC, and entrainment may also arise from desynchronization between the hippocampus and medial septum and diagonal band of Broca (MSDB).</p>
<p>Reciprocal connections between MSDB and hippocampus lie within the fimbria and fornix where axonal pathology is reliably seen in the <sub>L</sub>FPI model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref></sup>. Importantly, the extent of fimbria/fornix disruption has been correlated with poor learning and memory performance in human TBI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. In rodents, MSDB is especially important for theta generation and sets the pace of theta through theta frequency firing of MSDB interneurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">104</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">106</xref></sup>. Using the <sub>L</sub>FPI model, we previously demonstrated hippocampal-MSDB desynchronization in injured rats under isoflurane anesthesia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Here, in awake rats, we show that CA1 interneurons are less entrained to theta in injured animals. This further supports hippocampal-MSDB desynchronization as the entrainment of CA1 interneurons can be controlled by MSDB projecting interneurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">107</xref></sup>. MSDB glutamatergic and cholinergic inputs are also affected by fimbria/fornix pathology which may further contribute to theta dysfunction in TBI. MSDB acetylcholine neurons have been demonstrated to be susceptible to injury resulting in cholinergic dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">108</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">109</xref></sup>. This can disrupt type II theta which occurs when animals are not actively moving and exploring the environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">110</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">112</xref></sup>. We found that single unit entrainment to theta was substantially decreased in injured rats when they were not moving, a phenomenon not seen in shams, which suggests a disruption in type II theta. This provides further evidence that cholinergic signaling may be dysfunctional following TBI.</p>

<title>Implications of Temporal Coding Deficits</title>
<p>Oscillations provide the temporal framework to coordinate the firing of distinct cell ensembles within and across brain regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">113</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">115</xref></sup>. Theta oscillations arise from complex interactions between distributed circuits which can temporally link distant brain regions in time, while gamma oscillations reflect local processing important for selecting behaviorally relevant cell ensembles locally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">113</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">115</xref></sup>. Thus theta-gamma PAC represents a mechanism whereby local processing in many distributed networks can be temporally coordinated on a theta timescale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">116</xref></sup>. Importantly, LTP and LTD may preferentially occur at specific phases of the theta oscillation creating temporal windows for plasticity and potentially supporting spike-timing dependent plasticity across long distances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. In CA1, theta oscillations can provide temporal windows in which CA3 and EC input is integrated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">117</xref></sup>. Additionally, coordinated CA3 and EC inputs recruit subsets of CA1 interneurons that drive layer-specific gamma oscillations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">116</xref></sup>. CA3 driven low gamma (gamma<sub>L</sub>; 30-59 Hz) and EC driven mid gamma (gamma<sub>M</sub>; 60-80Hz) are respectively coupled to the descending phase (∼90°) and trough (∼180°) of theta measured in <italic>st. pyr</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">116</xref></sup>. This provides temporal separation of CA3 and EC inputs, which is hypothesized to prevent interference of previously stored associations in the CA3 recurrent network with the formation of new associations driven by EC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Our findings of reduced theta-gamma PAC in TBI rats and a shift in the peak of gamma<sub>L</sub> amplitude to a later phase of theta suggests that memory encoding and retrieval may not be sufficiently temporally separated in TBI rats. Further supporting this, we found that a larger percentage of pyramidal cells in injured animals fired across 2 distinct environments, one familiar and one novel. One proposed mechanism of gamma is to select only relevant cell ensembles while inhibiting activity from other ensembles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">113</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">115</xref></sup>. The loss of gamma power and theta-gamma PAC along with the over recruitment of pyramidal cells across environments suggests that this mechanism is dysfunctional in TBI, which could lead to interference between the encoding and retrieval of memories and disrupt memory updating.</p>
<p>Since information in the hippocampus is thought to be chunked on a theta timescale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">116</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">120</xref></sup>, findings from this study would predict a disruption in theta phase precession and the formation of theta sequences, processes that require precise temporal integration of afferent inputs with local circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">118</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">122</xref></sup>. While we did not assess this due to limited occupancy of the largely open environments during recording, previous studies have reported TBI-associated disruptions in place cell specificity and stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Future studies tying dysfunctional place fields to deficits in phase precession and theta sequences during a spatial navigation task could directly link impaired integration of afferent input to disrupted behavior following TBI. In the non-theta state, SWRs are frequently observed during which cell ensembles are activated in the same or reverse temporal order they fired during behavior but on a compressed timescale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. This replay of activity is important for memory consolidation, recall, and updating processes as well as planning behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Here we showed that ripples had decreased amplitudes in TBI animals, which may affect all of the above processes. Since we were unable to assess replay in this dataset, future studies are needed to address whether the replay of behaviorally relevant cells ensembles is affected by TBI.</p>

<title>Future Therapies</title>
<p>Neuromodulation therapies, including theta stimulation of the MSDB, fornix, or hippocampus, have been shown to improve learning and memory deficits in the <sub>L</sub>FPI model of TBI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">123</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c126">126</xref></sup>. While the physiological mechanisms underlying behavioral improvements have not been investigated, results from this study provide outcome measures to target and examine with future therapies. For example, stimulation paradigms that successfully re-entrain cells to theta or boost oscillatory power and theta-gamma PAC may be more successful at restoring TBI-associated cognitive deficits. There is a large parameter space to explore when performing brain stimulation, so having electrophysiological targets may allow for faster optimization of stimulation parameters. Transplantation of stem cells or interneurons have also been shown to restore cognitive deficits in preclinical models of TBI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c127">127</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c128">128</xref></sup>. Understanding how these transplanted cells functionally integrate into the network may help to unveil how pathophysiology correlates to behavior, especially if transplanted interneurons become entrained to local theta and gamma oscillations or if transplantation alters oscillatory power and coupling.</p>
<p>Overall, TBI pathologies can vary across patients and have a wide range of effects on the brain. Fixing a single TBI-associated pathological change is unlikely to improve cognitive outcomes, thus it is important to study how coalescing TBI pathological changes disrupt neural circuit activity underlying cognition in order to develop better targets and treatments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">129</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c131">131</xref></sup>. While some of the TBI pathophysiology we report here may be model and timepoint specific, similar electrophysiological deficits have been reported in Alzheimer’s disease, aging, epilepsy, and schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c132">132</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c140">140</xref></sup>, all of which can be associated with impaired cognition. Thus, temporal coding disruptions described in this study may be a good readout of hippocampal circuit function and could be predictive of cognitive dysfunction. As we learn more about how coding in the human hippocampus supports learning and memory, and how TBI disrupts these processes, we may be able to optimize deep brain stimulation treatments for TBI patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c141">141</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c144">144</xref></sup> and potentially incorporate non-invasive tools such as transcranial magnetic stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c145">145</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c147">147</xref></sup>, transcranial alternating current stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c148">148</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c149">149</xref></sup>, and focused ultrasound<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c150">150</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c151">151</xref></sup> to address cognitive impairments of TBI.</p>

<title><sub>L</sub>FPI Surgery</title>
<p>Lateral fluid percussion injury (<sub>L</sub>FPI) surgeries were performed as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Briefly, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and affixed to a stereotaxic holder. A midline incision was made on the head to visualize the skull, then a 5mm craniectomy was made over the left parietal cortex centered between lambda and bregma in the anterior/posterior direction and between midline and the lateral edge of the skull in the medial/lateral direction. A needle hub (cut from the needle) was affixed to the craniectomy site and secured with glue and dental cement. Rats were then removed from anesthesia, monitored for increased respiration and a response to toe pinch, then immediately attached to the FPI device. To induce injury, a pendulum was dropped to strike a tube filled with sterile saline delivering a fluid pulse to the intact dura within the craniectomy. A transducer was used to measure the force of the pressure wave. The needle hub was then removed and Kwik-Sil was place over the site of the craniectomy. The incision was then sutured up and rats were placed under a warming lamp and administered buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kc s.c.) after demonstrating a righting reflex. Sham rats underwent the same surgical procedure as injured rats, including the craniectomy, but no fluid pulse was delivered. Animals were excluded from further study if a dural breach was present or if the craniectomy was not properly centered between lambda/bregma and midline/lateral edge. Four rats (3 injured and 1 sham) were excluded from the MWM based on these criteria.</p>

<title>Electrode Implantation Surgery</title>
<p>Rats underwent electrode implantation surgery 3-4 days after <sub>L</sub>FPI/sham surgery. During this procedure, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and affixed to a stereotaxic holder. Sutures from the FPI procedure were removed, the midline incision was re-opened to expose the skull surface, and the Kwik-Sil cover over the <sub>L</sub>FPI craniectomy was removed. A stainless-steel screw was placed on the surface of the dura over the cerebellum and was used as ground. A small tungsten wire (∼10 kohms) was placed in the lateral ventricle (0.7 mm posterior to bregma, 2.8 mm lateral (assuming angle), 3.8 mm DV, at a 10° angle lateral to medial) and was used as a reference. A durotomy was then performed over the <sub>L</sub>FPI craniectomy and electrodes mounted to drives (nano-Drive; Cambridge NeuroTech; Cambridge, United Kingdom) were slowly advanced into cortex (AP: −4.2 mm, ML: 2.8 mm, DV: ∼1.3 mm). Dura-Gel (Cambridge NeuroTech) was then applied to the brain surface and Vaseline was melted onto the electrode and cable using a low-temp cauterizer to allow them to move when advancing the electrode post-implant. Anchor screws were inserted bilaterally into the lateral ridge of the skull, and dental cement was applied to secure the implant. Rats were either implanted with a Cambridge NeuroTech E1 (4 shank) electrode (n=2 sham, n=2 injured) or a Cambridge NeuroTech H2 electrode (n=2 sham, n=3 injured).</p>

<title>Behavior During Electrophysiological Recordings</title>
<p>Animals used for electrophysiological recordings were handled for 5-7 days then were food restricted (up to 85% of body weight) and introduced to a 1 m<sup>2</sup> open field environment containing small pieces of Fruit Loops to encourage exploration. Rats were exposed to the environment for 15 mins/day for a minimum of 3 days before injury to become familiarized to it. Rats were then returned to normal <italic>ad libitum</italic> food access for at least 24 hrs then subjected to <sub>L</sub>FPI/sham surgery. Rats were chronically implanted with recording electrodes 3-4 days after sham/injury surgery. 24 hrs after implantation, rats were again food restricted (up to 85% of body weight) and habituated to the wireless recording transmitter (FreeLynx; Neuralynx; Bozeman, MT) while exploring the same open field environment for food rewards. The following days, electrodes were advanced deeper into the brain, and the rat was again placed in the open field environment to find food rewards. This process was repeated until electrodes reached <italic>st. pyr</italic> in CA1 (6-9 days post-injury) which was determined based on real-time observation of multi-unit activity and the presence of sharp-wave ripples. Once in <italic>st. pyr</italic>, rats were placed in their home cage for at least 20mins to allow electrodes to settle then recordings were obtained in the familiar open field environment. Rats were then placed back in their home cage for 5 mins while the battery for the wireless transmitter was replaced, then were placed into a novel environment for an additional recording. The novel environment was an 8-arm radial arm maze with Fruit Loops scattered throughout to encourage exploration (no behavioral task was performed in the radial arm maze). On 2 subsequent days, electrodes were advanced further into the CA1 lamina, allowed to settle, then rats were recorded in the familiar open field environment.</p>

Tracking was curated by manually removing artifacts (sudden large displacements), interpolating between removed positions, and smoothing pixel locations with a gaussian kernel. Pixels were then converted to real-world distances (cm) using the size of the environments for scaling. Instantaneous velocity (Δ position / Δ time) was computed between each frame then smoothed with a gaussian kernel.</p>

<title>Power Analyses</title>
<p>Raw signals were down sampled to 3 kHz using an anti-aliasing filter (resample function in MATLAB; Mathworks, MA). Power was then computed using a continuous wavelet transform using the cwt function in MATLAB. First a filter bank of complex bump wavelets was created from 1-1500 Hz using 36 wavelets per octave. Bump wavelets were selected because they have narrow variance in frequency. Wavelets were then convolved with the down sampled signal and power was computed as the magnitude of the analytic signal squared for each convolution. For each recording, the mean power for each frequency was computed specifically for times when the rat was moving (&gt;10 cm/sec). These values were then averaged across shanks and days to get an average per animal for the defined <italic>st. pyr</italic> and <italic>st. rad</italic> channels respectively, and sham and injured animals were averaged with each other to create the power spectra shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>. Theta and gamma power was extracted from each animal’s mean power spectrum by computing the area under the curve in the 5-10 and 30-59 Hz bands respectively. These individual values are shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G</xref>.</p>

<title>Single Unit Isolation and Clustering</title>
<p>Automated spike sorting was done using Klusta (RRID: SCR_014480) and manually curated in Phy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/kwikteam/phy">https://github.com/kwikteam/phy</ext-link>) by a reviewer blind to sham/injured condition. Each shank was assessed independently as the inter-shank spacing of 250 uM ensured that units were not visible on multiple shanks. Familiar and novel environment recordings on day 1 were spliced together, and spike sorting was performed on this joined data to retain unit identity across recordings. After single units were extracted, they were clustered into 3 different groups: putative pyramidal cells, interneurons, or unclassified. All units &gt;80 µm above the defined <italic>st. pyr</italic> channel were automatically clustered as interneurons. Cells within ±80 µm of the defined <italic>st. pyr</italic> channel were manually classified by a reviewer blind to animal ID and sham/injured condition based on firing rate, spike shape, and autocorrelogram.</p>
<p>Automated k-means consensus clustering was performed to further validate manual clustering. Firing rates, spike width (width of mean action potential waveform at half-max spike height), and the first moment of the autocorrelogram (mean of autocorrelogram values at lags from 0-50 ms) were normalized from 0-1 for each cell within ±80 µm of the defined <italic>st. pyr</italic> channel. K-means clustering (with 2 groups) was performed on these normalized features 1000 times, and the consensus of all 1000 permutations was used to identify cells as pyramidal cells or interneurons. Classification of cells that were manually identified as pyramidal cells or interneurons (excluding unclassified cells) were compared to automated clustering results and there was &gt;95% agreement between the two methods.</p>

<title>Entrainment Analyses</title>
<p>Entrainment was assessed by filtering the <italic>st. pyr</italic> LFP into discrete frequency bands using a 2<sup>nd</sup> order Butterworth filter, finding the instantaneous angle associated with each spike using the Hilbert transform, then computing the mean vector length (MVL) and mean angle of entrainment using circular statistics (CircStat toolbox in MATLAB; RRID:SCR_016651)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c153">153</xref></sup>. Entrainment strength was visualized across a range of frequency bins (24 bins spanning 1-15 Hz with a width of 1 Hz, and 30 bins spanning 15-180 Hz with a width of 20 Hz) separately for epochs when the rat was moving (&gt;10 cm/sec) and still (&lt;10 cm/sec) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs 4B&amp;D</xref>). Units were excluded if their firing rate was below 0.1 Hz in the environment or if they did not have at least 25 spikes in both moving and still epochs.</p>
<p>Theta and gamma entrainment was assessed by filtering the <italic>st. pyr</italic> LFP from 5-10 Hz or 30-59 Hz respectively and calculating the MVL and mean angle of entrainment. To determine if cells were significantly entrained to theta or gamma oscillations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C&amp;E</xref>), we used a circular shuffling procedure with 500 permutations. For each permutation, the vector of <italic>st. pyr</italic> theta and gamma phase angles was cut at a random point (minimum 10 second offset from the original data), and the phase angles after the cut point were placed in front of the phase angles before the cut point to create a circularly shuffled distribution of phase angles. This maintains the spiking profile of all units as well as the temporal structure of the data except at the cut point. The MVL was computed for each permutation, and significantly entrained cells were defined as cells that had a MVL greater than 95% of shuffled permutations. Any units not significantly entrained to theta oscillations were excluded from analysis in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>.</p>

<title>Ripple Detection and Analysis</title>
<p>Raw signals were down sampled to 3000 Hz using an anti-aliasing filter (resample function in MATLAB). Then a continuous wavelet transform was used to construct time-frequency maps of signals using an open-source algorithm (fCWT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c154">154</xref></sup>. Morlet wavelets with C= 12 were used for higher frequency resolution. High frequency events were isolated by thresholding the time-frequency maps using empirical cumulative distribution function of amplitudes. The thresholding value was calculated for 80-250 Hz and 250-500 Hz separately to minimize the effect of decrease in the amplitude of oscillations with frequency. These isolated high frequency blobs were accepted if they passed several criteria such as their duration (at least 3 cycles based on the frequency of oscillation), or their amplitudes compared to background activity. The hyperparameters of this algorithm were chosen by evaluating the accuracy and precision of this method using synthetic data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Sharp wave events were detected separately on <italic>st. rad</italic> (Note that for some animals, the first day of recording did not include any channels located at <italic>st. rad</italic> because most electrodes were localized to <italic>st. pyr</italic>). First, the down sampled raw signals were filtered between 8 and 40 Hz using a 2<sup>nd</sup> order Butterworth filter. Then, local minimums of the filtered signal were found using islocalmin function in MATLAB as candidates for the center of sharp waves. Next, islocalmax function in MATLAB was used to find the local maximums of the filtered signal for the starting and stopping point of a sharp wave. A sharp wave was identified if a center (local minimum) was located between to local maximums. Finally, sharp waves were only accepted if their amplitude of the local minimum was larger than 98% of all local minimums. The described method for sharp wave detection was generous by design (it can be stricter by applying a harsher criterion for amplitudes).</p>
<p>Sharp-wave ripples were identified if the detected ripples events (accepted contiguous blobs in time-frequency maps) overlapped with detected sharp wave events. These putative SWRs were then manually curated by an observer blind to animal ID, sham/injured condition, and animal behavior during event. The percentage of accepted SWR events that occurred while the animals were not moving was calculated (&gt;95% in all conditions) and SWR event frequency was normalized to the amount of time animals were not moving to compare SWR event frequency across conditions while controlling for any potential differences is the amount of time animals spent moving. Frequency amplitude spectra were computed for each event by averaging amplitudes at each frequency bin over times coinciding with the blob edges (see white lines in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>), then averaged across conditions. Event durations and peak amplitudes (the maximum value in the time-frequency map) were then computed to create the cumulative distributions shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E</xref>.</p>

<title>Morris Water Maze</title>
<p>The MWM apparatus was a circular pool (2 m in diameter, 50 cm tall, filled to a depth of 25 cm with 18° C water) containing a hidden platform (11.5 cm x 11.5 cm x 24 cm tall) just below the water’s surface. Both the interior of the pool and the platform were painted black making the platform invisible from the surface. External visual cues could be easily seen from the pool for navigation purposes. Rats received 10 trials of training in the MWM ∼20 hrs before TBI/sham surgery followed by another 10 trials ∼2 hrs before surgery. For each trial, the rat was placed in one of 4 randomly selected starting locations located 90° apart and given 2 mins to freely swim until they found the platform. If the rat was unable to find the platform after 2 mins, they were placed there for 15-30 sec. Rats were tested ∼42 hrs after FPI or sham surgery to assess memory of the platform location. During testing, the platform was removed, and rats freely swam for 1 minute. A memory score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup> was calculated based on the amount of time the rat spent in 5 distinct zones with zones closer to the platform’s previous location being weighted higher. All trials were video recorded from a camera placed above the pool, and the rat’s position was obtained using automated video tracking (Ethovision XT, Noduls; RRID: SCR_000441).</p>

<title>Histological Examinations</title>
<p>To ensure the nature and severity of injury were consistent with prior characterizations of the model, a separate set of animals underwent FPI without electrode implantation (n=2; 1.8 atm) or sham surgery (n=1) for histopathological analysis. All animals were survived for 48 hours. At the study endpoint, ketamine / xylazine / acepromazine (75/15/2 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered and following adequate anesthesia, animals were transcardially perfused with chilled 1X phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed immediately with chilled 10% neutral buffered formalin. Brains were extracted and post-fixed for 24 hours at 4°C before being blocked in the coronal plane at 2 mm intervals and processed to paraffin using standard techniques. 8 μm thick whole brain coronal sections were obtained at the level of the anterior hippocampus, posterior hippocampus and posterior angular bundle using a rotary microtome.</p>
<p>All regions were stained using hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E). In addition, to determine the presence and distribution of axonal pathology, immunohistochemical (IHC) techniques were performed as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c155">155</xref></sup>. Briefly, following deparaffinization and rehydration of tissue sections, endogenous peroxidase activity tissue was quenched using 3% aqueous hydrogen peroxide. Antigen retrieval was performed using a pressure cooker with sections immersed in Tris EDTA buffer (pH 8.0). Subsequent blocking was performed for 30 minutes in 1% normal horse serum (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA, USA) in Optimax buffer (BioGenex, San Ramon, CA, USA). An antibody reactive for the N-terminal amino acids 66-81 of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) (Clone 22C11: Millipore, Billerica, MA) was applied at 1:40K and incubated overnight at 4°C. After rinsing, sections were incubated with the appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody for 30 minutes followed by avidin-biotin complex and visualization achieved using DAB (all reagents: Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA, USA). Sections were rinsed and dehydrated in graded alcohols and cleared in xylenes before being coverslipped. Positive control tissue for APP IHC included sections of contused rat brain tissue with previously established axonal pathology. Omission of the primary antibody was performed on positive control tissue to control for non-specific binding.</p>
<p>Fluoro-Jade C staining was performed to assess for neuronal degeneration using the Biosensis Fluoro-Jade C staining Reagent Kit per the manufacturer’s instructions (Biosensis, Thebarton, Australia). Briefly, following dewaxing and rehydration to water as above, tissue was the immersed in potassium permanganate solution for 25 minutes at room temperature. After being rinsed in gently flowing dH<sub>2</sub>O, tissue was then incubated in Fluoro-Jade C solution at room temperature for 30 minutes. After rinsing, sections were dried at 37° C in an oven for 90 minutes before being immersed in xylenes and coverslipped.</p>

<title>Analysis of Histological Findings</title>
<p>All sections were reviewed for the presence of hemorrhage. The presence or absence of axonal pathology was determined in all sections including in the fimbria fornix, angular bundle, hippocampus, corpus callosum and thalamus. In addition, cell death was assessed by examination for Fluoro-Jade C positive neurons in all sections, including all hippocampal subfields, entorhinal cortex and thalamus. Two independent observers reviewed all sections for the presence or absence of axonal pathology and cell degeneration with excellent interrater reliability (Cohen’s Kappa 0.91). Notably, histological observations were performed at 48 hours to identify pathologies which are readily visualized at this timepoint including acute axonal and neuronal degeneration. However, due to the complex temporal evolution of post-traumatic pathologies, observations at 48 hrs may differ from the pathologies at 7 days post-injury, when electrophysiological recordings were performed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study investigated how traumatic brain injury affects oscillatory and single-unit hippocampal activity in awake-behaving rats.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The use of high-density laminar electrodes enabled precise localization of recording sites. To ensure an unbiased, rigorous approach, single-unit analysis was performed by a reviewer who was blind to experimental conditions. A proof of concept study was undertaken to characterize the pathology that resulted from the specific TBI model used in the main study. There was an effort to link abnormalities in hippocampal activity to memory disruption by running a cohort of rats on the Morris Water Maze task.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The paper is written as if the experiment was exploratory and not hypothesis-driven despite the fact that there is a wealth of experimental evidence about this TBI model that could have informed very specific predictions to test a hypothesis that is only hinted at in the discussion. The number of rats used for the spatial working memory experiment is not reported. Some of the statistics are not completely reported. It is also unclear what the rationale was for recording single units in a novel and familiar environment. Furthermore, this analysis comparing single-unit activity between familiar and novel environments is quite rudimentary. There are much more rigorous analyses to answer the question of how hippocampal single-unit firing patterns differ across changes in environments. There are details lacking about the number of units recorded per session and per rat, all of which are usually reported in studies that record single units. Spatial working memory assessment is delegated to a single panel of a supplementary figure. More importantly, there is no effort to dissociate between spatial working memory deficits and other motor, motivational, or sensory deficits that could have been driving the lower &quot;memory score&quot; in the experimental group.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors investigate changes in theta-gamma phase amplitude coupling, and action potential entrainment to theta following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Both phenomena are widely hypothesized to be important for cognition, and the authors report deficits in both after TBI. The manuscript is well-written, the figures are well-constructed, and the author's use of high-level analysis methods for TBI EEG data collected from awake, behaving animals is welcome.</p>
<p>Major Comments:</p>
<p>- The animal n's are small (4 sham and 5 injured). In Figure 3, for instance, one wonders if panels D and E might have shown significant differences if more animals had been recorded.</p>
<p>- The text focuses on deficits in the theta and gamma bands, but the reduction in power appears to be broadband (see Figure 1F, especially Pyramidal cell layer panel). Therefore, the overall decrease in broadband (in the injured population) must be normalized between sham and injured animals before a selective comparison between sham and injured animals can be conducted. That is the only way that selective narrow bands i.e., theta and low gamma can be compared between the two cohorts. A brief discussion of the significance of a broadband decrease would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors studied the effects of traumatic brain injury created by LFPI procedure on the CA1 at the network level. The major findings in this study seem to be that the TBI reduces theta and gamma powers in CA1, reduces phase-amplitude coupling in between theta and gamma bands as well as disrupts the gamma entrainment of interneurons. I think the authors have made some important discoveries that could help advance the understanding of TBI effects at the physiological level, however, more investigations into deciphering the relationship of the behavioral and brain states to the observed effects would help clarify the interpretations for the readers.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors in this study were able to combine behavioral verification of the TBI model with the laminar electrophysiological recordings of the CA1 region to bring forward network-level anomalies such as the temporal coordination of network-level oscillations as well as in the firing of the interneurons. Indeed, it seems that the findings may serve future studies to functionally better understand and/or refine the therapies for the TBI.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Discoveries made in the paper and their broad interpretations can be helped with further characterization and comparison among the brain and behavioral states both during immobility and movement. The impact of brain injury in several parts of the brain can alter brain-wide LFP and/or behavior. The altered behavior and/or LFP patterns might then lead to reduced spiking and unreliable LFP oscillations in the hippocampus. Hence, claims made in the abstract such as &quot;These results reveal deficits in information encoding and retrieval schemes essential to cognition that likely underlie TBI-associated learning and memory impairments, and elucidate potential targets for future neuromodulation therapies&quot; do not have enough evidence to test whether the disruptions were information encoding and retrieval related or due to sensory-motor and/or behavioral deficits that could also occur during TBI.</p>
<p>Movement velocity is already known to be correlated to the entrainment of spikes with the theta rhythm and also in some cases with the gamma oscillations. So, it is important to disentangle the differences in behavioral variables and the observed effects. As an example, the author's claims of disrupted temporal coding (as shown in the graphical abstract) might have suffered from these confounds. The observed results of reduced entrainment might, on one hand, be due to the decreased LFP power (induced by injury in different brain areas) resulting in altered behavior and/or the unreliable oscillations of the LFP bands such as theta and gamma, rather than memory encoding and retrieval related disruption of spikes synchrony to the rhythms, while on the other hand, they may simply be due to reduced excitability in the neurons particularly in the behavioral and brain state in which the effects were observed, rather than disrupted temporal code. Hence, further investigations into dissociating these factors could help readers mechanistically understand the interesting results observed by the authors.</p>

<p>We would like to thank the editors and reviewers for their constructive feedback, and we look forward to addressing their comments in the revised manuscript. We also appreciate the acknowledgment that the use of laminar electrodes in awake-behaving animals is an important advancement for the TBI community, and that our results provide a potential physiological link between coalescing TBI pathologies and cognitive deficits. We believe that integrating the reviewer comments will help to make our analyses even more rigorous and will improve the overall manuscript. Please find comments related to specific concerns raised in the public review below:</p>

<p>Previous mechanistic and physiological studies suggested interneuronal dysfunction following TBI that we hypothesized would disrupt oscillatory dynamics underlying temporal coding (single unit entrainment to theta/gamma, phase precession, and phase-amplitude coupling). These are known to support hippocampal-dependent learning and memory tasks such as the Morris Water Maze. While we did not record during a goal-directed behavioral task, the goal of recording in a familiar and novel environment was to assess remapping across these environments. Unfortunately, occupancy in the two environments was not high enough to rigorously characterize place cell specificity and phase precession or and investigate remapping, although putative place cells were identified. Despite this shortcoming, we were still able to confirm that the spike timing of interneurons relative to hippocampal oscillations was disrupted which we believe underlies the massive reduction in theta-gamma phase amplitude coupling reported. This opens the door to more strongly hypothesis-driven, mechanistic studies (i.e. closed loop stimulation) to alter the spike timing of interneurons relative to theta phase and potentially rescue these effects on phase amplitude coupling and behavior.</p>

<p>The number of rats used for the spatial working memory task was reported in the text and Figure legend where the statistics were reported, but we will ensure that the statistics are more completely reported by including relevant statistical results and parameters outside of the test used and p-value. Additionally, we will report the number of units recorded per animal.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>The spatial working memory deficit that we report in the Morris Water Maze is not a novel finding and has been demonstrated numerous times in this TBI model. Our goal in including this was to increase the rigor of the study by verifying this deficit in our hands at the injury level used for these physiology experiments. The dissociation between spatial working memory deficits and other motor, motivational, or sensory deficits from TBI in the Morris Water Maze (e.g. swim speed and escape latency with visible platforms) has been well characterized in this TBI model at many injury levels including more severe injuries than those used in this study. We will address this in the Discussion as it is an important point.</p>

<p>We agree that there is a broadband downward shift in power following TBI especially in the pyramidal cell layer. We will include a normalization of the power spectra in order to specifically compare the theta and gamma bands between sham and injured rats and include discussion about the broadband decrease.</p>

<p>We agree that changes in hippocampal physiology that we report could arise due to disrupted inputs from TBI, and this study is inherently limited due to recording exclusively from CA1. We chose to record from the hippocampus due to its importance for learning and memory, and its vulnerability in TBI. Future studies will investigate how hippocampal afferents are affected by injury, and we hope that the layer-specific changes we report will help to inform which inputs may be preferentially disrupted. Importantly, these inputs along with local processing within the hippocampus change drastically depending on the behavior of the animal. We will more rigorously assess movement and the behavioral state of the rats when comparing physiological properties, especially the firing rates reported in Figure 3.</p>
