<title>Abstract</title><p>Metabolic disease is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, yet few studies have examined how these factors influence signal transduction, a key mediator of metabolism. Using mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics, we quantified 23,126 phosphosites in skeletal muscle of five genetically distinct mouse strains in two dietary environments, with and without acute <italic>in vivo</italic> insulin stimulation. Almost half of the insulin-regulated phosphoproteome was modified by genetic background on an ordinary diet, and high-fat high-sugar feeding affected insulin signalling in a strain-dependent manner. Our data revealed coregulated subnetworks within the insulin signalling pathway, expanding our understanding of the pathway’s organisation. Furthermore, associating diverse signalling responses with insulin-stimulated glucose uptake uncovered regulators of muscle insulin responsiveness, including the regulatory phosphosite S469 on Pfkfb2, a key activator of glycolysis. Finally, we confirmed the role of glycolysis in modulating insulin action in insulin resistance. Our results underscore the significance of genetics in shaping global signalling responses and their adaptability to environmental changes, emphasizing the utility of studying biological diversity with phosphoproteomics to discover key regulatory mechanisms of complex traits.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Protein post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation enable cells to rapidly respond to environmental changes by modifying protein function at low metabolic cost<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. As a result of this high metabolic efficiency, phosphorylation is involved in nearly all biological processes and is dysregulated in numerous complex diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Advances in mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics – the unbiased identification and quantification of protein phosphorylation – have led to the discovery of more than 100,000 phosphosites, revealing that the phosphoproteome comprises vast, interconnected phosphorylation networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, rather than the textbook view of isolated, linear kinase cascades.</p>
<p>The insulin signalling network is among the most studied phosphorylation networks. Post-prandial increases in blood glucose stimulate pancreatic insulin secretion, coordinating a metabolic switch in target tissues like skeletal muscle and adipose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Insulin increases glucose uptake into these tissues by promoting translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the plasma membrane, and serves other functions like enhancing protein synthesis, downregulating lipid catabolism, and altering gene transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. To coordinate these functions, insulin triggers a phosphorylation cascade primarily involving activation of the Ser/Thr kinase Akt, regulation of downstream kinases including mTORC1 and GSK3, and modulation of parallel signalling arms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Seminal phosphoproteomics studies demonstrated that this cascade regulates over a thousand phosphosites, with many still uncharacterised in insulin action<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Insulin resistance – the failure of insulin to promote glucose uptake in its target tissues – is triggered by genetic and environmental factors such as family history of metabolic disease and high-calorie diets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Although insulin resistance is a major precursor of metabolic disease including type 2 diabetes, its mechanistic basis remains unresolved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Interactions between genetics and environment significantly regulate biomolecular processes, including insulin resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. As signalling pathways connect the extracellular environment to intracellular proteins, they are likely a major conduit of gene-by-environment interactions. Yet, how global phosphorylation signalling networks are regulated across different genetic backgrounds is relatively unexplored. Recent phosphoproteomics studies in yeast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> and mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> identified genetic variants affecting multiple phosphosites, but did not analyse the phosphoproteome’s response to acute perturbation, which is crucial to its role as a signal transduction system. We have also shown marked variation in acute signalling responses to exercise or insulin across individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. However, this study did not systematically assess the relative contributions of genetics and the environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Understanding how these variables intersect with signal transduction is fundamental to our basic knowledge of signalling and the advancement of personalised medicine, which advocates individualised treatment regimens based on genetic risk factors and gene-by-environment interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Inbred mice allow precise control of genetics and environment unachievable in human studies, enabling examination of how these factors interact to influence biomolecular systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Here, we performed phosphoproteomics on insulin-stimulated or control skeletal muscle from five genetically distinct inbred mouse strains fed either an ordinary chow diet or a high-fat, high-sugar “western style” diet. Strikingly, we found that genetic background influenced both the phosphoproteomic insulin response of chow-fed mice, as well as how these responses were modified by high-fat, high-sugar feeding. These signalling changes were reflected in altered activity profiles of multiple kinases and provided insight into the functional organisation of the insulin signalling network by revealing subnetworks of coregulated phosphosites. A major challenge in phosphoproteomics studies is pinpointing important regulatory events among the many responding to a stimulus. We reasoned that associating changes in protein phosphorylation across the gene-by-environment landscape with phenotypic change – in this case insulin-stimulated glucose uptake – would dissect mechanistic targets with greater fidelity. This approach generated known as well as candidate regulators of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, leading us to demonstrate that glycolytic upregulation reverses insulin resistance. Our work represents the first global portrait of insulin signalling network plasticity in response to genetic and environmental variation, which will serve as an important resource in future studies of insulin action and resistance.</p>

<title>Phosphoproteomics of insulin signalling in mouse skeletal muscle</title>
<p>To study how protein phosphorylation networks are affected by genetics and environment, we examined insulin signalling in five genetically distinct inbred mouse strains including four lab strains with diverse metabolic phenotypes (C57Bl6J, NOD, BXH9, and BXD34<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>), and the wild-derived CAST strain (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref></bold>). Mice underwent a six-week diet regimen of standard lab diet (CHOW) or a high-fat high-sucrose diet (HFD), which is commonly used to induce insulin resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Consistent with their diverse genetics, these strains differed in morphometric parameters (body weight, adiposity) and metabolic traits (fasting blood glucose, fasting blood insulin, glucose tolerance) both on the CHOW diet and in their response to HFD-feeding (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>We focused on skeletal muscle, as it is the site of greatest post-prandial glucose uptake and the most significant contributor to impaired glucose disposal in type 2 diabetes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Specifically, we chose to examine the soleus muscle, because its largely oxidative fibre composition resembles human muscle tissue more than other murine muscles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Mice were injected retro-orbitally with saline control or insulin for 10 minutes, and the soleus was collected for phosphoproteomic analysis (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref></bold>). A tritiated 2-deoxyglucose (<sup>3</sup>H-2DG) tracer was co-injected to measure soleus glucose uptake.</p>
<p>Using the EasyPhos workflow and data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, we quantified 28,809 phosphopeptides across 95 biological samples, corresponding to 23,126 unique high-confidence phosphosites (Class I; localization score &gt; 0.75) on 3,507 proteins (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref></bold>, <bold>Table S1</bold>). On average we quantified 15,395 phosphopeptides in each sample, with minimal variation (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2a</xref></bold>). Samples from animals of the same strain and diet were highly correlated and generally clustered together, implying the data are highly reproducible (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2b</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">d</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>To explore the soleus insulin signalling network, we examined phosphopeptides altered by insulin stimulation in at least one of the ten strain-diet combinations. We filtered our data to 10,432 phosphopeptides highly quantified across most conditions (see Methods) and identified those with significant differences between unstimulated and insulin-stimulated samples (three-way ANOVA insulin main-effect q-value &lt; 0.05) that was of sufficient magnitude in at least one strain-diet combination (insulin/unstimulated fold change &gt; 1.5). This resulted in 441 insulin-regulated phosphopeptides on 232 proteins, which is noticeably more than recent studies of 10-minute insulin signalling in patient-derived myoblasts (174 phosphopeptides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> and 242 phosphopeptides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>) or mouse adipose tissue (319 phosphopeptides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref></bold>, <bold>c, Table S1</bold>).</p>
<p>Our analysis recovered many well-studied insulin-regulated phosphosites, including Akt substrates such as T247 on Akt1s1 (PRAS40), S939 on Tsc2, and S9 on Gsk3β (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d-f</xref></bold>), as well as targets of downstream kinases including the Gsk3β substrate S641 on Gys1 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref></bold>). Enrichment of Gene Ontology (GO) biological processes recapitulated canonical insulin signalling axes including “insulin receptor signaling pathway”, “phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling”, “protein kinase B signaling”, and “TORC1 signaling”, and multiple pathways related to glucose metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, autophagy, and protein translation, reflecting known targets of insulin action (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3a</xref></bold>). Furthermore, insulin-regulated phosphosites were enriched for insulin regulation in our previous human skeletal muscle phosphoproteome (fold enrichment = 4.22, p = 9.50×10<sup>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, one-sided Fisher’s exact test, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3b</xref></bold>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Despite this, only half of all insulin-regulated phosphopeptides (228/441) were previously annotated as insulin-regulated in the PhosphositePlus database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3c</xref></bold>), highlighting the potential of our data to discover novel aspects of insulin signalling while recapitulating known components. Overall, our phosphoproteomics data provide a comprehensive and high-quality atlas of insulin signalling in mouse skeletal muscle.</p>

<title>Genetics and diet modulate insulin signalling</title>
<p>The influence of genetic and environmental variation on global insulin signalling responses is largely unknown. We therefore developed a pipeline to address this question using our phosphoproteomics data (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref></bold>). First, we converted the intensity values of each insulin-regulated phosphopeptide to “insulin response” values, by normalising insulin-stimulated data to the unstimulated median of the corresponding Strain-Diet combination. Since protein expression should not change within a 10 min insulin stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, this allowed us to parse out protein abundance differences across strains and diets and focus solely on acute signalling processes. We then assessed the impact of genetics in CHOW-fed mice by identifying phosphopeptides with differing insulin responses in one or more strains compared to C57Bl6J (“Strain effect”). Lastly, we explored the effects of HFD-feeding on signalling as two types of “Diet effects”, either as a “Uniform diet effect” – where HFD-feeding affects each strain similarly – or a “StrainxDiet effect” – where its impact depends on the mouse strain. Analyses of “Strain effects” and “Diet effects” were performed separately, so a phosphopeptide could have both a Strain effect and a StrainxDiet/Uniform Diet effect.</p>

</fig>
<p>Almost half of the 441 insulin-regulated phosphopeptides displayed a Strain effect (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref></bold>, <bold>Table S1</bold>). These included phosphopeptides where C57Bl6J had a stronger insulin response than other strains, such as S15 on the RNA methyltransferase Rnmt (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref></bold>), and phosphopeptides where C57Bl6J had a weaker insulin response, such as S48 on the vesicle fusion regulator Vamp3 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref></bold>). Vamp3 S48 is predicted to be highly functional (functional score = 0.750<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>), its phosphorylation correlates with glucose uptake in insulin-stimulated and/or exercised human skeletal muscle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, and Vamp3 overexpression rescues GLUT4 translocation in insulin resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, suggesting that this site may represent a genetically variable control point of GLUT4 trafficking. In general, insulin responses were weaker in the four remaining strains compared to C57Bl6J, though the extent of this trend was strain-dependent (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref></bold>). In all, the strain-affected phosphopeptides reveal a unique fingerprint of insulin signalling within each strain (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref></bold>), highlighting the complex and widespread effects of genetic variation on signalling networks.</p>
<p>We next examined the impact of HFD-feeding in insulin signalling. StrainxDiet effects were more prevalent than Uniform diet effects (110 vs 10 phosphopeptides, <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref></bold>, <bold>Table S1</bold>), suggesting that the molecular impact of dietary perturbation was strongly modulated by genetic background. StrainxDiet effects impacted known regulatory phosphosites such as the inhibitory site S78 on Map2k4, whose insulin response was attenuated by HFD-feeding only in C57Bl6J and CAST (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h</xref></bold>). Map2k4 activates p38 and JNK kinases which have been implicated as drivers of HFD-induced insulin resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, and based on the behaviour of S78, the orchestration of this detrimental signalling axis in HFD-feeding may depend on genetic background.</p>
<p>HFD-feeding exerted complex effects on signalling, with the balance between suppressed and enhanced insulin responses varying across strains (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2i</xref></bold>). Furthermore, insulin-regulated phosphopeptides were largely altered by HFD-feeding in only a single strain, and when multiple strains were affected, they often changed in opposite directions (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2j-k</xref></bold>). For instance, multiple insulin responses were strengthened in BXH9 but weakened in C57Bl6J or CAST (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2k</xref></bold>), such as S500 on the translation regulator Larp4b (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3d</xref>)</bold>. Principal component analysis supported the highly divergent impact of dietary perturbation, as HFD-feeding displaced each strain in a distinct direction in principal component space (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2l</xref></bold>). StrainxDiet and Strain effects were driven by a mixture of changes to insulin-stimulated phosphorylation, unstimulated phosphorylation, or both, highlighting the complexity of these signalling alterations (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3e-f</xref></bold>). This analysis demonstrates the pervasive role of genetics in shaping signalling networks, as genetic background profoundly modulated the effect of HFD-feeding on insulin signalling.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Exploring genetic and dietary modulation of the insulin signalling network</title>
<p>To understand the insulin signalling circuitry and functional pathways modulated by genetics and diet, we curated a network of 160 insulin-regulated phosphosites, comprising sites from a knowledge pathway-derived list of canonical insulin signalling proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> and substrates of insulin-regulated kinases (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref></bold>, see Methods). Strain and diet affected multiple highly studied signalling sites, including Tsc2 S939 (Diet effect), Gsk3α S21 (Strain and Diet effects), and Tbc1d4 T649 (Strain and Diet effects), while other sites such as Gsk3β S9 and Akt1s1 T247 were unaffected. Interestingly, strain and diet affected both canonical and non-canonical insulin signalling proteins to a similar extent (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3g-h</xref></bold>). Non-canonical phosphosites could shed light on underappreciated outcomes of insulin action either altered or unaffected by genetics and the environment, such as the p70S6K substrate S47 on Dnajc2 (Strain and Diet effects), which drives cellular senescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, and S315 on Pcyt1a (no Strain or Diet effect), which inhibits phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>No functional pathways were overrepresented within strain or diet-affected phosphosites relative to all insulin-regulated sites, implying that genetics and environment modulate most or all outcomes of insulin. For instance, strain and diet affected regulatory phosphosites controlling vesicle trafficking (S348, T575, S595, and T649 on the GLUT4 trafficking regulator Tbc1d4); glucose metabolism (S469 and S486 on Pfkfb2, which promote glycolysis); mitochondrial structure and function (S129 on Mff, which promotes mitochondrial fission); autophagy (S555 on the master autophagy regulator Ulk1); gene transcription (the inhibitory site S108 on the transcription factor Tfeb); and mRNA translation (S236 on ribosomal proteins S6, S422 on Eif4b, and S64 and T69 on Eif4ebp1, which promote translation). Interestingly, Strain and Diet effects overlapped significantly (fold enrichment = 1.50, p = 4.40×10<sup>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, two-sided Fisher’s exact test, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3i</xref></bold>), implying some phosphosites may be more amenable to regulation overall. As a notable exception, all six insulin-regulated phosphosites on Plin1 had Diet effects while only one had a Strain effect (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref></bold>). Plin1 coats and regulates lipid droplets, hence this enrichment of Diet effects may represent a signalling response to increased intramuscular lipids in the HFD condition. Overall, genetics and environment triggered widespread alterations in insulin signalling impinging on diverse cellular pathways.</p>

<title>Genetics and diet rewire insulin-regulated kinase signalling</title>
<p>The extensive signalling changes caused by genetics and diet may result from altered kinase regulation. We tested this hypothesis using a kinase substrate enrichment analysis (KSEA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> on phosphopeptide insulin responses. KSEA accurately captured the activation of canonical insulin-regulated kinases (Akt, mTOR, p70S6K, and p90RSK) and the deactivation of GSK3, confirming the validity of the approach (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref></bold>). Focussing on CHOW-fed mice, we identified seven kinases differentially enriched across mouse strains (ANOVA adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05, <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref></bold>). For example, insulin activated SGK and deactivated GSK3 more in C57Bl6J and NOD than in other strains (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref></bold>). Extending this analysis to all mice, we identified kinases with Uniform diet or StrainxDiet effects (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref></bold>). Akin to our analysis of individual phosphosites (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref></bold>), StrainxDiet effects were more prevalent than Uniform diet effects (five kinases compared to one), indicating that genetic background strongly influences the impact of HFD-feeding on kinase signalling. These results suggest that the observed phosphosite signalling changes could be partly due to altered insulin regulation of multiple kinases.</p>

<title>Biological variation reveals functional organisation of the insulin signalling network</title>
<p>KSEA predicted changes in overall kinase activity, but we questioned if substrates of the same kinase could be differentially regulated by genetic and environmental variation. As a case study we examined substrates of Akt – a master regulator of insulin signal transduction – to assess the similarity of their insulin responses across strains and diets. Strikingly, we observed a range of both positive and negative correlations (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref></bold>). For instance, while Tsc2 S939 and Akt1s1 T247 both activate mTORC1, their insulin responses correlated poorly (r = 0.202, p = 0.168, <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref></bold>). Supporting these findings, similar heterogeneity in Akt substrate insulin responses has previously been observed in skeletal muscle from humans with differing metabolic health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Hierarchical clustering revealed four distinct groups of positively correlated Akt substrates (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref></bold>), suggesting these groups may coordinate distinct functional outputs of Akt signalling.</p>

<p>We next explored if the genetic and environmental variation in our study could reveal organisational principles of the entire insulin signalling pathway. By performing weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>), we identified eight subnetworks of coregulated insulin-responsive phosphopeptides (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref></bold>) varying in size from 16 to 120 phosphopeptides, with 91 assigned to no subnetwork (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref></bold>, <bold>Table S2</bold>). Examining the subnetwork “eigenpeptides” – a weighted average of the constituent phosphopeptides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> – revealed that the subnetworks captured distinct effects of genetics and diet on insulin signalling (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref></bold>). For example, HFD-feeding attenuated the insulin response of subnetwork I in CAST and C57Bl6J strains, while subnetwork II was affected by HFD-feeding only in CAST and NOD (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref></bold>). This suggests that the subnetworks may be sensitive to distinct cellular information.</p>
<p>Next, we characterised the regulatory and functional nature of these subnetworks. Canonical insulin-regulated kinases such as Akt and mTOR were enriched across multiple subnetworks (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref></bold>), confirming that genetic and environmental variation can reveal uncoupling of substrates targeted by the same kinase (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a-b</xref></bold>). Nevertheless, visualising these subnetworks within our curated insulin signalling pathway (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref></bold>) revealed cases where signal flowed through a single subnetwork, such as from Erk2 (Y185) to its target kinase Rsk2 (T365 and S369) and Rsk2 substrates (Gab2 S211 and Nos1 S847) within subnetwork III (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4</xref></bold>). Within multiply phosphorylated proteins, phosphosites either belonged to the same subnetwork (e.g. Plin1) or diverse subnetworks (e.g. Tbc1d4 and the transcription factor Nfatc2), suggesting the latter may serve as hubs integrating diverse cellular information (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Some subnetworks were enriched in specific cellular compartments (GO ontologies), implying that common localisation may facilitate coregulation of phosphosites (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5g</xref></bold>). Coregulation may partition functional outcomes of insulin action, as certain biological processes were enriched only in select subnetworks (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5h</xref></bold>). These included known insulin targets like “negative regulation of lipid catabolic process” in subnetwork I and “positive regulation of glycogen biosynthetic process” in I, VI, and VIII (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5h</xref></bold>). Lastly, we leveraged our previous phosphoproteomic time course of insulin signalling to interrogate subnetwork dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> and found that phosphopeptide insulin response dynamics varied across subnetworks (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5i</xref></bold>). This reveals distinct temporal regulation as another feature underlying the substructure of the insulin signalling network. Overall, genetic and environmental diversity illuminated the complex coregulation structure of insulin signalling, featuring subnetworks that evade known network circuitry and present unique functional signatures.</p>

<title>Leveraging biological variation to identify drivers of insulin responsiveness</title>
<p>We have so far described the marked influence of genetic background and HFD-feeding on skeletal muscle insulin signalling, evident at the level of individual phosphosites, protein kinases, and co-regulated network modules. We hypothesised that by associating this signalling diversity with a phenotypic output of insulin, such as enhanced glucose uptake, we would filter out mechanistically irrelevant phosphosites and hence prioritise molecular regulators of the phenotype. To test this hypothesis, we measured <italic>in vivo</italic> glucose uptake with <sup>3</sup>H-2DG tracer in the same muscle samples used for phosphoproteomics. Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake differed by more than twofold across strains (two-way ANOVA strain effect p = 4.78×10<sup>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>) and was almost uniformly decreased by HFD-feeding (two-way ANOVA diet effect p = 1.83×10<sup>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>) (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref></bold>).

<p>To prioritise signalling nodes responsible for differences in insulin responsiveness, we correlated all insulin-regulated phosphopeptides with glucose uptake in insulin-stimulated muscles, resulting in 37 significantly correlated phosphopeptides (r &gt; 0.35 or &lt; -0.35, q-value &lt; 0.1, <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref></bold>). The most significantly correlated phosphopeptide contained T1174 and S1176 on the nitric oxide synthase Nos3. The latter serves as a positive control for our analysis, as this site is known to be phosphorylated in response to insulin to promote <italic>in vivo</italic> glucose uptake by vasodilation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref></bold>). Other correlated phosphopeptides that could modulate insulin responsiveness include S1751 on Afdn, a phosphosite implicated in insulin action<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, and S196 on the Prkag2 subunit of AMPK, a major metabolic signalling hub promoting glucose uptake<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref></bold>). These examples suggest that our analysis prioritised regulators of glucose uptake.</p>
<p>While the above analysis identified phosphosites associated with glucose uptake through their absolute abundance, we hypothesized that for some phosphosites, the magnitude of their response to insulin may be a stronger determinant of insulin action. We found that the insulin response values of 13 phosphopeptides correlated with insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (r &gt; 0.35 or &lt; -0.35, q-value &lt; 0.1, <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref></bold>). These were largely distinct from the 37 phosphopeptides identified in our first analysis, indicating that the two approaches captured complementary information. Several of these phosphopeptides could regulate insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, such as the regulatory site S469 on the enzyme Pfkfb2 which activates glycolysis, a major pathway for glucose consumption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e</xref></bold>), and S177 on Rcsd1, which could affect GLUT4 vesicle transport via actin cytoskeleton remodelling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>In addition to individual phosphosites, the status of larger signalling network components could also influence insulin responsiveness. Kinase enrichment scores affected by strain or diet did not correlate with glucose uptake (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Table S3</xref></bold>), suggesting insulin action is not dominated by the net activity of specific kinases. Interestingly, two WGCNA-derived insulin signalling subnetworks correlated with glucose uptake: subnetwork V (r = 0.436, p = 0.00173) and subnetwork I (r = 0.332, p = 0.0197, <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6f</xref></bold>). Subnetwork V could modulate glucose uptake through actin cytoskeleton remodelling via Rscd1 S177, through glucose metabolism promotion via Gys1 S641 (<bold>Table S2</bold>), and by influencing GLUT4 vesicle trafficking due to its enrichment at “cytoplasmic vesicle membranes” (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5g</xref></bold>). It was also enriched in substrates of GSK3, which has been implicated in insulin resistance in skeletal muscle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> and adipose tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Subnetwork I, the largest cluster containing 27% of insulin-regulated phosphopeptides, was enriched in multiple kinases and biological processes (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref></bold>, <bold>h</bold>), suggesting it may be a central regulatory hub for various outcomes of insulin action including glucose uptake. Overall, compartmentalisation of insulin-responsive phosphosites into subnetworks may enable independent control of insulin’s functional outputs, since only two subnetworks correlated with insulin-stimulated glucose uptake.</p>

<sec id="s2g">
<title>Upregulating glycolysis reverses insulin resistance</title>
<p>We next aimed to validate our approach for identifying regulatory mechanisms of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. S469 on Pfkfb2 correlated highly with glucose uptake follow insulin stimulation (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e</xref></bold>). Phosphorylation of this site leads to increased production of F2,6BP, a potent glycolytic agonist, suggesting that activating glycolysis may play a key role in muscle insulin responsiveness. This is consistent with our previous findings that glycolytic enzyme abundance was strongly associated with <italic>ex vivo</italic> insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in muscle from inbred mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, and that decreasing glycolytic flux caused insulin resistance <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. To further establish glycolysis as a regulator of insulin responsiveness in skeletal muscle, we decided to investigate whether upregulating glycolysis through F2,6BP production can restore insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in insulin resistance. We endeavoured to stimulate glycolytic flux in muscle cells independently of regulatory input in case this is compromised by insulin resistance. While Pfkfb2 requires activating phosphorylation by Akt to produce F2,6BP substantially, its paralog Pfkfb3 has high basal production rates and lacks an Akt motif at the corresponding phosphosites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. We therefore rationalised that overexpressing Pfkfb3 would robustly increase F2,6BP production and enhance glycolysis regardless of insulin stimulation and Akt signalling (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6g</xref></bold>). To avoid systemic effects of Pfkfb3 overexpression we studied cultured L6-GLUT4-HA myotubes, which display robust insulin regulation of GLUT4 trafficking and develop insulin resistance upon palmitate treatment, mimicking lipotoxicity, a trigger of <italic>in vivo</italic> insulin resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>As anticipated, Pfkfb3 overexpression increased glycolytic capacity in L6-GLUT4-HA myotubes as measured by extracellular acidification rate (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Fig. S5a-c</xref></bold>). Pfkfb3 overexpression also restored insulin-stimulated glucose uptake to normal levels in palmitate-treated cells (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6h</xref></bold>). This effect was only observed in cells treated with palmitate and insulin, suggesting it specifically modulated insulin action rather than non-specifically increasing glucose uptake through enhanced glucose consumption. These results further establish glycolytic flux as a major determinant of the glucose uptake arm of muscle insulin action and highlight the power of studying phosphoproteomics across the gene-by-environment landscape to identify causal drivers of complex phenotypes. We anticipate that our catalogue of glucose uptake-correlated phosphosites will provide a rich starting point for future investigations into mechanisms of insulin action and resistance.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The environment shapes the flow of information from genotype to phenotype. Many studies have interrogated the role of intermediate molecular layers such as the transcriptome or proteome, however few studies have examined how protein post-translation modifications participate in this information transfer. Here we have approached this problem by leveraging diverse inbred mouse strains and phosphoproteomics to examine the insulin signalling network across a landscape of genetic and dietary variation. Genetic background significantly altered the insulin signalling network both independently and in concert with dietary status, affecting myriad phosphosites and multiple kinases. We exploited this variation in signalling responses in two ways – to study the partitioning of the Akt and insulin signalling pathways into distinct subnetworks of coregulated phosphosites; and to identify potential regulators of insulin responsiveness by associating phosphorylation with insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Finally, validation studies in L6 myotubes confirmed the major role of accelerated glycolysis as a key regulator of insulin responsiveness.</p>
<p>Genetic and diet-driven signalling changes did not transmit linearly through our current model of the insulin signalling network, illustrating that this model remains incomplete. Notably, substrates of kinases such as Akt clustered into distinct groups based on differing insulin responses. Hence, it is an oversimplification to model signalling pathways as networks of individual kinases since substrates of the same kinase display independent regulation. This could arise from localisation of a kinase to distinct substrate pools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>; interactors targeting a kinase to different substrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>; substrate phosphorylation by alternate kinases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>; the dephosphorylation of specific substrates by phosphatases; kinase post-translational modifications altering substrate specificity; and distinct substrate phosphorylation kinetics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. As our knowledge of the repertoire of kinase substrates continues to deepen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>, future research should explore how the above mechanisms contribute to finer regulation of these substrates. Genetic and environmental variation also exposed a coregulation subnetwork structure within the insulin signalling network. The enrichment of subnetworks in distinct biological processes, and the selective association of two subnetworks with glucose uptake, suggests that this coregulation structure may direct independent control of distinct outcomes of insulin action. This exciting possibility necessitates further investigation, including replication in independent cohorts, spatiotemporal characterisation of subnetwork dynamics, and association of additional insulin-regulated phenotypes with subnetwork profiles.</p>
<p>Muscle insulin signalling responses vary across individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, and our results suggest that baseline genetic differences and an individual’s environment both alter signalling, with the environment’s influence depending strongly on genetic background. Signalling pathways are popular therapeutic targets due to their importance in human health and the relative ease of pharmaceutical interventions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. Our results advocate for a personalised approach to such therapies, implying that the efficacy of treatments aiming to correct pathological signalling responses will depend on an individual’s genetic background. In cancer, where signalling networks are dysregulated heterogeneously, modelling patient-specific networks has already shown promise for identifying personalised drug targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Personalised medicine approaches will also be aided by a comprehensive understanding of how genetics shape signalling networks and potentiate their modulation by the environment. Recent studies have made the first step, revealing that the ground-state phosphoproteome can be altered by mutations affecting network components such as kinases, phosphatases, and phosphoproteins, as well as the molecular milieu the network is exposed to including extracellular signalling ligands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. An important corollary of such genetic factors is that multiple genetic backgrounds should be studied when establishing generalizable signalling responses. Our data indicate that insulin responses in C57BL6J – the most commonly studied mouse strain – are not necessarily generalizable, indicated by phosphosites such as S15 on Rnmt that were insulin regulated almost exclusively in C57Bl6J.</p>
<p>A major challenge in studying signal transduction with omics technologies is that hundreds to thousands of molecular events typically respond to a cellular signal, making it difficult to pinpoint the most crucial regulatory nodes. To tackle this challenge, we previously demonstrated that associating phosphoproteomics with physiological phenotypes across diverse individuals enriches for phosphosites more likely to modulate biological responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Here we have elaborated on this approach, revealing that associating phosphorylation with phenotype across a genetic and environmental landscape can identify regulators of specific biological processes, such as insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Our results recapitulated known glucose uptake regulators and led to further validation of glycolytic flux as a modulator of insulin responsiveness. We have previously demonstrated that reduced glycolytic flux impairs GLUT4 translocation and insulin signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>, implying that the status of glycolysis is sensed by proteins regulating insulin action. An enhanced glycolytic metabolic tone may alter production of reactive oxygen species, a known modulator of insulin action<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup> and insulin signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Alternatively, recent approaches to map protein-metabolite interactions could identify points of allosteric crosstalk between glycolytic metabolites and insulin action proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>, hence broadening our understanding of the bidirectional communication between insulin action and metabolism.</p>
<p>It was striking that only several dozen insulin-regulated phosphopeptides associated significantly with glucose uptake. Since insulin triggers multiple distinct cellular outcomes, it is possible that only a subset of insulin-responsive phosphosites contribute to enhanced glucose uptake. Moreover, many of these phosphosites might only be permissive for insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and are not major regulatory nodes determining the fidelity of the process. For example, while mutation of the four primary Akt regulatory sites on Tbc1d4 blocks GLUT4 translocation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>, none of these phosphosites featured strong positive correlations with glucose uptake in our analysis (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig. S6</xref></bold>). This implies that their phosphorylation may promote glucose uptake in a functionally permissive, switch-like fashion. We suggest that the glucose uptake-associated phosphosites we have identified will be enriched in major regulators of insulin responsiveness, necessitating future functional studies to characterise these sites and explore their involvement in insulin resistance.</p>
<p>Our work demonstrates that genetic and environmental variation can profoundly modulate global signalling networks and that the influences of these factors are intrinsically entwined. We show that the resulting diversity in signalling responses can be leveraged to pinpoint regulators of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, providing a powerful methodological framework for interrogating the regulatory basis of complex biological pathways.</p>

<title>Limitations of this study</title>
<p>First, this study focused on male mice and examined only five inbred strains. This limited number of strains may mean that our association analysis was underpowered to detect some regulators of insulin responsiveness. Importantly, however, this does not imply that the regulators identified are incorrect, but only that there may be more to discover with larger cohorts. Future work should therefore extend our approach across a broader range of genetic backgrounds, as well as in female mice. Second, we only examined insulin signalling after 10 minutes, since measuring multiple timepoints would have drastically increased the number of animals and samples required. Integration of dynamic phosphoproteome data from cultured cells indicated that insulin signalling dynamics may contribute to trends in our data (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5i</xref></bold>), suggesting the exploration of signalling at additional timepoints may be fruitful in the future. Third, mammalian tissues are a heterogeneous mixture of cell types, and differences in this mixture could result in different signalling responses measured at the whole tissue level. In our experience, the soleus can be reproducibly dissected as an intact muscle with little contamination from surrounding tissues, making it unlikely that cell type composition varied across samples due to tissue collection. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that differences in the composition of the soleus muscle across strains and diets contributed to the signalling changes we detected. Lastly, as we did not perform total proteomics in parallel to phosphoproteomics, we did not assess whether phosphosite changes were caused by differences in total protein abundance. While we cannot ignore the influence of changes in protein abundance, in our previous studies of insulin signalling in adipocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> or human skeletal muscle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> in which deep proteomes were measured in parallel, we found little global correlation between changes in protein phosphorylation and protein abundance in both unstimulated and insulin-stimulated conditions, suggesting the contribution of protein abundance to phosphosite changes is likely minimal.</p>

<title>Animal details</title>
<p>Male C57BL/6J (C57Bl6J), BXH9/TyJ (BXH9), BXD34/TyJ (BXD34), and CAST/EiJ (CAST) mice were purchased from Australian BioResources (Moss Vale, NSW, Australia) while NOD/ShiLtJ (NOD) mice were purchased from Animal Resources Centre (Murdoch, WA, Australia). Mice were at most 9 weeks old upon arrival. Mice were housed at 23 °C on a 12 h light/dark cycle in cages of 2-5, with free access to food and water. At 12-16 weeks of age mice were randomly allocated to a standard CHOW diet (13% calories from fat, 65% from carbohydrate, 22% from protein; “Irradiated Rat and Mouse Diet”, Specialty Feeds, Glen Forrest, WA, Australia) or a high-fat high-sucrose diet made in house (HFD; 45% calories from fat (40% calories from lard), 35% from carbohydrate (14% calories from starch), and 22% from protein) and sacrificed exactly 6 weeks later. The number of mice in each group are C57Bl6J: 8 CHOW, 10 HFD; NOD: 10 CHOW, 10 HFD; BXH9: 8 CHOW, 9 HFD; CAST: 9 CHOW, 9 HFD; BXD34: 10 CHOW, 11 HFD.

<p>On the day of a glucose tolerance test mice were fasted for 6 h (0800-1400). Mice were then orally gavaged with 20% (w/v) glucose in water at 2 g/kg lean mass, and blood glucose was measured from the tail vein using a glucometer 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 min after the gavage. At 0 and 15 min, 5 µL blood was also collected into an Insulin Mouse Ultra-Sensitive ELISA plate (Crystal Chem USA, Elk Grove Village, Illinois, USA). Blood insulin concentration was measured according to the manufacturer’s protocol, using linear extrapolation from an insulin standard curve.

<p>On the day of the procedure mice were fasted for 2h (1100-1300). Mice were then anaesthetised by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital at 80 mg/kg body mass. To counter anaesthesia-associated declines in body temperature, mice were wrapped in aluminium foil and placed on a heating pad at 37°C. After 15 min anaesthesia, mice were injected retro-orbitally as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup> with 50 µL plasma replacement (B.

Blood glucose was measured from the tail vein using a glucometer (AccuCheck, Roche Diabetes Care, NSW, Australia) 1 min prior to injection and 1, 5, 7.5, and 10 min after injection. Simultaneously, 5 µL blood was collected into 95 µL 0.9% NaCl on ice to measure <sup>3</sup>H-2DG blood concentration. Ten minutes after insulin injection mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the soleus muscle was rapidly excised, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C. To measure <sup>3</sup>H-2DG blood concentration, diluted blood samples were first centrifuged at 10,000 xg for 10 min to pellet blood cells.

<title>Skeletal muscle lysis</title>
<p>Frozen muscle tissue was powdered by grinding in a mortar and pestle chilled with liquid nitrogen and dry ice. To lyse powdered tissue, 200 µL lysis buffer (4% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5) was added followed by 10 s vortexing.

<title>Identifying insulin-regulated phosphopeptides</title>
<p>To allow comparison across conditions, phosphopeptides were filtered for those highly quantified in most strain-diet combinations. For a given phosphopeptide, this filtering was performed on two levels. Firstly, each of the 10 strain-diet combinations were retained if there were ≥ 3 insulin-stimulated values and ≥ 3 unstimulated values. Then, the phosphopeptide itself was retained if ≥ 8 strain-diet combinations had passed the previously filtering. Phosphopeptides were then fit to a three-way ANOVA with all interaction terms (“aov” in the R package “stats”) and an F-test was performed assessing the main effect of insulin stimulation. To correct for multiple hypothesis testing p-values were converted into q-values (R package “qvalue”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>). The log2(insulin/unstimulated) fold change with the greatest magnitude across strain-diet combinations was then calculated (max log2(insulin/unstimulated)). Phosphopeptides were considered “insulin-regulated” when q &lt; 0.05 and if insulin increased or decreased phosphorylation by &gt; 1.5-fold in at least one strain-diet combination (max log2(insulin/unstimulated) &gt; 0.58 or &lt; -0.58).</p>

<p>For each insulin-regulated phosphopeptide a one-way ANOVA was performed modelling the insulin response as a function of mouse strain within the CHOW diet. p-values were converted to q-values. For significant phosphopeptides (q &lt; 0.05), t-tests were performed comparing the insulin response of C57Bl6J to each of the other four strains. t-test p-values were converted to q-values and considered significant when q &lt; 0.05. To ensure that significant differences between a strain and C57Bl6J were of a meaningful magnitude, the strain’s log2(insulin/unstimulated) was compared to the C57Bl6J log2(insulin/unstimulated). In general, if the absolute difference between the two was greater than 0.58 this was accepted. However, this threshold was decreased for phosphopeptides with weaker insulin regulation. Specifically, the difference was retained if it passed the following filtering:

<title>Uniform diet and StrainxDiet effects</title>
<p>For each insulin-regulated phosphopeptide a two-way ANOVA was performed modelling the insulin response as a function of strain, diet, and their interaction.

Whenever the StrainxDiet term was significant (q &lt; 0.05), additional tests were performed to identify specific strains in which the insulin response differed between CHOW and HFD. If the StrainxDiet term was not significant but the Diet term was significant, a separate filtering procedure was performed.</p>
<p>When the StrainxDiet term was significant, t-tests were performed to compare the CHOW insulin response to the HFD insulin response within each strain. When a t-test was significant (q &lt; 0.05), the log2(insulin/unstimulated) filtering procedure described for “Strain effects” was applied comparing CHOW and HFD fold changes. Insulin-regulated phosphopeptides were considered to have a “StrainxDiet effect” if there was a difference between CHOW and HFD in at least one strain.</p>
<p>When only the Diet term was significant, the log2(insulin/unstimulated) filtering procedure described for “Strain effects” was applied, comparing the mean log2(insulin/unstimulated) across strains within CHOW, to the mean across HFD.

<p>The extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) of GLUT4-HA-L6 cells myotubes was measured using Seahorse XFp miniplates and a Seahorse XF HS Mini Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience, Copenhagen, Denmark) as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. Cells incubated in palmitate or BSA control were washed twice with Krebs-Ringer Bicarbonate Buffer (Sigma, K4002) and once with standard cell culture media without bicarbonate (XF-DMEM, pH 7.4). Cells were then incubated in XF-DMEM without glucose at 37°C for 1 h in a non-CO2 incubator, followed by assaying in the XFp Analyzer. ECAR was measured after a 12-minute equilibration period followed by mix/wait/read cycles of 3/0/3 min. After stabilizing the baseline rates, compounds were injected to reach a final concentration of: 10 mM glucose, 5 μg/mL oligomycin, and 50 mM 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), allowing estimation of glucose-driven glycolysis (glucose ECAR - basal ECAR), glycolytic capacity (oligomycin ECAR - 2DG ECAR), and non-glycolytic acidification (equal to 2DG ECAR). Data were normalized to protein concentration and presented as a percentage of total ECAR.</p>

<title>2DG uptake in GLUT4-HA-L6 myotubes</title>
<p>2-deoxyglucose (2DG) uptake into GLUT4-HA-L6 myotubes was performed as previously described with modifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. Cells were incubated overnight in αMEM supplemented with either BSA-coupled 125 µM palmitic acid or BSA vehicle control before being washed 3x with 37 °C HEPES-buffered saline (HBS). Cells were then incubated in HBS supplemented with 10 µM unlabelled 2-deoxyglucose and either 0 or 100 nM insulin at 37°C for 15 min. Cells were then incubated for a further 5 min following the addition of 0.5 µCi/ml [<sup>3</sup>H]-2-deoxyglucose in HBS. Cells were then washed on ice 5x with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 1 M NaOH. For non-specific background uptake, 1 well per condition was pre-treated with cytochalasin B. Counts were determined by Perkin Elmer Quantulus GCT Liquid Scintillation Counter (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). 2DG uptake was expressed relatively to protein concentration as determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay after neutralisation with 1 M HCl and subtraction of non-specific uptake.</p>

<p>This <bold>fundamental</bold> study provides a unique tool for assessing the range of phosphorylation in insulin reactions due to genetic variation and dietary influence through the utilization of genetically distinct mouse strains. The discoveries of this study hold substantial importance, as they shed light on the interplay between genetic attributes and environmental conditions in shaping the insulin-signaling network within skeletal muscle, a crucial regulator of metabolism. The supporting evidence presented is <bold>compelling</bold>, and the work is anticipated to captivate a wide audience within the metabolism discipline due to its extensive appeal and by providing inspiration for further hypothesis-driven research.</p>

<p>The authors focused on genetic variability in relation to insulin resistance. They used genetically different lines of mice and exposed them to the same diet. They found that genetic predisposition impacts the overall outcome of metabolic disturbances. This work provides a fundamental novel view on the role of genetics and insulin resistance.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>

In the present study, van Gerwen et al. perform deep phosphoproteomics on muscle from saline or insulin-injected mice from 5 distinct strains fed a chow or HF/HS diet. The authors follow these data by defining a variety of intriguing genetic, dietary, or gene-by-diet phosphor-sites that respond to insulin accomplished through the application of correlation analyses, linear mixed models, and a module-based approach (WGCNA). These findings are supported by validation experiments by intersecting results with a previous profile of insulin-responsive sites (Humphrey et al, 2013) and importantly, mechanistic validation of Pfkfb3 where overexpression in L6 myotubes was sufficient to alter fatty acid-induced impairments in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. To my knowledge, this resource provides the most comprehensive quantification of muscle phospho-proteins which occur as a result of diet in strains of mice where genetic and dietary effects can be quantifiably attributed in an accurate manner. Utilization of this resource is strongly supported by the analyses provided highlighting the complexity of insulin signaling in muscle, exemplified by contrasts to the &quot;classically-used&quot; C57BL6/J strain. As it stands, I view this exceptional resource as comprehensive with compelling strength of evidence behind the mechanism explored. Therefore, most of my comments stem from curiosity about pathways within this resource, many of which are likely well beyond the scope of incorporation in the current manuscript. These include the integration of previous studies investigating these strains for changes in transcriptional or proteomic profiles and intersections with available human phospho-protein data, many of which have been generated by this group.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Generation of a novel resource to explore genetic and dietary interactions influencing the phospho-proteome in muscle. This is accompanied by the elegant application of in silico tools to highlight the utility.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Some specific aspects of integration with other data among the same fixed strains could be strengthened and/or discussed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors aimed to investigate how genetic and environmental factors influence the muscle insulin signaling network and its impact on metabolism. They utilized mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics to quantify phosphosites in the skeletal muscle of genetically distinct mouse strains in different dietary environments, with and without insulin stimulation. The results showed that genetic background and diet both affected insulin signaling, with almost half of the insulin-regulated phosphoproteome being modified by genetic background on an ordinary diet, and high-fat high-sugar feeding affecting insulin signaling in a strain-dependent manner.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The study uses state-of-the-art phosphoproteomics workflow allowing quantification of a large number of phosphosites in skeletal muscle, providing a comprehensive view of the muscle insulin signaling network. The study examined five genetically distinct mouse strains in two dietary environments, allowing for the investigation of the impact of genetic and environmental factors on insulin signaling. The identification of coregulated subnetworks within the insulin signaling pathway expanded our understanding of its organization and provided insights into potential regulatory mechanisms. The study associated diverse signaling responses with insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, uncovering regulators of muscle insulin responsiveness.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Different mouse strains have huge differences in body weight on normal and high-fat high-sugar diets, which makes comparison between the models challenging. The proteome of muscle across different strains is bound to be different but the changes in protein abundance on phosphosite changes were not assessed. Authors do get around this by calculating 'insulin response' because short insulin treatment should not affect protein abundance. The limitations acknowledged by the authors, such as the need for larger cohorts and the inclusion of female mice, suggest that further research is needed to validate and expand upon the findings.</p>
