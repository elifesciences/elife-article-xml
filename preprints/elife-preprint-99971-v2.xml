<title>Abstract</title><p>Flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) are a conserved family of xenobiotic enzymes upregulated in multiple longevity interventions, including nematode and mouse models. Previous work supports that <italic>C. elegans fmo-2</italic> promotes longevity, stress resistance, and healthspan by rewiring endogenous metabolism. However, there are five <italic>C. elegans</italic> FMOs and five mammalian FMOs, and it is not known whether promoting longevity and health benefits is a conserved role of this gene family. Here, we report that expression of <italic>C. elegans fmo-4</italic> promotes lifespan extension and paraquat stress resistance downstream of both dietary restriction and inhibition of mTOR. We find that overexpression of <italic>fmo-4</italic> in just the hypodermis is sufficient for these benefits, and that this expression significantly modifies the transcriptome. By analyzing changes in gene expression, we find that genes related to calcium signaling are significantly altered downstream of <italic>fmo-4</italic> expression. Highlighting the importance of calcium homeostasis in this pathway, <italic>fmo-4</italic> overexpressing animals are sensitive to thapsigargin, an ER stressor that inhibits calcium flux from the cytosol to the ER lumen. This calcium/<italic>fmo-4</italic> interaction is solidified by data showing that modulating intracellular calcium with either small molecules or genetics can change expression of <italic>fmo-4</italic> and/or interact with <italic>fmo-4</italic> to affect lifespan and stress resistance. Further analysis supports a pathway where <italic>fmo-4</italic> modulates calcium homeostasis downstream of activating transcription factor-6 (<italic>atf-6</italic>), whose knockdown induces and requires <italic>fmo-4</italic> expression. Together, our data identify <italic>fmo-4</italic> as a longevity-promoting gene whose actions interact with known longevity pathways and calcium homeostasis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Aging is a major risk factor for the onset of cancer, cardiovascular disease, dementia, and many other serious illnesses. Studying the aging process is crucial because a more comprehensive understanding can lead to the development of therapeutics that treat multiple diseases simultaneously. The use of model organisms, from yeast to mammals, has helped define genetic and environmental pathways that influence aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Many of these pathways, such as dietary restriction (DR), defined as a decrease in nutrient intake without malnutrition, involve active modification of metabolism that robustly and reproducibly improve health and longevity across species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Similarly, the response to oxygen deficiency, or hypoxic response, can lead to increased longevity, healthspan, and stress resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Interestingly, in <italic>C. elegans,</italic> both DR and the hypoxic response converge upon a single gene, <italic>fmo-2,</italic> that is necessary and sufficient to improve health and longevity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) are a family of enzymes that use oxygen and NADPH to oxygenate nucleophilic substrates. FMOs oxygenate a wide array of xenobiotic substrates and were discovered â¼50 years ago for their role in drug metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Consequently, a majority of published data on FMOs relate to this role. Recently, studies have begun to focus on the endogenous role(s) of FMOs. Results show that multiple mammalian FMO proteins are involved in systemic metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. We initially discovered a role for <italic>C. elegans fmo-2</italic> in regulating stress resistance and longevity downstream of DR and hypoxia and have continued to identify role(s) for FMO-2 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> metabolism and longevity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>However, the conserved mechanisms for FMO-mediated health benefits are still unclear, as are the roles of individual FMO enzymes. Thus, to best understand how FMOs could be leveraged to improve health, we need to understand the conserved mechanism of these enzymes in longevity and metabolism.</p>
<p>There are five <italic>C. elegans</italic> FMOs, and three of the five share significant structural overlap with mammalian FMOs. This overlap involves a predicted endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localization and a membrane spanning domain, which are each found in <italic>fmo-1, fmo-2</italic>, and <italic>fmo-4.</italic> In comparison to the more well-studied longevity gene <italic>fmo-2, fmo-4</italic> in particular shares 88% identity in the catalytic domain amino acids, suggesting that FMO-2 and FMO-4 may bind similar substrates and could plausibly have overlapping endogenous roles. Published data also show that DR induces both <italic>fmo-2</italic> and <italic>fmo-4</italic> gene expression, implying a role for <italic>fmo-4</italic> in longevity regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Based on this, we hypothesized that <italic>fmo-4</italic> may play a role in <italic>C. elegans</italic> longevity and that studying this role can help to understand this gene family and its relevance to aging.</p>
<p>FMOs are transmembrane enzymes thought to primarily reside in the ER. While mainly studied for its involvement in protein and lipid synthesis, the ER also plays a key role in metabolism and maintaining homeostasis within the cell. For instance, the ER responds to misfolded proteins by eliciting its unfolded protein response (UPR<sup>ER</sup>), thereby removing dysfunctional proteins and restoring homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. The ER is also responsible for storing and releasing calcium in a coordinated manner with the cytosol and mitochondria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. The ER establishes calcium homeostasis through processes involving 1) sequestering calcium in the lumen with the calreticulin chaperone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, 2) releasing calcium into the cytosol through the inositol triphosphate receptor (IP<sub>3</sub>R)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, and 3) bringing calcium into the ER lumen through the sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum ATPase (SERCA) pump<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the ERâs role in regulating metabolic and calcium homeostasis in the cell has recently been linked to longevity in <italic>C. elegans.</italic> Knocking out <underline>a</underline>ctivating transcription factor (<italic>atf</italic>)-6, one of the three branches of the UPR<sup>ER</sup>, modulates calcium signaling from the ER to the mitochondria, resulting in increased mitochondrial turnover and lifespan extension in <italic>C. elegans</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Given that 1) <italic>fmo-4</italic> is induced by a longevity-promoting pathway (DR), 2) <italic>fmo-4</italic> is predicted to be an ER transmembrane protein, and 3) the ERâs role in cellular homeostasis is linked to aging, we hypothesized that <italic>fmo-4</italic> regulates longevity by modulating ER-related processes. Here, we test this hypothesis by modifying <italic>fmo-4</italic> expression and interrogating interactions between <italic>fmo-4,</italic> stress resistance, longevity, and the ER. Our resulting data show that <italic>fmo-4</italic> promotes longevity and paraquat stress resistance downstream of mTOR and DR through calcium homeostasis. We find that not only is <italic>fmo-4</italic> a regulator of multiple longevity promoting pathways, but it is also sufficient to extend lifespan and confer paraquat stress resistance when overexpressed either ubiquitously or in the hypodermis. Transcriptomics data and stress assays reveal that calcium signaling is altered downstream of <italic>fmo-4</italic> expression, and that <italic>fmo-4</italic> interacts with calcium regulation between the ER and mitochondria to promote longevity and paraquat stress resistance. Together, these results establish <italic>fmo-4</italic> as a longevity promoting gene and provide evidence as to how <italic>fmo-4</italic> extends <italic>C. elegans</italic> lifespan through calcium-mediated ER to mitochondrial processes.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title><italic>Cefmo-4</italic> is required for DR and mTOR-mediated lifespan extension</title>
<p><italic>C. elegans fmo-4</italic> shares significant similarity to its family member and longevity gene, <italic>fmo-2,</italic> including 88% conservation in catalytic residues (Supplementary Fig 1), a transmembrane domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>) and predicted subcellular localization in the ER (Supplementary Fig 2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Additionally, <italic>fmo-4</italic> is induced by the longevity intervention DR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. These structural similarities and DR-mediated induction led us to hypothesize that <italic>fmo-4</italic> may play a role in aging. To test this, we first asked whether <italic>fmo-4</italic> is required for well-studied longevity pathways, including DR. We utilized <italic>fmo-4</italic>(<italic>ok294</italic>) knockout (KO) animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> on five conditions reported to extend lifespan in <italic>C. elegans.</italic> Since <italic>fmo-4</italic> is induced by dietary restriction, we started with fed and DR (sDR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>) conditions. Our results show that loss of <italic>fmo-4</italic> has no significant effect on control fed worms but prevents nearly all the lifespan extension seen under DR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). Wild-type (WT) worms on DR experience a â¼35% lifespan extension compared to fed WT worms, but when <italic>fmo-4</italic> is knocked out this extension is reduced to â¼10% and this interaction is significant by Cox regression (p-value &lt; 4.50e<sup>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>). These data support that <italic>fmo-4</italic> is required for the DR longevity pathway (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). Having established this role, we continued lifespan analyses of <italic>fmo-4</italic> KO worms exposed to RNAi knockdown of the S6-kinase gene <italic>rsks-1</italic> (mTOR signaling)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, the Von Hippel-Lindau gene <italic>vhl-1</italic> (hypoxic signaling)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, the insulin receptor <italic>daf-2</italic> (insulin-like signaling)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, and the cytochrome c reductase gene <italic>cyc-1</italic> (mitochondrial electron transport chain, cytochrome c reductase)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C-F</xref>). The resulting data show that <italic>fmo-4</italic> is fully required for <italic>rsks-1</italic>-mediated longevity as marked by a complete abrogation of the <italic>rsks-1</italic> RNAi lifespan extension when <italic>fmo-4</italic> is knocked out (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>), placing <italic>fmo-4</italic> downstream of mTOR. <italic>fmo-4</italic> was not required for the hypoxic response (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>), insulin-like signaling (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>), or cytochrome c reductase inhibition pathways (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>) to increase lifespan. It is notable that, unlike <italic>fmo-4, fmo-2</italic> is required for <italic>vhl-1</italic>-mediated longevity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. This result, coupled with <italic>fmo-4</italic> and <italic>fmo-2</italic> each being required for DR, suggests that these two genes in the same family are overlapping but distinct in their requirement. Together, these data suggest that <italic>fmo-4</italic> plays a necessary role in <italic>C. elegans</italic> longevity regulation downstream of at least two pathways: DR and mTOR signaling.</p>

<title><italic>fmo-4</italic> is required for <italic>fmo-2</italic>-mediated longevity, stress resistance, and healthspan</title>
<p>Having established that, like <italic>fmo-2, fmo-4</italic> is required for DR-mediated longevity, we next hypothesized that <italic>fmo-2</italic> and <italic>fmo-4</italic> may be acting in the same pathway. To test this, we crossed <italic>fmo-2</italic> overexpressing (OE) worms with <italic>fmo-4</italic> KO worms to create an <italic>fmo-2</italic> OE; <italic>fmo-4</italic> KO strain (<italic>fmo-2</italic>OE;4KO). We validated this strain via qPCR analysis (Supplementary Table 1). Upon measuring their lifespan compared to <italic>fmo-2</italic> OE animals, we find that knocking out <italic>fmo-4</italic> completely abrogates the lifespan extension from <italic>fmo-2</italic> OE (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). This result suggests that <italic>fmo-4</italic> is required for <italic>fmo-2-</italic>mediated longevity and thus may act downstream of <italic>fmo-2</italic> to promote longevity in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p>

<p>We previously showed that <italic>fmo-2</italic> OE is not just sufficient for lifespan extension but is also sufficient to promote resistance to multiple forms of stress, including oxidative stress (paraquat), heat stress, and ER stress (tunicamycin)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Since <italic>fmo-4</italic> is required for <italic>fmo-2-</italic> mediated longevity, we hypothesized that <italic>fmo-4</italic> would also be required for <italic>fmo-2-</italic>mediated stress resistance. Following exposure to 5mM paraquat, 37Â°C heat stress, or 5Âµg/mL tunicamycin, we find that the <italic>fmo-2</italic>OE;4KO worms survive similar to WT worms and are no longer resistant to these stresses (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B-D</xref>).

As <italic>fmo-4</italic> is required for both the lifespan extension and stress resistance observed with <italic>fmo-2</italic> OE, we hypothesized that <italic>fmo-4</italic> would also be required for <italic>fmo-2-</italic>mediated healthspan benefits. To test this, we measured the thrashing rate of <italic>fmo-2</italic> OE;4KO worms at day 2 and day 10 of adulthood.

<p>While being necessary for increased healthspan, lifespan, and stress resistance shows that <italic>fmo-4</italic> is required for these benefits, it does not test whether it can modulate aging directly. Therefore, to better understand <italic>fmo-4âs</italic> role in longevity and health, we next asked whether <italic>fmo-4</italic> is sufficient for lifespan extension, stress resistance, and healthspan benefits. We created a ubiquitous <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE worm strain with <italic>fmo-4</italic> expressed under the <italic>eft-3</italic> promoter via multicopy extrachromosomal array followed by random integration. qPCR analysis shows that <italic>fmo-4</italic> is overexpressed â¼150 fold over WT in the ubiquitous <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE worms (Supplementary Table 1), and their development time is slightly (â¼1.5 hours) but statistically significantly delayed compared to WT (Supplementary Fig 3).

<p>Increased longevity is frequently observed in tandem with increased healthspan and resistance to toxic stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. We assessed the healthspan of the ubiquitous <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE worms at days 2 and 10 of adulthood by measuring thrashing rates (movement). We find that ubiquitous <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE is sufficient for an improvement (p = 0.011) in healthspan benefits with age (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B- C</xref>). We next measured the stress resistance of the ubiquitous <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE worms to 5mM paraquat (oxidative stress), 37Â°C heat stress, 5Âµg/mL of tunicamycin (ER glycosylation stress), and 1mg/mL thapsigargin (ER calcium stress). We included two ER stresses because FMO-4 is predicted to be an ER transmembrane protein. We find that ubiquitous <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE is sufficient to convey paraquat stress resistance (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>) but does not offer any protection from heat (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>) or tunicamycin stress (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F</xref>). Interestingly, ubiquitous <italic>fmo-4</italic> overexpressing animals are sensitive to thapsigargin, as shown by the wormsâ significantly diminished size and inability to develop compared to WT control worms (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3G-J</xref>). These results suggest a narrow stress resistance and even some sensitivity for <italic>fmo-4</italic> in comparison to other longevity genes. To test whether <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE would interact with <italic>fmo-2</italic> OE, we combined the strains and measured their stress resistance. We find that the <italic>fmo-2</italic> OE strain is still resistant to paraquat, heat, and tunicamycin stress in the presence of increased <italic>fmo-4,</italic> suggesting that overexpression of <italic>fmo-4</italic> does not affect resistance to these stresses (Supplementary Fig 4B-D). Interestingly, the <italic>fmo-2</italic> OE strain is sensitive to thapsigargin stress in the presence of increased <italic>fmo-4,</italic> suggesting that <italic>fmo-4</italic> likely also acts downstream of <italic>fmo-2</italic> in this stress pathway (Supplementary Fig 4E-I). Overall, these results suggest that <italic>fmo-4</italic> 1) is sufficient to improve healthspan, 2) is both necessary and sufficient to promote paraquat resistance, 3) is necessary but not sufficient to improve heat and tunicamycin resistance, and 4) promotes sensitivity to calcium-mediated ER stress from thapsigargin. As expected under the hypothesis that <italic>fmo-4</italic> acts downstream of <italic>fmo- 2,</italic> the <italic>fmo-4</italic>OE;2KO strain phenocopies the <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE strain in all stress assays (Supplementary Fig 5B-I).

<title>Hypodermal overexpression of <italic>fmo-4</italic> is sufficient for longevity and paraquat resistance</title>
<p>While using the ubiquitous overexpressing worm strain is helpful to probe into <italic>fmo-4âs</italic> involvement in longevity, stress resistance, and healthspan, it is also important to note that <italic>fmo-4</italic> is normally localized and expressed primarily in the hypodermis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A-C</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>.

We measured lifespan, resistance to paraquat, heat, tunicamycin and thapsigargin stress, as well as healthspan of the hypodermal-specific <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE worms (<italic>fmo-4</italic> OE<sup>Hyp</sup>). We find that the <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE<sup>Hyp</sup> strain exhibits a lifespan extension (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>), resistance to paraquat (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>) but not heat or tunicamycin stress (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4F-G</xref>), and sensitivity to thapsigargin stress (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4H-J</xref>). However, the <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE<sup>Hyp</sup> strain did not have a statistically significant effect on healthspan unlike the ubiquitous <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE strain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4K-L</xref>).

<title><italic>fmo-4</italic> OE transcriptomics reveal a link to calcium regulation</title>
<p>To identify the downstream effects of <italic>fmo-4</italic> expression, we analyzed the transcriptome of <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE animals and compared them with control animals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). Based on a p-value of &lt; 0.05, we find â¼800 transcripts are upregulated and â¼500 transcripts are downregulated when <italic>fmo-4</italic> is overexpressed (Supplemental Data 1). Of the upregulated and downregulated transcripts unique to the <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE profile, we noticed that some of the significant pathways include transcription, Wnt signaling, TGFÎ² signaling, protein processing in the ER, and other subsets of signaling, as determined by the <bold><underline>D</underline></bold>atabase for <bold><underline>A</underline></bold>nnotation, <bold><underline>V</underline></bold>isualization and <bold>I</bold>ntegrated <bold><underline>D</underline></bold>iscovery (DAVID) Functional Annotation Bioinformatics Microarray Analysis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). Based on its known role as a xenobiotic enzyme, we were intrigued to find that <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE is modulating signaling pathways. We were further intrigued to find that one of the signaling pathways affected by <italic>fmo-4</italic> is calcium signaling (Supplementary Table 2). This was interesting considering that <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE worms are sensitive to thapsigargin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3G-J</xref>), implicating an interaction between calcium signaling and <italic>fmo-4</italic>. To further verify this possibility, we used another tool called PANTHER Classification System Protein Class, which identified FMO-4 as a putative transmembrane signal receptor (G-protein coupled receptor), ion transporter, and/or calcium-binding protein (Supplemental Data 2). Together, these results support the possibility that FMO-4 is involved in calcium-related processes.</p>

<p>To begin exploring this interaction, we determined how changes in intracellular calcium levels impact <italic>fmo-4</italic> expression and lifespan. We first manipulated calcium levels by supplementing the acetylcholine agonist, carbachol. Carbachol activates acetylcholine receptors, increasing overall intracellular calcium levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. We first validated that carbachol increases calcium levels by utilizing worms that neuronally express the calcium indicator GCaMP7f (SWF702)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. When these worms were exposed to 300ÂµM carbachol, a significant increase in GFP fluorescence was reported, indicating an increase in calcium levels (Supplementary Fig 6A-D). We then measured <italic>fmo-4</italic> gene expression upon exposure to carbachol using an <italic>fmo-4p::mCherry</italic> transcriptional reporter strain. Interestingly, we find that supplementation of 300ÂµM carbachol induces <italic>fmo-4</italic> promoter expression fluorescence nearly 2- fold over a water control (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B-C</xref>). This was similar to the level of induction of <italic>fmo-4</italic> in fasted (DR-like) conditions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B-C</xref>). We postulate that <italic>fmo-4</italic> is induced by carbachol because increased intracellular calcium activates <italic>fmo-4</italic> gene expression. Since carbachol supplementation induces <italic>fmo-4</italic>, we hypothesized that carbachol may affect lifespan and would interact with <italic>fmo-4</italic>. We measured lifespan of worms supplemented with 50ÂµM carbachol and find that while WT lifespan is significantly extended by carbachol, this extension is not additive with <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>), and requires <italic>fmo-4,</italic> as the <italic>fmo-4</italic> KO is shorter-lived when exposed to carbachol (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>).</p>
<p>To test whether reducing calcium has an opposing effect to increasing it, we utilized <underline>E</underline>thylene<underline>D</underline>iamine<underline>T</underline>etra<underline>A</underline>cetic acid (EDTA) to deplete calcium levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. We validated that EDTA depletes calcium levels by exposing GCaMP7f expressing worms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> to 10mM EDTA and we observed a significant decrease in GFP fluorescence, indicating a decrease in calcium levels (Supplementary Fig 6A-B, E-F). Then, we placed <italic>fmo-4p::mCherry</italic> reporter worms on plates containing 10mM EDTA and measured fluorescence. Surprisingly, we find that EDTA also significantly induces <italic>fmo-4</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B-C</xref>). We then assessed the survival of WT, <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE and KO worms on plates supplemented with 50ÂµM EDTA. We find that EDTA significantly extends WT lifespan without further extending <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE lifespan (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F</xref>), while shortening the lifespan of <italic>fmo-4</italic> KO animals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5G</xref>). Overall, these data suggest that <italic>fmo-4</italic> is highly sensitive to changing calcium levels in either direction, and that both increasing and depleting calcium 1) induces <italic>fmo-4,</italic> 2) extends WT lifespan, 3) is not additive with <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE lifespan, and 4) is deleterious to <italic>fmo-4</italic> KO animals. Thus, these results support an interaction between <italic>fmo-4</italic> and calcium signaling.</p>

<title><italic>fmo-4</italic> genetically interacts with calcium signaling to promote longevity and paraquat resistance</title>
<p>Having established an interaction between <italic>fmo-4</italic> and calcium perturbations, we next asked if <italic>fmo-4</italic> interacts with genes involved in calcium signaling. These genes include calreticulin (<italic>crt-1</italic>), inositol triphosphate receptor (IP<sub>3</sub>R, <italic>itr-1</italic>), and the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (<italic>mcu-1</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Calreticulin is responsible for binding and sequestering calcium in the ER lumen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. It was previously shown that FMO protein extracted from rabbit lung can form a complex with calreticulin, suggesting a physical interaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. When testing for genetic interactions between <italic>crt-1</italic> and <italic>fmo-4,</italic> we find that <italic>crt-1</italic> RNAi extends WT lifespan, as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, and that this lifespan extension is not additive with <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). Treating <italic>fmo- 4</italic> KO worms with <italic>crt-1</italic> RNAi can significantly extend lifespan (Supplementary Fig 7A), but this result was inconsistent (Supplemental Data 3). Overall, this suggests that <italic>fmo-4</italic> and <italic>crt-1</italic> are acting in the same genetic pathway. IP<sub>3</sub>R, or <italic>itr-1</italic> in <italic>C. elegans,</italic> is located in the ER membrane and is critical for exporting calcium from the ER lumen into the cytosol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Previous results suggest that loss of <italic>itr-1</italic> decreases WT lifespan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, which our results confirm (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). Importantly, we also find that <italic>itr-1</italic> RNAi decreases lifespan of <italic>fmo-4</italic> KO worms similarly (Supplementary Fig 7B) and <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>) worms to a greater extent than WT, negating the relative longevity of <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE worms compared to WT. Thus, <italic>itr-1</italic> is required to increase lifespan downstream of <italic>fmo-4.</italic> MCU (<italic>mcu-</italic>1) is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and allows cytosolic calcium into the inner mitochondrial matrix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>.

The <italic>fmo-4</italic> KO lifespan is slightly decreased on <italic>mcu-1</italic> RNAi (Supplementary Fig 7C).

Interestingly, we find that <italic>crt-1</italic> RNAi promotes resistance in WT worms and this effect is not additive in <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE worms (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>). Further, <italic>crt-1</italic> RNAi extends the lifespan of <italic>fmo-4</italic> KO worms (Supplementary Fig 7D), suggesting that <italic>crt-1</italic> and <italic>fmo-4</italic> act in the same pathway and that <italic>crt-1</italic> may act downstream of <italic>fmo-4</italic> to promote paraquat stress resistance. Neither <italic>itr-1</italic> RNAi nor <italic>mcu-1</italic> RNAi confers resistance to paraquat, and <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE resistance is lost when exposed to these RNAi (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E-F</xref>). The <italic>fmo-4</italic> KO worms show a decrease in paraquat survival when treated with <italic>itr-1</italic> and <italic>mcu-1</italic> RNAi (Supplementary Fig 7E-F). We also measured paraquat stress resistance of <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE and KO worms exposed to RNAi of the voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (<italic>vdac-1</italic>), which is located in the outer mitochondrial membrane and also regulates calcium flow into and out of the mitochondria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Interestingly, <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE resistance is lost when exposed to <italic>vdac-1</italic> RNAi and the <italic>fmo-4</italic> KO worms show no difference in paraquat survival compared to the EV RNAi control (Supplementary Fig 7G-H). These data support a model where <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE converges onto a shared pathway mediating paraquat stress resistance and longevity regulation. Together, we conclude that <italic>fmo-4</italic> interacts with ER to mitochondrial calcium signaling through <italic>crt-1, itr-1,</italic> and <italic>mcu-1,</italic> to promote longevity and paraquat stress resistance.</p>

<title><italic>atf-6</italic> KD regulates <italic>fmo-4</italic>-mediated longevity and paraquat resistance</title>
<p>Our data establish that <italic>fmo-4</italic> interacts with ER and mitochondrial calcium signaling to promote lifespan extension and resistance to paraquat. A previous study linked many of these components to a major regulator of UPR<sup>ER</sup>, activating transcription factor-6 (<italic>atf-6</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. When <italic>atf-6</italic> is lost, lifespan is extended through changes in calcium signaling between the ER and mitochondria requiring <italic>crt-1, itr-1</italic> and <italic>mcu-1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Based on our transcriptomics data and <italic>fmo-4âs</italic> interactions with calcium signaling genes, we hypothesized that <italic>fmo-4</italic> could interact with <italic>atf-6</italic> to promote longevity and paraquat resistance. To test whether <italic>atf-6</italic> is regulating <italic>fmo-4,</italic> we utilized our <italic>fmo-4p::mCherry</italic> transcriptional reporter strain. We measured <italic>fmo-4</italic> gene expression after RNAi knockdown of <italic>atf-6</italic> and find that <italic>fmo-4p::mCherry</italic> worms on <italic>atf-6</italic> RNAi show a consistentâ¼2-fold increase in fluorescence (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A-B</xref>), similar to what we observe from calcium perturbations (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B-C</xref>). Since <italic>atf-6</italic> is one of three branches of UPR<sup>ER</sup>, we were curious to see if <italic>fmo-4</italic> interacts specifically with <italic>atf-6</italic> or also with the other two branches, <italic>ire-1</italic>/<italic>xbp-1</italic> and <italic>pek-1</italic>/<italic>atf-4</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. We treated the <italic>fmo-4p::mCherry</italic> reporter worms with <italic>ire-1, xbp-1, pek-1,</italic> or <italic>atf-4</italic> RNAi and measured fluorescence. We find that knocking down the components of the IRE-1 or PEK-1 branches does not induce <italic>fmo-4</italic> gene expression (Supplementary Fig 8A-B).

<p>We hypothesized that <italic>atf-6</italic> limits <italic>fmo-4</italic> expression and thus <italic>fmo-4</italic> acts downstream of <italic>atf-6</italic> knockdown to modulate lifespan extension. To test this, we assessed survival and find that while <italic>atf-6</italic> RNAi extends the lifespan of WT worms, as reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, this effect is abrogated when <italic>fmo-4</italic> is knocked out (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C</xref>). This result suggests that <italic>fmo-4</italic> is indeed acting downstream of <italic>atf-6</italic> to promote longevity. To determine if <italic>atf-6</italic> is also involved in <italic>fmo-4-</italic>mediated paraquat resistance, we exposed WT and <italic>fmo-4</italic> KO worms to 5mM paraquat plates with <italic>atf-6</italic> RNAi. We find that <italic>atf-6</italic> RNAi promotes stress resistance to paraquat, but this effect is lost when <italic>fmo-4</italic> is knocked out, supporting the hypothesis that <italic>atf-6</italic> is involved in <italic>fmo-4-</italic>mediated paraquat resistance (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7D</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Together, our data present a model where <italic>fmo-4</italic> acts downstream of DR and mTOR to positively affect healthspan and longevity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B-C</xref>). <italic>fmo-4</italic> overexpression is sufficient to provide these benefits (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>) and does not require the DR-mediating family member, <italic>fmo-2</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Our results also suggest that <italic>fmo-4</italic> gene expression is upregulated upon changes in intracellular calcium, and that <italic>fmo-4</italic> interacts with calcium signaling through key genes like <italic>crt-1, itr-1,</italic> and <italic>mcu-1</italic>, to promote longevity and paraquat stress resistance (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>-<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The relationship between <italic>fmo-4</italic> and calcium is further illustrated by <italic>fmo-4</italic> OEâs susceptibility to thapsigargin, a calcium-mediated ER stress. Furthermore, we find that knocking down the UPR<sup>ER</sup> transcription factor and calcium regulator, <italic>atf-6,</italic> induces <italic>fmo-4</italic> gene expression and requires <italic>fmo-4</italic> to promote longevity (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). Collectively, our data suggest that <italic>fmo-4</italic> promotes longevity and paraquat stress resistance by regulating calcium homeostasis between the ER and mitochondria (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7E</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies from our lab have elucidated how <italic>C. elegans fmo-2</italic> promotes longevity through endogenous metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Based on the conservation within the <italic>fmo</italic> gene family and that multiple Fmos are induced in long-lived worms and mammals, it was reasonable to hypothesize that Fmos could play overlapping roles in longevity regulation. Our data here support the broader hypothesis that Fmos have a conserved role in aging, but interestingly, that the mechanisms by which they modulate aging are separable. Importantly, we find that <italic>fmo-4</italic> is required for multiple longevity-promoting pathways, including DR and mTOR, but is not required for lifespan extension through the hypoxic response, insulin-like signaling, or cytochrome c reductase pathways. We also find that <italic>fmo-4</italic> does not require <italic>fmo-2,</italic> but that <italic>fmo-2</italic> does require <italic>fmo-4.</italic> This is interesting because not only do these data tell us that <italic>fmo-4</italic> is important in the context of longevity, but also that it acts distinctly from <italic>fmo-2</italic>.</p>
<p>After creating ubiquitous and hypodermal-specific <italic>fmo-4</italic> overexpressing strains, we find that <italic>fmo-4</italic> is sufficient for longevity and paraquat stress resistance but not heat, tunicamycin, or thapsigargin stress. These results further differentiate <italic>fmo-4</italic> from <italic>fmo-2</italic> and also provide insight into <italic>fmo-4âs</italic> potential roles in the cell. For instance, <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE wormsâ resistance to paraquat could suggest a role in responding to or controlling reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the mitochondria. Additionally, <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE wormsâ sensitivity to thapsigargin likely points towards an involvement in ER calcium regulation. These are both interesting plausible roles for <italic>fmo-4,</italic> and may go hand in hand, as calcium levels are known to impact ROS levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, and changes in ROS levels are known to impact ER calcium release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Based on this and the data with calcium perturbations, we speculate that FMO-4 acts as a calcium sensor, and when calcium levels are too high or too low, FMO-4 responds by regulating downstream calcium signaling proteins to restore homeostasis in the cell. As FMO-4 is a predicted ER transmembrane protein, we hypothesize that FMO-4 is sensing changes in calcium levels in the ER and/or cytosol.</p>
<p>We note that our data reveal genetic interactions between <italic>fmo-4</italic> and other longevity pathways like DR, mTOR, FMO-2, and ATF-6. However, it is important to also understand on the protein level how FMO-4 is interacting with these pathways and how FMO-4 is regulating downstream calcium signaling components to promote longevity and paraquat stress resistance. For instance, it was previously shown that rabbit FMO protein forms a complex with calreticulin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. It is possible that an increase in FMO-4 leads to more binding between FMO-4 and calreticulin, which ultimately prevents calreticulin from binding ER calcium. This would then allow for proper calcium flux from the ER to the mitochondria via the IP<sub>3</sub>R and MCU, respectively. Our future work will look into these protein interactions so that we can further tease apart the FMO-4-mediated longevity pathway. We also note that we have utilized RNAi knockdown rather than knockout mutants to assess these genetic interactions with <italic>fmo-4.</italic> In particular, we were wary of knocking out crucial calcium regulating genes, like <italic>itr-1</italic> and <italic>mcu-1,</italic> that already result in some level of sickness in the worms when knocked down (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>) or could potentially lead to other confounding metabolic changes if knocked out. We were able to obtain robust and reproducible results using RNAi knockdown, but recognize the caveats that come with not testing full deletion mutants.</p>
<p>While our transcriptomics analysis and calcium manipulations suggest <italic>fmo-4</italic> involvement in calcium regulation, there are other measures that can better assess an interaction between <italic>fmo-4</italic> and calcium. Carbachol and EDTA supplementation are not perfect assessments of altered calcium levels, as carbachol does not act in every tissue and EDTA may be depleting more than just calcium from the cell. Thus, future studies should measure calcium levels and calcium flux in <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE and KO worms using GCaMP expressing worms to determine the direct link between <italic>fmo-4</italic> expression and calcium in the cell. Additionally, to determine if FMO-4 is acting as a calcium sensor or interacting with one to regulate calcium homeostasis, development of FMO-4 antibodies for immunoprecipitation assays would be useful<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Together, it will be important to establish the biochemical parameters of the FMO-4 calcium interaction.</p>
<p>As calcium signaling occurs between the ER and the mitochondria, our results could have interesting implications in ER-mitochondrial metabolism. We would expect that FMO-4 regulates ER-mitochondria metabolism because 1) FMO-4 is a predicted ER transmembrane protein and blocking the expression of another ER transmembrane protein, ATF-6, induces the expression of <italic>fmo-4</italic>, 2) <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE worms are highly sensitive to ER calcium stress but resistant to ROS induced stress, 3) lifespan extension driven by <italic>fmo-4</italic> depends on mitochondrial calcium import (<italic>mcu-1</italic>), and 4) Fmo gene expression is induced by mitochondrial inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Additionally, changes in mitochondrial calcium import affect various mitochondrial measures like respiration, dynamics (i.e., fission and fusion), membrane potential, and TCA cycle activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Future studies will delve into how <italic>fmo-4</italic> perturbations impact each of these measures and if they act in the <italic>fmo-4-</italic>mediated longevity pathway. Based on our data, we speculate that <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE may increase mitochondrial calcium by regulating <italic>mcu-1</italic> activity, and that <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE worms may in turn be regulating ROS production in the mitochondria. We hypothesize that changes in <italic>fmo-4</italic> expression will alter mitochondrial respiration, dynamics, membrane potential, and TCA cycle activity. Taken together, future experiments will shed light on the role that FMOs play in calcium regulation and mitochondrial metabolism and will help to further tease apart the FMO- mediated longevity pathway.</p>

<p>Gravid <italic>fmo-4p::mCherry</italic> transcriptional reporter adult animals were placed on NGM plates containing 1mM Î²-D-isothiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), 25 Î¼g/ml carbenicillin, and the corresponding RNAi clone from the Vidal or Ahringer RNAi library. After 3 hours, the adults were removed, and the eggs were allowed to develop at 20Â°C until they reached late L4/young adult stage. Then 40-50 worms per plate were transferred to similar plates that contain FUdR for overnight. The following day, â¼20 worms per condition were picked off these plates, added to a 2% agarose pad on a glass slide, anesthetized in 0.5M sodium azide (Sigma), and imaged at 6.3x magnification with the LASx software and Leica scope using the mCherry fluorescence channel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Three replicates were performed. Fluorescent intensity in the mCherry channel was measured in ImageJ. Brightness of images within a dataset was increased to the same level. Data were analyzed in GraphPad Prism using unpaired two-tailed t tests with Welchâs correction.</p>

<p>Log-rank test was used to derive p-value for lifespan and stress resistance survival assays using p &lt; 0.05 cut-off threshold compared to EV or wild-type controls. Cox regression was also used to assess interactions between genotype and condition for lifespans and stress resistance survival assays using p &lt; 0.01 cut-off threshold compared to controls. Supplemental Data 3 provide the results of the Log-rank test and Cox regression analysis, which were run in RStudio.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This interesting and well-written article by Tuckowski et al. summarizes work connecting the flavin-containing monooxygenase FMO-4 with increased lifespan through a mechanism involving calcium signaling in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.</p>
<p>The authors have previously studied another fmo in worms, FMO-2, prompting them to look at additional members of this family of proteins. They show that fmo-4 is up in dietary restricted worms and necessary for the increased lifespan of these animals as well as of rsks-1 (s6 kinase) knockdown animals. They then show that overexpression of fmo-4 is sufficient to significantly increase lifespan, as well as healthspan and paraquat resistance. Further, they demonstrate that overexpression of fmo-4 solely in the hypodermis of the animal recapitulates the entire effect of fmo-4 OE.</p>
<p>In terms of interactions between fmo-2 and fmo-4 they show that fmo-4 is necessary for the previously reported effects of fmo-2 on lifespan, while the effects of fmo-4 do not depend on fmo-2.</p>
<p>Next the authors use RNASeq to compare fmo-4 OE animals to wild type. Their analyses suggested the possibility that FMO-4 was modulating calcium signaling, and through additional experiments specifically identified the calcium signaling genes crt-1, itr-1, and mcu-1 as important fmo-4 interactors in this context. As previously published work has shown that loss of the worm transcription factor atf-6 can extend lifespan through crt-1, itr-1 and mcu-1, the authors asked about interactions between fmo-4 and atf-6. They showed that fmo-4 is necessary for both lifespan extension and increased paraquat resistance upon RNAi knockdown of atf-6.</p>
<p>Overall this clearly written manuscript summarizes interesting and novel findings of great interest in the biology of aging, and suggests promising avenues for future work in this area.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This paper contains a large number of careful, well executed and analysed experiments in support of its existing conclusions, and which also point toward significant future directions for this work. In addition it is clear and very well written.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Within the scope of the current work there are no major weaknesses. That said, the authors themselves note pressing questions beyond the scope of this study that remain unanswered. For instance, the mechanistic nature of the interactions between FMO-4 and the other players in this story, for example in terms of direct protein-protein interactions, is not at all understood yet. Further, powerful tools such as GCaMP expressing animals will enable a much more detailed understanding of what exactly is happening to calcium levels, and where and when it is happening, in these animals.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Members of a conserved family of flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) play key roles in lifespan extension induced by diet restriction and hypoxia. In C. elegans, fmo-2 has received the majority of attention, but there are multiple fmo genes in both worms and mammals, and how overlapping or distinct the functional roles of these paralogs are remains unclear. Here Tuckowski et al. identify that a new family member, fmo-4, is also a positive modulator of lifespan. Based on differential requirements of fmo-2 and fmo-4 in stress resistance and lifespan extension paradigms, however, the authors conclude that fmo-4 acts through mechanisms that are distinct from fmo-2. Ultimately, the authors place fmo-2 genetically within a pathway involving atf-6, calreticulin, the IP3 receptor, and mitochondrial calcium uniporter, which was previously shown to link ER calcium homeostasis to mitochondrial homeostasis and longevity. The authors thus achieve their overarching aim to reveal that different FMO family members regulate stress resistance and lifespan through distinct mechanisms. Furthermore, because the known enzymatic activity of FMOs involves oxygenating xenobiotic and endogenous metabolites, these findings highlight a potential new link between redox/metabolic homeostasis and ER-mitochondrial calcium signaling.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors demonstrate links between multiple conserved life-extending signaling pathways and fmo-4, expanding both the significance and mechanistic diversity of FMO-family genes in aging and stress biology.</p>
<p>The authors use genetics to discover an interesting and unanticipated new link between FMOs and calcium pathways known to regulate lifespan.</p>
<p>The genetic epistasis patterns for lifespan and stress resistance phenotypes are generally clean and compelling.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors achieve a necessary and valuable first step with regard to linking FMO-4 to calcium homeostasis, but the mechanisms involved remain preliminary at this stage. Specifically, the genetic interactions between fmo-4 and conserved mediators of calcium transport and signaling are convincing, but a putative molecular mechanism by which the activity of FMO-4 would alter subcellular calcium transport remains unclear and potentially indirect. The authors effectively highlight this gap as a key pursuit for subsequent studies.</p>
<p>The authors have shown that carbachol and EDTA produce the expected effects on a cytosolic calcium reporter in neurons, supporting the utility of the chemical approach in general, but validating that carbachol, EDTA and fmo-4 itself have an impact on calcium in the tissues and subcellular compartments relevant to the lifespan phenotypes would still be valuable in supporting the overall model. Notably, however, the hypodermal-specific role of FMO-4 suggests potential cell non-autonomous regulation of lifespan, such that this pathway may ultimately involve complex inter-cellular signaling that would necessitate substantially more time and effort.</p>
<p>Employing mutants and more sophisticated genetic tools for modulating calcium transport or signaling (in addition to RNAi) would strengthen key conclusions and/or help to elucidate tissue- or age-specific aspects of the proposed mechanism.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors assessed the potential involvement of fmo-4 in a diverse set of longevity interventions, showing that this gene is required for DR and S6 kinase knockdown related lifespan extension. Using comprehensive epistasis experiments they find this gene to be a required downstream player in the longevity and stress resistance provided by fmo-2 overexpression. They further showed that fmo-4 ubiquitous overexpression is sufficient to provide longevity and paraquat (mitochondrial) stress resistance, and that overexpression specifically in the hypodermis is sufficient to recapitulate most of these effects.</p>
<p>Interestingly, they find that fmo-4 overexpression sensitizes worms to thapsigargin during development, an effect that they link with a potential dysregulation in calcium signalling. They go on to show that fmo-4 expression is sensitive to drugs that both increase or decrease calcium levels, and these drugs differentially affect lifespan of fmo-4 mutants compared to wild-type worms. Similarly, knockdown of genes involved in calcium binding and signalling also differentially affect lifespan and paraquat resistance of fmo-4 mutants.</p>
<p>Finally, they suggest that atf-6 limits the expression of fmo-4, and that fmo-4 is also acting downstream of benefits produced by atf-6 knockdown.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>â¢ comprehensive lifespans experiments: clear placement of fmo-4 within established longevity interventions.</p>
<p>
â¢ clear distinction in functions and epistatic interactions between fmo-2 and fmo-4 which lays a strong foundation for a longevity pathway regulated by this enzyme family.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>â¢ no obvious transcriptomic evidence supporting a link between fmo-4 and calcium signalling: either for knockout worms or fmo-4 overexpressing strains.</p>
<p>
â¢ no direct measures of alterations in calcium flux, signalling or binding that strongly support a connection with fmo-4.</p>
<p>
â¢ no measures of mitochondrial morphology or activity that strongly support a connection with fmo-4.</p>
<p>
â¢ lack of a complete model that places fmo-4 function downstream of DR and mTOR signalling (first Results section), fmo-2 (second Results section) and at the same time explains connection with calcium signalling.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The authors have addressed and fixed all the private comments we had made. In terms of the public comments, I think nothing has changed in terms of strengths and weaknesses. They have multiple independent results (drugs, RNAi and transcriptomics) that suggest a connection between fmo-4 and calcium regulation, but there is no strong evidence for what this connection is. The work still lacks direct measures of calcium, ER or mitochondrial function in relation to fmo-4 (which they acknowledge in the discussion). The first four sections strongly place fmo-4 within established longevity interventions, but their model doesn't explain how calcium regulation would fit into these.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer 1:</bold></p>
<p>Comment 1: Within the scope of the current work there are no major weaknesses. That said, the authors themselves note pressing questions beyond the scope of this study that remain unanswered. For instance, the mechanistic nature of the interactions between FMO-4 and the other players in this story, for example in terms of direct protein-protein interactions, is not at all understood yet.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the positive review, and fully agree and acknowledge that there are unanswered questions for future studies that are beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer 2:</bold></p>
<p>Comment 1: The effects of carbachol and EDTA on intracellular calcium levels are inferred, especially in the tissues where fmo-4 is acting. Validating that these agents and fmo-4 itself have an impact on calcium in relevant subcellular compartments is important to support conclusions on how fmo-4 regulates and responds to calcium.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this important suggestion. We agree that carbachol and EDTA can be broad agents and validating that they are altering calcium levels is very useful. While this is technically challenging, we attempted to address this by using neuronally expressed GCaMP7f calcium indicator worms and measuring their GFP fluorescence upon exposure to carbachol and EDTA. Assessing both short term and long term exposure to these agents, we were able to show that carbachol increases GFP fluorescence, indicating an increase in calcium levels, and EDTA decreases GFP fluorescence, indicating a decrease in calcium levels. Unfortunately, because FMO-4 is not neuronally expressed, we were not able to test the effects of FMO-4 on calcium in this strain, which would require hypodermal expression and possibly short-term modification of <italic>fmo-4</italic> expression to test. We have made sure to temper our language about the indirect measures we used.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 2: Experiments are generally reliant on RNAi. While in most cases experiments reveal positive results, indicating RNAi efficacy, key conclusions could be strengthened with the incorporation of mutants.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate and value this suggestion and agree that mutants could be helpful to strengthen our conclusions. We address this caveat in the discussion of the revised manuscript. We explain that we were concerned about knocking out key calcium regulating genes like <italic>itr-1</italic> and <italic>mcu-1</italic> that either already result in some level of sickness in the worms when knocked down (<italic>itr-1</italic>) or could lead to confounding metabolic changes if knocked out. We do find that our RNAi lifespan results are robust and reproducible, but we also understand and recognize the caveats that come with using RNAi knockdown instead of full deletion mutants.</p>

<p>Comment 1: no obvious transcriptomic evidence supporting a link between fmo-4 and calcium signaling: either for knockout worms or fmo-4 overexpressing strains.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this feedback. While there is some transcriptomic evidence, we agree that it is not overwhelming evidence. We do think that this evidence, combined with the phenotype observed under thapsigargin (i.e., significant reduction in worm size and significant delay or prevention of development), in addition to the genetic connections to calcium regulation, provide additional compelling evidence that FMO-4 interacts with calcium signaling.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 2: no direct measures of alterations in calcium flux, signalling or binding that strongly support a connection with fmo-4.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As described in reviewer 2 comment 1, we have successfully used GCaMP7f worms to assess calcium flux upon exposure to carbachol and EDTA. This approach confirmed the changes in calcium expected from these compounds. Unfortunately, because FMO-4 is not neuronally expressed, we were not able to test the effects of FMO-4 on calcium in this strain, which would require hypodermal expression and possibly short-term modification of <italic>fmo-4</italic> expression to test. We have made sure to temper our language about the indirect measures we used.</p>

<p>Comment 3: no measures of mitochondrial morphology or activity that strongly support a connection with fmo-4.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a great point, and something we are currently working on to include for a future manuscript.</p>

<p>Comment 4: lack of a complete model that places fmo-4 function downstream of DR and mTOR signalling (first Results section), fmo-2 (second Results section) and at the same time explains connection with calcium signalling.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for this helpful feedback. We have included a more complete working model in our revision.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer 1:</bold></p>
<p>Comment 1: &quot;We utilized fmo-4 (ok294) knockout (KO) animals on five conditions reported to extend lifespan in C. elegans.&quot; Here I believe &quot;fmo-4 (ok294)&quot; should be &quot;fmo-4(ok294)&quot;. (No space).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this helpful revision. We have made this change as suggested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 2: &quot;Wild-type (WT) worms on DR experience a ~35% lifespan extension compared to fed WT worms, but when fmo-4 is knocked out this extension is reduced to ~10% and this interaction is significant by cox regression (p-value &lt; 4.50e-6).&quot; Here &quot;cox regression&quot; should be &quot;Cox regression&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have made this change as suggested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 3: &quot;Having established this role, we continued lifespan analyses of fmo-4 KO worms exposed to RNAi knockdown of the S6-kinase gene rsks-1 (mTOR signaling), the von hippel lindau gene vhl-1 (hypoxic signaling), the insulin receptor daf-2 (insulin-like signaling), and the cytochrome c reductase gene cyc-1 (mitochondrial electron transport chain, cytochrome c reductase) (Fig 1C-F).&quot; Here &quot;von hippel lindau&quot; should be &quot;Von Hippel-Lindau&quot;.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer 2:</bold></p>
<p>Comment 1: While FMO-4 is clearly placed in the ER calcium pathway genetically, the molecular mechanism by which FMO-4 would alter ER calcium is unclear. Notably, Tuckowski et al. highlight this gap in the discussion as well.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for identifying this important caveat. We hope to address the molecular mechanism by which FMO-4 alters ER calcium in upcoming projects.</p>

<p>Comment 2: Determining whether overexpression of catalytically dead FMO-4 or introduction of an inactivating point mutant into the endogenous locus phenocopy FMO-4 OE and KO animals would help distinguish between mechanisms involving protein-protein interactions or downstream metabolic regulation.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable suggestion. This is an experiment we are hoping to do in the near future to better understand molecular mechanisms and protein-protein interactions.</p>

<p>Reviewer 3:</p>
<p>Comment 1: When measuring the effect of thapsigargin on development of fmo-4 mutants it would be great to use a developmental assay rather than quantifying normalized worm area. Also please add scale bars to Figure 3G and 4H, it seems that fmo-4 overexpression decreases worm size even in control conditions, clarify if this is the case.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this feedback. In addition to quantifying normalized worm area in Figure 3G-I, we have added a developmental assay (Figure 3J) that shows the development time of wild-type worms on DMSO or thapsigargin as well as the <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE worms on DMSO or thapsigargin. These data validate that the <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE worm development is either delayed significantly or even prevented when the worms are treated with thapsigargin.</p>
<p>We have added scale bars to Figure 3G and 4H as suggested.</p>
<p>We also appreciate the reviewerâs observation of the <italic>fmo-4</italic> overexpression worms appearing smaller than wild-type worms in control conditions. We looked through the replicates and found that just one replicate showed a significant decrease in worm size, as observed in our unrevised manuscript. We repeated this experiment twice more to gather more data and determined that the <italic>fmo-4</italic> overexpression worms were ultimately not significantly different in size compared to wild-type worms. We have included the new images and quantifications in Figure 3G-I and Figure 4H-J in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 2: correct or replace Supplementary Table 2, which is not showing a DAVID analysis as the title and text would suggest. We should see biological/molecular processes, effect sizes, p-values, ...</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for identifying this issue. We have added more detail to the Supplementary Table 2 so that it is clearer what is being shown in each tab.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 3: clarify the data presented in Supplementary Data 2 because it does not clearly explain what is shown</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a great point, and we have added more detail to the Supplementary Data 2 to make sure the data are more clearly explained in each tab.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 4: in Figure 5B the fluorescent images do not seem to reflect the quantification in panel 5C.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this feedback. We re-analyzed our data to make sure the proper fluorescent images are included with their matching quantifications in Figure 5B-C.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 5: where is Supplementary Data 3?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for noticing this. Supplementary Data 3 was accidentally missing from the first submission, and has now been added.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 6: conceptually the last results section (regarding atf-6) does not add much to the story, I would consider removing these results</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this feedback. We have decided to keep Figure 7 because we think it helps to validate <italic>fmo-4</italic>âs role in calcium movement from the ER. While we show genetic interactions between <italic>fmo-4</italic> and key genes involved in calcium regulation (<italic>crt-1, itr-1,</italic> and <italic>mcu-1</italic>), we think that showing how <italic>fmo-4</italic> also interacts with <italic>atf-6,</italic> a known regulator of calcium homeostasis, strengthens and supports the genetic mechanisms of <italic>fmo-4</italic> proposed in this manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 7: the model proposed in Figure 7E is not convincingly supported by the results:</p>
<p>
o the arrows connecting atf-6, fmo-4 and crt-1 (calreticulin) suggest that fmo-4 is downstream of atf-6 and upstream of crt-1: Berkowitz 2020 showed that atf-6 knockdown downregulates calreticulin, so unless the authors show that this downregulation is mediated directly by fmo-4, the more likely explanation is that atf-6 knockdown affects calcium levels which in turn induces fmo-4 expression.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this helpful feedback. We have addressed this by updating our proposed model. We used a solid arrow leading from the reduction of <italic>atf-6</italic> to induction of <italic>fmo-4,</italic> as this is supported by our data in Figure 7A-B. We then used dashed arrows between <italic>fmo-4</italic> and <italic>crt-1</italic> as well as between <italic>atf-6</italic> and <italic>crt-1</italic> to indicate that more data is needed to clarify this part of the pathway.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 8: Avoid pointing at a mitochondrial connection in the title as the only evidence supporting this interaction comes from the mcu-1 RNAi epistasis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewerâs suggestion. We added another piece of evidence suggesting an interaction between <italic>fmo-4</italic> and the mitochondria to Supplementary Figure 7G-H. Here we show that while <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE worms are resistant to paraquat stress, knocking down <italic>vdac-1</italic> (a calcium regulator located in the outer mitochondrial membrane), abrogates this effect. We have kept mitochondria in our title but have made sure to temper our language in the main text to avoid pointing to a strong mitochondrial connection, since we have two pieces of evidence connecting <italic>fmo-4</italic> to the mitochondria.</p>
