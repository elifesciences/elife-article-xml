<title>Summary</title>
<p>Large-scale cell flow characterizes gastrulation in animal development. In amniote gastrulation, a bilateral vortex-like counter-rotating cell flow, called ‘polonaise movements’, appears along the midline. Here, through experimental manipulations, we addressed relationships between the polonaise movements and morphogenesis of the primitive streak, the earliest midline structure in amniotes. Suppression of the Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway maintains the polonaise movements along a deformed primitive streak. Mitotic arrest leads to diminished extension and development of the primitive streak and maintains the early phase of the polonaise movements. Ectopically induced Vg1, an axis-inducing morphogen, generates the polonaise movements, aligned to the induced midline, but disturbs the stereotypical cell flow pattern at the authentic midline. Despite the altered cell flow, induction and extension of the primitive streak are preserved along both authentic and induced midlines. Finally, we show that ectopic axis-inducing morphogen, Vg1, is capable of initiating the polonaise movements without concomitant PS extension under mitotic arrest conditions. These results are consistent with a model wherein primitive streak morphogenesis is required for the maintenance of the polonaise movements, but the polonaise movements are not necessarily responsible for primitive streak morphogenesis. Our data describe a previously undefined relationship between the large-scale cell flow and midline morphogenesis in gastrulation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Large-scale cell flow during gastrulation is an evolutionarily conserved biological phenomenon in embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). During this period, animals with bilateral symmetry, called bilaterians, initiate development of three germ layers (i.e. the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm) and midline structures (e.g. the notochord and primitive streak) along the midline axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). The large-scale cell flow has been linked to early embryonic morphogenesis, including axial structures, through rearrangement of cells and/or transportation of signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Coupling of the large-scale cell flow and body axis morphogenesis has been extensively studied in invertebrate bilaterians, particularly insect models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). However, in vertebrates, our understanding of whether and how the large-scale cell flow and midline morphogenesis are coupled is limited.</p>
<p>Vertebrates are classified into two groups: non-amniotes (e.g. fish and amphibians) and amniotes (e.g. birds and mammals) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). In non-amniotes, particularly amphibians, the large-scale cell flow is coupled with formation of the notochord through Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway-regulated convergent extension, which does not depend on mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). In amniotes, a bilateral vortex-like counter-rotating cell flow, termed ‘polonaise movements’, occurs within the epiblast along the midline axis, prior to and during primitive streak (PS) formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). The PS is an evolutionarily unique embryonic structure in amniotes, which is not only an organizing center for gastrulation but also the earliest midline structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). During amniote gastrulation, widespread mitosis has been identified throughout the embryo, including the PS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), and previous studies showed that mitotic arrest leads to morphologically diminishing PS extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Further, the Wnt/PCP pathway also plays an important role for proper PS extension and patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Since the chick embryo is readily accessible and closely represents the human gastrula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>), much of what is known about the cell flow and PS development has come from studies using this model system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). The PS is first visible as a cell cluster at the posterior embryonic disc at the initial streak stage [HH2; Hamburger and Hamilton staging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>)] formed through the influence of several axis inducing factors [e.g. Vg1 and Chordin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>)]; it then extends anteriorly along the midline axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). During PS development, displacement of cells and/or tissue tension potentially generates biomechanical forces, which lead to cell flows and/or PS morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Recent studies discuss that cell intercalation and ingression underlying PS formation, leading to the polonaise movements through altering the neighbor tissue tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>), suggesting that the polonaise movements are likely a consequence of PS morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Other studies demonstrate that the polonaise movements, generated by the myosin-cable-mediated tissue tension with cell intercalation and ingression, lead to PS morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Thus, the relationship between the polonaise movements and PS morphogenesis remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we characterize a previously undefined relationship between the polonaise movements and PS morphogenesis. Suppression of the Wnt/PCP pathway generates a wider and shorter PS while maintaining the polonaise movements. Mitotic arrest diminishes PS extension and maintains the early phase of the polonaise movements. Moreover, experimentally manipulating the large-scale cell flow by inducing a secondary midline axis indicates that the authentic PS forms despite altered cell flows. Ultimately, a single axis-inducing morphogen, Vg1, is capable of initiating the polonaise movements despite defective PS morphogenesis. These results suggest that PS morphogenesis is not responsible for the initiation and early phase of the polonaise movements.</p>
<p>Further, the polonaise movements are not necessarily responsible for PS morphogenesis. This study suggests that amniote gastrulation may be evolutionarily distinct from non-amniote gastrulation in the mechanisms coupling large-scale cell flow and midline morphogenesis.</p>

<title>Suppression of the Wnt/PCP pathway maintains the bilateral vortex-like counter-rotating cell flow along a deformed PS</title>
<p>Throughout this work, the cell flows were recorded by tagging individual epiblast cells with electroporated fluorescent tracers at the pre-streak stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). The tagged embryos were live-imaged until HH3 with a modified New culture system, which we previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). To reconstruct trajectories of the tagged cells and quantitatively analyze the cell flow pattern, the recorded images were processed using tracking analysis tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>), Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>), and subsequent visualization techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>).</p>
<p>To address the relationship between the polonaise movements and PS morphogenesis, we experimentally manipulated the shape of the PS while maintaining the population of PS cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-B</xref>). The DEP domain of Dishevelled (Dsh; a transducer protein of Wnt signaling) is responsible for the non-canonical Wnt/PCP pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>), and misexpression of dominant-negative Dsh lacking DEP [dnDsh(ΔDEP)] leads to deformation of the midline structures, including the PS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Further, the Wnt/PCP pathway is involved in cellular polarity and migration, while the canonical Wnt pathway regulates cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). We generated a dnDsh(ΔDEP)-GFP construct, we will refer to this as ΔDEP-GFP, and tested whether the construct was capable of modifying cellular polarity, resulting in PS deformation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C-E</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A-D</xref>). In the control-GFP-introduced PS and epiblast cells, Pk1 (a PCP core component) exhibited a polarized localization at the E-cadherin-based adherens junctions, particularly cell-cell junctions (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A-B</xref>, n=3). In contrast, this Pk1-localization pattern was not identified in the ΔDEP-GFP-misexpressing PS and epiblast cells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C-D</xref>, n=3), implying that the construct efficiently disrupted the cellular polarity within the misexpressing cells. The expression of <italic>Brachyury</italic> indicated that ΔDEP-GFP-PS cells maintained their identity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>) but displayed a shorter and wider morphogenesis than the control PS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>, n≥4 for each). The number of PS cells was not significantly different from the control- and ΔDEP-GFP-PSs (control 8.5±0.4x10<sup>3</sup> cells vs ΔDEP 8.8±1.2x10<sup>3</sup> cells, p=0.68, n=3 for each, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). These results indicated that ΔDEP misexpression was capable of suppressing the Wnt/PCP pathway through disrupting the localization pattern of the PCP core component while maintaining the number of the PS cells. Having confirmed the function of the ΔDEP-GFP construct, we applied it as a molecular tool for manipulating the shape of the PS.</p>

</fig>
<p>To address a relationship between the polonaise movements and the shape of the PS, we live-imaged the control- and ΔDEP-GFP-embryos from pre-streak stage to HH3 and analyzed the resulting cell flows (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G-N</xref>”’, and movie S1). In the control-GFP embryo, the cell flow pattern, which was visualized by tracking tools and quantitatively analyzed by PIV with subsequent flow-visualization techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>), identified robust polonaise movements (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G-G</xref>”’, I-I”’, K-K”’, M-M”’, and movie S1, n=5,). Surprisingly, these analyses indicated that suppression of the Wnt/PCP pathway maintained the polonaise movements despite PS deformation (n=5, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C-N</xref>”’ and movie S1). While the topology of the counter-rotating flow pattern were maintained under suppression of the Wnt/PCP pathway, the distance between the left-right rotating cell flows was wider in the ΔDEP embryos than the controls (control 860.2±86.2μm vs ΔDEP 1008.4±183.8μm, p=0.026, n=4 for each, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1E-I</xref>), implying that the shape of the PS and/or the Wnt/PCP signaling-mediated cell intercalation affects the location of these rotations. These data demonstrated that the polonaise movements persisted even though the PS as a midline structure was deformed under the condition of suppressing the Wnt/PCP pathway.</p>

<title>Mitotic arrest diminishes PS formation but initially preserves the bilateral vortex-like rotating cell flow</title>
<p>The above data showed that a deformed midline structure allowed the polonaise movements to occur while the position of the LR rotations in the polonaise movements was affected (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>). However, it remained unclear the relationship between the polonaise movements and the population of the PS cells, particularly expansion of the PS precursor cells in PS morphogenesis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). To address this question, we applied a mitotic arrest approach using aphidicolin (a specific DNA polymerase inhibitor), which has been shown to diminished PS development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). In chick embryonic disc, active cell proliferation was identified in both the epiblast and PS cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). As verified by BrdU incorporation assay, the aphidicolin-treated embryos exhibited little or no mitotic activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C-D</xref>). Morphogenesis of PS was monitored by <italic>Brachyury</italic> (a marker for PS and mesodermal cells) and <italic>Sox3</italic> (an epiblast marker). The expression domain and midline extension of cells expressing <italic>Brachyury</italic> and negative for <italic>Sox3</italic> were considerably reduced in the aphidicolin-treated embryos, compared to the control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>; n≥4 for each). The expression pattern of <italic>Brachyury</italic> and PS extension followed an aphidicolin dose-dependent diminishment (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A-D</xref>). The <italic>Vg1</italic>-expressing area was also diminished but detectable in the aphidicolin-treated embryos (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>, n=4), suggesting that the axis-inducing morphogen was preserved in the embryonic disc, but expansion of the PS precursor cells was suppressed by mitotic arrest. These results indicate that mitotic arrest, induced by the aphidicolin-treatment, remarkably reduced PS extension and development, consistent with the previous works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>).</p>
<p>To address the relationship between the polonaise movements and the population of the PS cells, we live-imaged the fluorescently tagged embryos under aphidicolin-treatment and analyzed the resulting cell flow (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F-L</xref>”’ and movie S2). Tracking and PIV-based analyses visualized the cell flow pattern in control and aphidicolin-treated embryos (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F-M</xref>”’). In control embryos, the polonaise movements occurred from pre-streak until HH3 for more than four hours (n=4, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F-F</xref>”’ and movie S2). The streamline and vorticity plots illustrated that the polonaise movements became more robust in a time-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H-H</xref>”’, J-J”’ and L-L”’). Strikingly, in the aphidicolin-treated embryos (n=4), the polonaise movements initiated but were maintained for a shorter period, 2.2±1.2 hours (control 6.5±1.2 hours, p=0.0038, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G-G</xref>”’, movie S1). The streamline and vorticity plots also indicated the initiation and early phase of the polonaise movements in the aphidicolin-treated embryos (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I-I</xref>”’, K-K’”, and M-M”’). Together, these data demonstrated that the typical pattern of the polonaise movements was induced and initially maintained in the short-term, while there was no or little indication of robust PS formation or extension.</p>
<p>Aphidicolin potentially induces apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>), which might indirectly lead to the cell flow changes through tissue tension alterations. To test this possibility, we examined apoptosis in the control and aphidicolin-treated embryos (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A-C</xref>). TUNEL assay showed that the aphidicolin-treatment slightly increased apoptotic rate but there was no significant difference between these embryos and controls (control sham, 10.6±3.5%; aphidicolin, 12.1±3.7%, p=0.20, n=4 for each, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A-C</xref>), suggesting that the bilateral rotating cell flow in the aphidicolin-treated embryos was not indirectly induced by apoptosis.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that a large-scale ring-like distribution of phospholyrated-myosin (pMyosin) cables among the epiblast cell layer is required for tissue tension related to cell flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). We examined whether the pMyosin cables were maintained in the treated embryos over the course of the imaging (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3D-F</xref>). In the aphidicolin-treated embryos, the large-scale ring-like distribution pattern of the pMyosin cables remained in the epiblast (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3F</xref>), similar to the control embryos (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3D</xref>), implying that the mitotic arrested-embryos maintained tissue tension, consistent with the previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Thus, these results support a model that mitosis is coupled with PS morphogenesis but is not necessarily required for the initiation and early phase of the polonaise movements.</p>

<title>PS properly extends along the midline despite altering the large-scale cell flow</title>
<p>Given that PS morphogenesis is required for maintenance of the polonaise movements, we next examined the converse of the relationship; that the polonaise movements may be required for PS formation. To test this model, we experimentally reprogrammed the large-scale cell flow (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-B</xref>). Ectopically induced Vg1 leads to formation of a <italic>Brachyury</italic>-positive secondary PS and a secondary midline axis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C-D</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). COS cells expressing either a control-GFP (control-GFP/COS) or Vg1 (Vg1/COS) construct were placed at the anterior marginal zone (AMZ) at pre-streak stage, approximately 180° from the posterior marginal zone where the authentic PS forms, and we analyzed the resulting cell flow during both authentic and ectopically induced PS extension (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). If the bilateral rotating cell flow is required for PS formation, both the authentic and induced PSs should each be accompanied by polonaise movements during the extension. The trajectory analysis by Imaris and PIV-based analyses showed that the control-COS implanted embryos exhibited stereotypical polonaise movements along the authentic midline axis, indicating that the COS cell implantation maintained an authentic cell flow pattern (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>, and movie S3, n=4). In contrast, analyses of the cell flow in the Vg1/COS implanted embryos illustrated the disruption of the authentic polonaise movements at the extending authentic PS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F-F</xref>”’, H-H”’, J-J”’, L-L”’, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6</xref> and movie S3, S4, n=4). At pre-streak stage, the epiblast cells initially converged to the center of the embryonic disc along both the authentic and the induced axes, and the bilateral rotating cell flows began to appear at both axes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5, S6, and</xref> movie S3, S4). This cell flow pattern continued for approximately one hour (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3J</xref>’, J”, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>, and movie S3). Before extension of the authentic PS, the bilateral rotating cell flow along the induced axis became dominant, and eventually overrode the original cell flow (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3J</xref>’, J”, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref> and movie S3). Despite global disruption and reversed counter-rotating cell flows, the authentic PS extended properly along the authentic midline (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>, F”’, H”’, J”’, L”’, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>, and movie S3; n=4). Secondary midline-axis induction by ectopic Vg1 created the polonaise movements around the secondary PS and altered the original cell flow pattern, generating a reprogrammed large-scale cell flow (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F-F</xref>”’, H-H”’, J-J”’, L-L”’G, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6</xref> and movie S3, S4). These results indicate that extension of the authentic PS is preserved even under the defective polonaise movements.</p>

<title>Vg1 is capable of inducing the bilateral vortex-like rotating cell flow despite diminished PS extension under mitotic arrest</title>
<p>The above data indicate the lack of a strong relationship between the polonaise movements and PS morphogenesis; however, it remained unclear how the polonaise movements were induced. Given that mitotic arrest maintained both Vg1-expression and the initiation of the polonaise movements (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and movie S2) and that induction of the secondary midline axis by ectopic Vg1 reprograms the epiblast cell flow (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">S5</xref>, and movie S3), we tested the possibility that the axis-inducing morphogen, Vg1, would be capable of inducing the polonaise movements in the absence of PS extension (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). We combined the secondary axis induction by AMZ implantation of Vg1/COS cells with aphidicolin-treatment and analyzed the resulting cell flow (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>, <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">S7</xref>, and movie S4). The BrdU assay showed that the aphidicolin treatment effectively blocked mitosis in Vg1/COS implanted embryos (control sham 88±9.0% vs control-GFP/COS with aphidicolin 0.2±0.1% vs Vg1/COS with aphidicolin 0.19±0.2%, p= 0.0000005, n=3 for each, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C-D</xref>) and diminished both the authentic and induced PS (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>-F, n=3 for each). The control-GFP/COS implanted embryo under mitotic arrest condition initially displayed the polonaise movements along the authentic midline axis, however, the vorticity decreased time-dependently, resulting in a defective rotating cell flow (n=3, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>-G”’, I-I”’, K-K”’, M-M”’, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>, and movie S4), consistent with the non-COS cell implanted embryos under aphidicolin-treatment (shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). In contrast, the Vg1/COS implanted embryos under mitotic arrest condition exhibited the polonaise movements predominantly at the induction point of the secondary axis with disrupted authentic cell flow at the site of the authentic midline axis (n=3, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H-H</xref>”’, J-J”’, L-L”’, N-N”’, and movie S4). These data suggest that the midline axis induction by the single morphogen brings about the polonaise movements, even when the midline structure (i.e. extending PS) is diminished. Taken together, our data show that Vg1 is capable of inducing and reprogramming the large-scale cell flow during gastrulation even though the midline structure is diminished.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we described a previously undefined relationship between the polonaise movements and PS morphogenesis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Our approaches to molecularly manipulating PS morphogenesis revealed that the initiation and early phase of the polonaise movements occur despite diminished PS formation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Conversely, the experimental manipulation of the cell flow demonstrated that the authentic PS extends regardless of aberrant flow patterns (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Further, a single axis-inducing morphogen, Vg1, is capable of inducing the bilateral rotating cell flow even under mitotic arrest, when the ectopic PS is reduced (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>, C). Our data support a model in which the PS population is required for maintaining the polonaise movements, as seen in the ΔDEP embryos, while the polonaise movements are not necessarily responsible for PS morphogenesis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>).</p>
<p>A similar mitotic arrest has been described as simultaneously diminishing PS extension and disrupting the polonaise movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>), but it was not determined whether a lack of PS extension and/or diminished cell population of the PS at the midline led to defective polonaise movements. In this study, our live-imaging system combined with the quantitative analyses, molecular tools for manipulating PS formation, and the gene expression analyses allowed us to clarify the relationships among PS morphogenesis, the polonaise movements, mitosis, and the Wnt/PCP pathway (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, C). Our data demonstrated that the shape of the PS as a midline structure is not necessarily responsible for initiation of the polonaise movements while the population of the PS cells, expanded by mitosis, is required for sustained polonaise movements (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Mesendoderm specification is required for large-scale cell flows associated with later stage ingression and intercalation at the PS during gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Here, we have described the distinctive set of cell flows that precede gastrulation in the chick embryo, and the relationship between early and late cell flow has yet to be examined.</p>
<p>The Wnt/PCP pathway has been assumed to be coupled with the polonaise movements, as an evolutionarily conserved mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). In contrast, another study showed that misexpression of dnWnt11 or dnDsh-ΔPDZ [suppressing both the Wnt canonical and non-canonical pathway, including the Wnt/PCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>)] maintained the bilateral counter-rotating cell flow along a defective PS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). Thus, the role of the Wnt/PCP signaling pathway for the polonaise movements has remained unresolved. In this study, our loss-of-function technique, introducing ΔDEP to PS cells, demonstrated that the polonaise movements were preserved along the deformed PS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, and movie S1). Our electroporation-mediated gene-transfection allowed us to restrict gene transduction in area and number of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). Despite the technical limitations, the suppression level of the Wnt/PCP pathway through the ΔDEP-misexpression was sufficient to lead to the PS deformation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>). The Wnt/PCP pathway potentially works both cell-autonomously and non-cell autonomously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). In the PS and non-PS epiblast cells, the disruption of the Pk1-localization was identified not only in the ΔDEP-misexpressing cells, but also in neighbors; however, this study is not designed to provide insight into questions of cell autonomy. Further, the Wnt/PCP pathway is a major regulator of cell intercalation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent studies have shown that cell intercalation plays an important role in PS morphogenesis and the initiation of the polonaise movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Our data demonstrates that suppression of the Wnt/PCP pathway preserves the initiation and maintenance of the polonaise movements, but the lateral positioning of the rotations is enlarged when the PS is deformed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>). These results suggest that the Wnt/PCP pathway may not be associated with directional cell intercalation for driving the polonaise movements (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate the role of the polonaise movements for PS morphogenesis, a technical challenge/limitation is how to stop or disrupt the cell flow while preserving the cellular process intact. For example, previous loss-of-function studies, using knockdown techniques (such as siRNA and inhibitor treatments), identified the necessity of myosins, including pMyosin and actomyosin, for both the large-scale cell flow and PS morphogenesis, through regulation of tissue tension/biomechanical force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Myosins are fundamental cellular components and involved in several cell biological processes, such as tissue tension, cell division, and intracellular transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Therefore, it remains a possibility that myosin-related mechanisms could be involved in the cell flow and PS morphogenesis. Recent studies using injury and pressure models further demonstrated that the cell flow pattern can be altered by a physical cut to an embryonic disc or removal of a large portion of an embryo disc through change of the tissue tension or ablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). While these models suggest that the cell flow pattern is dependent on an intact embryonic architecture, it remains unclear as to involvement of other elements such as signaling pathways and gene expression, which can be also molecularly and cell-biologically changed as a result of surgeries. Thus, we developed an experimentally manipulation of the cell flow system, using a Vg1-induced two-midline axis model, disturbing the stereotypical cell flow pattern while maintaining embryonic development (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p>
<p>Our two-midline axis model provided an important insight into the axis-inducing morphogen for induction and patterning of the polonaise movements (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>-<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">S7</xref>, and movie S3, S4). Our data demonstrated that the ectopic Vg1, mimicking the inducing activity of the posterior marginal zone, generated the bilateral rotating cell flow aligned to the induced midline axis but disrupted the cell flows at the authentic midline axis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Despite the disturbed cell flow, PS extension was preserved along both authentic and induced midline axes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). While this model ultimately disturbed the stereotypical cell flow pattern at the authentic midline axis, cell flow was initiated there. Therefore, our study does not rule out potential roles of the cell flow in the initiating steps of PS extension.</p>
<p>It remains unclear how the induced polonaise movements along with the secondary axis overcame the authentic cell flows despite mitotic arrest (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). As for axis-induction by other axis-inducing morphogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>), Vg1 may work dose-dependently for induction and patterning of the polonaise movements, and ectopic application may have over-ridden endogenous levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Further studies will clarify the relationship between the large-scale cell flows and the concentration of the morphogen; this will add new insight to the regulation mechanisms that connect axis-induction and the cell flow patterning.</p>
<p>This study further suggests evolutional distinctions underlying cell biological mechanisms of the large-scale cell flow and midline morphogenesis, between amniotes and non-amniotes. The first distinction is the necessity of the Wnt/PCP pathway to the large-scale cell flow. Whereas the Wnt/PCP pathway is coupled with both the large-scale cell flow and midline morphogenesis in non-amniotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>), our data revealed that the signaling pathway is required for proper PS morphogenesis, but contributes little to the polonaise movements (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The second distinction is mitosis-dependency/independency comparisons between model systems of gastrulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Non-amniotes, in particular amphibians, utilize a blastopore-mediated gastrulation and undergo notochord formation with the large-scale cell flow, all independent of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). In amniotes, mitosis is required for PS morphogenesis, and expanding the mass of the PS cells contributes to the maintenance of the polonaise movements (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Thus, the large-scale cell flow and midline morphogenesis in amniote gastrulation is not tightly coupled, which may be evolutionarily distinct from non-amniote gastrulation.</p>
<p>In summary, our study illustrates the relationships between midline morphogenesis, the large-scale cell flow, and an axis-inducing factor in amniote gastrulation. These findings will add another layer of our understanding to how the bilateral body plan is initiated and patterned along the midline axis.</p>

<title>PIV analysis and cell flow visualizing techniques</title>
<p>For quantitatively analyzing the cell flow pattern, the recorded images were further processed by using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and subsequent visualization techniques. PIV analysis technique [PIVlab package in MATLAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>)], which is a common technique for mapping displacement of particles (e.g. tagged cells) over a short time interval measured from a series of consecutive images to obtain the velocity vector field is employed to quantify the cell flows in the experimental time-lapse datasets. PIV is a standard technique used in the Fluid Physics and Engineering community to quantitatively measure and characterize fluid flows in different systems. This analysis provides comprehensive and quantitative information of a whole flow as a velocity vector field. The PIV analysis involves several steps that are carried out on image sequences over time intervals of 3 minutes, which is also the imaging acquisition speed in the experiments. First, we apply a high-pass filter during the image preprocessing step to highlight the bright particles (fluorescently tagged cell) and minimize the background. Then the PIV analysis was carried out by partitioning the image into smaller interrogation windows, typically of size 64 x 64 pixels with 50% overlap on the first pass, and a window size of 32 x 32 pixels with 50% overlap on the second pass. After this, raw velocity vector fields over time were obtained, and then these vectors were post-processed and validated by setting threshold limits, data smoothing and interpolation. A calibration was applied to convert pixel/frame units into μm/s units.</p>
<p>The generated velocity vector field through PIV displayed the averaged cell pattern of the whole-flow-field in the certain time period in this study. To highlight the more specific rotating cell flows, mathematical/physical information (such as topology and vorticity) was extracted from these velocity vector fields via computational visualization techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). Topology of the cell flow was determined by streamlines, which are a group of curves that approximate to contours of the vectors in the velocity vector field at a particular moment in time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). Flowtrace visualized the trajectories of the cell flow, whereas the streamlines illustrated the averaged flow pattern in the time period. Therefore, the trajectories and streamlines show similar pattern when the cell flow is in stable-state; however, they are not completely consistent with each other when the cell flow is unstable and time-dependently changing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). Vorticity, also termed as ‘curl of vorticity’, is a measure of a local rotation in the larger flow and its magnitude is twice that of the local angular velocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). The vorticity plot further displays directionality of the rotation. Since vorticity arises from any rotational movements, including both a full- and partial rotation, the vorticity plot displayed the vorticities in both the vortex-like rotating and curves of the cell flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>).</p>

<p>Large scale cell movements occur during gastrulation in vertebrate embryos but their role in this major morphogenetic transition in formation of the body plan is poorly understood. Using the chick embryo model system, this study makes <bold>important</bold> advances using elegant methods to show that extension of the primitive streak during gastrulation, occurring through cell proliferation, polarisation and intercalation, and large-scale polonaise cell movements, can be uncoupled. Although the driving mechanism and precise role of these movements remains a mystery, the study provides <bold>convincing</bold> evidence for the uncoupling through independent approaches, the most creative of which are the effects shown after induction of a supernumerary primitive streak.</p>

<p>In chicken embryos, the counter-rotating migration of epiblast cells on both sides of the forming primitive streak (PS), a process referred to as polonaise movements, has attracted longstanding interest as a paradigm of morphogenetic cell movements. However, the association between these cell movements and PS development is still controversial. This study investigated PS development and polonaise movements separately at their initial stage, showing that both could be uncoupled (at least at the initial phase), being activated via Vg1 signaling.</p>
<p>Strengths of this study</p>
<p>Polonaise movements, i.e., the circular cell migration of epiblast cells on both sides of the forming PS in avian embryos, have been the subject of research through live imaging and promoted the development of new tools to analyze quantitatively such movements. However, conclusions from previous studies remain controversial, at least partly due to the nature of perturbations to PS development and polonaise movements.</p>
<p>This study performed the challenging technique of electroporation to successfully mark and manipulate Wnt/PCP pathways in unincubated chicken embryo cells at the initiation phase of these two processes. In addition, the authors separately altered PS development and polonaise movements: PS development was perturbed by inhibiting either the Wnt/PCP pathway or DNA synthesis using aphidicolin, while polonaise movements were modified by the development of a second PS after engrafting Vg1-expressing COS cells located at the opposite end of the blastoderm. The study concluded that Vg1 elicits both PS development and polonaise movements, which occur in a parallel and are not inter-dependent.</p>
<p>To support these conclusions, particle image velocimetry (PIV) of cell trajectories captured by live imaging was performed. These tools delineated visually appealing cell movements and gave rise to vorticity profiles, adding more value to this study.</p>
<p>Weaknesses of this study</p>
<p>Engrafted Vg1-expressing COS cells located at the anterior end of the blastoderm elicited both the development of a second PS and marked bilateral polonaise movements while perturbing these movements along the original PS. How do polonaise movements along the second PS dominate over those along the normal PS? The authors suggested a model in which Vg1 acts in a graded or dose-dependent manner since engrafted COS cells over-expressed Vg1. This model can be tested by reducing the mass of engrafted COS cells. Although the authors propose performing this analysis in further investigations, it would be preferable to incorporate into this study for better consistency.</p>
<p>The authors claim that chicken embryo development is representative of &quot;amniotes,&quot; but it does not hold for all groups. Avian and mammal species are exceptional among amniotes in the sense they develop a PS (e.g., Coolen et al. 2008). Moreover, in certain mammalian embryos like mouse embryos, cells laterally to the PS do not move much (Williams et al. 2012). The authors should avoid the generalization that chicken embryos unequivocally represent amniotes as opposed to the observed in non-amniote embryos. The observations in chicken embryos as they stand are significant enough.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors are interested in large-scale cell flow during gastrulation and in particular in the polonaise movement. This movement corresponds to a bilateral vortex-like counter-rotating cell flow and transport the mesendodermal cells allowing ingression of cells through the primitive streak and ultimately the formation of the mesoderm and endoderm. The authors specifically wanted to investigate the coupling of the polonaise movement and primitive streak to understand whether the polonaise movement is a consequence of the formation of the primitive streak or the other way around. They propose a model where the primitive streak elongation is not required for the cell flow but rather for its maintenance and that robust cell flow is not required for primitive streak extension.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Overall, the manuscript is well written with clear experimental designs. The authors have used live imaging and cell flow analysis in different conditions, where either the formation of the primitive streak or the cell flow was perturbed.</p>
<p>
Their live imaging and PIV-based analyses convincingly support their conclusions that primitive streak deformation or mitotic arrest do not impact the initiation of the polonaise movement but rather the location or maintenance of these rotations. They additionally showed that disruption of the polonaise movement in the authentic primitive streak by elegant addition of an ectopic primitive streak does not impact the original primitive streak elongation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
- When using the delta-DEP-GFP construct, the authors showed that they can manipulate the shape of the primitive streak without affecting the identity and number of primitive streak cells. It is not clear however how this can affect the shape, volume or adhesion of the cells. Some mechanistic insights would strengthen the paper.</p>
<p>
- Overall, frequencies of observation are missing for a better view of the phenomenon. For example, do Vg1/Cos cells always disrupt the flow at the authentic primitive streak? Can replicate vector fields be integrated to reflect quantification?</p>
<p>
- Since myosin cables have been shown to be instrumental for the polonaise movement, it would be interesting to better investigate how the manipulations by the delta-DEP-GFP construct, or Vg1/Cos affect the myosin cables (as shown in preliminary form for the aphidicolin-treated embryos).</p>
