<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The Gram-negative bacterium <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> glides on solid surfaces. Dynamic bacterial focal adhesion complexes (bFACs) convert proton motive force from the inner membrane into mechanical propulsion on the cell surface. It is unclear how the mechanical force transmits across the rigid peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall. Here we show that AgmT, a highly abundant lytic PG transglycosylase homologous to <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> MltG, couples bFACs to PG. Coprecipitation assay and single-particle microscopy reveal that the gliding motors fail to connect to PG and thus are unable to assemble into bFACs in the absence of an active AgmT. Heterologous expression of <italic>E. coli</italic> MltG restores the connection between PG and bFACs and thus rescues gliding motility in the <italic>M. xanthus</italic> cells that lack AgmT. Our results indicate that bFACs anchor to AgmT-modified PG to transmit mechanical force across the PG cell wall.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In natural ecosystems, the majority of bacteria attach to surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Surface-associated motility is critical for many bacteria to navigate and populate their environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. The Gram-negative bacterium <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> moves on solid surfaces using two independent mechanisms: social (S-) motility and adventurous (A-) motility. S-motility, analogous to the twitching motility in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and <italic>Neisseria</italic>, is powered by the extension and retraction of type IV pili<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. A-motility, also known as gliding motility, does not depend on conventional motility-related cell surface appendages, such as flagella or pili<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. In <italic>M. xanthus</italic>, AglR, AglQ, and AglS form a membrane channel that functions as the gliding motor by harvesting proton motive force<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. The motor unit associates with at least fourteen gliding-related proteins that reside in the cytoplasm, inner membrane, periplasm, and outer membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Recently, the mechanisms for bFAC assembly and the coupling between bFACs and substrate begin to emerge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. In each gliding cell, two distinct populations of gliding complexes coexist: dynamic complexes move along helical paths and static complexes remain fixed relative to the substrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Motors transport incomplete gliding complexes along helical tracks but form complete, force-generating complexes at the ventral side of cells that appear fixed to the substrate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Based on their functional analogy with eukaryotic focal adhesion sites, these complete gliding machineries are called bacterial focal adhesion complexes (bFACs). Despite their static appearance, bFACs are dynamic under single-molecule microscopy. Individual motors frequently display move-stall-move patterns, in which they move rapidly along helical trajectories, join a bFAC where they remain stationary briefly, then move rapidly again toward the next bFAC or reverse their moving directions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. bFACs adhere to the gliding substrate through an outer membrane adhesin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. As motors transport bFACs toward lagging cell poles, cells move forward but bFACs remain static relative to the gliding substrate.</p>

<caption><title>Stationary bFACs drive <italic>M. xanthus</italic> gliding.</title>
<p>Motors carrying incomplete gliding complexes either diffuse or move rapidly along helical paths but do not generate propulsion. Motors stall and become nearly static relative to the substrate when they assemble into complete bFACs with other motor-associated proteins at the ventral side of the cell. Stalled motors push MreB and bFACs in opposite directions and thus exert force against outer membrane adhesins. Overall, as motors transport bFACs toward lagging cell poles, cells move forward but bFACs remain static relative to the substrate. IM, inner membrane; OM, outer membrane.</p></caption>

<p>bFAC assembly can be quantified at nanometer resolution using the single-particle dynamics of gliding motors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Single particles of a fully functional, photoactivatable mCherry (PAmCherry)-labeled AglR display three dynamic patterns, stationary, directed motion, and diffusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. The stationary population consists of the motors in fully assembled bFACs, which do not move before photobleach. In contrast, the motors moving in a directed manner carry incomplete gliding complexes along helical tracks, whereas the diffusing motors assemble to even less completeness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. As motors only generate force in static bFACs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, the population of nonmotile motors indicates the overall status of fully assembled bFACs.</p>
<p>However, how bFACs transmit force across the peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall is unclear. PG is a mesh-like single molecule of crosslinked glycan strands that surrounds the entire cytoplasmic membrane. The rigidity of PG defines cell shape and protects cells from osmotic lysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. If bFACs physically penetrate PG, their transportation toward lagging cell poles would tear PG and trigger cell lysis. To avoid breaching PG, an updated model proposes that there are two subcomplexes in each bFAC, one on each side of the PG layer. Rather than forming stable and rigid interactions, these two subcomplexes only associate transiently to form a bFAC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
<p>As motors reside in the fluid inner membrane, to transmit force to the cell surface, they must push against two relatively rigid structures, one on each side of the membrane, in opposite directions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). MreB is a bacterial actin homolog that associates with the motors and plays essential roles in gliding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. The motors could push against MreB filaments in the cytoplasm, whereas PG could be the structure that motors push against in the periplasm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. The interaction between the inner complex and PG not only satisfies the physical requirement for force generation but also supports efficient bFACs assembly. Without this interaction, once the inner subcomplex disassociates from the outer one, it will quickly escape bFACs and no longer contribute to force generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. In this case, the fraction of time each motor generates force (remains in bFACs) will be extremely low<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. How the inner complex interacts with PG remains unknown. It was speculated that gliding motors in the inner complex could bind PG directly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. However, such binding has not been confirmed by experiments.</p>
<p>In this study, we found that AgmT, a lytic transglycosylase (LTG) for PG, is essential for <italic>M. xanthus</italic> gliding motility. AgmT is required for maintaining PG integrity under the stress from the antibiotic mecillinam. Using single-particle tracking microscopy and coprecipitation assays, we found that AgmT is required for the gliding motors to connect to PG and stall in bFACs. Importantly, expressing <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> MltG heterologously rescues the connection between PG and bFACs and thus restores gliding motility. Hence, the LTG activity of AgmT anchors bFAC to PG, potentially by modifying PG structure. Our findings reveal the long-sought connection between PG and bFAC that allows mechanical force to transmit across the PG cell wall.</p>

<title>AgmT, a putative LTG, is essential for gliding motility</title>
<p>To elucidate how bFACs interact with PG, we searched for potential PG-binding domains among the proteins that are required for gliding motility. A previous report identified 35 gliding-related genes in <italic>M. xanthus</italic> through transposon-mediated random mutagenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Among these genes, <italic>agmT</italic> (ORF K1515_04910<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>) was predicted to encode a protein with a large “periplasmic solute-binding” domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. After careful analysis, we found that AgmT showed significant similarity to the widely conserved YceG/MltG family LTGs. About 70% of bacterial genomes, including firmicutes, proteobacteria, and actinobacteria, encode YceG/MltG domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Especially, the putative active site, Glu223 (corresponding to E218 in <italic>E. coli</italic> MltG)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, is conserved in AgmT (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). To confirm the function of AgmT in gliding, we constructed an <italic>agmT</italic> in-frame deletion mutant. To eliminate S-motility, we further knocked out the <italic>pilA</italic> gene that encodes pilin for type IV pilus. In contrast to the <italic>pilA</italic><sup>−</sup> cells that were still motile with gliding motility, the Δ<italic>aglR pilA</italic><sup>−</sup> cells that lack an essential component in the gliding motor, were unable to move outward from the colony edge. Similarly, the Δ<italic>agmT pilA</italic><sup>−</sup> cells also formed sharp colony edges, indicating that they were nonmotile with gliding (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). As AgmT is a putative LTG for PG, we then tested if its predicted active site, Glu223, is required for gliding. Because the amino acid following Glu223 is also a glutamate (Glu224), we replaced both glutamate residues with alanine (AgmT<sup>EAEA</sup>) using site-directed mutagenesis to alter their codons on the chromosome. <italic>agmT</italic><sup>EAEA</sup> <italic>pilA</italic><sup>−</sup> cells were nonmotile (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Thus, the putative LTG activity of AgmT is essential for <italic>M. xanthus</italic> gliding motility.</p>

<p>Besides <italic>agmT</italic>, the genome of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> contains 13 genes that encode putative LTGs (<bold>Table S1</bold>). To test if these proteins also contribute to gliding, we knocked out each of these 13 genes in the <italic>pilA</italic><sup>−</sup> background. The resulting mutants all retained gliding motility, indicating that AgmT is the only LTG that is required for <italic>M. xanthus</italic> gliding (<bold>Fig. S1</bold>).</p>

<title>AgmT is an LTG</title>
<p>To determine if AgmT is an LTG, we expressed the periplasmic domain (amino acids 25 – 339) of wild-type AgmT and AgmT<sup>EAEA</sup> in <italic>E. coli</italic>. We purified PG from wild-type <italic>M. xanthus</italic> cells, labeled it with Remazol brilliant blue (RBB), and tested if the purified AgmT variants hydrolyze labeled PG <italic>in vitro</italic> and release the dye<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Similar to lysozyme that specifically cleaves the ®-1,4-glycosidic bonds in PG, wild-type AgmT solubilized dye-labeled <italic>M. xanthus</italic> PG that absorbs light at 595 nm. In contrast, the AgmT<sup>EAEA</sup> variant failed to release the dye (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Hence, AgmT displays LTG activity <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

</fig>
<p>Whereas AgmT does not affect growth rate (<bold>Fig. S2</bold>), cells that lacked AgmT or expressed AgmT<sup>EAEA</sup> maintained rod shape but were slightly shorter and wider than the wild-type ones (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Nevertheless, altered morphology alone does not likely account for abolished gliding. In fact, a previously reported mutant that lacks all three class A penicillin-binding proteins (<italic>⊗3</italic>) displays similarly shortened and widened morphology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, but is still motile by gliding (<bold>Fig. S1</bold>).</p>
<p>A recent report revealed that <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> MltG degrades un-crosslinked PG turnover products and prevents their detrimental accumulation in the periplasm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. To test if AgmT plays a similar role in <italic>M. xanthus</italic>, we used mecillinam to induce cell envelope stress. Mecillinam is a ®-lactam that induces the production of toxic, un-crosslinked PG strands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Rather than collapsing the rod shape, mecillinam only causes bulging near the centers of wild-type <italic>M. xanthus</italic> cells, whereas large-scale cell lysis does not occur and cell poles still maintain rod shape even after prolonged (20 h) treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Thus, wild-type <italic>M. xanthus</italic> can largely mitigate mecillinam stress. In contrast, mecillinam-treated <italic>agmT</italic> cells increased their width drastically, displayed significant cell surface irregularity along their entire cell bodies, and lysed frequently (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Cells expressing AgmT<sup>EAEA</sup> as the sole source of AgmT displayed similar, but even stronger phenotypes under mecillinam stress, growing into elongated, twisted filaments that formed multiple cell poles and lysed frequently (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). These results confirm that similar to <italic>V. cholerae</italic> MltG, <italic>M. xanthus</italic> AgmT is important for maintaining cell integrity under mecillinam stress. The different responses from <italic>agmT</italic> and <italic>agmT</italic><sup>EAEA</sup> cells suggest that AgmT could interact with other PG-related enzymes and that the inactive AgmT variant might still modulate PG through these enzymes. Alternatively, other LTGs could partially substitute AgmT while AgmT<sup>EAEA</sup> blocks these enzymes from accessing un-crosslinked PG strands.</p>

<title>AgmT is essential for bFACs assembly</title>
<p>How does AgmT support gliding? We first tested if AgmT regulates the function of the gliding motor. For this purpose, we quantified the motor dynamics by tracking single particles of AglR, an essential component of the motor. We spotted the cells that express a fully functional, photo-activatable mCherry (PAmCherry)-labeled AglR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> on 1.5% agar surface. We used a 405-nm excitation laser to activate the fluorescence of a few labeled AglR particles randomly in each cell and quantified their localization using a 561-nm laser at 10 Hz using single particle tracking photo-activated localization microscopy (sptPALM) under highly inclined and laminated optical sheet (HILO) illumination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Using this setting, only a thin section of each cell surface that was close to the coverslip was illuminated. To analyze the data, we only chose the fluorescent particles that remained in focus for 4 - 12 frames (0.4 - 1.2 s). As free PAmCherry particles diffuse extremely fast in the cytoplasm, entering and exiting the focal plane frequently, they usually appear as blurry objects that cannot be followed at 10-Hz close to the membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. For this reason, the noise from any potential degradation of AglR-PAmCherry was negligible.

<p>bFAC assembly is sensitive to mechanical cues. As the agar concentration increases in gliding substrate, more motor molecules engage in bFACs, where they appear immobile<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. We exposed <italic>aglR-PAmCherry</italic> cells to 405-nm excitation (0.2 kW/cm<sup>2</sup>) for 2 s, where most PAmCherry molecules were photoactivated and used epifluorescence to display the overall localization of AglR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. As the agar concentration increased bFACs increased significantly in size (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Accordingly, the immobile AglR particles detected by sptPALM increased from 10.7% (n = 1112) on 0.5% agar to 45.2% (n = 726) on 5.0% agar surface (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Thus, the stationary population of AglR-PAmCherry particles reflects the AglR molecules in fully assembled bFACs.</p>
<p>In contrast to the cells that expressed wild-type AgmT (<italic>agmT</italic><sup>+</sup>), AglR particles were hyper motile in the cells that lacked AgmT or expressed AgmT<sup>EAEA</sup>. On 1.5% agar surfaces, the immobile populations of AglR particles decreased to 10.5% (n = 2,989) and 11.7% (n = 1,408), respectively. Consistently, AglR-containing bFACs were not detectable in these cells, even on 5% agar surfaces (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-C</xref>).</p>
<p>To test if other components in the gliding machinery also depend on AgmT to assemble into bFACs, we tested the localization of AglZ, a cytoplasmic protein that is commonly used for assessing bFAC assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. In the cells that expressed wild-type AgmT, yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-labeled AglZ formed a bright cluster at the leading cell pole and multiple stationary, near-evenly spaced clusters along the cell body, indicating the assembly of bFACs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). In contrast, AglZ-YFP only formed single clusters at cell poles in the cells that lacked AgmT or expressed AgmT<sup>EAEA</sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Taken together, the LTG activity of AgmT is essential for bFACs assembly.</p>

<title>AgmT does not assemble into bFACs</title>
<p>We first hypothesized that AgmT itself could assemble into bFACs, where it could either generate pores in PG that allow the inner and outer gliding complexes interact directly or bind to PG and recruit other components to bFACs through protein-protein interactions. If this is the case, AgmT should localize in bFACs. To test this possibility, we labeled AgmT with PAmCherry on its C-terminus and expressed the fusion protein as the sole source of AgmT using the native promoter and locus of <italic>agmT</italic>. <italic>agmT-PAmCherry pilA</italic><sup>−</sup> cells displayed gliding motility that was indistinguishable from <italic>pilA</italic><sup>−</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), indicating that the fusion protein is functional. Immunoblot using an anti-mCherry antibody showed that AgmT-PAmCherry accumulated in two bands that corresponded to monomers and dimers of the full-length fusion protein, respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). This result is consistent with the structure of <italic>E. coli</italic> MltG that functions as homodimers (PDB: 2r1f). Importantly, AgmT-PAmCherry was about 50 times more abundant than AglR-PAmCherry (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). To test if AgmT itself assembles into bFACs, we first expressed AgmT-PAmCherry and AglZ-YFP together using their respective loci and promoter. We exposed <italic>agmT-PAmCherry</italic> cells to 405-nm excitation (0.2 kW/cm<sup>2</sup>) for 2 s to visualize the overall localization of AgmT. We found that on a 1.5% agar surface that favors gliding motility, AglZ aggregated into bFACs whereas AgmT localized near evenly along cell bodies without forming protein clusters (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Thus, AgmT does not localize into bFACs. These results echo the fact that despite its abundance, AgmT has not been identified as a component in bFACs despite extensive pull-down experiments using various bFAC components as baits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>We reasoned that if AgmT assembles into bFACs, AgmT and gliding motors should display similar dynamic patterns. To test this possibility further, we used sptPALM to track the movements of AgmT-PAmCherry single particles on 1.5 agar surfaces at 10 Hz. Distinct from the AglR particles of which 32.1% remained stationary, AgmT moved in a diffusive manner, showing no significant immobile population. Importantly, compared to the diffusion coefficients (<italic>D</italic>) of mobile AglR particles (1.8 · 10<sup>−2</sup> ± 3.6 · 10<sup>−3</sup> ⎧m<sup>2</sup>/s (n = 1,833)), AgmT particles diffused much faster (<italic>D</italic> = 2.9 · 10<sup>−2</sup> ± 5.3 · 10<sup>−3</sup> ⎧m<sup>2</sup>/s (n = 8,548)). Taken together, neither the localization nor dynamics of AgmT displayed significant correlation with bFAC components. We thus conclude that AgmT does not assemble into bFACs</p>

<sec id="s2e">
<title>AgmT connects bFACs to PG through its LTG activity</title>
<p>We then explored the possibility that AgmT could modify PG through its LTG activity and thus generate the anchor sites for certain components in bFACs. If this hypothesis is true, heterologous expression of a non-native LTG could rescue gliding motility in the <italic>⊗agmT</italic> strain. To test this hypothesis, we fused the <italic>E. coli mltG</italic> gene (<italic>mltG</italic><sub>Ec</sub>) to a vanillate-inducible promoter and inserted the resulting construct to the <italic>cuoA</italic> locus on <italic>M. xanthus</italic> chromosome that does not interfere gliding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. We subjected the <italic>⊗agmT</italic> and <italic>agmT</italic><sup>EAEA</sup> cells that expressed MltG<sub>Ec</sub> to mecillinam (100 ⎧g/ml) stress. Induced by 100 ⎧M sodium vanillate, MltG<sub>Ec</sub> restored cell morphology and integrity of the <italic>⊗agmT</italic> strain to the wild-type level (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). This result confirmed that MltG<sub>Ec</sub> was expressed and enzymatically active in <italic>M. xanthus</italic>. In contrast, MltG<sub>Ec</sub> failed to confer mecillinam resistance to the <italic>agmT</italic><sup>EAEA</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). A potential explanation is that AgmT<sup>EAEA</sup> could still bind to PG and thus block MltG<sub>Ec</sub> from accessing <italic>M. xanthus</italic> PG. Consistent with its activity, MltG<sub>Ec</sub> restored gliding motility in the <italic>agmT pilA</italic> cells but not in the <italic>agmT</italic><sup>EAEA</sup> <italic>pilA</italic> ones (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). As MltG<sub>Ec</sub> substitutes AgmT in gliding motility, it is the LTG activity, rather than specific interactions between AgmT and bFACs, that is required for gliding.</p>
<p>It is challenging to visualize how AgmT facilitates bFAC assembly through its enzymatic activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. First, the inner complex in a bFAC spans the cytoplasm, inner membrane, and periplasm and contains multiple proteins whose activities are interdependent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. It is hence difficult to purify the entire inner complex in its functional state. Second, Faure <italic>et al</italic>. hypothesized that AglQ and AglS in the gliding motor could bind PG directly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. However, such binding has not been proved experimentally due to the difficulty in purifying the membrane integral AglRQS complex. To overcome these difficulties, we used AglR-PAmCherry to represent the inner complex of bFAC and investigated how bFACs bind PG in their native environment. To do so, we expressed AglR-PAmCherry in different genetic backgrounds as the sole source of AglR using the native <italic>aglR</italic> locus and promoter. We lysed these cells using sonication, subjected their lysates to centrifugation, isolated the pellets that contained PG, and detected the presence of AglR-PAmCherry in these pellets by immunoblots using a mCherry antibody. Eliminating AgmT and disabling its active site significantly reduced the amounts of AglR in the pellets (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Because such pellets contain both the PG and membrane fractions, we further eliminated PG in cell lysates using lysozyme before centrifugation and determined the amount of AglR-PAmCherry in the pellets that only contained membrane fractions. Regardless of the presence and activity of AgmT, comparable amounts of AglR precipitated in centrifugation pellets after lysozyme treatment, indicating that AgmT does not affect the expression or stability of AglR (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Thus, active AgmT facilitates the association between bFACs and PG. Strikingly, the heterologous expression of MltG<sub>Ec</sub> enriched AglR-PAmCherry in the PG-containing pellets from the <italic>⊗agmT</italic> cells but not the <italic>agmT</italic><sup>EAEA</sup> ones (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). These results indicate that AgmT connects bFACs to PG through its LTG activity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Gliding bacteria adopt a broad spectrum of nanomachineries. Compared to the trans-envelope secretion system that drives gliding in <italic>Flavobacterium johnsoniae</italic> and <italic>Capnocytophaga gingivalis</italic> that both contain PG, the gliding machinery of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> appears to lack a stable structure that transverses cell envelope, especially across the PG layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. In order to generate mechanical force from the fluid <italic>M. xanthus</italic> gliding machinery, the inner complex must establish solid contact with PG and push the outer complex to slide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. In this work, we discovered AgmT as the long-sought factor that connects bFACs to PG. Such connection not only satisfies the requirement for force generation but is also essential for bFAC assembly.</p>
<p>It is rather unexpected that AgmT itself does not assemble into bFACs. Because MltG<sub>Ec</sub> substitutes AgmT in gliding, rather than interacting with bFAC components specifically, AgmT facilitates bFAC assembly through its LTG activity. A few possibilities could explain the function of AgmT. First, LTGs usually break glycan strands and produce unique anhydro caps on their ends<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Certain components in bFACs could specifically bind to such modified glycan strands in PG and further recruit other components. Second, AgmT could generate small openings all over the PG meshwork that allow the inner and outer subcomplexes in bFACs to interact locally. Third, AgmT could reduce the overall rigidity of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> PG, allow the bulky inner subcomplexes to deform the PG layer, and thus establish a viscous coupling between bFACs and PG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Then how does AgmT, a protein localized diffusively, facilitate bFAC assembly into near-evenly spaced foci? The actin homolog MreB is the only protein in bFACs that displays quasiperiodic localization independent of other components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. <italic>M. xanthus</italic> MreB assembles into bFACs and positions the latter near evenly along the cell body<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. MreB filaments change their orientation in accordance with local membrane curvatures and could hence respond to mechanical cues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Strikingly, <italic>M. xanthus</italic> does assemble bFACs in response to substrate hardness (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>) and assembled bFACs could distort the cell envelope, generating undulations on the cell surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Taken together, whereas AgmT potentially modifies the entire PG layer, it is still the quasiperiodic MreB filaments that determine the loci for bFAC assembly in response to the mechanical cues from the gliding substrate.</p>
<p>Most bacteria encode multiple LTGs that function in PG growth, remodeling, and recycling. Trans-envelope structures often require highly specialized LTGs to penetrate PG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. This work provides an example that macro bacterial machineries domesticate non-specialized LTGs for specialized functions. Other examples include MltD in the <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> flagellum and MltE in the <italic>E. coli</italic> type VI secretion system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Both <italic>M. xanthus</italic> AgmT and <italic>E. col</italic>i MltG belong to the YceG family, which is the first identified LTG family that is conserved in both Gram-negative and positive bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. LTGs in this family localize to the inner membrane and feature periplasmic transglycosylase domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Due to their unique localization, the YceG family LTGs are important for determining the length of nascent glycan strands and for degrading the toxic un-crosslinked strands from futile PG synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Due to the wide distribution of YceG family LTGs, it is challenging to study how the unique <italic>M. xanthus</italic> gliding machinery adopts AgmT in evolution. Nevertheless, the fact that AgmT is the only <italic>M. xanthus</italic> LTG that belongs to this family (<bold>Table S2</bold>) could partially explain why it is the only LTG that has been adopted by the gliding machinery. It will be interesting to investigate if other LTGs, once anchored to the inner membrane, could also facilitate bFAC assembly.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript nicely outlines a conceptual problem with the bFAC model in A-motility, namely, how is the energy produced by the inner membrane AglRQS motor transduced through the cell wall into mechanical force on the cell surface to drive motility? To address this, the authors make a significant contribution by identifying and characterizing a lytic transglycosylase (LTG) called AgmT. This work thus provides clues and a future framework work for addressing mechanical force transmission between the cytoplasm and the cell surface.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Convincing evidence shows AgmT functions as an LTG and, surprisingly, that mltG from E. coli complements the swarming defect of an agmT mutant.</p>
<p>(2) Authors show agmT mutants develop morphological changes in response to treatment with a -lactam antibiotic, mecillinam.</p>
<p>(3) The use of single-molecule tracking to monitor the assembly and dynamics of bFACs in WT and mutant backgrounds.</p>
<p>(4) The authors understand the limitations of their work and do not overinterpret their data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) A clear model of AgmT's role in gliding motility or interactions with other A-motility proteins is not provided. Instead, speculative roles for how AgmT enzymatic activity could facilitate bFAC function in A-motility are discussed.</p>
<p>(2) Although agmT mutants do not swarm, in-depth phenotypic analysis is lacking. In particular, do individual agmT mutant cells move, as found with other swarming defective mutants, or are agmT mutants completely nonmotile, as are motor mutants?</p>
<p>(3) The bioinformatic and comparative genomics analysis of agmT is incomplete. For example, the sequence relationships between AgmT, MltG, and the 13 other LTG proteins in M. xanthus are not clear. Is E. coli MltG the closest homology to AgmT? Their relationships could be addressed with a phylogenetic tree and/or sequence alignments. Furthermore, are there other A-motility genes in proximity to agmT? Similarly, does agmT show specific co-occurrences with the other A-motility genes across genera/species?</p>
<p>(4) Related to iii, what about the functional relationship of the endogenous 13 LTG genes? Although knockout mutants were shown to be motile, presumably because AgmT is present, can overexpression of them, similar to E. coli MltG, complement an agmT mutant? In other words, why does MltG complement and the endogenous LTG proteins appear not to be relevant?</p>
<p>(5) Based on Figure 2B, overexpression of MltG enhances A-motility compared to the parent strain and the agmT-PAmCh complemented strain, is this actually true? Showing expanded swarming colony phenotypes would help address this question.</p>
<p>(6) Cell flexibility is correlated with gliding motility function in M. xanthus. Since AgmT has LTG activity, are agmT mutants less flexible than WT cells and is this the cause of their motility defect?</p>

<p>The manuscript by Carbo et al. reports a novel role for the MltG homolog AgmT in gliding motility in M. xanthus. The authors conclusively show that AgmT is a cell wall lytic enzyme (likely a lytic transglycosylase), its lytic activity is required for gliding motility, and that its activity is required for proper binding of a component of the motility apparatus to the cell wall. The data are generally well-controlled. The marked strength of the manuscript includes the detailed characterization of AgmT as a cell wall lytic enzyme, and the careful dissection of its role in motility. Using multiple lines of evidence, the authors conclusively show that AgmT does not directly associate with the motility complexes, but that instead its absence (or the overexpression of its active site mutant) results in the failure of focal adhesion complexes to properly interact with the cell wall.</p>
<p>An interpretive weakness is the rather direct role attributed to AgmT in focal adhesion assembly. While their data clearly show that AgmT is important, it is unclear whether this is the direct consequence of AgmT somehow promoting bFAC binding to PG or just an indirect consequence of changed cell wall architecture without AgmT. In E. coli, an MltG mutant has increased PG strain length, suggesting that M. xanthus's PG architecture may likewise be compromised in a way that precludes AglR binding to the cell wall. However, this distinction would be very difficult to establish experimentally. MltG has been shown to associate with active cell wall synthesis in E.c oli in the absence of protein-protein interactions, and one could envision a similar model in M. xanthus, where active cell wall synthesis is required for focal adhesion assembly, and MltG makes an important contribution to this process.</p>
