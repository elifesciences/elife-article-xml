<title>Abstract</title><p>It takes more than twenty years for normal colorectal mucosa to develop into metastatic carcinoma. The long time window provides a golden opportunity for early detection to terminate the malignant progression. Here we aim to enable liquid biopsy of T1a stage colorectal cancer (CRC) and precancerous advanced adenoma (AA) by profiling circulating small extracellular vesicle (sEV)-derived RNAs. We exhibited a full RNA landscape for the circulating sEVs isolated from 60 participants. A total of 58,333 annotated RNAs were detected from plasma sEVs, among which 1,615 and 888 sEV-RNAs were found differentially expressed in plasma from T1a stage CRC and AA compared to normal controls (NC). Then we further categorized these sEV-RNAs into 6 modules by a weighted gene coexpression network analysis and constructed a 60-gene t-SNE model consisting of the top 10 RNAs of each module that could well distinguish T1a stage CRC/AA from NC samples. Some sEV-RNAs were also identified as indicators of specific endoscopic and morphological features of different colorectal lesions. The top-ranked biomarkers were further verified by RT-qPCR, proving that these candidate sEV-RNAs successfully identified T1a stage CRC/AA from NC in another cohort of 124 participants. Finally, we adopted different algorithms to improve the performance of RT-qPCR-based models and successfully constructed an optimized classifier with 79.3% specificity and 99.0% sensitivity. In conclusion, circulating sEVs of T1a stage CRC and AA patients have distinct RNA profiles, which successfully enable the detection of both T1a stage CRC and AA via liquid biopsy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>With 1,880,725 new cases and 915,880 deaths, colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as the 3rd most commonly diagnosed and 2nd most lethal cancer worldwide in 2020.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> Both the incidence and mortality of CRC in developing countries are gradually increasing due to rapid social- economic improvement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> Even though a remarkably high CRC incidence was observed in developed areas, such as Europe and North America, the mortality of CRC has dramatically decreased over the past decade owing to the continuous improvement of multidisciplinary treatment and the promotion of CRC screening programs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> Noticeably, endoscopic treatments enable radical resection of T1a stage CRC without open surgery, and the 5-year survival rate of those patients has been improved to over 90%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> Advanced adenoma (AA) is the crucial precancerous lesion of CRC, which is also resectable under endoscopy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> About 40% of AA patients could progress to invasive CRC within 10 years, which provided a very wide window of opportunity for curative treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> Unfortunately, most AA patients were asymptomatic, and hard to be identified by opportunistic screening. Thus, early diagnosis of CRC and precancerous AA is of vital importance.</p>
<p>Endoscopy is the main approach for the screening of CRC and AA, whereas the invasiveness and complicated operation procedures largely restricted its application in asymptomatic populations. For most endoscopy screening programs, participants are simply pre-selected by their age and other epidemiological factors, resulting in low compliance and unsatisfactory cost-effectiveness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> Fecal occult blood test (FOBT) and fecal immunohistochemistry test (FIT) are also popular in identifying individuals of high CRC/AA risk, whereas their sensitivities are far from satisfactory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> The performances of FOBT and FIT to detect AA are especially disappointing, which exhibited a sensitivity of 20% (95% CI 6.8% to 40.7%) and 32% (95% CI 14.9% to 53.5%), respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> Therefore, the invention of alternative technologies allowing early CRC and AA detection with minimal invasion is urgently needed.</p>
<p>Extracellular vesicles are various-sized membrane particles derived from host cells, which become a new source of biomarkers in liquid biopsy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) of 40-100nm diameter isolated by 100K ultracentrifugation were mostly considered to be exosomes, which derived from endosomes and participated in cell-cell communication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> There are plenty of RNA species stuffed in sEVs, and one major function of sEVs is the delivery of functional donor cell RNAs to the recipient cell.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> Additionally, the phospholipid bilayer of sEVs could effectively protect enclosed RNA from the RNase in the environment,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> thus making sEV-RNA a relatively stable detection target. Consequently, for the diversity of enclosed RNAs and the properties of being protected from degradation by RNase,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> the sEV- RNAs become an attractive treasury of biomarkers in cancer diagnosis.</p>
<p>Many studies have already reported the function of sEV-RNAs in the progress of many diseases and their potential application in diagnosis and prognosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> However, even though it is generally accepted that a landscape profiling of the contents from plasma EVs would largely facilitate the progress of biomarker discovery in liquid-biopsy of cancers, systematic screening of plasma sEV-RNAs is extremely hampered by the highly instrument-dependent, time-consuming isolation of sEVs from plasma and the exquisite manipulating of tiny amount RNA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> Previously, with a modified differential centrifugation (DC) procedure,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> we isolated sEVs from plasma and characterized those sEVs according to the MISEV2018 guideline.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> Then we proved that sEVs encapsuled miRNAs outperformed their free-floating counterparts in diagnostic liquid-biopsy, which proposed a new promising biomarker category.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> We also verified the abnormal abundance of several miRNAs in the circulating sEVs of CRC patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> However, even though the sEV miRNAs have already been carefully investigated, the panorama of circulating sEV-RNAs in CRC patients has not been revealed yet. Additionally, detecting AA by liquid biopsy could also be much more challenging than detecting CRC since AA always exhibited a smaller size and fewer vascular inside networks as compared to CRC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>To strengthen the ability of sEV biomarkers in identifying both T1a stage CRC and AA, here we accomplished the first whole-transcriptomic profiling of circulating sEV-RNAs in a large cohort with 60 participants, including T1a stage CRC, AA, and normal controls (NC). The identification of CRC or AA-specific lncRNA and mRNA largely extended the sEVs biomarker repertoire, considering there were more than 50,000 lncRNA and mRNA species, nearly 25 times of known miRNA species.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> Finally, with a comprehensive analysis of plasma sEVs, we obtained the T1a stage CRC and precancerous AA-specific sEV-RNA landscape, proposed a 10-gene signature, and verified its ability in identifying T1a stage CRC and AA in another cohort of 124 participants (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>TEM imaging showed that the sEVs isolated from plasma exhibited cup-shaped, vesicle- like structures (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref></bold>). NTA analysis revealed a heterogeneous size distribution ranging between 75nm to 200nm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). Western blot analysis exhibited an enrichment of sEVs markers (CD63, TSG101, and Alix) and an absence of Calnexin, a negative marker of sEVs, indicating that the isolated fractions consisted mostly of sEVs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>). The total RNA levels of the sEVs fractions were also assessed, and an EV-associated RNA concentration of 3.70Â±2.39ng per mL plasma was reported.</p>

<p>For RNA profiling, a total of 58,333 annotated genes, including 2,694 miRNAs, 24,927 mRNAs, and 30,712 lncRNAs, were detected. The numbers of detected miRNA species are almost equal among different groups, while there were slightly more mRNA and lncRNA species in T1a stage CRC than in NC/AA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among different groups were filtered by an FDR-adjusted ANOVA p-value. The top 100 miRNAs, mRNAs, and lncRNAs could roughly distinguish T1a stage CRC patients from AA and NC participants by unsupervised hierarchical clustering, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2e</xref>). The clustering results using all those 300 RNAs exhibited clear discrimination between T1a stage CRC/AA patients and NC participants, and crude discrimination between T1a stage CRC and AA patients (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>âfigure supplement 1). Unsupervised t-SNE clustering by those 300 RNAs provided a very clear separation of T1a stage CRC, AA, and NC individuals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2f</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>âfigure supplement 2).</p>
<p>The DEGs under comparisons between any two groups were identified by the Mann- Whitney U tests, and the overlaps of those DEGs were shown in a Venn diagram (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2g</xref>, Table S1-9). Noticeably, there were 888 DEGs between AA and NC, and 519 (58%) of them overlapped with DEGs between T1a stage CRC and NC, suggesting most sEV-RNAs in AA remained abnormally expressed while progressing to T1a stage CRC. KEGG pathway analysis suggested that those DEGs were enriched in Pathways in cancer, MAPK signaling, Focal Adhesion, <italic>etc.</italic>, indicating a close relationship with cancer progression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2h</xref>). Additionally, the potential core regulatory networks between miRNAs and mRNAs in those DEGs were also exhibited (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3i-k</xref>).</p>

<title>Cell-specific features of the sEV-RNA profile indicated the different proportion of cells of sEV origin among different groups</title>
<p>We employed the ssGSEA algorithm to calculate the correlations between the sEV-RNA profile of each sample and the transcriptome characteristics of different cells to investigate the possible difference in the proportion of cells of sEV origin among different groups. The immune cell-specific features of each sample were shown in <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref></bold>, and the stromal- related features were shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>. The complete landscape of cell-specific features of the sEV-RNA profile were shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>âfigure supplement 1a. Generally, plasma sEV- RNAs of different groups showed distinct cell-specific features. Especially, sEV-RNA of CC and RC showed higher expression levels of RNA markers of inflammation-promoting cells, MHC class I, HLA, TIL, and Paneth cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>). Correspondingly, RNA markers of DC cells, Mast cells, and Enterocyte cells were mostly enriched in sEV-RNAs of NC and AA compared to those of CC and RC (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref>).</p>
<p>According to those cell-specific features, the tumor microenvironment-associated scores were calculated. The sEV-RNAs of CC, RC, and AA exhibited significantly higher Immune scores and significantly higher Estimate scores as compared to those of NC, whereas the NC group possessed the highest Stromal score (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref>). Then we estimated the possible correlation among different cell-specific features, and a strong correlation among Inflammation promoting cells, MHC class I, HLA, TILs, Paneth cells, and Paneth-like cells was identified (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3f</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>âfigure supplement 1b). Taking all together, cell-specific features of the sEV-RNA profile indicated that there is a higher proportion of inflammatory cell-originated sEVs in the plasma of CC, RC, and AA patients as compared to NC participants.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>sEV-derived DEGs could be divided into 6 WGCNA modules</title>
<p>We performed WGCNA to reveal the inner correlation between DEGs and clinical parameters. Six coexpression modules were constructed based on the expression levels of 1525 DEGs in each sample by WGCNA (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref></bold>). The associations among different modules were shown in a heatmap (all DEGs with kME&gt;0.7 in each module were used for calculating the Pearson correlation), revealing relatively high correlations between the green and turquoise modules, and between the blue and brown modules (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>). Additionally, the number and percentage of different RNA species in each module were also displayed in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4d</xref>, while the distributions of DEGs with kME&gt;0.7 were shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>âfigure supplement 1. Noticeably, most miRNAs were categorized into the brown module, suggesting that the abundances of those sEV-miRNAs could be affected by the same factors, which further enhanced the necessity of including mRNAs and lncRNAs as additional biomarkers to cover as many patients as possible.</p>

</fig>
<p>The expression levels of the top 10 DEGs in each module were shown in a heatmap (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4e</xref>). We further used those DEGs for t-SNE analysis to cluster different samples and obtained a nearly perfect separation of T1a stage CRC, AA, and NC individuals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4f</xref>). In light of this result, we then tried to reduce the number of DEGs used for t-SNE analysis by picking only the top 5 DEGs and the top 1 DEG from each module, respectively. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4g</xref>, when enrolled more DEGs of each module, the overall distinguishing effect significantly increased with less sample mis-clustered. Noticeably, the top 1 DEG from each module could separate the NC samples from T1a stage CRC and AA samples very clearly, meanwhile, CRC samples could also be blurrily separated from AA samples with only 3 exceptions.

<p>In brief, the DEG modules we identified in WGCNA showed a close association with morphological features of colorectal tumors, which was also well verified in RT-qPCR of representative sEV-RNAs. For example, flat lesions (subtype II) cases exhibited overexpressed MT-ND2 (blue module) levels in plasma sEVs as compared to protruding lesions (subtype Is/Ip/Isp) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6b</xref>, left panel), while LST tumors showed a relatively higher level of HIST2H2AA4 (green module) than non-LST tumors (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6b</xref>, right panel).</p>
<p>Unsupervised hierarchical clustering suggested that sEV-RNAs of those three modules could not only separate T1a stage CRC/AA from NC but also roughly distinguish CRC and AA samples with different endoscopic classifications and other clinical features, such as LST and location (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6c</xref>). The inner correlations among sEV-RNAs in the same module were also evaluated and exhibited by Circos plots. The top 2 sEV-RNAs of the green module exhibited a very strong correlation with each other (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6d</xref>), while in other modules (red and black) the top 6 sEV-RNAs showed relative average correlation coefficients with each other (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6ef</xref>).</p>

<p>We extracted all sEV-RNAs upregulated in CRC or AA using a 4-fold change cutoff (Table S10, S11). High-abundance sEV-RNAs were considered more appropriate for RT-qPCR quantification since they are much easier to detect in liquid biopsy-obtained trace samples. Therefore, we excluded all low-abundance sEV-RNAs (median TPM &lt;50). A signature covering more different modules is preferred since it includes more orthogonal factors in prediction. Thus, the candidate sEV-RNAs were finally selected based on their fold change in CRC/AA, absolute abundance, and module attribution (<bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Simultaneously detecting AA and CRC by a RT-qPCR-based sEV-RNA signature</title>
<p>The expression levels of those candidate sEV-RNAs were quantified by RT-qPCR in an independent cohort of 124 participants. Lasso regression was applied to select the most effective variables from all candidate sEV-RNAs to construct a multivariate CRC prediction model (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>âfigure supplement 1).

Furthrtmore, we assessed the discriminative effects of CRC on NC, taking into account different age groups, genders, tumor sizes, and tumor anatomical locations.

<p>Additionally, we adopted quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) to demonstrate the possibility of the plasma sEV-RNA signature for direct sample classification. An overall accuracy of 78% (ranging from 63% to 100%) was obtained for direct sample classification (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7ij</xref>). Generally, the individuals classified into AA/CC/RC are considered as high-risk and should be advised to further endoscopic examination, and our QDA classifier provided a specificity of 79.25%, and a sensitivity of 99.0% (with only one CC sample missed) in identifying those high-risk individuals. Together, our RT-qPCR-based plasma sEVs-RNA signature could be a powerful and better alternative to FIT and FOBT tests in CRC and precancerous AA screening programs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Previously, we proved that plasma sEV-encapsulated miRNAs outperformed their free- floating counterparts in the diagnostic liquid biopsy of cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> However, whole- transcriptomic profiling of plasma sEVs is much more challenging and highly attractive, as there are many more long transcript species than miRNAs in plasma sEVs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> Additionally, mRNAs and lncRNAs encapsulated in sEVs manifested very important functions during carcinogenesis and cancer progression. For example, lncARSR in sEVs promoted sunitinib resistance in renal cancer in a ceRNA-dependent manner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> Similarly, sEV-delivered HChrR6 mRNA showed a therapeutic effect in the treatment of human HER2(+) breast cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> Thus, whole-transcriptomic profiling of circulating sEVs would not only facilitate the minimally invasive diagnosis of T1a stage CRC but also promote our understanding of the microenvironment change during CRC carcinogenesis.</p>
<p>Here we identified 2,694 miRNAs (1,838 known, 856 novel), 24,927 mRNAs (18,947 known, 5,980 novel), and 30,712 lncRNAs (12,928 known, 17,784 novel) in human circulating sEVs. A total of 2,621 RNA species showed a primary potential in distinguishing colorectal tumors from others, which was a great treasury of biomarker candidates in liquid biopsy. The profiling of circulating sEV-RNAs for early detection of CRC and AA we provided here, which is, to our knowledge, not only the first published whole-transcriptomic profile (including miRNA, mRNA, and lncRNA) dataset from human plasma EVs, but also the first attempt to simultaneously diagnose early CRC and precancerous AA by a plasma sEV-RNA signature. It is also worth noting that Zheng <italic>et al.</italic> reported a data-independent acquisition (DIA)-mass spectrometry (MS) based protein profiling of circulating sEVs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> The plasma sEV- protein signature exhibited very good performance, especially for CRC patients with liver metastases. Thus, here we also suggested that a comprehensive biomarker panel consisting of both plasma sEV-RNAs and proteins could be very promising in identifying both early and advanced CRC patients in the future.</p>
<p>Our results proved that sEV-RNAs could well separate T1a stage CRC, AA, and NC from each other, indicating a significant overall change of plasma sEV-RNA profile during the whole process of CRC carcinogenesis. We also found that those sEV-RNAs were enriched in pathways associated with cancer, MAPK signaling, Focal adhesion, <italic>etc.</italic>, suggesting those sEV-encapsulated RNAs could be potentially effective. Noticeably, those sEV-RNAs were not necessarily originated from cancer cells, since target-selecting procedures, such as anti- EpCAM-based immuno-capture,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> were not conducted before sEVs isolation. Nevertheless, biomarker studies that enrolled all possible biomarkers regardless of their origination could provide a larger candidate pool, a higher abundance and detectability, and a simplified procedure for easier detection of given targets. Detailed single sEV analysis or other methodology revealing sEV-RNA heterogeneity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> could further improve the performance of sEV-based liquid biopsy and reveal the underlying molecular mechanisms.</p>
<p>Here we provided a 6-RNA signature based on the RNA-seq data, which exhibited a good effect in distinguishing T1a stage CRC, AA from NC. The simplicity of this signature is quite inspiring but not surprising, considering it took advantage of the discrimination efficiency of sEV-RNAs and the orthogonality between WGCNA modules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> Some but not all of the key sEV-RNAs we identified have already been reported involved in carcinogenesis. For example, miR-425-5p was reported in promoting CRC via BRAF/RAS/MAPK Pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> Hypoxia- induced let-7f-5p regulated osteosarcoma cell proliferation and invasion by inhibiting the Wnt signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> Additionally, patients with higher PPDPF expression exhibited worse prognosis than others,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> while high HIST1H2BK levels predicted poor prognosis in glioma patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> Further investigation on the functions of other key sEV-RNAs was needed to provide a full landscape of the molecular mechanism of their roles during carcinogenesis.</p>
<p>To facilitate the clinical application of sEV-RNAs in CRC screening, an RT-qPCR-based assay was designed. RNA candidates were selected from the sEV-RNAs identified by RNA- seq under a tradeoff between expected performance and RT-qPCR detectability, and sEV-RNAs with higher abundance distributed in different modules were preferred. Although we got a good performance for this sEV-RNA signature, other gene selection strategies were also worth trying and improved results could also be possibly achieved by a more meticulous pipeline considering other factors such as sample-specific effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> To maximize the performance of given sEV-RNA signatures, we compared the traditional logistic regression model with two popular machine learning algorithms, <italic>ie.</italic> SVM and Lasso regression. The SVM model and Lasso model showed higher AUC in identifying T1a stage CRC and AA, respectively. QDA analysis was also tested for a direct classification of different samples, which exhibited a specificity of 79.25%, and a sensitivity of 99.0%. Those efforts also highlighted the power of modeling algorithm selection in biomarker discovery and utilization.</p>
<p>Detecting sEV-RNAs could also provide more data beyond diagnosis. The modules we identified in WGCNA showed a very close association with morphological features of colorectal tumors, which was also verified in RT-qPCR analysis of representative sEV-RNAs. For example, LST tumors showed a relatively higher level of plasma sEV-derived HIST2H2AA4 than non-LST tumors, while flat lesions exhibited overexpressed plasma sEV- derived MT-ND2 levels than protruding lesions. Considering the higher HIST2H2AA4 mRNAs and MT-ND2 mRNAs in tissues could reflect a higher proliferation rate and higher energy metabolism,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> their elevated levels in sEVs could be a potential indicator of invasiveness. Though those interpretations are hypothetical, the fact that one could get biological information on cancerous and precancerous tumors from plasma sEVs is still inspiring. Hence we believed that in-depth data mining of sEV-RNAs acquired by liquid biopsy would be helpful in different scenarios of healthcare decision-making.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p>
<p>Detection of early-stage colorectal cancer is of great importance. Recently, both laboratory scientists and clinicians have reported different exosomal biomarkers to identify colorectal cancer patients.</p>
<p>Here, the authors exhibited a full RNA landscape for plasma exosomes of 60 individuals, including 31 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, 19 advanced adenoma (AA) patients, and 10 noncancerous controls. RNAs with high fold change, high absolute abundance, and various module attribution were used to construct RT-qPCR-based RNA models for CRC and AA detection.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a well-performed proof-of-concept study to highlight exosomal RNAs as potential biomarkers of early-stage colorectal cancer and its precancerous lesions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your careful evaluation and valuable suggestions, which have provided valuable guidance for the improvement of our paper. In response to your feedback, we have implemented the following improvements.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) Depicting the full RNA landscape of circulating exosomes is still quite challenging. The authors annotated 58,333 RNA species in exosomes, most of which were lncRNAs, but the authors do not explain how they characterized those RNAs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Author response and action taken: Thanks for your comments. In the Supplementary Methods section titled &quot;Identification of mRNAs and lncRNAs&quot;, we have provided a comprehensive explanation on the characterization of mRNAs and lncRNAs to address the concerns you raised. Characterization of long-chain RNAs is a great challenge. For lncRNA analysis, the transcriptome was assembled using the Cufflinks and Scripture based on the reads mapped to the reference genome. The assembled transcripts were annotated using the Cuffcompare program from the Cufflinks package. The unknown transcripts were used to screen for putative lncRNAs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors tested their models in a medium size population of 124 individuals, which is not enough to obtain an accurate evaluation of the specificity and sensitivity of the biomarkers proposed here. External validation would be required.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Author response and action taken: Thanks for your comments. We fully acknowledge the significance of external validations in the evaluation of diagnostic model performance. Unfortunately, as a pilot study, we currently do not have the conditions for a multicenter investigation. To mitigate result bias and overfitting effects, we implemented a rigorous variable selection strategy and enhanced model stability through 10-fold cross-validation. In the meantime, we will persist in our efforts to elevate the quality of our research and seek additional resources for external validation in future studies.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p>
<p>The authors present an important study on the potential of small extracellular vesicle (sEV)-derived RNAs as biomarkers for the early detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) and precancerous adenoma (AA). The authors provide a detailed analysis of the RNA landscape of sEVs isolated from participants, identifying differentially expressed sEV-RNAs associated with T1a stage CRC and AA compared to normal controls. The paper further categorises these sEV-RNAs into modules and constructs a 60-gene model that successfully distinguishes CRC/AA from NC samples. The authors also validate their findings using RT-qPCR and propose an optimised classifier with high specificity and sensitivity. Additionally, the authors discuss the potential of sEV-RNAs in understanding CRC carcinogenesis and suggest that a comprehensive biomarker panel combining sEV-RNAs and proteins could be promising for identifying both early and advanced CRC patients. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the potential clinical application of sEV-RNAs in liquid biopsy for the early detection of CRC and AA.</p>
<p>Major strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Comprehensive sEV RNA profiling: The study provides a valuable dataset of the whole-transcriptomic profile of circulating sEVs, including miRNA, mRNA, and lncRNA. This approach adds to the understanding of sEV-RNAs' role in CRC carcinogenesis and facilitates the discovery of potential biomarkers.</p>
<p>(2) Detection of early-stage CRC and AA: The developed 60-gene t-SNE model successfully differentiated T1a stage CRC/AA from normal controls with high specificity and sensitivity, indicating the potential of sEV-RNAs as diagnostic markers for early-stage colorectal lesions.</p>
<p>(3) Independent validation cohort: The study combines RNA-seq, RT-qPCR, and modelling algorithms to select and validate candidate sEV-RNAs, maximising the performance of the developed RNA signature. The comparison of different algorithms and consideration of other factors enhance the robustness of the findings.</p>

<p>Thank you for your careful evaluation and valuable suggestions. These comments have been highly valuable for the performance evaluation and clinical applications of our work. In response to your feedback, we have implemented the following improvements.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1). Lack of analysis on T1-only patients in the validation cohort: While the study identifies key sEV-RNAs associated with T1a stage CRC and AA, the validation cohort is only half of the patients in T1(25 out of 49). It would be better to do an analysis using only the T1 patients in the validation cohort, so the conclusion is not affected by the T2-T3 patients.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Author response and action taken: Thanks for your comments. This feedback is essential for ensuring consistency in the results with our previous findings. In this context, we revalidated various diagnostic panels using exclusively Stage I patients (Figure 7âfigure supplement 2). To minimize the potential overfitting effect due to the reduction in sample size after partitioning, we implemented a 10-fold cross-validation for each panel and these panels exhibit promising performance in Stage I colorectal cancer (CRC) patients.</p>

<p>(2). Lack of performance analysis across different demographic and tumor pathology factors listed in Supplementary Table 12. It's important to know if the sEV-RNAs identified in the study work better/worse in different age/sex/tumor size/Yamada subtypes etc.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Author response and action taken: Thanks for your comments. This feedback will be immensely beneficial for clinical diagnosis. Similarly, cross-validation was performed in this section. We assessed the discriminative effects of CRC on NC, taking into account different age groups, genders, tumor sizes, and anatomical locations (Figure 7âfigure supplement 3). Overall, these sEV RNA panels perform better in individuals under the age of 55 and in female patients. There is no significant difference in discriminative effects across different tumor sizes. Compared to rectal cancer, the discriminative effects are better in colon cancer.</p>
