<title>Abstract</title><p>During root nodule symbiosis (RNS), cell-division activity is re-initiated and sustained in the root cortex to create a hospitable cellular niche. Such temporary and spatially confined site is required to render host cells compatible with the intracellular progression of rhizobia. Although it has been suggested that early infection events might involve a pre-mitotic cell-cycle arrest, this process has not been dissected with cellular resolution. Here, we show that a dual-colour <italic>Medicago</italic> histone reporter robustly identifies cells with different mitotic or endoreduplication activities in the root cortex. By imaging deep root tissues, we found that a confined trajectory of cortical cells that are transcellularly passed by infection threads are in a stage of the cell-cycle that is distinct from directly adjacent cells. Distinctive features of infected cells include nuclear widening and large-scale chromatin rearrangements consistent with a cell-cycle exit prior to differentiation. Using a combination of fluorescent reporters demarcating cell-cycle phase progression, we confirmed that a reduced proliferation potential and modulating the G2/M transition, a process possibly controlled by the NF-YA1 transcription factor, mark the success of rhizobial delivery to nodule cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cell-cycle regulation is a key pathway to maintain beneficial and sustainable symbiotic associations that are of primary importance in both marine and terrestrial ecosystems. One common theme to stabilize facultative associations is to achieve a mutual control of cell proliferation and differentiation dynamics in both the host and the symbionts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Kondorosi &amp; Kondorosi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Russo &amp; Genre, 2021</xref>). Prime examples are flowering plants from a single phylogenetic clade, comprising four orders (Fabales, Fagales, Cucurbitales, Rosales) with legumes being the most prominent ones, that evolved the unique ability to accommodate soil-borne rhizobia intracellularly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Parniske, 2018</xref>). Within this symbiosis, rhizobia fix atmospheric nitrogen and deliver ammonium to the host in exchange for plant photosynthates. The conversion of atmospheric dinitrogen into a usable form is highly energy-demanding and requires a low-oxygen environment, which is provided within nodules, specialized lateral organs formed on the roots that are densely populated by rhizobia. A widely adopted mechanism to access the developing nodule cells is the formation of cortical infection threads, transcellular conduits formed upon the invagination of the host plasma membrane and hijacking the cellular machinery of infected root cortical cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Timmers et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Su et al., 2023</xref>). Although the molecular and cellular understanding of the infection mechanisms is expanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Tsyganova et al., 2021</xref>), our knowledge on how exactly these processes are interconnected with the control of cell-cycle progression in cells hosting intracellular infection threads has remained fragmentary.</p>
<p>Plants engaging into arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) or root nodule symbioses (RNS) have recruited a common range of cell-cycle processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Foucher &amp; Kondorosi, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Russo &amp; Genre, 2021</xref>). In <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic> (<italic>M.t.</italic>; hereafter, Medicago), the perception of and colonization by the AM fungus result in occasional cell divisions in the inner cortical layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Russo et al., 2019</xref>) and in diffuse endoreduplication events as intraradical hyphae spread throughout the root cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Carotenuto et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Carotenuto et al., 2019b</xref>). During RNS, the perception of rhizobia results in the onset of a signalling cascade that triggers an outward gradient of cell-cycle reactivation and cell divisions. Although this is initiated in the pericycle, cell-cycle reactivation occurs throughout the inner cortical (C) layers C5, C4 and the middle C3 layer in Medicago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Timmers et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Xiao et al., 2014</xref>). The successful establishment of RNS further involves the tight coordination of the infection and organogenesis programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Guan et al., 2013</xref>). It requires the progression of cortical infection threads through the C3 layer prior to subsequent periclinal divisions that produce a persistent nodule meristem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Xiao et al., 2014</xref>). The resulting indeterminate nodules will later form well-defined developmental zones, with actively dividing meristematic cells giving rise to post-meristematic, differentiating central tissues of increasing ploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Vinardell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Nagymihály et al., 2017</xref>). While those cells can be intracellularly colonized, the infection competence of nodule-like structures as being induced by exogenous application of cytokinin (Gauthier-Coles et al., 2019), constitutive activation of common symbiotic components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Gleason et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Singh et al., 2014</xref>) or the expression of meristematic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dong et al., 2021</xref>) may be massively reduced in many of these spontaneous nodules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hayashi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). The lack of infectibility cannot be overcome even when applying bacterial strains which enter plant cells from the intercellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Liang et al., 2019</xref>). This clearly demonstrates the ultimate requirement of cells being in a so far uncharacterized state of infection competence.</p>
<p>Transcriptome profiling of Medicago root hairs, treated with rhizobial Nod factors or undergoing rhizobial colonization, uncovered changes in several cell-cycle related genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Breakspear et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Liu et al., 2019a</xref>). This perception of Nod factors results in the increased transcription of D-type cyclins, genes known to respond to extrinsic signals and to promote cell-cycle progression from the first GAP (G1) phase to the DNA-synthesis (S) phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dewitte et al., 2003</xref>). Subsequently, the initiation of infection threads coincides with the highest expression of genes required for DNA replication, modification and repair, strongly suggesting that the epidermal infection programme involves cell cycle re-entry and progression to a post-replicative phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Breakspear et al., 2014</xref>). A repression of the endocycle was further proposed to occur since infected root hairs accumulate transcripts of the <italic>OSD1/UVI4</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Breakspear et al., 2014</xref>), whose activity prevents an unscheduled increase in ploidy by inhibiting the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Iwata et al., 2011</xref>). However, much less is known about the transcriptional signature of infected cells along the cortical trajectory of transcellularly progressing infection threads. Such ability to guide rhizobia <italic>via</italic> cortical infection threads is yet thought to be an important innovation since it has been evolutionary maintained in the vast majority of nodulating species as it, most likely, maximizes the host control over bacterial delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Parniske, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cathebras et al., 2022</xref> – pre-print).</p>
<p>A central regulator for controlling infection and organogenesis is the transcription factor <italic>Nodule Inception</italic> (<italic>NIN</italic>). Co-opted from nitrate response circuits, NIN acts as a master coordinator of infection, nodule organogenesis and nodule number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Marsh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Fournier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Soyano et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cathebras et al., 2022</xref> – pre-print). It promotes the expression of several growth targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Liu et al., 2019a</xref>) including <italic>NF-YA1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Soyano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Feng et al., 2021</xref>), a subunit of the conserved heterotrimeric Nuclear Factor-Y (NF-Y) transcription factor. A-, B- and C-type subunits of the NF-Y complex act as specialized modules, interacting with other transcription factors and recruiting chromatin remodelling enzymes to adjust cell specification to environmental or developmental needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Zanetti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Myers &amp; Holt, 2018</xref>). In vertebrates, the CCAAT-binding NF-Y transcription factor targets genes involved in all major activities executed in G2 and mitosis (M; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Linhart et al., 2005</xref>) and is an important regulator of the G2/M transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Manni et al., 2001</xref>). In legumes, the rhizobium-induced NF-YA1 subunit functions in cortical infection thread progression, in the establishment and maintenance of the nodule meristem and in the early differentiation of nodule cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Combier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Laporte et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Xiao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Hossain et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Lee et al., 2024</xref>). Yet, whether the Medicago NF-YA1 protein regulates the G2/M transition is not known.</p>
<p>The hypothesis that intracellular infection at least partially relies on cell-cycle control is further supported by structural re-arrangements in cortical cells anticipating transcellular infection thread progression. These include the formation of pre-infection threads (PITs), which are transvacuolar, cytoplasmic bridges comparable to those occurring in pre-mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">van Brussel et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Timmers et al., 1999</xref>). <italic>In situ</italic> detection of marker transcripts revealed that outer cortical cells recruit histone H4 used during DNA replication but do not express a B-type, mitotic cyclin gene – implying that activated target cells stop in the G2 phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Yang et al., 1994</xref>). G2-phase cell-cycle arrests have been repeatedly described in eukaryotic cells as appropriate gates for executing cell fate and patterning decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Meserve &amp; Duronio, 2017</xref>), for wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cosolo et al., 2019</xref>) or for host infection during pathogenic and biotrophic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Wildermuth et al., 2017</xref>). Modulating the G2/M transition combines well-described transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms, leading to the repression of genes necessary to execute cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Berckmans &amp; De Veylder, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kobayashi et al., 2015</xref>), controlling the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) and the stability of transcriptional repressors and mitotic inducers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Kondorosi &amp; Kondorosi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Although previous reports have suggested such cell-cycle patterns to occur in roots during rhizobial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Yang et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Breakspear et al., 2014</xref>), this has never been spatially resolved at cellular level.</p>
<p>Here, we employed a combination of cell-cycle reporters to resolve functional steps of cell-cycle progression on the cortical infection thread trajectory with cellular and subcellular resolution. We demonstrate that the first generation of Medicago cells successfully internalizing rhizobia shows unique features, including a marked decrease in their histone H3.1 content and a reduced competence for both cell division and chromosome segregation. We also show that tetraploid (4n) cells reaching an 8C DNA content are optimal for infection by rhizobia. Our results strongly suggest that, upon transcellular infection thread passage, cortical cells undergo a last GAP phase after DNA replication and exit to differentiation. Furthermore, we present first evidence that the symbiosis-induced NF-YA1 subunit, by controlling mitotic entry in a heterologous system and ectopically in transgenic Medicago roots, holds potential to contribute to this process.</p>

<title>A reduced proliferative potential typifies cells supporting cortical infection thread progression</title>
<p>In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<italic>A.t.</italic>; hereafter, Arabidopsis), the incorporation and eviction dynamics of histone H3 variants have been used to identify cells with different cell division and reprogramming potentials, during organ patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Otero et al., 2016</xref>) or when acquiring reproductive competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Hernandez-Lagana &amp; Autran, 2020</xref>). To test whether gaining a stage of intracellular infection competence involves a similar modification of the cell-division potential and associated chromatin reorganization, we searched for Medicago genes coding for the replicative histone variant H3.1 and the replacement variant H3.3 (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1–figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Probst et al., 2020</xref>). The encoded Medicago H3.1 protein is identical to the one present in <italic>Lotus japonicus</italic> and <italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic> and, as in other flowering plants, differs from H3.3 by only four residues (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1–figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Shi et al., 2011</xref>). To check that these Medicago <italic>H3</italic> genes encode for <italic>bona fide</italic> H3.1 and H3.3 counterparts, native promoter-genomic fusions with fluorescent tags were expressed in <italic>Agrobacterium rhizogenes</italic>–induced transgenic roots, formed on composite plants that were inoculated with the compatible symbiont <italic>Sinorhizobium meliloti</italic> (each composite plant representing an independent transformant; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Boisson-Dernier et al., 2001</xref>). We adopted a fixation, clearing and cell-wall counter-staining procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Ursache et al., 2018</xref>) that enabled us to perform detailed imaging deep inside the multi-layered root cortical tissues. Medicago H3 fusion proteins fully recapitulated the patterns observed in Arabidopsis roots (<italic>i.e.,</italic> patchy pattern of H3.1 and constitutive presence of H3.3; <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1–figure supplement 1C–E</xref>) and showed the expected localization in euchromatin (diffuse labelling) and heterochromatic regions (subnuclear foci; <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1–figure supplement 1E</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ingouff et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Shi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Otero et al., 2016</xref>). A low H3.1 content, typical for cells with a reduced proliferative potential, also enabled us to identify putative quiescent centre (QC) cells within the open root apical meristem of Medicago (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1–figure supplement 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Rost, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Otero et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Xiao et al., 2019</xref>). Preferentially incorporated during DNA replication, the canonical histone H3.1 variant controls the maintenance of genome integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Davarinejad et al., 2022</xref>) and epigenetic inheritance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Jiang &amp; Berger, 2017</xref>) and is consequently maintained at high levels in cells engaged in recurrent cell division or endoreduplication cycles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Once cells exit the cell cycle, H3.1 is evicted and likely replaced by H3.3 to mediate cellular differentiation in various Arabidopsis cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Otero et al., 2016</xref>). In Medicago, increased levels of <italic>H3.1</italic> transcripts were coherently detected at an early stage of nodule primordia development (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1– figure supplement 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Schiessl et al., 2019</xref>) and mRNAs accumulated only in meristematic (ZI) and infection zones of mature nodules (ZIId and ZIIp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Roux et al., 2014</xref>), while <italic>H3.3</italic> transcription stayed high in the differentiation zone (ZIII; <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1– figure supplement 1G</xref>). We verified a corresponding differential accumulation of H3.1 and H3.3 tagged proteins at cellular resolution in nodule sections (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). The double histone reporter proved also useful to distinguish actively endoreduplicating cells prior to fungal colonization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Carotenuto et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Carotenuto et al., 2019b</xref>) from fully differentiated, arbuscule-containing cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Since the selected Medicago histone variants recapitulated the expected transcriptional and localization patterns in well-defined developmental zones, we considered them as functional reporters of H3.1 and H3.3. In addition, the H3.1/H3.3 balance enables to track cortical cells re-entering the cell cycle and adapting their responses to both bacterial and fungal symbionts.</p>

<p>We then focused on the H3.1 nuclear content at early interaction stages between rhizobia and the host plant (8 days post inoculation [dpi]; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A–B</xref>). In accordance with RNA sequencing data (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1– figure supplement 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Schiessl et al., 2019</xref>), we observed the replicative H3.1 variant accumulating in regularly dividing cortical cells forming the nodule primordium (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, upper panels). The H3.1-eGFP fusion protein was also visible in cells penetrated but not fully passed by an infection thread (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, lower panels). This is consistent with earlier observations that cells preparing for intracellular infection pass through S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Yang et al., 1994</xref>). By contrast, host cells sustaining cortical infection thread progression in the middle and inner cortex (C3 and C4) up to the first recipient cells in the nodule primordium (C4/5-derived; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) exhibited enlarged nuclei (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>) with a significantly decreased histone H3.1 content compared to their direct neighbouring cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Such pattern was also observed using another <italic>H3.1</italic> gene expressed in root tissues (<italic>H3.1 (2)</italic>; <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2–figure supplement 1A–E</xref>). Nuclear enlargement associated with a massive eviction of H3.1 typically identifies cells having completed a DNA replication round, but pausing in the following GAP phase for cell-cycle switches or exit decisions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Otero et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Hernandez-Lagana &amp; Autran, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Probst et al., 2020</xref>). Together, our data strongly suggest that cortical cells along the infection thread trajectory, different to their direct neighbours, exhibit a reduced proliferation potential and presumably exit the cell cycle (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B–D</xref>). The observed nuclear enlargement and large-scale chromatin rearrangements are consistent with an increased transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Knaack et al., 2022</xref>) concomitant with sustained infection thread progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Breakspear et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Liu et al., 2019a</xref>).

<title>Exiting the cell cycle on the cortical infection thread trajectory aligns infection and organogenesis</title>
<p>Next, we tested whether a cell-cycle exit decision and associated remodelling of the histone H3 composition requires the tight coupling of infection and nodule organogenesis as observed under wild-type (WT) conditions. Thus, we compared the H3.1/H3.3 patterns in WT roots to those of two mutants in which nodule organogenesis is either abolished (<italic>daphne-like</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Liu et al., 2019b</xref>) or where nodules form but cortical infection threads are impaired in their progression (<italic>nf-ya1-1</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Laporte et al., 2014</xref>). In the WT situation, the majority of cortical cells (90%) enabling transcellular passage until reaching the nodule primordium showed a reduced proliferation potential (low H3.1 content, n = 41; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3–figure supplement 1A-B</xref>’’). A higher H3.1 content was occasionally observed in the last infected cell in the absence of nodule primordium organogenesis (NOD <sup>(-)</sup>; <xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3–figure supplement 1C-C</xref>’’). Absence of inner cortical cell divisions is also a characteristic feature of the <italic>daphne-like</italic> Medicago mutant (<xref rid="fig3s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3–figure supplement 2A-A</xref>’’), which lacks a remote cis-regulatory region in the <italic>NIN</italic> promoter perceiving cytokinin signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Liu et al., 2019b</xref>). This non-nodulating mutant still produces WT-like root hair infections occasionally reaching outer cortical layers. In this context, the percentage of infected cortical cells visibly accumulating H3.1 in the euchromatin increased from 10% in the WT to almost 41% in the <italic>daphne-like</italic> mutant (n = 44; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3–figure supplement 2B-C</xref>’’).

Although the last infected cortical cells showed a significant nuclear enlargement in all three genetic backgrounds investigated (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), failure to coordinate organogenesis and infection programs in the mutants resulted in an increased occurrence of infected cells accumulating more H3.1 than their direct neighbours (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Together, these data reveal that an appropriate attenuation in cell-cycle activity and associated chromatin changes in infected cells preferentially occur when progressing cortical infections and the formation of a nodule primordium are temporarily fully aligned.</p>

<title>Cortical cells supporting transcellular infection control their commitment to cell division</title>
<p>In Medicago and other plants producing indeterminate nodules, a local control of mitotic activity could be especially important for rhizobia to timely cross the middle cortex, where sustained cellular proliferation gives rise to the nodule meristem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Xiao et al., 2014</xref>). To investigate in greater detail whether cells competent for transcellular infection are selectively kept away from transiting to mitosis, we first used a triple fluorescent sensor enabling to track all cell-cycle phases <italic>in planta</italic>. Originally developed for Arabidopsis, the plant cell-cycle indicator (PlaCCI) combines a component of the pre-replication complex (CDT1a), the replicative histone variant (H3.1) and the N-terminal domain of a B-type cyclin (N-CYCB1;1) as G1-, S- and late G2-phase reporters, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Desvoyes et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Echevarría et al., 2021</xref>). The N-terminal domain of CYCB1;1 contains a destruction box (D-box) ensuring a rapid turnover of the protein after one mitotic cell cycle. These cell-cycle markers are expressed at early stages of organ development but disappear in terminally differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Desvoyes et al., 2020</xref>). When expressing the PlaCCI construct in transgenic Medicago roots, all three markers were successfully visualized in reactivated cortical cells upon nodule primordium formation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B–C</xref>). Cortical cells passed by an infection thread kept low but detectable amounts of the Arabidopsis H3.1 variant, indicating that they transited through S-phase (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). However, these cells stopped before accumulating substantial levels of N-CYCB1;1, in contrast to their direct neighbours. We also confirmed latter observations by using an Arabidopsis CYCB1;2-based fluorescent reporter (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), labelling only cells that transit through G2/M (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5–figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Weimer et al., 2016</xref>). Based on these results and to adapt the PlaCCI reporter system to the study of legume-rhizobia interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Nadzieja et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Echevarría et al., 2021</xref>), we designed an alternative version of the PlaCCI sensor (named PlaCCI v2) that includes the histone H3.1 variant from Medicago, functioning as a robust reporter of G2-arrested cells in composite plants. Observed in early nodule primordia, the PlaCCI v2 sensor enabled us to verify that the cells involved in transcellular infection presumably undergo a prolonged GAP phase without accumulating the B1;2 mitotic cyclin (<xref rid="fig5s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5–figure supplement 2A-C</xref>). Together, these results confirmed a selective decrease in mitotic competence occurring on the cortical infection thread trajectory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Yang et al., 1994</xref>) as rhizobia pass the middle cortical layer (C3) to access colonizable cells in Medicago roots.

<p>We next tested whether transcriptional reporters of a target gene necessary to execute cell division get selectively repressed on the path of a cortical infection. The late G2/M gene <italic>KNOLLE</italic> codes for a syntaxin protein specialized in angiosperm cytokinesis and is oppositely controlled when cells do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Haga et al., 2007</xref>) or shall not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Takahashi et al., 2019</xref>) commit to mitosis. The transcription of <italic>KNOLLE</italic> and other late cell-cycle genes (<italic>e.g.</italic>, <italic>CYCB1;2</italic>) in Arabidopsis is primarily regulated by mitosis-specific activator (MSA) cis-elements present in their promoters that are targeted by activator- and repressor-type three Myb repeats (MYB3R) transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Haga et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kobayashi et al., 2015</xref>). Mutations in all three MSA core sequences present in the Medicago <italic>KNOLLE</italic> promoter significantly reduced the expression of a β-glucuronidase (<italic>GUS</italic>) reporter gene in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> leaf cells in the presence of a hyperactive form of a MYB3R transcriptional activator (NtmybA2Δ630; <xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5–figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Araki et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting that the Medicago <italic>KNOLLE</italic> gene can be used as a <italic>bona fide</italic> late G2/M readout. Using the pKNOLLE::NLS-3xVenus construct, we found that the activation of the <italic>KNOLLE</italic> promoter was lower on the cortical infection thread trajectory in comparison to neighbouring, proliferating cells from nodule primordia (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). An equivalent construct, ensuring the timely elimination of fluorescent reporters after one canonical cell cycle (pKNOLLE::D-box-3xVenus-NLS; <xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5–figure supplement 1C</xref>), corroborated a selective control of the G2/M transition in cells undergoing transcellular infection. Combining our observations of enlarged nuclei (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), the absence of a G1 marker and the reduced H3.1 levels and expression of mitotic genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B–D</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A–B</xref>), we conclude that the initial cortical cells along the infection thread trajectory conduct a single cell-cycle round and stay in a post-replicative (<italic>i.e.</italic>, G2) phase as long as they are crossed.</p>
<p>We further took advantage of the fact that the PlaCCI sensor provides a full view on cell-cycle phase progression in root tissues, in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Desvoyes et al., 2020</xref>) and Medicago (this study). CDT1a- and CYCB1;1-associated signals in the root tip enabled us to identify 2C (<italic>i.e.</italic>, G1) and 4C (<italic>i.e.</italic>, G2) nuclei, respectively (<xref rid="fig5s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 3A</xref>) – where 2C and 4C chromatin-values correspond to the DNA content of a basic diploid genome. Measuring the area of nuclei exhibiting the CYCB1;1-YFP signal in cortical layers of the root apical meristem (root tip) or the nodule primordium revealed that they were on average 1.57 or 1.63 times larger than the ones producing CDT1a-eCFP, respectively (<xref rid="fig5s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 3B</xref>). This is in agreement with an increased DNA content as cells transit from the G1- to the late G2-phase. Surprisingly, proliferating nodule cells contained significantly wider nuclei than their diploid counterparts in the proliferation zone of the root apical meristem (<xref rid="fig5s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 3B</xref>), suggesting a higher ploidy level early on. These results lead to the intriguing possibility that reactivated inner cortical cells in Medicago enter the mitotic cell cycle with an increased amount of genetic material.</p>

<title>Proliferation of endopolyploid cortical cells is a distinctive feature of Medicago root nodules</title>
<p>Our data suggest that the dividing cortical cells contributing to nodule primordium formation are polyploid – <italic>i.e.</italic>, that they contain more than the two genome copies of a diploid (2n) cell, where “n” refers to the number of separate chromosomes. To assess this further, we identified and used the centromere-specific histone H3 variant (CENH3) from Medicago as a marker of individual chromosomes. Such fluorescently-tagged CENH3 proteins have already been successfully applied for chromosome quantification <italic>in planta</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Lermontova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">De Storme et al., 2016</xref>). Aligning the Medicago CENH3 amino acid sequence (G8A083) with characterized CENH3 sequences from <italic>L. japonicus</italic>, Arabidopsis, <italic>H. vulgare</italic> and <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> revealed the presence of canonical CENH3 features (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>), including a variable N-terminal tail and the centromere targeting domain (CATD). When expressing a mCitrine-CENH3 fusion protein under the control of its own promoter (pCENH3::mCitrine-CENH3), CENH3 labelled up to 16 nuclear foci and localized exclusively at the presumed centromeres during mitosis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref> and B) in diploid root tip cells. As the signal was rather weak, we scored centromeric foci in roots constitutively expressing the protein (pLjUbi::mCitrine-CENH3; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Here, a reliable signal was observed in an increased proportion of nuclei (82%) displaying not more than 14 to 16 mCitrine-CENH3 foci (versus only 55% when <italic>CENH3</italic> was expressed under its endogenous promoter; n = 55; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>) – reflecting the base ploidy in <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic> with 2n = 16. We therefore used the pLjUbi::mCitrine-CENH3 reporter construct for our further analyses.</p>

<p>In a first set of experiments, we used CENH3 to discriminate between polyploid cells undergoing endomitosis or endocycling. In endomitosis, entire chromosome replication and partial mitotic progression result in a doubling of the chromosome / centromeric foci number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Iwata et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">De Storme et al., 2016</xref>). By contrast, endocycling cells undergo repeated rounds of DNA synthesis without segregating the newly replicated parts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Edgar et al., 2014</xref>). Here, copied chromosome arms do not condense and spatial separation of sister kinetochores does not occur, so that the number of compact CENH3 signals corresponds to the initial number of chromosomes (up to 8C; <xref rid="fig6s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6–figure supplement 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Lermontova et al., 2006</xref>). As the occurrence of endocycling cells has been previously reported in tissues infected by AM fungi, we first tested the CENH3-reporter in roots inoculated with <italic>Rhizophagus irregularis</italic>. Indeed, cortical cells entered by the fungus displayed large nuclei with no more than 16 labelled foci (<xref rid="fig6s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6–figure supplement 2B</xref>), supporting their endocycling nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Carotenuto et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Lermontova et al., 2006</xref>). Up to 16 CENH3 foci were also observed in diploid cortical cells from the root tip and pericycle cells from lateral root primordia (<xref rid="fig6s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6–figure supplement 2C</xref>). However, the majority of nodule cells exhibited between 26 and 32 fluorescent centromeric foci (75.5% in nodule primordia from stage IV to VI, n = 106; <xref rid="fig6s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6– figure supplement 2B–C</xref>) and a visibly increased number of mitotic chromosomes (<xref rid="fig6s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6–figure supplement 2B</xref>). These observations strongly support previously published data proposing that proliferating cortical cells giving rise to indeterminate root nodules are tetraploid (4n = 32 in <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Torrey &amp; Barrios, 1969</xref>).</p>
<p>We next tested whether endopolyploid cells are already present at an earlier stage of nodule development, where cell division events are confined to the pericycle, the inner cortical cells (C4, C5) and occasionally occur in the third (C3) and second (C2) cortical layers (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Xiao et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, cells originating only from cortical cell divisions (C2 to C5) showed an increased number of chromosomes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D-E</xref>) compared to recently divided cells originating from the pericycle (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). Notably, cells performing anticlinal divisions in the middle cortex (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>, left panel) that will later be crossed by the infection thread (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>, violet triangle) were also polyploid. From these observations, we conclude that a key feature of cortical cells in Medicago nodules is their ability to segregate a higher number of chromosome copies - corresponding to 8C in a tetraploid cell entering mitosis.</p>

<title>Infected cells within the nodule primordium selectively halt their preparations for mitosis</title>
<p>In a next set of experiments, we studied to which extent the cells positioned on the infection thread trajectory (C3 to C4/5) prepare for mitosis. For this, we made use of the pre-mitotic loading characteristics of CENH3 to the centromeres, which mainly occurs during the G2 phase and prior to the spatial separation of sister kinetochores (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Lermontova et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">2011</xref>). In proliferating populations of the root tip (<xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7–figure supplement 1A-B</xref>) and nodule primordia (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A-B</xref>), late G2 cells contained large nuclei where the majority of sister kinetochores was split and appeared as twin foci. We further noticed that centromere separation in Medicago is a gradual rather than a simultaneous process, as root tip cells with comparable nuclear areas often exhibited an intermediate number of fluorescent doublets (<xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7–figure supplement 1A</xref>) of similar appearance and length on a single focal plane (<xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7–figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). To address the question to which extent cortical cells that are competent for infection can commit to nuclear division, we assessed the gradual formation of sister centromeres. Although the nuclear size of infected C3 cells suggested an 8C DNA content, as found in late G2-phase cells of the nodule tissue (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B, C</xref>), none of these infected cells showed the typical CENH3 twin foci formed when sister kinetochores split (n = 13; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B and D</xref>). Such control over mitotic commitment was tightly maintained in the majority of infected, C4/5-derived cells (75.5%; n = 53; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>) which did not display any visible sign of centromere separation across image stacks (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>), despite a presumably duplicated genomic DNA content (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). A smaller proportion of the recently infected cells (20.7%) partially prepared for chromosome segregation and showed up to 3 fluorescent doublets (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>) of comparable lengths to those measured in G2-phase progressing cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>), whereas only two cells (3.8%) with internalized bacteria got closer to nuclear and likely to cell division (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B and D</xref>). Together, by combining several marker strategies based on histone H3 dynamics and on <italic>bona fide</italic> mitotic reporters, we conclude that most middle (C3) and inner (C4/5-derived) cortical cells competent for intracellular infection enter a post-replicative, G2-type phase without proceeding towards M-phase. Endopolyploid cortical cells hosting infection threads have presumably gained the ability to execute a differentiation program rather than entering cell division at the end of G2.</p>

<title>The symbiosis-specific NF-YA1 subunit holds potential to modulate the G2/M transition</title>
<p>Our data suggest that cell-cycle progression and bacterial infection are highly coordinated, although the precise molecular players able to redirect cell-cycle decisions while promoting cortical infections remain to be identified. Prominent candidates are NF-YA1 proteins that were evolutionary recruited to RNS, where they sustain both organogenesis and intracellular infection in a range of nodulating legume and non-legume species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Combier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Laporte et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Xiao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Hossain et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bu et al., 2020</xref>). NF-YA1 plays an unambiguous role as a positive regulator of cell divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Soyano et al., 2013</xref>) but was also recently shown to function in the early differentiation and specification of nodule cells in Medicago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Lee et al., 2024</xref>). This prompted us to assess whether NF-YA1 could act as a switch at mitotic entry. To test this, we used WT NF-YA1 and a mutated variant lacking a functional DNA-binding domain (mutDBD) as eGFP fusion proteins. As expected, both variants localized to the nucleus when being expressed in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaf epidermal cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Laloum et al., 2014</xref>). To foster cell cycle re-entry in these differentiated cells, we ectopically expressed the Arabidopsis D-type cyclin <italic>CYCD3;1</italic> in mature leaves as described in the recently developed ‘cell division-enabled leaf system’ (CDELS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Xu et al., 2020</xref>). As these re-activated cells commit to mitosis and perform cytokinesis (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>), they also enable the activation of promoters containing MSA cis-elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Xu et al., 2020</xref>) as found in the Medicago <italic>KNOLLE</italic> promoter (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5–figure supplement 1B</xref>). We confirmed this by expressing eGFP-KNOLLE from its endogenous promoter in the absence and presence of Arabidopsis CYCD3;1. The KNOLLE fusion protein was only detected when being co-expressed with CYCD3;1 using immunoblot analyses (<xref rid="fig8s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 8–figure supplement 1A</xref>) and labelled newly formed cell-division planes (<xref rid="fig8s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 8–figure supplement 1B</xref>). This is consistent with previous reports showing that the syntaxin KNOLLE accumulates only in dividing cells. We also confirmed the specific activation of the Medicago <italic>KNOLLE</italic> promoter (pKNOLLE::GUS) in CDEL samples ectopically expressing CYCD3;1 by using a fluorometric GUS assay (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>). Next, we tested the impact of NF-YA1 on the activity of promoters driving cell cycle-dependent gene transcription in the CDEL samples. While the presence of NF-YA1 did not alter <italic>GUS</italic> expression when driven from the histone <italic>H4</italic> promoter (pH4::GUS) that is active during DNA synthesis (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C-D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Yang et al., 1994</xref>), it significantly repressed pKNOLLE::GUS activation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E</xref>). This effect was abolished when using the mutated NF-YA1<sup>mutDBD</sup> variant (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E</xref>). Interestingly, the repressive effect of NF-YA1 was stronger compared to the one observed when using a MYB3R transcriptional repressor from Medicago (<xref rid="fig8s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 8–figure supplement 2A–B</xref>) known to halt the expression of late G2/M genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Haga et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Takahashi et al., 2019</xref>). These results suggest that the NF-YA1 DNA-binding subunit prevents an unscheduled entry into mitosis in de-differentiating leaf cells, despite the action of ectopically-expressed CYCD3;1.</p>

<p>We then tested whether such effect could be observed at the cellular level in the CDEL system. For this, we ectopically co-expressed non-fluorescently-tagged CYCD3;1 and NF-YA1 and additionally transformed these leaves with fluorescently tagged Medicago H3.3 and KNOLLE proteins, expressed from their native promoters (<xref rid="fig8s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 8–figure supplement 1B</xref>). While the constitutive presence of NF-YA1 did not prevent cell division events <italic>per se</italic>, a significantly lower proportion of transformed cells produced detectable levels of KNOLLE (<xref rid="fig8s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 8–figure supplement 1C</xref>), indicating that less pavement cells engaged in mitosis at the investigated experimental timepoint. Cells visibly accumulating the KNOLLE protein still progressed through M-phase in the presence of NF-YA1 (<xref rid="fig8s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 8–figure supplement 1B</xref>), although a smaller proportion of them fully completed cell division at 64 hours when compared to the control samples (<xref rid="fig8s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 8–figure supplement 1D</xref>). From these data we conclude that NF-YA1 is able to control mitotic entry in de-differentiating, endoreduplicated cells at least in the CDEL system.</p>

<title>NF-YA1 acts at the interface between control of cell division and intracellular infection competence in the Medicago root cortex</title>
<p>According to our observations, access to colonizable cells <italic>via</italic> transcellular infection implies a local decision to exit the cell cycle.

<p>For the next set of experiments, we selected the <italic>ENOD11</italic> promoter sequence to locally increase NF-YA1 levels in WT roots <italic>via</italic> the symbiotically induced expression of a non-fluorescently-tagged version (pENOD11::FLAG-NF-YA1 or hereafter, pENOD11::NF-YA1). Limited to the area close to infection, additional <italic>NF-YA1</italic> expression led to a modest but significant reduction in the number of nodule primordia formed (<xref rid="fig9s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 9–figure supplement 2A</xref>) without impacting nodule colonization, with 93% of the primordia being infected in both the control condition and upon ectopic <italic>NF-YA1</italic> expression (n = 334 and 216, respectively; <xref rid="fig9s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 9–figure supplement 2B-C</xref>). To assess the influence of <italic>NF-YA1</italic> overexpression at cellular level, we coupled the pENOD11::NF-YA1 construct to the <italic>KNOLLE</italic> G2/M transcriptional reporter (pKNOLLE::D-box-3xVenus-NLS; <xref rid="fig9s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 9–figure supplement 3A-B</xref>). As previously observed (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5–figure supplement 1C</xref>), this destabilized nuclear reporter functions as a robust readout of a cell’s competence to be crossed by an infection thread (low reporter signal) or to commit to cell division (high reporter signal) in Medicago roots. In this context, we sought to determine whether more cells become competent to host infection threads and whether NF-YA1 also regulates cell division activity when accumulated in the outer cortex.</p>
<p>A significant nuclear enlargement was observed in crossed cortical cells of both control roots and those additionally expressing <italic>NF-YA1</italic> (<xref rid="fig9s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 9–figure supplement 4A-B</xref>), implying that elevated levels of NF-YA1 did not prevent infected cells from proceeding through DNA replication. The local increase in <italic>NF-YA1</italic> expression also did not alter the typical expression profile of the transcriptional <italic>KNOLLE</italic> reporter (<xref rid="fig9s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 9–figure supplement 4C</xref>). Although overall reduced compared to control roots, the nuclear levels of triple-Venus fluorescence were kept low in infected cells and gradually increased in the vicinity of an infection site and within nodule primordia (<xref rid="fig9s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 9–figure supplement 4D</xref>) in transgenic roots ectopically expressing <italic>NF-YA1</italic> (<xref rid="fig9s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 9–figure supplement 3A-B</xref>). Competence for transcellular infection, defined here as a pre-mitotic arrest of the cell cycle, therefore appears to be maintained in the context of local <italic>NF-YA1</italic> overexpression. The latter leads to a slight (non-significant) increase in the number of infected cells per cortical layer: in almost 9% of the examined layers (C1 to C3, n = 70), at least three cells hosted an infection thread upon ectopic <italic>NF-YA1</italic> expression, while this was observed only once in C3 (<italic>i.e.</italic>, 3% of the examined cortical layers; n = 32) in control roots (<xref rid="fig9s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 9–figure supplement 4E-G</xref>). Regarding cell division activity, local overexpression of <italic>NF-YA1</italic> did not influence the proportion of adjacent cells dividing in the vicinity of infected cells (about 33% in each of the transgenic backgrounds; <xref rid="fig9s5" ref-type="fig">Figure 9–figure supplement 5A-B</xref>). By contrast, we observed a greater proportion of split cells on the trajectory of the cortical infection thread: 35% of infected cells (n = 40) divided anticlinally in the outer cortex when <italic>NF-YA1</italic> expression was locally increased compared to only 12.5% (n = 16) in control condition (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A-B</xref>). This supports the idea that, when accumulated in a symbiotic context, NF-YA1 may facilitate the division of endoreduplicated cortical cells in anticipation of infection. Conversely, increased levels of NF-YA1 presumably repress the transition to mitosis within cells undergoing infection (<xref rid="fig9s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 9–figure supplement 4D</xref>) and appear to also influence the general structure of infection threads (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9C-E</xref> and <xref rid="fig9s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 9–figure supplement 3B</xref>). Ectopic expression of <italic>NF-YA1</italic> led to a higher proportion of cells forming supernumerary infection thread branches, with 37.5% of infected cells showing at least 2 additional branches outside the main infection thread (n = 96) compared to 20% in control condition (n = 50; <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9E</xref>). Accumulated on the trajectory of a cortical infection, NF-YA1 might therefore act in increasing the proportion of potential host cells while promoting the branching of infectious structures in the Medicago root cortex.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Failure to timely coordinate infection and organogenesis programs in the root cortex results in the formation of poorly colonized nodules that are unable to support the plant’s demand to obtain fixed nitrogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Guan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Laporte et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Lee et al., 2024</xref>). Here, we sought to understand at cellular resolution, whether cell-cycle progression and cellular reprogramming are altered in a spatially confined array of host cells that gain a time-limited stage of competence for transcellular infection.</p>
<p>Our data support a model where dividing cells contributing to nodule formation, including target cells for cortical infection, are polyploid and contain 4 copies (C) of each chromosome (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D–E</xref>). In Medicago, these 4C cells either pre-exist in the root cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Vinardell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Carotenuto et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Carotenuto et al., 2019b</xref>) or arise from a single endoreduplication round prior to their possible entry into cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Libbenga &amp; Torrey, 1973</xref>). As competent cells are crossed by a cortical infection thread or fully internalize bacteria and despite being embedded into a proliferating tissue, they reach an 8C DNA content (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref> and <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>) but without committing to a subsequent cell division (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B–D</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A–B</xref>). Rather, cells supporting transcellular infections presumably use a cell-cycle GAP phase after DNA replication (<italic>i.e.,</italic> G2) and extend such phase to remodel their histone H3 composition (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A–B and D</xref>). Finally, this differentiation process and concomitant transcellular passage are accomplished within a single, last cell-cycle round (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Otero et al., 2016</xref>). Here, and similar to infected root hairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Breakspear et al., 2014</xref>), a rapid switch to another endocycle is likely prevented as both G1- and S-phase markers are kept low (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref rid="fig5s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5–figure supplement 2C</xref>). Taken together, these events control a cell-cycle progression state where infection players operate to ensure a successful transmission of rhizobia to the first nodule cells.</p>

<p>(A) Cortical cells competent for sustained transcellular infection thread progression are characterized by a reduced proliferation or endoreduplication activity (pink to green two-colour gradient). By the time they are crossed and ultimately internalize bacteria, such tetraploid cells reach a post-replicative, 8C ploidy stage. But, contrary to direct neighbour cells, they do not commit to a subsequent cell division (red to white two-colour gradient). (<bold>B</bold>) Rather, cells supporting transcellular infection may enter a prolonged G2-phase during which they remodel their histone H3 composition as part of their cellular reprogramming for infection. This differentiation process and concurrent transcellular passage are accomplished within a last cell-cycle round. We propose that cellular factors controlling the G2/M transition and eventually the exit from the canonical cell cycle (dashed arrow) are prominent candidates to support intracellular infection competence.</p></caption>

<title>Modulating endopolyploidy during rhizobial infections</title>
<p>In line with findings from Arabidopsis reporting that a downregulation of <italic>H3.1</italic> gene expression and a massive eviction process contribute to various differentiation programs, <italic>e.g.</italic>, in the male and female gametes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ingouff et al., 2010</xref>), the root meristem, the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Otero et al., 2016</xref>) and the female germline precursor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Hernandez-Lagana &amp; Autran, 2020</xref>), we show that the genetic program enabling intracellular infections of Medicago roots accesses the same mechanism (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A–B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2– figure supplement 1C–E</xref>). Reciprocally, our data indicate that high H3.1 levels tend to be maintained in infected cells with blocked or aborted infections (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A and C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3–figure supplement 1 and 2</xref>). Furthermore, the nuclear enlargement in infected cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>) indicates profound transcriptional reprogramming and activation of new gene regulatory networks, as previously shown to occur in LCO-treated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Knaack et al., 2022</xref>) or young symbiotic cells (<italic>i.e.</italic>, infected root hairs and 8C cells from mature nodules; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Breakspear et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Nagymihály et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Liu et al., 2019a</xref>). We expanded the latter view by showing that tetraploid cortical cells passed by an infection thread also reach a presumable 8C DNA content (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). As reported for growing cell types in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bhosale et al., 2018</xref>), such alteration in endopolyploidy might support, among others, changes in cell wall composition, which have also recently been demonstrated to occur specifically around infected cells in Medicago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Su et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Gaudioso-Pedraza et al., 2018</xref>). In the determinate nodulator <italic>L. japonicus</italic>, polyploidization of early nodule cells might be controlled by <italic>VAGRANT INFECTION THREAD 1</italic> (<italic>VAG1</italic>), a putative component of the DNA topoisomerase VI (topo VI) complex, as cortical cells with reduced ploidy levels cannot be infected in the <italic>vag1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Suzaki et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, but different to infections by mycorrhizal fungi where repetitive rounds of endoreduplication occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Russo &amp; Genre, 2021</xref>) and support fungal colonization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Carotenuto et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Carotenuto et al., 2019b</xref>), markedly reduced histone H3.1 contents in cells maintaining rhizobial infections in the root cortex up to the first recipient cells in nodule primordia indicate reduced endocycling rates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Otero et al., 2016</xref>). Such attenuation of cell-cycle progression together with decreased transcript levels of mitotic cyclins were shown to occur in budding yeast and Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Negishi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Gigli-Bisceglia et al., 2018</xref>) following the activation of a cell-wall integrity (CWI) checkpoint. More recently, Ma and colleagues proposed a scenario where the CWI kinase THESEUS1 (THE1), with a related gene being induced in infected root hairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Breakspear et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Liu et al., 2019a</xref>), triggers cell wall stiffening as a response to endoreduplication attenuation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Ma et al., 2022</xref>).

<title>A G2-phase arrest and attenuated endoreduplication as a plausible context for cortical infections</title>
<p>Reaching and staying in a pre-mitotic stage has been proposed to facilitate the long-distance progression of infection threads in legume species forming so-called cortical, pre-infection threads (PITs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Yang et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Timmers et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Foucher &amp; Kondorosi, 2000</xref>). These microtubule-rich cytoplasmic bridges resemble the onset of a cell division plane that requires the formation of a cortical division zone, which is established from late S-through G2 phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Costa, 2017</xref>). Interestingly, this cell-cycle progression window coincides with the one we observed in infected cortical cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A–B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A–D</xref>), reinforcing the hypothesis that part of the machinery activated in anticipation of cytokinesis could be recruited and assist transcellular infection of PIT-forming cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Murray, 2016</xref>). This is in line with a recent report showing that a rhizobium-induced mitotic module, comprising an α-Aurora kinase gene and its MYB3R transcriptional activator, supports endosymbiotic infection in Medicago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gao et al., 2022</xref>). Interestingly though, overexpression of the activator-type <italic>MYB3R1</italic> gene resulted in the formation of abnormally bulbous or branched infection threads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gao et al., 2022</xref>). These data emphasize the need to balance the activity of transcriptional regulators driving mitosis and cytokinesis in infected cells.</p>
<p>In summary, we hypothesize that endocycle suppression after a round of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Breakspear et al., 2014</xref>) and exiting the cell-cycle from the G2-phase might therefore create a permissive, yet controlled state for cortical infection thread progression, where polarization and cell-wall remodelling factors specialized for intracellular infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lace et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Su et al., 2023</xref>) act in a defined cell-cycle window to control infection thread growth and guidance across cortical layers. Although differences in the relationship between rhizobial infection and endoreduplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Fan et al., 2022</xref>) or cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Monroy-Morales et al., 2022</xref>) exist in legumes forming determinate or indeterminate nodules, it is important to note that a post-replicative state of the cell cycle remains most favourable for infection.</p>

<title>Endopolyploidization following cytokinin perception: a legume innovation?</title>
<p>Using the centromeric histone H3 (CENH3) fluorescent reporter enabled us to assess the number of chromosomes, the progression through the G2 phase (<xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7–figure supplement 1A–B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Lermontova et al., 2006</xref>) and to clearly identify diploid and polyploid cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B and E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">De Storme et al., 2016</xref>). Combining CENH3 patterns with the histone H3.3 marker showed that somatic cortical cells giving rise to Medicago root nodules are mainly tetraploid, which is consistent with previous observations in legumes producing indeterminate nodules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Wipf and Cooper, 1938</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Torrey &amp; Barrios, 1969</xref>). In addition, our imaging data indicate that dividing endopolyploid cells, despite an elevated risk of genome instability, are homogenously maintained in the nodule tissue (<xref rid="fig6s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6–figure supplement 2B–C</xref>). This suggests that tetraploidization is an important feature for nodule fitness and infectability, as it may enable processes such as the required integration of many contextual stimuli (<italic>e.g.,</italic> bacterial signals; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Russo &amp; Genre, 2021</xref>). Furthermore, our findings point towards tetraploidization of cortical cells being a hallmark for nodule identity as pericycle cells in nodule or lateral root primordia remain strictly diploid (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref rid="fig6s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6–figure supplement 2C</xref>). Interestingly, when dissected and cultured in suspension, cortical cells from the susceptible zone of pea roots entered cell divisions as tetraploid cells only when cytokinin (kinetin) was applied in addition to auxin (2,4-D; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Libbenga &amp; Torrey, 1973</xref>). This is particularly interesting since a specific cortical response to cytokinin, an auxin/cytokinin interplay and subsequent cellular proliferation in the root cortex appear to be a legume innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Guan et al., 2013</xref>; Gauthier-Coles et al., 2019). Whether an early somatic, whole-genome duplication event is a signature of functional root nodules and part of this innovation, as recently suggested for the recruitment of meristematic regulators (Dong et al., 2020), remains to be investigated.</p>

<title>NF-YA1, possible intermediary between intracellular infection and cell-cycle control</title>
<p>While this and other reports have shed light onto cell-cycle patterns during rhizobial infections in roots and nodules, genetic factors coordinating cell-cycle progression and intracellular infections remained enigmatic. Using the heterologous CDEL system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Xu et al., 2020</xref>) has enabled us to test the impact of at least one of the potential candidates, the symbiotic transcription factor NF-YA1, on cell cycle-dependent activities in a de-differentiating cellular population. Expression of NF-YA1 in this system did not prevent cells from passing through S-phase (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>). But, while the activated cells (as indicated by the induction of the KNOLLE reporter) still engage in mitosis and eventually divide (<xref rid="fig8s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 8–figure supplement 1B</xref>), significantly fewer transformed cells promoted the expression of this G2/M marker at our experimental timepoints (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E</xref> and <xref rid="fig8s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 8–figure supplement 1C</xref>). These results strongly suggest that, in the CDEL system, NF-YA1 negatively regulates the entry into mitosis despite the presence of CYCD3;1. The latter has been shown to promote mitotic cycles and to restrain differentiation and endoreduplication when accumulated in shoot tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Schnittger et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dewitte et al., 2003</xref>). Our observations are therefore consistent with the indispensable role of A-type NF-Y subunits in the transition to the early differentiation and specification of nodule cells, downstream of cytokinin perception and initial cell-cycle reactivation in Lotus and Medicago. According to loss- and gain-of-function studies, adequate levels of NF-YA1 appear indeed essential to generate a pool of enlarged (likely endoreduplicated) cells, deriving from a functional meristem in Medicago nodules and competent to host nitrogen-fixing bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Combier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Xiao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Hossain et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Schiessl et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Lee et al., 2024</xref>).

It was proposed that LSH1/LSH2 transcription factors foster the proliferation of cortical cells that support bacterial colonization in part <italic>via</italic> promoting <italic>NF-YA1</italic> expression in the newly divided cells associated with the specification of the nodule primordium. At an earlier stage of infection, forcing the expression of Medicago <italic>NF-YA1</italic> in the outer cortex revealed its dual role in promoting cell division and intracellular infection competence on the trajectory to the nodule cells (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A-E</xref> and <xref rid="fig9s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 9–figure supplement 4A-G</xref>). Although the effects we observed are subtle, they might be explained by the ability of NF-YA1 to modulate the G2/M transition. A couple of recent studies in Arabidopsis demonstrate that meristematic regulators from the GRAS and AP2 transcription factor families drive cell proliferation while enabling the local accumulation of CDK inhibitors, thereby controlling the duration of G1- and G2 phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Nomoto et al., 2022</xref>; Echevarría et al., 2022 – pre-print). Whether LSHs and/or NF-YA subunits work similarly, and whether genes responsible for structuring the infection thread are part of the NF-YA1 regulon are exciting possibilities that remain to be explored.</p>
<p>In summary, we propose that a local control of cell-cycle activity and a cell-cycle exit decision along the infection thread trajectory provide a window of cellular competence for cortical infections to progress down to the nodule primordium niche in Medicago. We demonstrated that the cell division and differentiation potentials are controlled in a spatially confined cell-file in the root cortex. We also showed that post-replicative, tetraploid cells reaching an 8C DNA content are optimal for intracellular infection. Consequently, it is tempting to hypothesize that exactly these cells comprise a highly specific transcriptional and regulatory landscape that ultimately defines the molecular susceptibility state for intracellular infection competence.</p>

All quantitative measurements were performed on single focal planes and single channels from un-processed z-stacks, acquired from fully transformed Medicago roots. The Fire lookup table (LUT) was applied to facilitate the visualization of low-intensity pixels. Nuclear areas were measured at the equatorial plane using the freehand selection tool, on channels displaying the signal from nuclear (<italic>i.e.</italic>, NLS-2xmCherry) or chromatin-associated proteins (<italic>i.e.</italic>, H3.1- or H3.3-FP fusions). H3.1-eGFP levels were quantified in the nucleus of infected cells (IC) and of directly adjacent, neighbouring cells (NC) present on the same z-stack in the same cortical layer. For this, an outline was manually drawn around each nucleus at the equatorial plane and area, integrated density and mean gray values were measured. Three oval selections were drawn adjacent to all measured nuclei to be used for normalization against background fluorescence.

Ten leaf discs per transformed leaf were frozen in liquid nitrogen inside a Safe Seal Micro tube containing a stainless-steel bead (5 mm diameter). Samples were ground twice for 30 s (28/s frequency) using a Tissue Lyser MM300 (Retsch) and the powder was resuspended in 400 µl of cold GUS extraction buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM DTT, 0.05% [v/v] Triton X-100 and 1x Protease Inhibitor Cocktail [Roche]). Crude leaf extracts were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C on a turning wheel and centrifuged at 16.900 g for 5 min at 4 °C. Ten µl of the supernatant were used to determine protein concentrations by the dye-binding Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Twenty-five µg of total proteins in a final volume of 100 µl were pipetted into a white 96 well plate (Greiner Bio-One) before the addition of 200 µl of GUS reaction buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA, 1% [v/v] Triton X-100 and 0.5 mM 4-Methylumbelliferyl-β-D-glucuronide [4-MUG] [Carl Roth]).

<p>(<bold>A</bold>) Confocal images of a whole-mount Medicago WT root expressing an Arabidopsis CYCB1;2-based fluorescent reporter. The CYCB1;2 promoter (pCYCB1;2) contains several mitosis-specific activator (MSA) cis-elements and is active in late G2 and early M phase. The destruction box (D-box) motif in the N-terminal domain (N-CYCB1;2) ensures the proteolytic degradation of the triple-Venus reporter during anaphase. The pCYCB1;2::N-CYCB1;2-NLS-3xVenus reporter shows a characteristic patchy pattern, reflecting mitotic activity in the root apical meristem (left panel) and labels individual cells that transit through G2/M (right panel) with only occasional, incomplete post-mitotic degradation of the triple-Venus reporter (star). Pro: prophase. Meta: metaphase. Scale bars: 100 μm (left panel); 20 μm (right panel). Images show merged fluorescent channels (Venus: green; Calcofluor white cell-wall staining: grayscale). (<bold>B</bold>) Upper panel: schematic representation of the Medicago <italic>KNOLLE</italic> promoter (<italic>M.t. pKNOLLE</italic>). The three closely-spaced mitosis-specific activator (MSA) cis-elements present in the proximal promoter region are indicated by yellow boxes. Locations of the core MSA motifs (AACGG/CCGTT) are as follows, relative to the ATG start codon: MSA1 = −303 to −307; MSA2 = −335 to −339; MSA3 = −358 to −362. Lower panel: transactivation assay in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaf cells co-expressing an activator-type MYB3R transcription factor (NtmybA2Δ630) and one of the following target promoter::GUS fusions: Medicago <italic>pKNOLLE</italic> (native or MSA1-3 point-mutated) or Arabidopsis <italic>pCYCB1;2</italic> (native) acting as a positive control.

<caption><title>Somatic centromere labelling identifies a doubling of the chromosome number as a typical feature of nodule cortical cells.</title>
<p>(A) Schematic representation of two different paths by which somatic polyploid cells can be generated. Endocycling cells (1) successively duplicate genomic DNA without chromosome condensation and segregation, alternating only S- and G-phases. Endomitotic cells (2) abort mitosis (M) during metaphase or anaphase (red arrow) and re-form a single nucleus. Because of complete chromosome replication and partial mitotic progression, endomitotic cells can better retain the ability to re-enter cell division (CD) than highly endoreduplicated cells. After endomitosis, generated polyploid cells hold a doubled number of entire chromosomes individually labelled by CENH3 (blue dots). Chromatin-values (C) are given for a diploid cell (2n) in G1 (2C), G2 (4C), for a 2C cell that has undergone 2 rounds of endocycle (8C) and for a tetraploid cell (4n) in G1 (4C). The number n refers to the number of separate chromosomes in a cell. For simplicity, only 3 segregating chromosomes are represented in M.

<p>(<bold>A-B</bold>) Confocal images of whole-mount WT transgenic roots constitutively expressing mCitrine-CENH3 in the meristematic zone of the root tip. Simultaneous expression of H3.3-mCherry enables the recognition of condensed and segregating chromosomes. Images show merged fluorescent channels (mCitrine: Green Fire Blue; mCherry and Calcofluor white cell-wall staining: grayscale). (<bold>A</bold>) Upper panel: an early G2-phase cell is indicated, exhibiting a large nucleus where not all sister kinetochores have split. Dotted lines encircle mCitrine-CENH3 fluorescent doublets appearing on the same focal plane. The number of CENH3-labeled doublets determined across image stacks is indicated in yellow. Ana: anaphase. Lower panel: an early prophase cell (Pro <sup>early</sup>) is indicated where all sister kinetochores have split and chromosomes start to condense. The number of CENH3-labeled twin foci determined across image stacks is indicated in yellow. Meta: metaphase. Telo: telophase (one daughter cell visible). Scale bars: 5 μm. (<bold>B</bold>) Upper left panel: maximum intensity projection of an early G2-phase cell where not all sister kinetochores have split. The dotted line in the corresponding right panel demarcates one mCitrine-CENH3 doublet appearing on a single focal plane. Lower left panel: maximum intensity projection of a late G2-phase cell where the majority of sister kinetochores have split and appear as twin spots on the same focal plane (dotted-line ovals in the corresponding right panel). Scale bars: 5 μm. (<bold>C</bold>) Quantification of the nuclear area at the equatorial plane in early (n = 25) and late (n = 17) G2-phase cells as identified in (<bold>B</bold>).

<caption><title>NF-YA1 modulates the entry into mitosis in a de-differentiating leaf cell population.</title>
<p>(A) Immunoblot analyses of total protein extracts from <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves co-transformed with the following constructs: pKNOLLE::eGFP-KNOLLE / pH3.3::H3.3-mCherry and p35S::CYCD3;1-HA, pLjUbi::FLAG-NFYA1 or p35S::CYCD3;1-HA / pLjUbi::FLAG-NFYA1. The Coomassie blue-stained membrane (CBS) is shown below and serves as a loading control. The cytokinesis-specific syntaxin KNOLLE was only detected in the samples co-expressing CYCD3;1. Immunoblots were performed 3 times from 3 independent transformation experiments with similar results. (<bold>B</bold>) Live-cell confocal images of <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> epidermal cells ectopically expressing CYCD3;1 (p35S::CYCD3;1-HA) and co-transformed with the pKNOLLE::eGFP-KNOLLE construct, 64 hours post-infiltration (hpi). Simultaneous expression of H3.3-mCherry under its native promoter serves as a transformation marker and enables the recognition of segregating chromosomes. FLAG-NF-YA1 was constitutively produced (pLjUbi::FLAG-NF-YA1) from the T-DNA carrying also the CYCD3;1 expression cassette. Left and middle panels: filled arrowheads indicate newly formed cell-division planes in CYCD3;1-expressing samples, in the absence (left) or presence (middle) of NF-YA1. Dashed line boxes in the middle panel indicate cells engaged in mitosis (M). Right panels: close-up images of dividing cells in metaphase (upper panel) or cytokinesis (lower panel) taken from samples co-expressing CYCD3;1 and NF-YA1. Images show merged fluorescent channels (eGFP: Green Fire Blue; mCherry: magenta). Scale bars: left and middle panels = 100 μm; right panel = 20 μm. (<bold>C</bold>) Quantification of transformed pavement cells showing the eGFP-KNOLLE signal, 64 hpi. Samples were co-infiltrated with p35S::CYCD3;1-HA ([-] NF-YA1) or with p35S::CYCD3;1-HA / pLjUbi::FLAG-NF-YA1 ([+] NF-YA1). All data points are shown and bars indicate sample means with 95% confidence interval. Differences were statistically significant (p-value = 0.0043) according to an unpaired t test with Welch’s correction.

<p>This is a <bold>fundamental</bold> cell biological study of host responses during symbiotic microbial infection of plants. <bold>Compelling</bold> imaging-based approaches using genetically encoded cell cycle markers show that in Medicago truncatula root cortex cells, early rhizobial infection events are associated with cell-cycle re-entry, but once the infection is established, host cells exit the cell cycle. The work will be of interest to a wide range of readers working in fields from development and cell biology to plant-microbe interactions.</p>

<p>Many studies reported findings implying that rhizobial infection is associated with cell cycle re-entry and progression, however, our understanding has been fragmented. This study provides exciting new insights as it represents a comprehensive description of the cell cycle progression during early stages of nodulation using fluorescence markers.</p>
<p>To briefly summarize, the authors first monitor H3.1 / H3.3 replacement to distinguish between replicating (S phase) and non-replicating cells to show that M. truncatula cortex cells along the bacterial infection thread are non-replicating (while neighbors enter the S phase). Nuclear size measurements revealed that these non-replicative cells are in the post-replicative stage (G2) rather than in the pre-replicative G1 phase, which the authors confirm with the Plant Cell Cycle Indicator (PlaCCI) fluorescent marker to track cell cycle progression in more detail. Cortex cells in the trajectory of the infection thread did not accumulate the late G2 marker of the PlaCCI nor the G2/M marker KNOLLE, indicating that these cells indeed remain in G2. Because nuclear size measurements indicated that infected cells are polyploid, the authors used the centromere histone marker CENH3 to determine chromosome number. They find that cortex cells giving rise to the nodule primordium are endomitotic and tetraploid, probably because their cell cycle is halted at centromere separation. Although not a focus of this manuscript, the authors also use their fluorescent tools to track cell cycle progression during arbuscular mycorrhiza symbiosis. They confirm that infected cells transition from a replicating to a non-replicating state (H3.1 to H3.3) with progressing development of the arbuscules. In addition, the CENH3 marker confirms previous findings that cortex cells infected by fungi are endocycling (i.e., DNA synthesis without segregation of replicated parts). This represents an important confirmation of previous findings and contrasts with the situation during nodulation symbiosis, where chromosomes separate after replication.</p>
<p>In general, all microscopy images are of very high quality and support the authors' conclusions. While individually each set of fluorescent markers has its limitations, combined they constitute a powerful tool to track various stages of cell cycle progression in individual root cells during symbiosis. Overall, this is a very strong manuscript that comprehensively elucidates root cell cycle changes during microbial infection.</p>

<p>Cell cycle control during nitrogen-fixing symbiosis is an important topic, but our understanding of the process is poor and lacks resolution, as the nodule is a complex organ with many cell types that undergo profound changes. The authors aim to define the cell cycle state of individual plant cells in the emerging nodule primordium, as a transcellular infection thread passes through the meristem to reach cells deep in the incipient nodule and releases bacteria to form symbiosomes. The authors used a number of cell cycle reporters, such as different Histone 3 variants and cyclins, to follow cell cycle progress in exquisite detail. They showed that the host cells in the path of an infection thread exhibit a cell fate distinct from their immediate neighbors: after entering the S phase similar to their neighbors, these cells exit the cell cycle and enter a special differentiated state. This is likely an important shift that allows the proper passage of the infection thread. Although definitive proof needs more investigation, they showed that a pioneering transcription factor, NF-YA1, likely represses these endoreduplicated cells from completing the cell cycle.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>(…) In my view, the part about NF-YA1 is less strong - although I realize this is a compelling candidate to be a regulator of cell cycle progression, the experimental approaches used to address this question falls a bit short, in particular, compared to the very detailed approaches shown in the rest of the manuscript. The authors show that the transcription factor NF-YA1 regulates cell division in tobacco leaves; however, there is no experimental validation in the experimental system (nodules). All conclusions are based on a heterologous cell division system in tobacco leaves. The authors state that NF-YA1 has a nodule-specific role as a regulator of cell differentiation. I am concerned the tobacco system may not allow for adequate testing of this hypothesis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reviewer #1 makes a valid point by asking to focus the manuscript more explicitly on the role of NF-YA1 as a differentiation factor in a symbiotic context. We have now addressed this formally and experimentally.</p>
<p>The involvement of A-type NF-Y subunits in the transition to the early differentiation of nodule cells has been documented in model legumes through several publications that we refer to in the revised version of the discussion (lines 617/623). We fully agree that the CDEL system, because it is heterologous, does not allow us more than to propose a parallel explanation for these observations - i.e_._, that the Medicago NF-YA1 subunit presumably acts in post-replicative cell-cycle regulation at the G2/M transition. Considering your recommendations and those of reviewer #2, we sought to support this conclusion by testing the impact of localized over-expression of <italic>NF-YA1</italic> on cortical cell division and infection competence at an early stage of root colonization. The results of these experiments are now presented in the new Figure 9 and Figure 9-figure supplement 1-5 and described from line 435 to 495.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>With the fluorescent tools the authors have at hand (in particular tools to detect G2/M transition, which the authors suggest is regulated by NF-YA1), it would be interesting to test what happens to cell division if NF-YA1 is over-expressed in Medicago roots?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To limit pleiotropic effects of an ectopic over-expression, we used the symbiosis-induced, <italic>ENOD11</italic> promoter to increase <italic>NF-YA1</italic> expression levels more specifically along the trajectory of infected cells. We chose to remain in continuity with the experiments performed in the CDEL system by opting for a destabilized version of the <italic>KNOLLE</italic> transcriptional reporter to detect the G2/M transition. The results obtained are presented in Figure 9B (quantification of split infected cells), in Figure 9-figure supplement 1B (<italic>ENOD11</italic> expression profile), in Figure 9-figure supplement 3B (representative confocal images) and Figure 9-figure supplement 4D (quantification of pKNOLLE reporter signal). There, we show that mitosis remains inhibited in cells accommodating infection threads, but is completed in a higher proportion of outer cortical cells positioned on the infection trajectory, where <italic>ENOD11</italic> gene transcription is active before their physical colonization.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Based on NF-YA1 expression data published previously and their results in tobacco epidermal cells, the authors hypothesize that NF-YA regulates the mitotic entry of nodule primordial cells. Given that much of the manuscript deals with earlier stages of the infection, I wonder if NF-YA1 could also have a role in regulating mitotic entry in cells adjacent to the infection thread?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The expression profile of <italic>NF-YA1</italic> at early stages of cortical infection (Laporte et al., 2014) is indeed similar to the one of <italic>ENOD11</italic> (as shown in Figure 9-figure supplement 1C) in wild-type Medicago roots, with corresponding transcriptional reporters being both activated in cells adjacent to the infection thread. Under our experimental conditions, additional expression of <italic>NF-YA1</italic> (driven by the <italic>ENOD11</italic> promoter) in these neighbouring cells did not impact their propensity to enter mitosis and to complete cell division. These results are presented in Figure 9-figure supplement 4D (quantification of pKNOLLE reporter signal) and Figure 9-figure supplement 5 (quantification of split neighbouring cells).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>- In the first part, images show the qualitative presence/absence of H3.1 or H3.3 histones.</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection, many cells seem to have both histones. In Fig1-S1 for example (root meristem), it is evident that there are many cells with low but clearly present H3.1 content in the green channel; however, in the overlay, the green is lost and H3.3 (pink) is mainly visible. What does this mean in terms of the cell cycle?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully agree with reviewer #1 on these points. Independent of whether they have low or high proliferation potential, most cells retain histone H3.1 particularly in silent regions of the genome, while H3.3 is constitutively produced and enriched at transcriptionally active regions. When channels are overlaid, cells in an active proliferation or endoreduplication state (in G1, S or G2, depending on the size of their nuclei) will appear mainly &quot;green&quot; (H3.1-eGFP positive). Cells with a low proliferation potential (e.g., in the QC), G2-arrested (e.g., IT-traversed) or terminally differentiating (e.g., containing symbiosomes or arbuscules) will appear mainly &quot;magenta&quot; (H3.1-low, medium to high H3.3-mCherry content).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Furthermore, all nodule images only display the overlay image, and individual fluorescence channels are not shown. Does the same masking effect happen here? It may be helpful to quantify fluoresce intensity not only in green but also in red channels as done for other experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Quantifying fluorescence intensity in the mCherry channel may indeed help to highlight the likely replacement of H3.1-eGFP by H3.3-mCherry in infected cells, as described by Otero and colleagues (2016) at the onset of cellular differentiation. However, the quantification method as established (i.e., measuring the corrected total nuclear fluorescence at the equatorial plane) cannot be applied, most of the time, to infected cells' nuclei due to the overlapping presence of mCherry-producing <italic>S. meliloti</italic> in the same channel (e.g., in Figure 2B). Nevertheless, and to avoid this masking effect when the eGFP and mCherry channels are overlaid, we now present them as isolated channels in revised Figures 1-3 and associated figure supplements. As the cell-wall staining is regularly included and displayed in grayscale, we assigned to both of them the Green Fire Blue lookup table, which maps intensity values to a multiple-colour sequential scheme (with blue or yellow indicating low or high fluorescence levels, respectively). We hope that this will allow a better appreciation of the respective levels of H3.1- and H3.3-fusions in our confocal images.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Fig 1 B - it is hard to differentiate between S. meliloti-mCherry and H3.3-mCherry. Is there a way to label the different structures?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the revised version of Figure 1B, we used filled or empty arrowheads to point to histone H3-containing nuclei. To label rhizobia-associated structures, we used dashed lines to delineate nodule cells hosting symbiosomes and included the annotation “IT” for infection threads. We also indicated proliferating, endoreduplicating and differentiating tissues and cells using the following annotations: “CD” for cell division, “En” for endoreduplication and “TD” for terminal differentiation. All annotations are explained in the figure legend.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Fig 1 - supplement E and F - no statistics are shown.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We performed non-parametric tests using the latest version of the GraphPad Prism software (version 10.4.1). Stars (Figure 1-figure supplement 1F) or different letters (Figure 1-figure supplement 1G) now indicate statistically significant differences. Results of the normality and non-parametric tests were included in the corresponding Source Data Files (Figure 1 – figure supplement 1 – source data 1 and 2). We have also updated the compact display of letters in other figures as indicated by the new software version. The raw data and the results of the statistical analyses remain unchanged and can be viewed in the corresponding source files.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Fig 2 A - overview and close-up image do not seem to be in the same focal plane. This is confusing because the nuclei position is different (so is the infection thread position).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully agree that our former Figure may have confused reviewers #1 and #2 as well as readers. Figure 2A was designed to highlight, from the same nodule primordium, actively dividing cells of the inner cortex (optical section z 6-14) and cells of the outer cortex traversed, penetrated by or neighbouring an infection thread (optical section z 11-19). We initially wanted to show different magnification views of the same confocal image (i.e_._, a full-view of the inner cortex and a zoomed-view of the outer layers) to ensure that audiences can identify these details. In the revised version of Figure 2A, we displayed these full- and zoomed-views in upper and lower panels, respectively and we removed the solid-line inset to avoid confusion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Fig 1A and Fig 2E could be combined and shown at the beginning of the manuscript. Also, consider making the cell size increase more extreme, as it is important to differentiate G2 cells after H3.1 eviction and cells in G1. You have to look very closely at the graph to see the size differences.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have taken each of your suggestions into account. A combined version of our schematic representation with more pronounced nuclei size differences is now presented in Figure 1A.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Fig. 3 C is difficult to interpret. Can this be split into different panels?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We realized that our previous choice of representation may have been confusing. Each value corresponds only to the H3.1-eGFP content, measured in an infected cell and reported to that of the neighbouring cell (IC / NC) within individual root samples. Therefore, we removed the green-magenta colour code and changed the legend accordingly. We hope that these slight modifications will facilitate the interpretation of the results - namely, that the relative level of H3.1 increases significantly in infected cells in the selected mutants compared to the wild-type. This mode of representation also highlights that in the mutants, there are more individual cases where the H3.1 content in an infected cell exceeds that of the neighbouring cell by more than two times. These cases would be masked if the couples of infected cells and associated neighbours would be split into different panels as in Figure 3B.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Line 357/359. I assume you mean ...'through the G2 phase can commit to nuclear division'.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have edited this sentence according to your suggestion, which now appears in line 370.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Cell cycle control during the nitrogen-fixing symbiosis is an important question but only poorly understood. This manuscript uses largely cell biological methods, which are always of the highest quality - to investigate host cell cycle progression during the early stages of nodule formation, where cortical infection threads penetrate the nodule primordium. The experiments were carefully conducted, the observations were detail oriented, and the results were thought-provoking. The study should be supported by mechanistic insights.</p>
<p>(1) One thought provoked by the authors' work is that while the study was carried out at an unprecedented resolution, the relationship between control of the cell cycle and infection thread penetration remains correlative. Is this reduced replicative potential among cells in the infection thread trajectory a consequence of hosting an infection thread, or a prerequisite to do so?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand and share the point of view of reviewer #2. At this stage, we believe that our data won’t enable us to fully answer the question, thus this relationship remains rather correlative. The reasons are that 1) the access to the status of cortical cells below C2 is restricted to fixed material and therefore only represents a snapshot of the situation, and 2) we are currently unable to significantly interfere with mechanisms as intertwined as cell cycle control and infection control. What we can reasonably suggest from our images is that the most favorable window of the cell cycle for cells about to be crossed by an infection thread is post-replicative, i.e., the G2 phase. Typical markers of the G2 phase were recurrently observed at the onset of physical colonization – enlarged nucleus, containing less histone H3.1 than neighbouring cells in S phase (e.g., in Figure 2A). Reaching the G2 phase could therefore be a prerequisite for infection (and associated cellular rearrangements), while prolonged arrest in this same phase is likely a consequence of transcellular passage towards a forming nodule primordium.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>More importantly, in either scenario, what is the functional significance of exiting the cell cycle or endocycle? By stating that &quot;local control of mitotic activity could be especially important for rhizobia to timely cross the middle cortex, where sustained cellular proliferation gives rise to the nodule meristem&quot; (Line 239), the authors seem to believe that cortical cells need to stop the cell cycle to prepare for rhizobia infection. This is certainly reasonable, but the current study provides no proof, yet. To test the functional importance of cell cycle exit, one would interfere with G2/M transition in nodule cells,  and examine the effect on infection.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully agree with reviewer #2 that the functional importance of a cell-cycle arrest on the infection thread trajectory remains to be demonstrated. Interfering with cell-cycle progression in a system as complex and fine-tuned as infected legume roots certainly requires the right timing – at the level of the tissue and of individual cells; the right dose; and the right molecular player(s) (i.e., bona fide activators or repressors of the G2/M transition). Using the symbiosis-specific <italic>NPL</italic> promoter, activated in the direct vicinity of cortical infection threads (Figure 9-figure supplement 1B), we tried to force infectable cells to recruit the cell division program by ectopically over-expressing the Arabidopsis <italic>CYCD3.1</italic>, “mimicking” the CDEL system. So far, this strategy has not resulted in a significant increase in the number of uninfected nodules in transgenic hairy roots - though the effect on symbiosome release remains to be investigated. Provided that a suitable promoter-cell cycle regulator combination is identified, we hope to be able to answer this question in the future.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Given that the authors have already identified a candidate, and showed it represses cell division in the CDEL system, not testing the same gene in a more relevant context seems a lost opportunity. If one ectopically expressed NY-YA1 in hairy roots, thus repressing mitosis in general, would more cells become competent to host infection threads? This seems a straightforward experiment and readily feasible with the constructs that the authors already have. If this view is too naive, the authors should explain why such a functional investigation does not belong in this manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reviewer #2's point is entirely valid, and we decided to address it through additional experiments. To avoid possible side effects on development by affecting cell division in general, we placed <italic>NF-YA1</italic> under control of the symbiosis-induced <italic>ENOD11</italic> promoter. Based on the results obtained in the CDEL system, the pENOD11::FLAG-NF-YA1 cassette was coupled to a destabilized version of the <italic>KNOLLE</italic> transcriptional reporter to detect the G2/M transition. Competence for transcellular infection was maintained upon local <italic>NFYA1</italic> overexpression, the latter leading to a slight (non-significant) increase in the number of infected cells per cortical layer. These results are presented in Figure 9-figure supplement 3A-B (representative confocal images) and in Figure 9-figure supplement 4A-</p>
<p>G.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1b) A related comment: on Line 183, it was stated that &quot;The H3.1-eGFP fusion protein was also visible in cells penetrated but not fully passed by an infection thread&quot;. Presumably, the authors were talking about the cell marked by the arrowhead. But its H3.1-GFP signal looks no different from the cell immediately to its left. It is hard to say which cells are ones &quot;preparing for intracellular infection pass through S-phase&quot;, and which ones are just &quot;regularly dividing cortical cells forming the nodule primordium&quot;. What can be concluded is that once a cell has been fully transversed by an infection thread, its H3.1 level is low. Whether this is the cause or consequence of infection cannot be resolved simply by timing the appearance or disappearance of H3.1-GFP.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We basically agree with comment 1b. In an unsynchronized system such as infected hairy roots, it is challenging to detect the event where a cell is penetrated, but not yet completely crossed by an infection thread. What we wanted to emphasize in Figure 2A, is that host cells in the path of an infection thread re-enter the cell cycle and pass through S-phase just as their neighbours do (as pointed out by reviewer #2 in his summary). The larger nucleus with slightly lower H3.1-eGFP signal than the neighbouring cell (as indicated by the use of the Green Fire Blue lookup table) suggests that the infected cell marked by the arrowhead in Figure 2A is actually in the G2 phase. The main difference is indeed that cells allowing complete infection thread passage exit the cell cycle and largely evict H3.1 while their neighbours proceed to cell division (as exemplified by PlaCCI reporters in Figure 4CD and the new Figure 5-figure supplement 2). Whether cell-cycle exit in G2 is a cause, or a consequence of cortical infection is a question that cannot be easily answered from fixed samples, which is a limitation of our study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors have convincingly demonstrated that cortical cells accommodating infection threads exit the cell cycle, inhibit cell division, and down-regulate KNOLLE expression. How do these observations reconcile with the feature called the pre-infection thread? The authors devoted one paragraph to this question in the Discussion, but this does seem sufficient given that the pre-infection thread is a prominent concept. Is the resemblance to the cell division plane superficial, or does it reflect a co-option of the normal cytokinesis machinery for accommodating rhizobia?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>From our point of view, cortical cells forming pre-infection threads are likely in an intermediate state. PIT structures undoubtedly share many similarities with cells establishing a cell division plane. The recruitment of at least some of the players normally associated with cytokinesis has been demonstrated and is consistent with the maintenance of infectable cells in a pre-mitotic phase in Medicago, as discussed in lines 558 to 568. We nevertheless think that the arrest of the cell cycle in the G2 phase, presumably occurring in crossed cortical cells, constitutes an event of cellular differentiation and specialization in transcellular infection.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The following are mainly points of presentation and description:</p>
<p>(3) Line 158: I can't see &quot;subnuclear foci&quot; in Figure 1-figure supplement 1C-E. However, they are visible in Fig. 1C.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We hope that presenting the eGFP and mCherry channels in separate panels and assigning them the Green Fire Blue colour scheme provides better visibility and contrast of these detailed structures. We now refer to Figure 1C in addition to Figure 1–figure supplement 1E in the main text (line 161).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Line 160: The authors should outline a larger region containing multiple QC cells, rather than pointing to a single cell, as there are other areas in the image containing cells with the same pattern.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We updated Figure 1-figure supplement 1E accordingly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Fig. 1B should include single channels, since within a single plant cell, the nucleus, the infection thread, and sometimes symbiosomes all have the same color. This makes it hard to see whether the nuclei in these cells are less green, or are simply overwhelmed by the magenta color.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To improve the readability of Figure 1B and to address suggestions from individual reviewers, we now include separate channels and have annotated the different structures labeled by mCherry.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Fig. 2A: the close-up does not match the boxed area in the left panel. Based on the labeling, it seems that the two panels are different optical sections. But why choose a different optical depth for the left panel? This can be disorienting to the author, because one expects the close-up to be the same image, just under higher magnification.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully agree that our previous choice of representation may have been confusing. As we also specified to reviewer #1, we wanted to show a full-view of proliferating cells in the inner cortex and a zoomed-view of infected cells in the outer layers of the same nodule primordium. In the revised version of Figure 2A, we displayed these full- and zoomedviews in separate panels and removed the boxed area to avoid confusion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Figure 2-figure supplement 1B: the cell indicated by the empty arrowhead has a striking pattern of H3.1 and H3.3 distribution on condensed chromosomes. Can you comment on that?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reviewer #2 may be referring to the apparent enrichment of H3.3 at telomeres, previously described in Arabidopsis, while pericentromeric regions are enriched in H3.1. This distribution is indeed visible on most of the condensed chromosomes shown in Figure 2-figure supplement 1B. We included this comment in the corresponding caption.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Fig. 4: It is not very easy to distinguish M phase. Can the authors describe how each phase is supposed to look like with the reporters?</p>

<p>We agree with reviewer #2 and attempted to improve Figure 4, which is now dedicated to the Arabidopsis PlaCCI reporter. ECFP, mCherry, and YFP channels were presented separately and the corresponding cell-cycle phases (in interphase and mitosis) were annotated. The Green Fire Blue lookup table was assigned to each reporter to provide the best visibility of, for example, chromosomes in early prophase. We included a schematic representation corresponding to the distribution of each reporter, using the colors of the overlaid image to facilitate its interpretation.</p>

<p>(9) Line 298: what is endopolyploid? This term is used at least three times throughout the manuscript. How is it different from polyploid?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the manuscript, we aimed to differentiate the (poly)ploidy of an organism (reflecting the number of copies of the basic genome and inherited through the germline) from endopolyploidy produced by individual somatic cells. As reviewed by Scholes and Paige, polyploidy and endopolyploidy differ in important ways, including allelic diversity and chromosome structural differences. In the <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic> root cortex for example, a tetraploid cell generated via endoreduplication from the diploid state would contain at most two alleles at any locus. The effects of endopolyploidy on cell size, gene expression, cell metabolism and the duration of the mitotic cell cycle are not shared among individual cells or organs, contrasting to a polyploid individual (Scholes and Paige, 2015).</p>

<p>(10) Line 332: &quot;chromosomes on mitotic figures&quot; - what does this mean?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reviewer #2 is right to point out this redundant wording. Mitotic “figures” are recognized, by definition, based on chromosome condensation. We now use the term &quot;mitotic chromosomes&quot; (line 344).</p>

<p>(11) Fig. 6A: could the authors consider labeling the doublets, at least some of them? I understand that this nucleus contains many doublets. However, this is the first image where one is supposed to recognize these doublets, and pointing out these features can facilitate understanding. Otherwise, a reader might think the image is comparable to nuclei with no doublets in the rest of the figure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Following this suggestion, five of these doublets are now labeled in Figure 7A (formerly Figure 6A).</p>
