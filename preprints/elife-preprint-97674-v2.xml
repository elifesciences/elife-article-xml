<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Otolith organs in the inner ear and neuromasts in the fish lateral-line harbor two populations of hair cells oriented to detect stimuli in opposing directions. The underlying mechanism is highly conserved: the transcription factor EMX2 is regionally expressed in just one hair cell population and acts through the receptor GPR156 to reverse cell orientation relative to the other population. In mouse and zebrafish, loss of Emx2 results in sensory organs that harbor only one hair cell orientation and are not innervated properly. In zebrafish, Emx2 also confers hair cells with reduced mechanosensory properties. Here, we leverage mouse and zebrafish models lacking GPR156 to determine how detecting stimuli of opposing directions serves vestibular function, and whether GPR156 has other roles besides orienting hair cells. We find that otolith organs in <italic>Gpr156</italic> mouse mutants have normal zonal organization and normal type I-II hair cell distribution and mechano-electrical transduction properties. In contrast, <italic>gpr156</italic> zebrafish mutants lack the smaller mechanically-evoked signals that characterize Emx2-positive hair cells. Loss of GPR156 does not affect orientation-selectivity of afferents in mouse utricle or zebrafish neuromasts. Consistent with normal otolith organ anatomy and afferent selectivity, <italic>Gpr156</italic> mutant mice do not show overt vestibular dysfunction. Instead, performance on two tests that engage otolith organs is significantly altered – swimming and off-vertical-axis rotation. We conclude that GPR156 relays hair cell orientation and transduction information downstream of EMX2, but not selectivity for direction-specific afferents. These results clarify how molecular mechanisms that confer bi-directionality to sensory organs contribute to function, from single hair cell physiology to animal behavior.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The vestibular system provides essential information about the head’s motion and orientation relative to gravity and plays a vital role in everyday life. Fundamental gaps exist in our understanding of vestibular development and function. For example, we do not fully understand how the abrupt reversal of hair cell (HC) orientation in otolith organs affects vestibular function, and whether the reversal also impacts HC mechano-electrical transduction properties or afferent neuron contacts. We explore these questions further in mouse and in the zebrafish lateral line, a sensory system where external fluid flow is detected by neuromast organs that also feature HC reversal.</p>
<p>Vestibular HCs reside in five sensory organs per inner ear in human, mouse and larval zebrafish: three cristae ampullaris and two otolith (or macular) organs. Within each of these organs, HCs are precisely oriented to detect mechanical stimuli based on direction. HCs are sensitive to the proportion of a stimulus aligned with the mechanosensory hair bundle’s orientation: a vector from the bundle’s short edge to its tall (kinociliary) edge. In cristae, which detect angular head motions, HCs are oriented uniformly to detect fluid flow in the plane of the attached semicircular canal. In contrast, HCs in otolith organs are oriented to respond to a range of head positions and linear motions in an approximately horizontal (utricle) or vertical (saccule) plane (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Within these planes, HCs show two opposing orientations across a virtual “line of polarity reversal” (LPR), a conserved anatomical feature in all otolith organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Denman-Johnson and Forge, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Flock, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lindeman, 1969</xref>). HCs are also aligned in two opposing orientations in fish and amphibian neuromasts in the lateral-line system. Orientation reversal confers on neighboring HCs of opposing orientations opposite responses to the same local stimulus: depolarization and increased afferent spike rate in one population, but hyperpolarization and decreased spike rate in the other. This functional prediction and its utility are well established in neuromasts as the ability to sensitively detect water movements in two directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Chitnis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lopez-Schier et al., 2004</xref>). Beyond increasing the range of stimulus orientations detected, it remains unclear how HCs with opposing orientations and responses serve otolith organ function.</p>

<p>In the utricle, the LPR also segregates distinct zones, for example the lateral extrastriola (LES) from the more medial striola (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Zones are strikingly different regions found in all vestibular epithelia, with ‘central’ and ‘peripheral’ zones of cristae corresponding to striolar and extrastriolar zones of maculae, respectively. Afferents that innervate striolar HCs have irregular spike timing and adapting responses in contrast to afferents that innervate extrastriolar HCs which have more regular and tonic spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Goldberg, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Goldberg, 2000</xref>). Striolar afferents transmit more information about the time course of translational self-motion, while extrastriolar afferents better discriminate between different static head orientations relative to gravity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jamali et al., 2019</xref>). Correlated with these physiological differences between zones are differences in HCs and afferent morphologies. Both the striola and extrastriola are populated by type I HCs contacted by <italic>calyx afferent endings</italic> and type II HCs contacted by <italic>bouton afferent endings.</italic> Most individual afferents in both zones contact both type I and type II HCs (“<italic>dimorphic afferents</italic>”). However, pure-calyx and pure-bouton individual afferents are respectively only found in the striola and extrastriola (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Eatock and Songer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Goldberg, 2000</xref>). In amniotes there is no obligatory relationship between HC orientation reversal and zones. While the utricular striola is entirely medial to the LPR, the saccular striola is bisected by the LPR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Deans, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Xue and Peterson, 2006</xref>). Moreover, central and peripheral zones of cristae bear many anatomical and physiological similarities to the striolar and extrastriolar zones, but cristae have no LPR and no abrupt variation in HC orientation, as in the organ of Corti.</p>
<p>Interestingly, mammalian otolith afferents have two distinct anatomical properties that segregate with the LPR. First, individual afferents are maximally excited by stimuli of one orientation and not the opposite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fernandez et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Goldberg et al., 1990</xref>), indicating that individual afferents selectively contact HCs sharing the same general orientation, as also observed in the zebrafish lateral line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ji et al., 2018</xref>). Second, the central projections of afferent neurons innervating HCs on each side of the LPR are also distinct; afferents that innervate one HC orientation largely project to the cerebellum, while the opposite HC orientation projects to the brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ji et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Maklad et al., 2010</xref>). The LPR thus correlates with a striking segregation of both the peripheral and central projections of afferent neurons.</p>
<p>Recent work has illuminated how HCs with opposing orientations are formed during development (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tarchini, 2021</xref>)). Early in development all organs are polarized by core PCP proteins that are enriched asymmetrically at cell-cell junctions before HCs are born (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Deans, 2013</xref>). In cristae, asymmetric core PCP proteins set up a default, uniform HC orientation across the epithelium. Because the asymmetric pattern of core PCP protein enrichment is unchanged across the LPR, a distinct, regional mechanism defines a HC population with an opposite orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Deans, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Deans et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jones et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Mirkovic et al., 2012</xref>). Regional expression of the transcription factor EMX2 in the lateral utricle and posterior saccule drives the 180°-reversed orientation of HCs compared to neighboring <italic>Emx2</italic>-negative HCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Holley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>). Although regionally restricted, <italic>Emx2</italic> is expressed by all cell types in the sensory epithelium. Reversal is achieved cell-autonomously in HCs by an orphan GPCR, GPR156 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kindt et al., 2021</xref>). Unlike <italic>Emx2</italic>, <italic>Gpr156</italic> is transcribed throughout the sensory epithelia but is limited to HCs. In <italic>Emx2</italic>-positive HCs only, the GPR156 protein is trafficked and planar-polarized at apical junctions, where it signals through inhibitory G proteins to trigger a reversal in HC orientation. The EMX2&gt;GPR156 reversal cascade is conserved in zebrafish neuromasts and loss of either of these proteins produces neuromasts where all HCs adopt the same, uniform orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jacobo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kindt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kozak et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lozano-Ortega et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Importantly, in addition to reversing HC orientation, Emx2 is required for afferent selectivity. In zebrafish <italic>emx2</italic> mutants, individual afferent fibers either innervate nearly all or very few HCs instead of innervating ∼50% of HCs based on their shared orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ji et al., 2018</xref>). In mouse otolith organs, regional <italic>Emx2</italic> expression is required for local afferents that innervate HC of one orientation to project centrally to the cerebellum and not to the brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ji et al., 2022</xref>). In zebrafish, Emx2 was also recently shown to affect HC mechanotransduction, thus defining an orientation-based functional asymmetry in lateral-line neuromasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Chou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kindig et al., 2023</xref>). It remains unknown whether, similar to Emx2, GPR156 is required for orientation-based selectivity of afferent contacts in mouse otolith organs or zebrafish neuromasts, and whether Gpr156 participates in direction-based asymmetry of mechanosensitive response in neuromasts.</p>
<p>Here, using animal models where <italic>Gpr156</italic> is inactivated, we first established that abolishing the LPR in mouse otolith organs did not produce obvious changes in HC patterning and mechanotransduction properties. In contrast, we found that similar to Emx2, Gpr156 is required for asymmetric mechanotransduction in zebrafish neuromasts. Normal afferent segregation was maintained in both mice and zebrafish lacking GPR156 despite one HC population failing to reverse its orientation. Unchanged afferent organization in the mouse allowed us to specifically interrogate how the LPR serves vestibular function. We found that although <italic>Gpr156</italic> mutant mice did not show overt vestibular dysfunction, performance on two tests that engage otolith organs was significantly altered. This study clarifies how molecular mechanisms that orient HCs to achieve bi-directional sensitivity contribute to vestibular and lateral-line function.</p>

<title>Normal hair cell numbers and organization in <italic>Gpr156</italic> mutant adult otolith organs</title>
<p>In previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kindt et al., 2021</xref>), we established that in sensory organs of the inner ear and lateral-line, <italic>Gpr156</italic> expression is limited to HCs. In neonate otolith organs, we demonstrated that GPR156 is required for EMX2-positive HCs to adopt a reversed orientation compared to EMX2-negative HCs. We further showed that EMX2-positive HCs lacking GPR156 do not correct their orientation with time and remain non-reversed in young adults (P21-P28). Focusing on the utricular sensory epithelium, we showed normal macular surface area and number of HCs in all three zones (LES, striola and MES; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) in adult <italic>Gpr156<sup>del/del</sup></italic>mutants. Here we begin by extending our morphological characterization of <italic>Gpr156<sup>del/del</sup></italic>adult macular organs to include the saccule as well as zonal and HC type profiles, before proceeding to functional and behavioral assessments.</p>
<p>We first verified that absence of GPR156 did not obviously interfere with striolar patterning in adult animals. We used oncomodulin (OCM) to immunolabel striolar HCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Simmons et al., 2010</xref>) at 4-week of age (P28) and confirmed that striolar surface area and striolar HC density were unaffected in constitutive <italic>Gpr156<sup>del/del</sup></italic> mutant utricles and saccules compared to controls (<italic>Gpr156<sup>del/+</sup></italic>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-C</xref>). Each macular organ contains two main HC types, type I and type II. Therefore, we next quantified type I HCs in the LES, striola and MES zones of the adult utricle and in the anterior (ANT), striolar and posterior (POST) zones of the adult saccule. We used SPP1/Osteopontin, a marker that labels the neck region of approximately 90% of type I HCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D-E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">McInturff et al., 2018</xref>). We observed no difference in SPP1-positive type I HC numbers between mutants and controls in any zone or organ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>).

<title>No defects in mechano-electrical transduction were detected in individual mouse utricular hair cells of <italic>Gpr156</italic> mutants</title>
<p><italic>Gpr156</italic> inactivation could be a powerful model to specifically ask how HC reversal contributes to vestibular function. However, GPR156 may have other confounding roles in HCs besides regulating their orientation, similar to EMX2, which impacts mechanotransduction in zebrafish HCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kindig et al., 2023</xref>) and afferent innervation in mouse and zebrafish HCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ji et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ji et al., 2018</xref>). After establishing normal numbers and types of mouse vestibular HCs, we thus first assessed whether HCs respond normally to hair bundle deflections in the absence of GPR156. For this assessment, we recorded whole-cell mechano-electrical transduction (MET) currents of HCs in the utricle of <italic>Gpr156<sup>del/del</sup></italic>mutants. To stimulate transduction, we deflected individual mechanosensory hair bundles of HCs from <italic>Gpr156<sup>del/del</sup></italic> mutants and heterozygous <italic>Gpr156<sup>del/+</sup></italic> control utricles with a rigid probe coupled to the back (short edge) of the bundle (see Methods, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). All bundles were positively deflected along their orientation axes.

<p>I<sub>MET</sub> responses are shown for families of iterated 400-ms steps of displacement; subsets of these families are shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-E</xref>. During bundle displacement, I<sub>MET</sub> typically peaked at step onset. As noted before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Vollrath and Eatock, 2003</xref>), traces evoked by stimuli in the middle of the operating range adapted with a time course fit by 1-2 decaying exponential terms. Because type I and II HCs were voltage-clamped at different holding potentials (V<sub>hold</sub> = –94 and –84 mV, respectively, see Methods), their MET currents experienced different driving forces. We normalized for driving force by converting current to conductance (G) and plotted G as a function of hair bundle displacement (X) for each HC type and genotype (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F-G</xref>). G(X) curves were fit with a simple Boltzmann function (<xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq. 1</xref>, Methods), yielding values for maximum conductance (G<sub>max</sub>), the midpoint of the G(X) curve (X<sub>1/2</sub>, displacement at half-maximal I<sub>MET</sub>) and <italic>dx</italic> (slope factor), the displacement range corresponding to an e-fold increase in G for small displacements. Among the LES HCs tested, no significant differences were detected between genotypes for any Boltzmann parameter (<italic>G<sub>max</sub></italic>, <italic>X<sub>1/2</sub></italic>, or <italic>dx</italic>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F-G</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). G<sub>max</sub> values were in the range of 2.5-3.0 nS, <italic>X<sub>1/2</sub></italic> was 200-300 nm and <italic>dx</italic> was 150-200 nm (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). From G(X) relations we estimated the operating range (OR; displacement range yielding 10-90% growth of G<sub>MET</sub>) to be ∼800-900 nm for all LES HCs (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In summary, the peak (non-adapted) displacement sensitivity of I<sub>MET</sub> was not detectably affected in LES hair bundles of mutants.</p>
<p>Another salient feature of vestibular HC transduction is adaptation (response decay) during a steady hair bundle deflection. We fit the adaptation with one or more exponential decays, and also calculated its extent (% decay) (<xref rid="eqn4" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq. 4</xref>, Methods; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-E</xref>). As reported previously for immature mouse utricular HCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Vollrath and Eatock, 2003</xref>), these mature mouse utricular HCs had fast and slow adaptation components. The fast component was more prominent at small displacements and the slow component dominated at large displacements; often, both were evident in the middle of the operating range. We therefore compared adaptation time constants, 1<sub>fast</sub> and 1<sub>slow</sub>, at the midpoint of the operating range (<italic>X<sub>1/2</sub></italic>). For 400-ms steps, mean values are in the range of 4 - 10 ms and 70 – 140 ms, respectively, and the two components are responsible for comparable extents of the total adaptation. These results are consistent with previous reports with similar methods from immature mouse utricular HCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Vollrath and Eatock, 2003</xref>) and immature rat saccular HCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Songer and Eatock, 2013</xref>. In the current sample, however, adaptation at <italic>X<sub>1/2</sub></italic> included a significant third, faster adaptation component (“very fast”; 1<sub>VF</sub> &lt; 1 ms) in most type I HCs (12/13) and 2/10 type II HCs. In the LES, we detected no significant differences with genotype in adaptation rates or extent (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>The time course and voltage dependence of outwardly rectifying voltage-gated current from LES type I cells of <italic>Gpr156<sup>del/del</sup></italic> utricles resembled those of <italic>Gpr156<sup>del/+</sup></italic> utricles (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A, C</xref>). Most of the current in type I HCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A, C</xref>) flows through a low-voltage-activated K<sup>+</sup> conductance (g<sub>K,L</sub>) that dominates the type I HC voltage response. As described in Methods, we used the current data to generate conductance density vs. voltage (G/Cm - V) curves (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>) and fitted them with the Boltzmann function (<xref rid="eqn5" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq. 5</xref>, Methods) to show how the open probability of g<sub>K,L</sub> varies with voltage. In both genotypes, approximately half of g<sub>K,L</sub> was activated at resting membrane potential, V<sub>rest</sub> (∼–85 mV). As a consequence of their large K<sup>+</sup> conductance at V<sub>rest</sub>, type I cells had low input resistances (R<sub>in</sub> ∼50 MΩ).

<p>Similarly, we detected no effect of genotype on the voltage-dependent outward currents of LES type II HCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B, D, F</xref>). The currents activated positive to resting potential (∼– 72 mV) and had activation midpoints (V<sub>1/2</sub> values) of –30 to –40 mV. Because of the small voltage-gated conductance at rest, input resistance was ∼10-fold higher than in type I HCs (∼500 MΩ vs. ∼50 MΩ). The outward currents inactivated significantly within 400 ms, indicating a substantial A-current component. The maximum conductance density (G<sub>max</sub>/C<sub>m</sub>) at 400 ms (∼steady state), which is proportional to the number of open channels per unit membrane area, was much smaller than in type I HCs. Again, no effect of genotype was detected on the differences between type I and II HCs of the LES (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Together these results are consistent with previous reports on key physiological properties of type I and II HCs in amniote vestibular organs.

<title>Gpr156 impacted the mechanosensitive properties of lateral-line hair cells in zebrafish</title>
<p>Similar to otolith organs of mammals, each neuromast within the posterior lateral-line system of zebrafish has two populations of HCs that enable the detection of anterior-or posterior-directed fluid flow (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>).

<p>To address this question, we used a membrane-localized GCaMP6s reporter in HCs (memGCaMP6s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kindt et al., 2021</xref>) to perform <italic>in vivo</italic> calcium imaging (Lukasz and Kindt, 2018) and. By imaging GCaMP6s signals in an apical plane containing the hair bundles, we measured evoked, mechanosensation-dependent calcium signals during fluid-jet stimulation. We used this approach to stimulate in both the anterior and posterior direction and compared the magnitude of the mechanosensitive responses in lateral-line HCs in both control (<italic>gpr156<sup>+/-</sup>)</italic> and <italic>gpr156</italic> mutants. As shown previously, we could reliably identify the orientation of control HCs (whether they sense posterior to anterior flow, P to A) or the reverse, A to P) using this approach (e.g., <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). We first verified that in control animals, the magnitude of the mechanosensitive responses of HCs that detect anterior flow was greater than those that detect posterior flow (e.g.: <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D, F</xref>). Consistent with previous work, in <italic>gpr156</italic> mutants, we found that the majority of HCs only responded to P to A flow (e.g., <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kindt et al., 2021</xref>). We next examined the magnitude of the GCaMP6s response in these P to A HCs in <italic>gpr156</italic> mutants. If Gpr156 did not function downstream of Emx2 to alter the mechanosensitive properties of HCs, we predicted that the response magnitude of these HCs would fall between that of P to A and A to P control HCs. However, if Gpr156 does act downstream of Emx2, we predicted that the response magnitude of the P to A HCs in <italic>gpr156</italic> mutants would resemble that of P to A HCs in controls and be greater than that of A to P HCs in controls. Importantly, we found that the magnitude of the mechanosensitive responses in <italic>gpr156</italic> mutants was comparable to that of control P to A HCs (e.g., <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E-F</xref>). Further, the mechanosensitive responses were significantly larger in <italic>gpr156</italic> mutants than control A to P HCs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>).</p>
<p>Our analysis thus indicates that in <italic>gpr156</italic> mutants, lateral-line HCs show larger mechanosensitive responses. These responses are similar to HCs in control animals that respond to anterior flow (Emx2<sup>-</sup>). Together, this data suggests that the EMX2-GPR156 mechanism driving HC orientation reversal also affects the mechanosensitive properties of HCs in zebrafish neuromasts.</p>

<title>Segregated afferent receptive fields were preserved in mouse utricles lacking GPR156</title>
<p>After characterizing the functional properties of HCs in mouse and zebrafish <italic>Gpr156</italic> mutants, we examined whether GPR156 plays a role in orientation-selective afferent innervation. Previous work has demonstrated that <italic>Emx2</italic> expression in the LES of the mouse utricle and in HCs that sense posterior flow in the lateral line is required for afferents to innervate HCs of similar (rather than opposing) orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ji et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ji et al., 2018</xref>). Whether GPR156 plays a similar role in direction-selective afferent innervation is unknown.</p>
<p>To investigate whether afferent organization in the LES is disrupted by loss of GPR156, we first compared the terminal fields of individual dye-filled calyx-bearing afferents in <italic>Gpr156<sup>del/+</sup> and Gpr156<sup>del/del</sup></italic> utricles. All LES calyces belong to dimorphic afferents, which form both calyces on type I HCs and boutons on type II HCs.

In this single case, a terminal branch crossed the LPR, innervating 16 striolar HCs with opposite orientation to the 12 LES HCs also innervated. In some filled LES afferents, a thin branch originated below the epithelium (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>, Supplemental video 1), as previously described for chinchilla extrastriola (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fernandez et al., 1990</xref>).

<p>When we performed dye labeling in <italic>Gpr156<sup>del/del</sup></italic> utricles, the innervation patterns and the size of terminal fields appeared similar to <italic>Gpr156<sup>del/+</sup></italic> controls. In <italic>Gpr156<sup>del/del</sup></italic> utricles, the labeled LES afferents (n = 8) were also all dimorphic, terminating in up to three calyces and 56 boutons (median: 23). The labeled receptive fields did not cross the striola/LES border (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E-G</xref>). We also did not observe fiber branches extending across the border from parent axons (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E-G</xref>; Supplemental video 2). As observed in the lone <italic>Gpr156<sup>del/+</sup></italic>striolar afferent (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>), <italic>Gpr156<sup>del/del</sup></italic> afferents with the main dendritic fiber terminating in the striola (n = 4) contacted relatively few HCs, and receptive fields were restricted to the calbindin-positive region (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>).</p>
<p>To confirm and complement dye-filling results at the whole organ level, we used a new genetic approach to specifically label afferents innervating EMX2<sup>+</sup> HCs in the LES. Interestingly, when breeding the <italic>Advillin-Cre</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Zhou et al., 2010</xref>) with the <italic>Tigre Ai140</italic> reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Daigle et al., 2018</xref>), we only observed Cre recombination and EGFP expression in vestibular ganglion neurons that contacted HCs in the lateral utricle region (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). Close examination revealed clear labeling of HC calyces in the LES, and occasionally in OCM<sup>+</sup> HCs in the lateral striola (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>, arrowheads). We confirmed that similar to OCM<sup>-</sup> EGFP<sup>+</sup> HCs in the LES, these OCM<sup>+</sup> EGFP<sup>+</sup> HCs were invariably oriented towards the medial edge (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). This demonstrated that <italic>Advillin</italic> expression defines a population of neurons whose peripheral processes closely segregate with HC orientation, irrespective of striolar (OCM<sup>+</sup>) or extrastriolar (OCM<sup>-</sup>) HC identity. Importantly, HC innervation by <italic>Advillin</italic>-positive neurons was unchanged in <italic>Gpr156<sup>del/del</sup></italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A-B</xref>).

<p>In summary, we detected no anomaly in afferent receptive fields in utricles lacking GPR156 and thus lacking a LPR, showing that the tendency of afferents to innervate HCs on one side of the LPR is not controlled by GPR156 or HC orientation.</p>

<title>Afferent firing patterns were preserved in mouse utricles lacking GPR156</title>
<p>Our innervation data suggested that HCs in zones demarcated by the LPR are still innervated by distinct populations of afferent neurons in <italic>Gpr156<sup>del/del</sup></italic>mutants. We next investigated whether the LES afferent population retains normal physiology. Striolar afferents have highly irregular inter-spike intervals, while extrastriolar afferents in both LES and MES have much more regular inter-spike intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Goldberg, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Goldberg, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Goldberg et al., 1990</xref>). Associated with the difference in spike timing regularity are zonal differences in response dynamics and information encoding capacity (e.g., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jamali et al., 2019</xref>)). The spike timing difference is considered to reflect differences in afferents’ excitability as conferred by their intrinsic ion channels, with regular afferents being more excitable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kalluri et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ventura and Kalluri, 2019</xref>). To test for effects of <italic>Gpr156</italic> inactivation on afferent excitability, we injected small depolarizing current steps into LES calyces through the whole-cell recording pipette and measured current threshold for spiking, I<sub>thresh</sub>, and the numbers of spikes evoked by each current step.</p>
<p>As reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gonzalez-Garrido et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Ono et al., 2020</xref>), I<sub>thresh</sub> evoked 1-to-several spikes but increments beyond I<sub>thresh</sub> evoked more sustained firing (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A-B</xref>).

<p>Consistent with previous results, some afferent fibers selectively contacted Emx2<sup>-</sup> HCs with hair bundles oriented to respond to anterior flow in control animals (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A-H</xref>).

<p>Following this initial assessment, we quantified the percentage of HCs per neuromast that were innervated by each afferent fiber. We found that <italic>gpr156</italic> mutant fibers innervated a similar percentage of HCs per neuromast compared to controls (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9Q</xref>, control: 38.90 % ± 2.40, n = 18, <italic>gpr156</italic> ko: 41.31 % ± 2.33, n = 23, p = 0.48). We also quantified how selective each afferent fiber was for Emx2<sup>+</sup> or Emx2<sup>-</sup> HC. For each afferent fiber, we calculated the percentage of either Emx2<sup>+</sup> or Emx2<sup>-</sup> HCs innervated out of the total number of innervated HCs. In both control and <italic>gpr156</italic> mutants, afferent fibers showed a high selectivity (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9R</xref>, control: 85.06 % ± 4.32, n = 18, <italic>gpr156</italic> ko: 81.29 % ± 3.17, n = 23, p = 0.48). We split this dataset and examined the selectivity of afferent fibers that preferentially contacted either Emx2<sup>-</sup> or Emx2<sup>+</sup> HCs (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9S-T</xref>). This analysis revealed that in control and <italic>gpr156</italic> mutants, both afferent fiber types were highly selective (afferents contacting Emx2<sup>-</sup> cells, control: 81.41 % ± 7.90, n = 8, <italic>gpr156</italic> ko: 79.37 % ± 4.73, n = 10, p = 0.82; afferents contacting Emx2<sup>+</sup> cells, control: 87.99 % ± 4.75, n = 10, <italic>gpr156</italic> ko: 82.80 % ± 4.38, n = 13, p = 0.43).

<p>To extend this analysis, we examined synaptic pairing in <italic>gpr156</italic> mutants.

<p>In summary, <italic>Gpr156</italic> inactivation does not appear to impact afferent selectivity in either mouse or zebrafish. This is in sharp contrast with results in <italic>Emx2</italic> mutants, where orientation-specific HC afferent innervation is profoundly altered in mouse and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ji et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ji et al., 2018</xref>). It follows that HC orientation per se does not dictate afferent selectivity, with EMX2 likely using a different effector(s) than GPR156 in this context. Thus, afferent studies confirm that the <italic>Gpr156<sup>del</sup></italic> model is well-suited to investigate specifically how the reversal of HC orientation in otolith and lateral line organs serves organ function.</p>

<title><italic>Gpr156</italic> mutant mice had defects in otolith-driven, but not canal-driven, vestibular behaviors</title>
<p>In mammals, only otolith organs (utricle, saccule) have a LPR. Therefore, the absence of a LPR in <italic>Gpr156</italic> mutants should only affect otolith-driven reflexes and behaviors.

Visual and quantitative assessments did not reveal circling or head tremor behaviors in <italic>Gpr156<sup>del/del</sup></italic> mice at rest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplemental fig. 2</xref>).

Further, to confirm that there was no visual deficit in <italic>Gpr156<sup>del/del</sup></italic> mice, we also tested their optokinetic reflex (OKR) by rotating a patterned visual surround sinusoidally about earth vertical axis at the same testing frequencies, while the animal remained stationary (see Methods). The OKR responses of <italic>Gpr156<sup>del/del</sup></italic> and control mice were comparable, confirming that there was no visual deficit in <italic>Gpr156</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12C-D</xref>). For the sake of completeness, we quantified the angular VOR evoked in the light (VORl) by rotating the animal sinusoidally around earth vertical axis, while the patterned visual surround remained stationary. Again, we found no difference in the VORl response of <italic>Gpr156<sup>del/del</sup></italic> versus control mice in this lit environment (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12E-F</xref>). Finally, we tested whether <italic>Gpr156<sup>del/del</sup></italic> mice demonstrated normal ability to adapt their angular VOR. We used a standard angular VOR motor learning protocol (see Methods) in which we carried out 30-minute-long VOR gain-down training for both control and <italic>Gpr156<sup>del/del</sup></italic> mice. Head restrained mice were rotated with the visual surround in phase. The training stimulus was 2 Hz with a peak velocity of 16°/s. The learning efficacy was assessed by quantifying change in the VOR gain after training. In both control and <italic>Gpr156<sup>del/del</sup></italic>mice, this VOR motor learning protocol produced a significant reduction in VOR gain after training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supplemental fig. 4A-B</xref>). Overall, <italic>Gpr156<sup>del/del</sup></italic>and control mice demonstrated a comparable percent change of gain decrease at each testing frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supplemental fig. 4C</xref>). Together, our VOR and OKR results indicated normal semicircular canals-driven responses in <italic>Gpr156<sup>del/del</sup></italic> mice.</p>

<title>Altered OVAR responses in <italic>Gpr156</italic> mutants</title>
<p>As no defects were apparent in semicircular canal-mediated behavior, we next tested whether otolith-mediated vestibulo-ocular reflex behaviors were impaired in <italic>Gpr156<sup>del/del</sup></italic>mice. For this assessment, we recorded eye movements while the mouse was tilted 17° off-the vertical axis (i.e., off-vertical axis rotation (OVAR)), and then rotated at a constant velocity (50°/s for 72 sec). The eye velocity evoked by this paradigm comprised two different responses: (1) a transient canal-mediated response that decayed over the first 10-15 sec and (2) an otolith-mediated steady-state response in which eye velocity oscillated around a constant bias with a sinusoidal waveform (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12G</xref>). Overall, our analysis revealed that transient OVAR responses did not differ between control and <italic>Gpr156<sup>del/del</sup></italic> mice, supporting the proposal that absence of GPR156 did not affect canal-related ocular responses. In contrast, steady-state OVAR responses demonstrated a significantly impaired bias in <italic>Gpr156<sup>del/del</sup></italic> mice as compared to controls (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12G-H</xref>). The OVAR of <italic>Gpr156<sup>del/del</sup></italic> mice was characterized by a significantly reduced bias relative to controls (<italic>Gpr156<sup>del/del</sup></italic>: bias=0.039 ± 0.26 versus control: bias=3.85 ± 0.54, P = 4.03E-5). Thus taken together, these results show that the absence of HC reversal in <italic>Gpr156<sup>del/del</sup></italic> alters otolith-mediated OVAR responses. This in turn may explain the swimming deficits observed (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11B</xref>).</p>

<title>Hair bundle orientation vs. zonal identity</title>
<p>Taken together, our observations in utricles lacking GPR156 agree with other evidence that in mouse vestibular epithelia, HC orientation is controlled separately from other zonally differentiated properties of either HCs or afferents. Prior evidence includes data from <italic>Emx2</italic> knockouts also exhibiting loss of the LPR without altering zoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>) and data showing that inactivating cytochrome P450 family 26 deletes striolar identity without affecting HC orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Ono et al., 2020</xref>). This conclusion stands in contrast to zebrafish lateral line results, where transduction properties vary with HC orientation depending on Emx2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kindig et al., 2023</xref>) and Gpr156 (this study).</p>

<title>Asymmetrical mechano-electrical transduction</title>
<p>Zebrafish lateral-line HCs use a combination of 2 mechanosensitive channels, Tmc2a and Tmc2b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Chou et al., 2017</xref>). In the posterior lateral line, Emx2<sup>+</sup> HCs that sense posterior flow rely on primarily on Tmc2b, while Emx2<sup>-</sup> HCs that sense anterior flow rely on both Tmc2a and Tmc2b. Recently, a functional asymmetry was discovered between anterior- and posterior-sensitive HCs: Emx2<sup>+</sup> HCs that rely primarily on Tmc2b have smaller mechanosensitive responses compared to Emx2<sup>-</sup> HCs that rely on both Tmc2a and Tmc2b. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kindig et al., 2023</xref>). This work raises the possibility that the transcription factor Emx2 inhibits <italic>tmc2a</italic> transcription to reduce mechanosensitive responses in HCs sensing posterior flow. In our present study we find that functional asymmetry was also lost in <italic>gpr156</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). In the context of mouse HC orientation, EMX2 is necessary and sufficient to enrich and polarize GPR156 at HC apical junctions and reverse HC orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kindt et al., 2021</xref>). As the Gpr156 receptor is unlikely to act transcriptionally, zebrafish Emx2 may act through Gpr156 to impact Tmc2a/2b function. For example, polarization of Gpr156 at apical junctions may limit scaffolding or transport of Tmc proteins to homomeric channels composed of Tmc2b. Overall, our work in zebrafish indicates that both Emx2 and Gpr156 are important to dictate HC orientation and the mechanosensitive properties of HCs with opposing orientations.</p>
<p>We did not see a clear impact of GPR156 loss on the transduction properties of <italic>Emx2</italic><sup>+</sup> HCs in the mouse utricle (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Subtle effects remain possible, however, given the variance in single-cell electrophysiological data from both control and mutant mice. Nevertheless, current results are consistent with normal HC function in the <italic>Gpr156</italic> mouse mutant, a prerequisite to interrogate how non-reversed HCs affects vestibular behavior.</p>

<sec id="s3c">
<title>Importance of the LPR for vestibular function</title>
<p>The brain combines information from the maculae and cristae with inputs from other modalities, including the somatosensory and visual systems, to compute a representation of our self-motion and spatial orientation (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cullen, 2019</xref>). Our present findings demonstrate that GPR156 is <italic>not</italic> required for macular HCs to selectively contact different afferents across the LPR. Accordingly, we predicted that HCs that fail to reverse in the lateral utricle of <italic>Gpr156</italic> mutants would lead to deficits in paradigms that test macular contributions to behavioral responses. Indeed, <italic>Gpr156</italic> mutant mice demonstrated impaired performance on two tests that engage the otolith organs: swimming and off-vertical-axis rotation (OVAR). First, during swimming, impaired spatial orientation results from the combined altered otolith input and reduced somatosensory feedback due to the aqueous environment. Second, <italic>Gpr156</italic> mutant mice displayed impaired sustained responses to off-vertical axis rotation (OVAR). While initial eye movement response to OVAR is mediated by stimulation of semicircular canal HCs, the canal response decays such that sustained eye movement is solely driven by the otolith stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Beraneck et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Ono et al., 2020</xref>). Quantification of the sustained responses revealed a marked reduction in this otolith-mediated reflex response. Confirming that these deficits are specific to otolith function, the <italic>Gpr156</italic> mutant mice did not show overt vestibular dysfunction such as spinning or head tilt that can arise with global dysfunction of vestibular epithelia. Further, they displayed normal performance during testing that selectively engaged superior canal organs, namely angular VOR in the light and dark. This latter finding was predicted; because HC orientation is unchanged in <italic>Gpr156</italic> mutant cristae, the coding properties of semicircular canal afferents should be unchanged and would therefore produce a normal angular VOR upon specific stimulation of canal ampullae.</p>

<title>Comparing vestibular phenotypes of <italic>Gpr156</italic> and <italic>Emx2</italic> mutants</title>
<p><italic>Gpr156</italic> does not appear to be significantly expressed in the central nervous system according to the Allen Brain Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lein et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, <italic>Advillin-Cre</italic> tracing and dye-filling experiments (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>-<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) showed that vestibular ganglion neurons still selectively innervated LES HCs even when lacking GPR156. We thus speculate that HC signals in the LES zone of <italic>Gpr156</italic> mutants are relayed to the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ji et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Maklad et al., 2010</xref>) via the central projection of <italic>Advillin<sup>+</sup></italic> neurons as usual, but with abnormal (non-reversed) response polarity. Overall, it appears unlikely that vestibular deficits observed in our constitutive <italic>Gpr156</italic> mouse mutants reflect defective neuronal activity in addition to a missing LPR. That said, we cannot entirely rule out another role of GPR156 beside its regulation of HC orientation. This could be addressed in a follow-up study by limiting <italic>Gpr156</italic> inactivation to HCs.</p>
<p>It is interesting to compare vestibular-related behaviors between the <italic>Gpr156</italic> and <italic>Emx2</italic> mouse models in light of established similarities and differences in protein distribution and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ji et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kindt et al., 2021</xref>). Regarding behavior, this study and work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ji et al., 2022</xref> agree that vestibular deficits in each model are relatively mild (normal balance beam, VOR and OKR). <italic>Emx2</italic> inactivation in HCs (<italic>Gfi1-Cre</italic>) showed impaired swimming ability, but defects were less severe and different in nature compared to constitutive <italic>Gpr156</italic> mutants. <italic>Gpr156</italic> mutants displayed substantial difficulty in maintaining their orientation in water, and frequently rolled over such that they needed to be rescued. In contrast, <italic>Emx2</italic> mutants did not need rescue and were described as demonstrating “frantic” swimming behavior, spending more time trying to climb out of the water as compared to their littermate controls. OVAR highlighted otolith-specific defects in <italic>Gpr156</italic> mutants but was not performed in <italic>Emx2</italic> mutants.</p>
<p>GPR156 acts downstream of EMX2 to regulate hair bundle orientation, and perhaps mechanosensitivity in zebrafish. Another significant new result in the current study is to show that afferent projections segregate with HC orientation and not with zonal identity (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>; Advillin neuron labeling), yet segregation does not depend on HC orientation since it is unchanged in mouse and zebrafish <italic>Gpr156</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>-<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). It follows that EMX2 must influence afferent segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ji et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ji et al., 2018</xref>) via other effectors unrelated to HC orientation. Accordingly, Ji and colleagues concluded that EMX2 regulates HC orientation and afferent patterning independently, with <italic>Emx2</italic> expression in support cells critical for proper afferent contacts with HCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ji et al., 2022</xref>). This aligns well with previous evidence that <italic>Gpr156</italic> is only expressed in HCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kindt et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Ji and colleagues also used specific inactivation of the transduction protein TMIE in the LES (<italic>Emx2-Cre</italic>) to silence the <italic>Emx2<sup>+</sup></italic> HC population. Interestingly, as with <italic>Emx2</italic> mutants, they did not observe severe behavioral defects, and swimming ability in particular was not obviously compromised in contrast to <italic>Gpr156</italic> mutants. It should be noted however that while the <italic>Gpr156 KO</italic> and <italic>Emx2-Cre; Tmie cKO</italic> models both lack a normal complement of bidirectional responses, they provide different forms of aberrant linear acceleration signals. In the <italic>Tmie</italic> cKO model, LES HC inputs to the cerebellum are missing but in the <italic>Gpr156</italic> model they are retained and of opposite nature since LES HCs fail to reverse their orientation.</p>
<p>Several considerations could potentially explain why the <italic>Gpr156</italic> model appears to display more severe behavioral defects compared to the <italic>Emx2</italic> models. First, HC or afferent properties were not tested in <italic>Emx2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ji et al., 2022</xref>) and may be defective. Second, compounded HC orientation and afferent defects in the <italic>Emx2</italic> mutants could dampen the deleterious consequence of having LES HCs drive a neuronal response of reversed polarity. Afferent defects in <italic>Emx2</italic> mutants were reported during embryogenesis (E16.5) and innervation could further degenerate in adults, further dampening the consequence of non-reversed HC activity in the LES. It is worth noting that aberrant vestibular afferent signals are clinically more deleterious than absent signals, which perhaps explains why properly relayed yet aberrant signals from LES HCs in <italic>Gpr156</italic> mutants result in behavioral defects worse than observed in <italic>Emx2</italic> or <italic>Emx2-Cre; Tmie cKO</italic> models.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the <italic>Gpr156</italic> mutant mouse model is well-suited to specifically interrogate how HC orientation reversal and the resulting LPR influence vestibular function because it appears to lack confounding afferent patterning defects. In future studies, this model could be improved by limiting <italic>Gpr156</italic> inactivation to HCs.</p>

<p>Temporal bones of adult animals were isolated, oval windows were cleared and the cochlear apex was punctured to allow better access to the fixative. Samples were then fixed in paraformaldehyde (PFA 4%) overnight at 4°C, rinsed in PBS and incubated overnight in 4% Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) at room temperature for decalcification. Both the trio (utricle and crista) and the saccule were dissected from the bone and their epithelium exposed. After dissection, samples were permeabilized and blocked in PBS with 0.5% Triton-X100 and bovine serum albumin (1%) for at least at 1 hour at room temperature. For SPP1/Osteonpontin staining, temporal bones were immediately dissected to isolate the trio and the saccule and expose their epithelium, and an eyelash was used to scrape off the otoconia, Samples were then fixed in PFA 4% for 1h at room temperature before being permeabilized and blocked as described previously. Primary and secondary antibodies were each incubated overnight at 4°C in PBS, and fluorescent dye-conjugated phalloidin was added to secondary antibodies. Samples were washed 3 times in PBS + 0.05% Triton-X100 after each antibody incubation before being finally post fixed in PFA 4% for at least 1 hour at room temperature. Primary antibodies used were:</p>

<p>All images were processed using Adobe Photoshop (CC2020), and the same image treatment was applied across genotypes for each experiment. All quantifications included at least three animals of each genotypes, and all values plotted in the study, as well as animal cohort size (N), HC number and stereocilia number (n) are detailed in legends. To quantify striolar surface, striolar density, as well as HC Type I and II density by region, images were captured using a DM5500B fluorescence microscope using the Leica Application Suite (LASX) and a 20x objective (Leica). Striolar surface was measured using the polygon selection and area tools in Fiji/ImageJ to define the striola based on the Oncomodulin staining. Striolar density was measured by using the cell counter tool in Fiji/ImageJ to obtain the total number of Oconmodulin positive HCs. That number was then normalized by the total striolar surface previously measured to obtain a final number of HCs per 1000µm<sup>2</sup>. To measure Type I and Type II HC density by region, three regions of interest (ROI) were defined centrally of either 130×50µm (utricle) or 150×40µm (saccule). The lateral extrastriolar (LES) domain was placed 20µm inside the macula starting from the lateral edge of the utricle, encompassing most of the region lateral to the line of polarity reversal (LPR). The striolar domain was defined immediately adjacent to the LES domain based on the LPR and oncomodulin signal in controls. The medial extrastriolar (MES) domain started 50µm medial to the striolar domain. The anterior extrastriolar domain (ANT) was placed 10µm from the anterior edge of the saccule. The striolar domain was defined 20µm posterior to the ANT domain based on oncomodulin staining in controls, and the posterior extrastriolar domain (POST) was defined 50µm posterior to the striolar domain. The location of these domains is illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1A</xref>. The same fields and spacing were next used for the <italic>Gpr156<sup>del/del</sup></italic> mutants.

<title>Preparation</title>
<p>Following protocols approved by the University of Chicago Animal Care and Use Committee, mice were deeply anesthetized with gaseous isoflurane and then decapitated to allow dissection of the utricles and attached nerve and ganglion. The preparations were dissected in our <italic>standard bath (external) solution</italic>: cold Leibovitz’s-L15 medium (L15, Gibco, #41300-021) supplemented with 10 mM HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid) (∼315 mmol/kg, pH 7.4). The utricles were then treated with L15 containing proteinase XXIV (100 mg/ml, Sigma, St. Louis, MO #P8038) for 11 min at room temperature to facilitate mechanical removal of the otolithic membrane. The epithelium was mounted on a cover slip with glued glass fibers and placed in a recording chamber on a microscope (Zeiss, Axio Examiner A1) equipped with Nomarski and fluorescence optics.</p>

<title>Recording</title>
<p>For whole-cell recording, pipettes (R6, King Precision Glass) were heat-pulled (PC100, Narishige) and parafilm-wrapped to reduce capacitance. Pipette resistances were 4-5 MΩ for the standard internal and external solutions. Standard internal solution contained (in mM): 135 KCl, 0.1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 3.5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 3 Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, 5 creatine phosphate (Na salt), 0.1 Na-cAMP, 0.1 Li-GTP, 5 EGTA, and 10 HEPES, plus ∼28 mM KOH to bring pH to 7.3 and osmolality to ∼300 mmol/kg. Internal solution was supplemented with sulforhodamine 101 (1 mg/100 ml; Thermo Fisher Scientific) for visualization of recorded hair cells. The bath (external solution) was modified L15 (described above), which was perfused during the experiment.</p>
<p>We were able to locate LES, striola or MES despite loss of the LPR because anatomical features of the striola are maintained in the otolith organs of <italic>Gpr156 <sup>del/del</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kindt et al., 2021</xref>), and some of these (hair bundle size, spacing of HCs, abundance of complex calyces) are visible in live tissue with Nomarski optics. Usually we aimed for HCs or calyces &gt;50 μm away from zonal boundaries to avoid confusion over zone. In one experimental series, however, we focused on the zonal boundary to see whether afferents respected zonal boundaries in Gpr156-deleted mice.</p>
<p>To record in whole-cell mode from a specific HC or afferent calyx, we cleaned the cell membrane by the outflow of pipette solution and applied gentle suction to promote giga-seal formation and membrane rupture. Stimulus protocols and data acquisition were implemented by the patch clamp amplifier (model EPC-10, HEKA Elektronik) controlled by Patchmaster software.

<title>Mechanical stimulation of mouse hair cells</title>
<p>Hair bundles were deflected with a rigid probe (pulled glass pipette, BF120-60-10, Sutter instrument Company) glued to a piezoelectric bimorph ceramic and brought into contact with the staircase of stereocilia (‘back’ of the bundle) at ∼half-height. Displacement of the probe to driving voltage was calibrated with a CCD camera, yielding a scale factor 330-410 nm/V, depending on the probe. Probe motion recorded with a photodiode (PIN-6D, United Detector Technology) revealed a primary resonance at 1900-2000 Hz. To attenuate this ringing, the voltage input to the bimorph was low-pass filtered (8-pole Bessel filter, Model 900, Frequency Devices) set at 1 kHz, for a step rise time (10-90%) of ∼300 μs.</p>
<p>Mechanotransduction current was recorded in voltage-clamp mode with the holding potential (HP) of –94 mV and –84 mV for type I and type II HCs, respectively. The larger negative potential for type I HCs was chosen to reduce g<sub>K,L</sub> and so improve the voltage clamp. Responses to three identical displacement step protocols were averaged and low-pass filtered off line (corner frequency, 2 kHz, 8-pole Bessel filter, as above). Step protocols comprised either 20 or 40 displacement steps iterated by 100 nm or 35 nm, respectively, and beginning slightly negative to the resting bundle position. Transduction sensitivity and adaptation was analyzed in 49 HCs with I<sub>max</sub> &gt; 150 pA (23 HCs from heterozygotes and 26 HCs from null mutants), as described next.</p>

<p>In mouse utricular HCs, the dominant voltage-gated currents are carried by outwardly rectifying K<sub>V</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Martin et al., 2023</xref>). By the end of the first postnatal week, these currents provide distinctive electrophysiological signatures in type I and type II mouse utricular HCs, which include more negatively activating K<sup>+</sup> currents and more negative resting potentials for type I HCs (Rüsch and Eatock, 1996; Rüsch et al., 1998). To characterize the voltage dependence of the currents, we applied families of iterated test voltage steps (400 ms duration) from holding potentials of –74 mV (type I HCs) and –64 mV (type II HCs). The different holding potentials reflect the difference in resting potentials of the two HC types. Steady-state voltage dependence was measured by constructing conductance-voltage [G(V)] relations from tail currents, measured 1 ms after the 400-ms test voltage steps, at a common membrane voltage of –39 mV (chosen to reduce contamination of tail currents by HCN currents). Tail current was converted to “tail conductance” by dividing by driving force (<italic>V<sub>m</sub> – V<sub>rev</sub></italic>), where V<sub>rev</sub> is approximated by the K<sup>+</sup> equilibrium potential (–84 mV in our solutions). Tail conductance was plotted against the iterated test step voltage and fit with the Boltzmann function:

<title>Imaging of afferent terminal arbors in mouse utricle (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>)</title>
<p>To investigate whether afferent receptive fields (terminal arbors) were disrupted by the lack of bundle reversal in the lateral extrastriola (LES), we recorded in whole-cell mode from calyces near the LES-striolar border. To label the terminal arbors for imaging, we included Alexa Fluor 594 (#A10438 Thermo Fisher Scientific) instead of sulforhodamine in the pipette solution (50 micromolar). After whole-cell recording was achieved, we waited 20 min as the fluorescent pipette solution diffused into the calyx and throughout the terminal arbor, then removed the pipette and fixed the utricular epithelium with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature (∼22°). Fixed utricles were immersed in blocking buffer (PBS with 4% normal donkey serum and 0.2% triton) then treated with primary antibodies diluted with blocking buffer overnight at 4°C. Primary antibodies were: mouse monoclonal anti-ýII spectrin (1:500; BD Transduction, #612562), to label hair bundles and show the location of the kinocilium by absence of label; rabbit polyclonal anti-calbindin (1:250; Invitrogen, #711443) to label the striola and juxtastriola (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Leonard and Kevetter, 2002</xref>).

<title>Measurement of excitability from mouse utricular afferents (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>)</title>
<p>To document excitability of afferents in the LES, we recorded from calyces in whole-cell current clamp mode, injected current steps and noted the thresholds for spiking and the firing patterns. Most LES afferents are dimorphic, forming both calyces and boutons on type I and II HCs, respectively. We rejected calyces with resting potentials less negative than −50 mV. We evoked spikes with current steps to determine if afferents had step-evoked firing patterns consistent with expected zonal patterns of spiking regularity in mammalian vestibular epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Goldberg et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Iwasaki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kalluri et al., 2010</xref>). Families of 500-ms current steps were applied from zero-current potential, beginning at −200 pA and incremented by 50 pA. Threshold current (I<sub>thresh</sub>) was taken as the minimum current (±50 pA) required to evoke any spikes.</p>

These patterns have been associated with the mechanisms that give rise to well-known differences in the regularity of firing across zones. The transient step-evoked pattern is associated with striolar, irregular afferents and the sustained step-evoked pattern with extrastriolar, regular afferents. The difference in step-evoked firing patterns is attributed to zonal differences in expression of K<sub>V</sub> channels that influence spike regularity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Iwasaki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kalluri et al., 2010</xref>) and, more importantly, encoding strategy of afferent fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jamali et al., 2019</xref>).</p>

<p>We tested the angular vestibulo-ocular reflex (aVOR), the optokinetic reflex (OKR), and the otolith vestibulo-ocular reflex (off-vertical axis rotation, OVAR). Specifically, aVOR tests semicircular canal function, whereas OVAR tests otolith function. For completeness we also tested each animal’s OKR as a control of the integrity of visuo-motor function.</p>

<title>aVOR and OKR</title>
<p>Surgical techniques and experimental setup have been previously described (Beraneck and Cullen, 2007). Eye movement data were collected using an infrared video system (ETL-200, ISCAN system). The rotational velocity of the turntable (head velocity) was measured using a MEMS sensor (MPU-9250, SparkFun Electronics). Eye movements during the OKR were evoked by sinusoidal rotations of a visual surround (vertical black and white stripes, visual angle width of 5°) placed around the turntable at frequencies 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1, 2, and 3 Hz with peak velocities of ±16°/s. To record VOR responses, the turntable was rotated at sinusoidal frequencies 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1, 2, and 3 Hz with peak velocities of ±16°/s in both light and dark. In the light condition, the visual surround remained stationary, whereas, in the dark condition, both the visual surround and turntable rotated in phase and the surroundings was made dark. Head and eye movement signals were low-passed filtered at 125 Hz and sampled at 1 kHz. Eye position data were differentiated to obtain velocity traces. Cycles of data with quick phases were excluded from the analysis. Least-square optimization determined the VOR and OKR gains, and phases plotted as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) against all frequencies for all mice.</p>

Eye movements were measured using the same Infrared video system (ETL-200, ISCAN system) used for angular VOR and OKR recordings. Quick phases were identified as previously described and excluded from subsequent analysis. We then estimated the time constant of the OVAR slow-phase eye velocity response decay, as well as the amplitude and phase of its sinusoidal modulation using a linear regression approach.</p>

<p>GCaMP6s-based calcium imaging in zebrafish hair bundles has been previously described (Lukasz and Kindt, 2018). Briefly, individual 5-6 dpf larvae were first anesthetized with tricaine (0.03% Ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate salt, SigmaAldrich). To restrain larvae, they were then pinned to a Sylgard-filled recording chamber. To suppress the movement, alpha-bungarotoxin (125 μM, Tocris) was injected into the heart. Larvae were then rinsed and immersed in extracellular imaging solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 2 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 10 HEPES, pH 7.3, OSM 310 +/- 10) without tricaine. A fluid jet was used to mechanically stimulate the apical bundles of HCs of the A-P neuromasts of the primary posterior lateral-line. To stimulate the two orientations of HCs (A&gt;P and P&gt;A) a 500 ms ‘push’ was delivered. Larvae were rotated 180° to deliver a comparable ‘push’ stimulus to both the A&gt;P and P&gt;A HCs.</p>
<p>To image calcium-dependent mechanosensitive responses in apical hair bundles, a Bruker Swept-field confocal system was used. The Bruker Swept-field confocal system was equipped with a Rolera EM-C2 CCD camera (QImaging) and a Nikon CFI Fluor 60✕ 1.0 NA water immersion objective. Images were acquired in 5 planes along the Z-axis at 0.5 μm intervals (hair bundles) at a 50 Hz frame rate (10 Hz volume rate). The 5 plane Z-stacks were projected into one plane for image processing and quantification. The method to create spatial ΔF heatmaps has been described (Lukasz and Kindt, 2018). For GCaMP6s measurements, a circular ROI with a ∼1.5 μm (hair bundles) diameter was placed on the center of each individual bundle. The mean intensity (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>) within each ROI was quantified. F<sub>0</sub> represents the GCaMP6s intensity prior to stimulation. We examined the GCaMP6s signal in each hair bundle to determine its orientation.

This plasmid was pressure at a concentration of 30 ng/µl. At 3 dpf larvae were anesthetized with 0.03% ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate (Tricaine), to screen for tdTomato expression. Larvae were screened for mosaic expression of tdTomato expression in the lateral-line afferents using a Zeiss SteREO Discovery V20 microscope (Carl Zeiss) with an X-Cite 120 external fluorescent light source (EXFO Photonic Solutions Inc). After selecting larvae with tdTomato expression, larvae were prepared for immunostaining at 5 dpf, and imaged as outlined above.</p>

<title>Zebrafish data analysis and statistics</title>
<p>Statistical analyses and data plots were performed with Prism 9 (Graphpad, San Diego, CA). Values of data with error bars on graphs and in text are expressed as mean ± SEM unless indicated otherwise. All experiments were performed on a minimum of 3 animals, 6 neuromasts (primary posterior lateral-line neuromasts with A-P orientations: L1-L5). For 5-6 dpf larvae, each neuromast represents analysis from 12 to 20 HCs and 41–68 synapses. All replicates are biological. No animals or samples were excluded from our analyses unless control experiments failed–in these cases all samples were excluded. No randomization or blinding was used for our animal studies. Where appropriate, data was confirmed for normality using a D’Agostino-Pearson normality test. Statistical significance between conditions was determined by an unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study provides <bold>convincing</bold> evidence that mutant hair cells with abnormal, reversed polarity of their hair bundles in mouse otolith organs retain wild-type localization, mechanoelectrical transduction and firing properties of their afferent innervation, leading to mild behavioral dysfunction. It thus demonstrates that the bimodal pattern of afferent nerve projections in this organ is not causally related to the bimodal distribution of hair-bundle orientations, as also confirmed in the zebrafish lateral line. The work will be of interest to scientists interested in the development and function of the vestibular system as well as in planar-cell polarity.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors aim at dissecting the relationship between hair-cell directional mechanosensation and orientation-linked synaptic selectivity, using mice and the zebrafish. They find that Gpr156 mutant animals homogenize the orientation of hair cells without affecting the selectivity of afferent neurons, suggesting that hair-cell orientation is not the feature that determines synaptic selectivity. Therefore, the process of Emx2-dependent synaptic selectivity bifurcates downstream of Gpr156.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is an interesting and solid paper. It solves an interesting problem and establishes a framework for the following studies. That is, to ask what are the putative targets of Emx2 that affect synaptic selectivity.</p>
<p>
The quality of the data is generally excellent.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The feeling is that the advance derived from the results is very limited.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>I am happy with the authors' reply and do not wish to modify my initial assessment.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors inquire in particular whether the receptor Gpr156, which is necessary for hair cells to reverse their polarities in the zebrafish lateral line and mammalian otolith organs downstream of the differential expression of the transcription factor Emx2, also controls the mechanosensitive properties of hair cells and ultimately an animal's behavior. This study thoroughly addresses the issue by analyzing the morphology, electrophysiological responses, and afferent connections of hair cells found in different regions of the mammalian utricle and the Ca2+ responses of lateral line neuromasts in both wild-type animals and gpr156 mutants. Although many features of hair cell function are preserved in the mutants-such as development of the mechanosensory organs and the Emx2-dependent, polarity-specific afferent wiring and synaptic pairing-there are a few key changes. In the zebrafish neuromast, the magnitude of responses of all hair cells to water flow resembles that of the wild-type hair cells that respond to flow arriving from the tail. These responses are larger than those observed in hair cells that are sensitive to flow arriving from the head and resemble effects previously observed in Emx2 mutants. The authors note that this behavior suggests that the Emx2-GPR156 signaling axis also impinges on hair cell mechanotransduction. Although mutant mice exhibit normal posture and balance, they display defects in swimming behavior. Moreover, their vestibulo-ocular reflexes are perturbed. The authors note that the gpr156 mutant is a good model to study the role of opposing hair cell polarity in the vestibular system, for the wiring patterns follow the expression patterns of Emx2, even though hair cells are all of the same polarity. This paper excels at describing the effects of gpr156 perturbation in mouse and zebrafish models and will be of interest to those studying the vestibular system, hair cell polarity, and the role of inner-ear organs in animal behavior.</p>
<p>The study is exceptional in including, not only morphological and immunohistochemical indices of cellular identity but also electrophysiological properties. The mutant hair cells of murine maculæ display essentially normal mechanoelectrical transduction and adaptation-with two or even three kinetic components-as well as normal voltage-activated ionic currents.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p>- The authors should think about revising the terminology used to describe electrophysiological data in zebrafish (Fig.5): &quot;posterior&quot; hair cells in a neuromast are sensitive to posterior-to-anterior flow, which is currently termed &quot;anterior&quot;. This is confusing because when &quot;posterior&quot; or &quot;anterior&quot; is used, for instance in the labels of the figure, one may get confused about whether this applies to hair-cell position or directionality of the stimulus. It would help to always use clearer terminology for the stimulus (e.g. posterior-to-anterior (P-to-A) as in Kindig 2023, or &quot;from the tail&quot;). Also, the authors may want to clarify what we should see in Fig.5 demonstrating that posterior hair cells, with reversed hair-bundle polarity, actually evince transduction of similar magnitude as anterior hair cells, with normal polarity of their hair bundles.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This nomenclature can indeed be confusing. Per the reviewers request we have changed the terminology to always refer to the direction of flow sensed by the hair cells. For example, HCs that respond to posterior-directed flow or anterior-directed flow. We now denote these HCs as (A to P) and (P to A), respectively in the Figure for clarity. We have modified Figure 5, the Figure 5 legend and Results (starting line 339) to reflect these changes.</p>
<p>In addition, in our results we now provide more context when comparing the response magnitude of the anterior-sensing hair cells in gpr156 mutants to the response magnitude of the two diVerent orientations of hair cells in controls.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Also, does it make sense that there is no defect in MET for mouse otolith organs with deleted GPR156, whereas there is a diVerence in the zebrafish lateral line? It would help motivate the study on mechanoelectrical transduction (see comment of Reviewer 1 below).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We previously discussed this point and recognized that subtle eVects remain possible in mouse (previously Discussion line 614). We have now  modified the text in the Discussion to better emphasize this point (new line 627). The Eatock lab is currently working on developing calcium imaging in the mouse utricle to revisit this question in a future study. &quot;Subtle e)ects remain possible, however, given the variance in single-cell electrophysiological data from both control and mutant mice.  Nevertheless, current results are consistent with normal HC function in the Gpr156 mouse mutant, a prerequisite to interrogate how non-reversed HCs a)ects vestibular behavior.&quot;</p>
<p>To help motivate transduction studies starting in the second Result paragraph, we added a transition at Line 205 that was indeed lacking:</p>
<p>&quot;Gpr156 inactivation could be a powerful model to specifically ask how HC reversal contributes to vestibular function. However, GPR156 may have other confounding roles in HCs besides regulating their orientation, similar to EMX2, which impacts mechanotransduction in zebrafish HCs (Kindig et al., 2023) and a)erent innervation  in mouse and zebrafish HCs (Ji et al., 2022; Ji et al., 2018).&quot;</p>
<p>(1) One overarching objective of this study was to use the Gpr156 KO model to discover how polarity reversal informs vestibular function (Introduction, overall summary in the last paragraph) . Pairing behavioral defects with hair cell orientation is only possible if hair cell transduction is normal, which had to be tested.</p>
<p>(2) The notion that experiments that produced negative results are unecessary and are not properly motivated can only apply in retrospect. At early stages we performed electrophysiology because we did not know whether transduction would be normal in absence of GPR156. We also did not know whether innervation would be normal. The fact that both appear normal makes Gpr156 KO a better model to address the importance of orientation reversal (conclusion of the Discussion line 705).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Fig1, panel B appears to show diVerent focal planes for Gpr156del/+ and Gpr156del/del.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figure 1B had control and mutant panels at slightly diVerent focal planes indeed. We swapped the right (mutant) panel image and adjusted intensities in the control image to match adjustments of the new mutant image.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Given that this work is largely about polarity and connectivity to neurons, I do not understand the need to assess mechanosensitivity in Gpr156 mutants. Please explain in the text, as follows: &quot;After establishing normal numbers and types of mouse vestibular HCs, we assessed whether HCs respond normally to hair bundle deflections in the absence of GPR156.&quot; We did this because...</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please see reply above in 'Recommendations for the authors' for comment about the need to assess mechanosensitivity. We agree that this transition was lacking, and we added an explanation as recommended:</p>
<p>&quot;Gpr156 inactivation could be a powerful model to specifically ask how HC reversal contributes to vestibular function. However, GPR156 may have other confounding roles in HCs besides regulating their orientation, similar to EMX2, which impacts mechanotransduction in zebrafish HCs (Kindig et al., 2023) and a)erent innervation  in mouse and zebrafish HCs (Ji et al., 2022; Ji et al., 2018).&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Anyway, the data in Figures 2, 3 and 4 seems somewhat superfluous to the main message of the paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please see reply above in 'Recommendations for the authors'. This data may appear superfluous in retrospect but we could not claim that behavioral changes in Gpr156 mutants reflect the role of the line of polarity reversal if, for example, hair cell transduction was abnormal. We had to perform experiments to figure this out. We were further motivated as data began to emerge from the zebrafish lateral line that showed eVects on HC transduction. Although we did not get positive results on this question in the mouse, we think the diVerence between models should be included as a significant part of the narrative.</p>
