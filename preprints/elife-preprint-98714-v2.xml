<title>Abstract</title><p>Gout is a prevalent form of inflammatory arthritis that occurs due to high levels of uric acid in the blood leading to the formation of urate crystals in and around the joints, particularly affecting the elderly. Recent research has provided evidence of distinct differences in the gut microbiota of patients with gout and hyperuricemia when compared to healthy individuals. However, the link between gut microbiota and age-related gout remained underexplored. Our study found that gut microbiota plays a crucial role in determining susceptibility to age-related gout. Specifically, we observed that age-related gut microbiota regulated the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway and modulated uric acid metabolism. More scrutiny highlighted the positive impact of “younger” microbiota on the gut microbiota structure of old or aged mice, enhancing butanoate metabolism and butyric acid content. Experimentation with butyrate supplementation indicated that butyric acid exerts a dual effect, inhibiting inflammation in acute gout and reducing serum uric acid levels. These insights emphasize the potential of gut microbiome rejuvenation in mitigating senile gout, unraveling the intricate dynamics between microbiota, aging, and gout. It potentially serves as a therapeutic target for senile gout-related conditions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Gout, the most common inflammatory arthritis in elderly individuals, results from the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in articular and nonarticular structures(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>), particularly among individuals aged 75-84 years, and the occurrence rate in this population can reach 4%(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). The development of gout is primarily attributed to the significant risk posed by a high serum urate concentration(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Pathological hyperuricemia is defined by a serum urate concentration exceeding 408 μmol/L [6.8 mg/dL], which forms monosodium urate crystals in vitro at physiological pH and temperature(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). The reason why the elderly population commonly experiences gout is complicated by the fact that the population is also ageing, and the treatment of this disease is often intricate due to the presence of comorbidities and medications prescribed for concurrent conditions(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Although the basic principles for the prevention and treatment for gout remain the same across different age groups, elderly individuals often exhibit lower tolerance for medication dosages, types, side effects, and surgical procedures due to their physiological factors. Moreover, despite the increasing severity of gout among elderly individuals, research on this issue remains scarce.</p>
<p>The gut microbiota plays essential roles in regulating energy and metabolism, as revealed by recent studies(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>), which have shown that individuals with hyperuricemia and gout exhibit dysbiosis of the gut microbiota(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Moreover, because the gut microbiota can directly participate in the metabolism of purines and uric acid(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>), it may play a crucial role in gout and hyperuricemia development. Although numerous studies have examined the relationship between the microbiome and early life stages, the impact of the microbiome’s on ageing and frailty in later life needs to be explored. Furthermore, studies have shown that the structure of the gut microbiota undergoes a gradual “ageing” process with advancing age, and this process is characterized by a decrease in the microbial diversity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). In addition, transplantation of a young microbiota can improve central nervous system inflammation and retinal inflammation in aged mice(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>), and counteract age-related behavioral deficits(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). We hypothesize that the high prevalence of gout in the elderly population may be closely related to its “ageing” gut microbiota. The association between the “ageing” gut microbiota and gout in elderly individuals has not been reported. Hence, we conducted a study to elucidate the influence of the ageing gut microbiota on the occurrence and progression of gout in elderly individuals.</p>
<p>In this study, we first tested the sensitivity to monosodium urate (MSU) in different age groups and conducted a microbiota clearance (Abx) on mice of different age groups to assess their sensitivity to MSU again. At the same time, we also tested their serum uric acid levels. We found that sensitivity to MSU increased with age, but changed after clearing the gut microbiota in terms of sensitivity to MSU and serum uric acid levels. Then we performed cross-age fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and subsequently stimulated the mice with MSU with the aim of how mice belonging to different age groups exhibit sensitivity to MSU after undergoing FMT. Because hyperuricemia is a necessary physiological factor for gout, we also evaluated the expression levels of uric acid-producing enzymes and uric acid transport proteins in the mice. Surprisingly, transplantation of the gut microbiota from aged mice into young mice, significantly increased their sensitivity to MSU. Conversely, the transplantation of the gut microbiota from young mice into aged mice, significantly decreased their sensitivity to MSU. These findings suggest that the gut microbiota of older individuals plays a promoting role in the occurrence and progression of gout. Moreover, an analysis of the serum uric acid levels of the mice after cross-age FMT yielded similar results. To investigate the underlying mechanisms of how gut microbiota influences gout and hyperuricemia, we performed 16S rDNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics analysis of fecal samples. We then, observed a significant increase in the abundance of <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> and <italic>Akkermansia</italic> in the gut microbiota of young mice and old or aged mice after transplantation of the gut microbiota from young mice. To further investigate the potential biological pathways affected by the gut microbiota, we performed functional metagenomic analysis using Tax4FUN software and found that butanoate metabolism was more robust in young mice than in aged mice. Furthermore, we also observed that transplantation of the gut microbiota from young mice to aged mice enhanced the butanoate metabolism of the recipient mice. Due to the limitations of untargeted metabolomics, we did not observe any differences in the levels of butyric acid among the different groups. However, the pathway data obtained by fecal untargeted metabolomics also yielded similar results. Based on the above-described results, we hypothesize that butyrate may play a significant role in these processes. Excitingly, the results from a short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) analysis support our hypothesis. Furthermore, a supplementation experiment using butyrate revealed, that the results aligned well with the cross-age FMT findings, which suggests that transplantation of the gut microbiota from young mice into aged mice can effectively prevent gout and hyperuricemia, and that butyrate is likely the critical factor playing a crucial role. Our research findings demonstrate the potential of young gut microbiota in preventing gout in elderly individuals and provide new insights and perspectives for the prevention and treatment of gout in elderly individuals.</p>

<title>Gout susceptibility increases with age, related to gut microbiota</title>
<p>In this study, we used the male C57BL/6 mice belonging to three age groups: young (∼3 months), old (∼18 months) and aged (∼24-months) mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). To investigate the impact of age on gout, we used a mouse model in which subcutaneous injections of MSU crystals were administered to the dorsal aspect of the hind paws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). The result showed that the old group exhibited a significant increase in footpad swelling compared with the young group, and the levels of IL-1β was significantly elevated in the Old and Aged groups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b, c</xref>). A prominent correlation was found between the occurrence of gout and the concentration of serum uric acid, which exhibits an upwards trend with advancing age(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Thus, we also measured the serum uric acid level, we found uric acid levels significantly increase with age (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). There are reports indicating a close relationship between gut microbiota and gout(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Therefore, we simultaneously tested the gut microbiota of mice at different ages. The results showed that as age increases, the ASVs (Amplicon Sequence Variants) showed a declining trend (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). Moreover, the principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) results revealed distinctive differences in the phylogenetic community structures between these groups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>). Then we carried out antibiotics (ABX) cocktail on mice of different age groups, found changes in the footpad swelling, IL-1β and discovered no differences in the level of serum uric acid (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g-i</xref>). These data highlight indicates that aging-associated changes in the gut microbiota exacerbate gout attacks.</p>

<title>Aged-to-young FMT worsens acute gout, whereas young-to-aged FMT reduced this disease</title>
<p>Based on the above results, we conducted fecal microbiota exchanges between male C57BL/6 mice also belonging to three age groups: young (∼3 months), old (∼18 months), and aged (∼24-months) mice. The experimental design and timeline are presented in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>. To investigate the impact of cross-age FMT on gout, we used a gout mouse model as aforementioned. The results of <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">supplementary figure 1a</xref> showed that young mice transplanted with fecal microbiota from mice in the old or aged group (Young+Old or Young+Aged) exhibited a significant increase in footpad swelling compared with the control group (Young+PBS). However, no significant difference in footpad swelling was found between old or aged mice transplanted with fecal microbiota from mice in the young groups (Old+Young and Aged+Young) and the control groups (Old+PBS and Aged+PBS) (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">supplementary figure 1a</xref>). Subsequently, we conducted a comparative analysis of haematoxylin &amp; eosin (H&amp;E)-stained tissue sections (scar, 1000μm), derived from mice with cross-age FMT and MSU-induced acute gout. We found that the Young+Old and Young+Aged group showed more inflammatory cell infiltration in the subcutaneous soft tissues than the Young+PBS group, whereas the Old+Young and Aged+Young groups showed less inflammatory cell infiltration (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). The inflammatory factors in the foot tissue of the mice with cross-age FMT were then examined. The levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα were significantly elevated in the Young+Aged group and significantly lower in the Aged+Young group compared with the Aged+PBS group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c-e</xref>). Meanwhile, to investigate the impact of cross-age FMT on MSU-induced inflammation, we utilized an animal model of C57BL/6 mice administered an intraperitoneal injection of 2.5 mg of MSU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Six hours after MSU intraperitoneal injection, we washed the mouse peritoneal cavity with sterile PBS and collected the peritoneal fluid and peritoneal cells separately. Simultaneously, we also examined the levels of inflammatory cytokines in mouse serum. Consistent with the acute gout model, the Young+Old or Young+Aged group exhibited more pronounced activation of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in peritoneal fluid (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f-h</xref>) and serum (Supplementary figure 1b-c). Although no differences in the IL-6 levels of serum and peritoneal fluid was found between the Old+PBS and Old+Young groups or between the Aged+Young and Aged+PBS groups (Supplementary figure 1c and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref>), a significant reduction in IL-1β and TNF-α was observed (Supplementary figure 1b, d and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f, h</xref>). These findings suggest that the increased susceptibility to gout in the elderly may closely related to “aging” gut microbiota.</p>

<p>“Younger” gut microbiota suppresses NLRP3 inflammasome pathway, “aging” gut microbiota promotes</p>
<p>The pathogenesis of acute gout has been primarily linked to the activation of proinflammatory pathways, notably NLRP3, and this activation instigates a surge in the production of the inflammatory cytokines, which further underscores their pivotal roles in the progression of the disease’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). We primarily examined proteins of foot tissue and peritoneal cells associated with the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. Interestingly, we discovered that the Young+Aged group demonstrated more pronounced activation of NLRP3, Pro-Caspase-1, Caspase-1, and IL-1β compared with the control group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a-b</xref>). However, the Old+Young and Aged+Young groups showed lower protein levels of Caspase-1 and IL-1β compared with the control group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c-f</xref>), which suggests that the gut microbiota of elderly mice may make them more sensitive to MSU stimulation, whereas the gut microbiota of young mice can effectively resist the MSU stimulation, and inhibit Caspase-1 cleavage, and IL-1β secretion. Meanwhile, the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway also was investigated in peritoneal cells, and similar results were obtained in the gout model. The fecal microbiota from mice in the old or aged group exacerbated the activation of Pro-Caspase -1, Caspase-1, Pro-IL-1β, and IL-1β in peritoneal cells, increasing the production of IL-1β (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">supplementary figure 2a-b</xref>). In contrast, the fecal microbiota from mice in the young group inhibited the cleavage of Caspase-1 and the secretion of IL-1β (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">supplementary figure 2c-f</xref>).</p>

<title>Beneficial effects of FMT from young to aged mice on uric acid metabolism</title>
<p>Serum samples were collected from the the different groups, and their serum uric acid levels were initially assessed. Surprisingly, we observed an elevation in the average serum uric acid levels in the Young+Old or Young+Aged group, whereas the Old+Young or Aged+Young group exhibited decreases in the serum uric acid levels compared with the same-age control group (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Our study, showed that compared with those of the same-age control group, the serum levels of AST and ALT were elevated in the Young+Old and Young+Aged groups, although the differences were not significant, whereas the Aged+Young groups exhibited modest decreases in these levels (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">supplementary figure 3a-b</xref>). Furthermore, similar trends were found for indicators (Crea and BUN) of renal function (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">supplementary figure 3c-d</xref>). Hyperuricemia is attributed to increased uric acid synthesis and decreased uric acid excretion in the body. We first measured the activity of enzymes involved in uric acid synthesis, namely adenosine deaminase (ADA), guanine deaminase (GDA), and xanthine dehydrogenase (XOD), in the liver and that of (XOD) in the kidney. The activity of ADA, GDA, and XOD in the liver, and the activity of XOD in the kidney of the Young+Old and Young+Aged groups did not significantly differ from those of the same-age control groups (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b-e</xref>). The fecal microbiota from mice in the young group induced a notable decrease in the activity of enzymes related to uric acid synthesis, and the most prominent reductions were found for ADA and XOD activity in the liver and XOD activity in the kidney (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b, d</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">e</xref>). We then examined the mRNA levels of relevant proteins involved in uric acid transport. We initially measured the renal injury marker KIM-1, and observed that the fecal microbiota from mice in the young group contributed to attenuating the mRNA expression levels of this marker compared with the same-age control group (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>). The urate transporter URAT1, which is responsible for uric acid reabsorption, exhibited a similar trend (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g</xref>). However, cross-age FMT did not significantly impact the mRNA expression of another uric acid reabsorption protein, GLUT9 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4h</xref>). The Young+Aged group showed lower mRNA expression levels of the uric acid excretion proteins OAT1 and OAT3 compared with the Young+PBS group (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4i-j</xref>). Although the mRNA expression levels of OAT1 and OAT3 did not show significant differences, a significant increasing trend was found for the other uric acid excretion protein, ABCG2, in aged mice transplanted with fecal microbiota from mice in the young group exhibited a significant increasing trend (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4k</xref>). Because ABCG2 is also expressed in the intestine, we examined its mRNA expression levels in the colon and found that the fecal microbiota from mice in the aged group could inhibit its expression (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">supplementary figure 3e</xref>). Similar trends were found for the mRNA expression levels of mice in ZO-1 and JAMA in the colon of the Young+Aged group (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">supplementary figure 3g-h</xref>). No significant alterations in the colonic Occludin mRNA expression levels were observed among all the groups (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">supplementary figure 3f</xref>). However, the mRNA expression levels of JAMA in the Old+Young and Aged+Young groups were significantly different from those in the same-age control groups (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">supplementary figure 3h</xref>). These results suggests that the fecal microbiota from mice in the old or aged group leads to insufficient uric acid excretion, whereas the fecal microbiota from mice in the young group promotes uric acid elimination, inhibits reabsorption, and may contribute to the integrity of the intestinal barrier structure and the maintenance of normal physiological function.</p>

<title>Modifications in the gut microbiota composition following cross-age FMT</title>
<p>To characterize the age-related alterations in the gut microbiota and assess changes following transplantation, we conducted 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing of all the mice at the endpoint. We focused on investigating the gut microbiota of mice after cross-age FMT. We detected the relative abundance of the top 10 phylum levels in each group (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>) and found no significant differences in the abundance of <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> and <italic>Firmicutes</italic> in the transplanted groups compared with that of their respective control groups (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">supplementary figure 4a-b</xref>). No significant differences were found in the the ratio of <italic>Firmicutes</italic> to <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">supplementary figure 4c</xref>). The species richness, evenness, and rarity are fundamental components of biodiversity and are commonly quantified using indices such as Chao1, observed otus, Shannon, and Simpson indices. Although no significant differences in the Simpson index were found among these groups (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">supplementary figure 4e</xref>), and the indices of the Old+Young and Aged+Young groups were not significantly different from those of the Old+PBS and Aged+PBS groups, respectively, the Chao 1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>), observed_otus (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>), and Shannon (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">supplementary figure 4d</xref>) indices of the Young+Aged group were significantly lower than those of the Young+PBS group. These findings are in line with other studies(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), indicating declines in the richness and diversity of the gut microbiota during aging. Moreover, the principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) results revealed distinctive differences in the phylogenetic community structures between these groups. We showed that the Young+Old and Young+Aged groups tended to be closer to the Old+PBS and Aged+PBS groups, and the Old+Young and Aged+Young groups tended to be closer to the Young+PBS group (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>). We then compared the abundance of the top 15 genus level among all the groups (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">supplementary figure 4f</xref>). A Metastats analysis, found that the abundance of <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> significantly differed between the Young+PBS group and the Young+Old and Young+Aged groups, and that the abundance of <italic>Lachnoclostridium</italic> showed an increasing trend in the Old+Young and Aged+Young groups (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>). The ternary plot showed that <italic>Akkermansia</italic> appears to be the dominant species in the Young+PBS, Old+Young and Aged+Young group (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>). According to previous reports(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) on <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> and <italic>Akkermansia</italic>, we hypothesize that these genera or their metabolites may play a key role in resistance to gout and hyperuricemia. Based on recent research findings(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>) and a KEGG analysis of bacterial community functions, we discovered that butanoate metabolism was more robust in the Young+PBS group than in the Old+PBS and Aged+PBS groups (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2a-b</xref>). However, no similar phenomenon was observed in the Young+Old and Young+Aged groups compared with the Young+PBS group (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2c-d</xref>). More interestingly, the Old+Young and Aged+Young groups showed stronger butanoate metabolism than the Old+PBS and Aged+PBS groups, respectively (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2e-f</xref>). Considering the results from the analysis modifications in the gut microbiota composition after cross-age FMT, both <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> and <italic>Akkermansia</italic> metabolites include SCFAs. These findings indicate that butyric acid derived from the young microbiome may be the critical element responsible for controlling gout. Numerous studies have reported the beneficial effects of butyric acid, but further research on the relationship between butyric acid and gout is needed.</p>

<title>Changes in fecal microbiota metabolism and pathways after cross-age FMT</title>
<p>We also performed an untargeted metabolomics analysis of samples collected after cross-age FMT to investigate the research question. Chemical classification of the metabolites identified in this study was performed, and a pie chart was generated to reflect the distribution and numbers of metabolites in each category. The pie chart for Class I metabolite classification and KEGG pathway annotation is shown in <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">supplementary figure 5a</xref>. Among the 42 samples analysed in this study, a total of 1009 metabolites were identified in the positive ion mode, and 522 metabolites were identified in the negative ion mode among the 42 samples analyzed in this project. The volcano plot provides an overview of the distribution of differentially expressed metabolites (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">supplementary figure 5b</xref>). We also used the KEGG database for metabolic analysis and network research of the identified biological entities. The enrichment results are based on KEGG pathway units, and hypergeometric testing was performed to identify pathways enriched in differentially abundant metabolites compared with all specified metabolite backgrounds. Through pathway enrichment, we discerned and elucidated the principal biochemical metabolic pathways and signal transduction pathways in which the differentialy abundant metabolites actively participate. The metabolites showing differential abundance between the Young+PBS and Old+PBS groups were enriched in the secondary bile acid biosynthesis pathway (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">supplementary figure 6a</xref>). Interestingly, the metabolites showing differential abundance between the Young+PBS and Aged+PBS groups were also enriched in the butanoate metabolism pathway (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">supplementary figure 6b</xref>). The same phenomenon was found from the comparisons of the Young+PBS and Young+Old groups, Young+PBS and Young+Aged groups, Old+PBS and Old+Young groups, and Aged+Young and Aged+PBS groups: the metabolites identified as showing differential abundance between the groups metabolites were enriched in the butanoate metabolism pathway (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a-d</xref>). Furthermore, we found that the metabolites showing differential abundance between the Old+PBS and Old+Young groups and between the Aged+Young and Aged+PBS groups were enriched in the secondary bile acid biosynthesis pathway (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c-d</xref>). Due to the limitations of untargeted metabolomics, we did not observe any differences in butyric acid. However, the results were consistent with the predicted functional capabilities of microbial communities and corresponded to butanoate metabolism. Based on the abovementioned results, butyrate may play an important role.</p>

<title>Butyrate supplementation inhibits gout and MSU-induced peritonitis</title>
<p>Based on the predictions of the functional capabilities of microbial communities and untargeted metabolomics results, we hypothesized that butyrate might play a key role. Because butyric acid is a short-chain fatty acid, we measured the levels of SCFAs (nk/g) in the Young+PBS, Aged+PBS, and Aged+Young groups. Subsequently, we observed that the butyric acid content in the faeces of Young+PBS group was significantly higher than that in the Aged+PBS group. Simultaneously, the butyric acid content in the faeces of mice in the Aged+Young was also significantly higher than that in the Aged+PBS (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>). 2-Methylvalerate and 3-Methylvalerate were not detected, and 4-Methylvaleric was detected in only a subset of samples, thus, these results are not presented. The difference analysis of the detected short chain fatty acids is shown in <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">supplementary figure 7a-h</xref>. Therefore, mice were supplemented with butyrate for 14 days and then subjected to intraperitoneal injections of MSU into the dorsal aspect of the hind paws to observe its anti-inflammatory effects in acute gout. The experimental results showed that butyrate exerted significant anti-inflammatory effects in the acute gout model with inflammation induced by intraperitoneal injection of MSU. Mice with gout model, supplemented with butyrate showed significant reductions in the foot thickness ratio (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>) and the levels of inflammatory factors (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) in their foot tissue (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c-e</xref>). Pathological sections revealed that the foot tissue of mice supplemented with butyrate exhibited less inflammatory cell infiltration than that of the control group (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7f</xref>). Moreover, after supplementation with butyrate, mice that received an intraperitoneal injection of MSU showed significant decreases in the levels of inflammatory factors (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) in both serum (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">supplementary figure 7i-k</xref>) and peritoneal fluid (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7g-i</xref>) compared with those in the control group. Subsequently, we also analyzed the expression of proteins associated with the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. Although no significant change in the expression of NLRP3 after supplementation with butyrate was observed in both the gout and peritonitis models, supplementation with butyrate effectively suppressed the production of Caspase-1 and IL-1β (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7j</xref> and <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">supplementary figure 7l</xref>). The anti-inflammatory effects of butyrate have been widely reported, but limited studies have investigated its specific on gout. Here we demonstrate that butyrate effectively inhibits inflammation induced by MSU stimulation.</p>

<title>Serum uric acid-lowering effect of butyrate in old or aged mice</title>
<p>This has been proved in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1d</xref>, that the serum uric acid levels in mice of different age groups exhibited increase in their serum uric acid levels with increase age. There is scarce research on the impact of butyrate on serum uric acid levels, and the effects of butyrate on hepatic uric acid production or renal uric acid excretion have not been investigated. Additionally, the impact of butyrate on the serum uric acid levels in aged mice remains unexplored. Aged mice were supplemented with butyrate for 14 days, and we found that butyrate supplementation significantly reduced the serum uric acid levels in 18-month-old and 24-month-old mice (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8a</xref>). In this regard, we also assessed the activity of enzymes implicated in uric acid synthesis, namely, ADA, GDA, and XOD in the liver, as well as that of XOD in the kidney. In addition to identifying that butyrate can reduce the activity of ADA in 24-month-old mice (Aged) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8b</xref>), and supplementation with butyrate did not have significant effects on the activities of enzymes involved in uric acid production in both 18-month-old and 24-month-old mice (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8c-e</xref>). Butyrate may not necessarily lower the serum uric acid levels by inhibiting uric acid production. Because butyrate might exert its influence on serum uric acid levels by affecting uric acid transport, we subsequently examined the expression of relevant transporter mRNA in mouse kidneys and the expression of the colonic ABCG2 transporter that facilitates uric acid excretion. The expression of the renal injury marker KIM-1 was significantly decreased in mice supplemented with butyrate (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8f</xref>). In contrast to the results obtained cross-age FMT, no significant difference in the expression of URAT1 was observed (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8g</xref>). However, the expression of GLUT9 was significantly decreased in 24-month-old mice after butyrate supplementation, whereas no significant difference was observed in the 18-month-old mice (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8h</xref>). We also found that the supplementation of old or aged mice with butyrate resulted in an increased mRNA expression level of uric acid transporters involved in uric acid excretion and significantly increased the expression of OAT1 and OAT3 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8i-j</xref>). Although no significant difference in the expression of ABCG2 was detected in old mice, a significant increased in its expression was observed in aged mice after supplementation with butyrate (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8k</xref>). Meanwhile, the mRNA expression of ABCG2 in the colons was significantly increased in old or aged mice after supplementation with butyrate (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8l</xref>). Moreover, supplementation with butyrate significantly increased the mRNA expression of ZO-1, Occludin, and JAMA in the colons of mice (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">supplementary figure 8a-c</xref>). Based on the abovementioned results, we found that supplementation with butyrate promotes uric acid excretion and improves the intestinal tight junction integrity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The incidence of gout and hyperuricemia continually to increases as individuals. However, research on gout among the elderly population is relatively limited. Previous studies have confirmed a close relationship between gout and the gut microbiota(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>), but the specific connection between the gut microbiota of older individuals and gout remains unexplored. FMT from young to old mice also reportedly alleviates age-related stroke(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>)and other benefits(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). And there are also studies indicating Older patients demonstrate heightened inflammatory reactions during gout attacks(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Based on this finding, we hypothesize that the gut microbiota of different age groups may exert varying effects on gout. Therefore, we conducted cross-age FMT to investigate the interaction between the gut microbiota in different age groups and gout.</p>
<p>This study demonstrated that FMT from young to aged mice effectively alleviated the inflammatory response caused by MSU and improved uric acid metabolism in elderly mice, reducing the symptoms of gout. In contrast, FMT from old or aged to young mice exacerbated gout, indicating the importance of the gut microbiota composition in gout development. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome has been implicated in the pathogenesis of gout, leading to the production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. The beneficial effects of FMT from young to aged mice could be attributed to inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. A “younger” gut microbiota could suppress the activation of NLRP3, Caspase-1 and IL-1β, thereby reduce the inflammatory response in gout. Furthermore, the modulation of uric acid metabolism in old or aged mice played a role in the effects of young gut microbiota transplantation. Additionally, the improvement in the intestinal tight junction integrity observed after transplantation of the gut microbiota from young to old or aged mice may contribute to enhanced elimination of uric acid. Recent studies have also shown a direct relationship between hyperuricemia and gut microbiota. Certain anaerobic microbial communities are capable of effectively degrading purines and uric acid and thereby regulate the abundance of purines in the body to maintain the body’s uric acid balance(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Our study also showed that the gut microbiota plays a role in maintaining the balance of serum uric acid in the body. The “ageing” gut microbiota is more likely to elevate the levels of serum uric acid in the body by suppressing the expression of uric acid excretion transporter (OAT1, OAT3). The “younger” gut microbiota helps to restrain the increase of serum uric acid levels in old or aged mice by suppressing the expression of uric acid reabsorption transporters (URAT1) and the activity of uric acid-producing enzymes (mainly XOD) and also promotes the expression of uric acid excretion transporters (ABCG2) in aged mice. We also found that old or aged mice exhibited stronger purine metabolism (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2a, b</xref>). These results may explain the reason for the high levels of uric acid detected in elderly individuals.</p>
<p>Moreover, through 16S rDNA sequencing analysis, we found that the abundance of <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> and <italic>Akkermansia</italic> was higher in young mice. Additionally, FMT from young to old or aged mice increased the abundance of the <italic>Akkermansia</italic> genus. There are existing reports regarding the therapeutic effects of <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>) and <italic>Akkermansia</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>) on gout and hyperuricemia. Therefore, we performed further investigation, and using microbiome-predicted functional and untargeted metabolomics data, we observed a significant enhancement in butanoate metabolism in young mice. Surprisingly, using untargeted metabolomics data, comparisons of the results after FMT from young to old or aged mice with those of old or aged mice also identified the secondary bile acid biosynthesis pathways. Studies have indicated that transplantation of the gut microbiota from healthy mice to progeroid mice can enhance the enrichment of secondary bile acid biosynthesis pathways, and the restoration of secondary bile acids may potentially contribute to extension of the healthspan and lifespan in progeroid mice(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). The current investigation into the impact of secondary bile acids on gout and hyperuricemia is still in its incipient phase, with the intrinsic mechanisms remaining largely unelucidated, thereby rendering this domain a pivotal subject of profound scientific inquiry. Moreover, old or aged mice transplanted with gut microbiota from young mice also exhibited an increase in butanoate metabolism. This finding led us to hypothesize that butyric acid might play a role in this phenomenon. Subsequently, we selected the Young+PBS, Aged+PBS, and Aged+Young groups for analysis of the short-chain fatty acid levels and discovered that the fecal butyric acid content in young mice was higher than that in aged mice, and that FMT from young mice led to an increase in fecal butyric acid content in aged mice. Consistent with previous reports, the content of SCFAs in the faeces of elderly mice was lower than that in the faeces of young mice(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). This result shifted our focus to butyric acid. Butyric acid, a SCFA derived from the gut microbiota, has been found to play a crucial role in host health(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Emerging evidence indicates that among SCFAs, butyrate plays a pivotal role as a regulator in mediating metabolic control of the microbiota(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). The anti-inflammatory effects of butyric acid have been extensively reported,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>) but only a few studies have investigated its impact on gout. Similarly, research on the anti-hyperuricemia effects of butyric acid is relatively scarce. We then conducted experiments using gout and peritonitis models, and found that mice supplemented with butyrate exhibited relief in symptoms of gout and inflammation. Butyrate could also reduce the serum uric acid levels in old or aged mice by promoting the expression of uric acid excretion transporters.</p>
<p>The findings of this study demonstrate the positive effects of gut microbiota transplantation from young to aged mice in mitigating gout symptoms. Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway was found to modulate uric acid metabolism, and increase butyric acid levels. The gut microbiota of young mice effectively alleviated the inflammatory response and improved uric acid metabolism in aged mice. We enhanced Butanoate metabolism in the gut microbiota of young mice, while the opposite was observed in aged mice. Furthermore, we observed higher levels of butyrate in the feces of young mice. Moreover, butyrate has excellent anti-inflammatory and uric acid-lowering effects. These findings highlight the potential of targeting the gut microbiota as a therapeutic approach for the prevention and treatment of senile gout-related conditions.</p>

<title>Preparation of MSU crystals</title>
<p>A solution consisting of 10 mM uric acid and 154 mM NaCl (both from Sigma) was adjusted to pH 7.2 and agitated for 7 days to produce MSU crystals. For sterilization the needle-shaped crystals were washed with ethanol, dried under sterile conditions and heated at 180°C for 2 h. The crystals were stored at 20 mg/mL in sterile PBS for the experimental model.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4b">
<title>Animals</title>
<p>All the mice in the different age groups were purchased from Longde Biotechnology Co., LTD (Changchun, Jilin, China). The mice were housed in a controlled environment with a temperature of 24±2°C and a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle, in a pathogen-free facility. These mice were provided ad libitum access to food and water. All animal experiments were conducted in compliance with the regulations set forth by the Administration of Affairs Concerning Experimental Animals in China. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Jilin University approved the entire protocol, including the mouse autopsy and sample collection (20170318).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4c">
<title>Animal and FMT</title>
<p>Young (3 months), old (18 months) and aged (24 months) male mice were randomly reassigned to experimental cages one week prior to the experiment. The mice in the FMT groups were subjected to antibiotic interventions and depletion of the host gut microbiota by via oral gavage of a 3-day broad-spectrum antibiotic cocktail regimen (vancomycin, 100 mg/kg; metronidazole, 200 mg/kg; ampicillin 200 mg/kg, neomycin 200 mg/kg) to maximize potential engraftment of the donor microbiota. Those in the PBS groups were orally gavaged with isopycnic PBS.</p>
<p>Before antibiotic interventions, fecal slurries from the donor mice were prepared by pooling fecal pellet material from 12-15 mice per cage (chosen randomly) for each age group. At the time of pellet collection, at least three pellets from each mouse were collected into sterile centrifuge tubes, and the mice were then returned to their cage. The fecal pellets from each age group were mixed, and sterile PBS (five times the weight of the fecal pellets) was added. The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g and 4°C for 10 min and fecal slurry was collected. After addition of 10% glycerol (v/v) and the slurry was stored at –80°C until use. After antibiotic washout, recipient mice were reassigned to different groups and received heterochronic donor microbiota twice 3 days apart by oral gavage of the fecal slurry preparation. Each mouse received 200 μL the fecal slurry preparation during each gavage.</p>
<p>Control groups for 3-month-old, 18-month-old and 24-month-old receiving heterochronic transfer were gavaged with PBS only, revealed antibiotic treatment/PBS gavage only and were administered control microbiota (obtained from a donor pool of the same age group).</p>
<p>Before MSU injection, fecal pellets were collected for sequencing and untargeted metabolomics analysis on day 22, and were then stored at −80°C. Blood and tissues were collected at the end of the experimental period. All FMT interventions were performed at the same time of day across all the cages to control for the circadian rhythm variabilities in feeding and the microbiota/metabolite composition.</p>

<title>Gout model</title>
<p>To establish this model, we administered 0.4 mg of preformed MSU crystals, resuspended in 20 μL of sterile PBS via subcutaneous injection into the left hind paws of the animals. We measured the hind paw thickness using calipers (the minimum accuracy of which was 0.01 mm) before and 8 hours after MSU injection. Eight hours after injection, mouse dorsal foot tissues were collected for histopathological observation and protein extraction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5b">
<title>Peritonitis model</title>
<p>Peritonitis was induced in the mice by intraperitoneal injection of MSU crystals at a dose of 2.5 mg in PBS. Six hours later, the peritoneal cells were collected by lavage (3 mL of PBS), and the cell count was determined using a hemocytometer to ensure consistent cell numbers. The lavage fluid was used to detect cytokines, and proteins were cells extracted from the cells.</p>

<title>Butyrate supplementation experiment</title>
<p>In this experiment, 3-month-old mice received a supplemental dose of butyrate (administered via gavage at a concentration of 200 mg/kg) for 14 days. Subsequently, these mice were subjected to monosodium urate (MSU) stimulation. The investigation was conducted utilizing both gout and peritonitis models to assess the effects of butyrate supplementation. Simultaneously, mice aged 18 months and 24 months were given the same dosage of supplemental butyrate as the 3-month-old mice for 14 days. Subsequently, their liver, kidneys, intestines, and blood samples were collected for analysis.</p>

<title>Western blotting</title>
<p>The total proteins from the peritoneal cells and foot tissue samples were extracted using a protein extraction kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The targeted proteins were separated by 10% or 15% SDS-PAGE based on the molecular weight and then bonded to 0.22 μm PVDF membranes. After blocking with 5% skim milk for three hours at RT, specific antibodies, including NLRP3, Caspace-1, IL-1β and β-actin, were used to detected target proteins at an appropriate final concentration according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The PVDF membranes were then incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:20,000), wash with TBST, and determined using the ECL plus western blotting detection system (Tanon, China). The grey values of the western blotting bands were procured using Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In their manuscript the authors report that fecal transplantation from young mice into old mice alleviates susceptibility to gout. The gut microbiota in young mice is found to inhibit activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway and reduce uric acid levels in the blood in the gout model.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>They focused on the butanoate metabolism pathway based on the results of metabolomics analysis after fecal transplantation and identified butyrate as the key factor in mitigating gout susceptibility. In general, this is a well-performed study.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The discussion on the current results and previous studies regarding the effect of butyrate on gout symptoms is insufficient. The authors need to provide a more thorough discussion of other possible mechanisms and relevant literature.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The revised manuscript presents interesting findings on the role of gut microbiota in gout, focusing on the interplay between age-related changes, inflammation, and microbiota-derived metabolites, particularly butyrate. The study provides valuable insights into the therapeutic potential of microbiota interventions and metabolites for managing hyperuricemia and gout. While the authors have addressed many of the previous concerns, a few areas still require clarification and improvements to strengthen the manuscript's clarity and overall impact.</p>
<p>(1) While the authors mention that outliers in the data do not affect the conclusions, there remains a concern about the reliability of some figures (e.g., Figure 2D-G). It is recommended to provide a more detailed explanation of the statistical analysis used to handle outliers. Additionally, the clarity of the Western blot images, particularly IL-1β in Figure 3C, should be improved to ensure clear and supportive evidence for the conclusions.</p>
<p>
(2) The manuscript raises a key question about why butyrate supplementation and FMT have different effects on uric acid metabolism and excretion. While the authors have addressed this by highlighting the involvement of multiple bacterial genera, it is still recommended to expand on the differences between these interventions in the discussion, providing more mechanistic insights based on available literature.</p>
<p>
(3) It is noted that IL-6 and TNF-α results in foot tissue were requested and have been added to supplementary material. However, the main text should clearly reference these additions, and the supplementary figures should be thoroughly reviewed for consistency with the main findings. The use of abbreviations (e.g., ns for no significant difference) and labeling should also be carefully checked across all figures.</p>
<p>
(4) The manuscript presents butyrate as a key molecule in gout therapy, yet there are lingering concerns about its central role, especially given that other short-chain fatty acids (e.g., acetic and propionic acids) also follow similar trends. The authors should consider further acknowledging these other SCFAs and discussing their potential contribution to gout management. Additionally, the rationale for focusing primarily on butyrate in subsequent research should be made clearer.</p>
<p>
(5) The full-length uncropped Western blot images should be provided as requested, to ensure transparency and reproducibility of the data.</p>
<p>
(6) Despite the authors' revisions, several references still lack page numbers. Please ensure that all references are properly formatted, including complete page ranges.</p>
<p>
The manuscript has improved with the revisions made, particularly regarding clarifications on experimental design and the inclusion of supplementary data. However, some concerns about data quality, mechanistic insights, and clarity in the figures remain. Addressing these points will enhance the overall impact of the work and its potential contribution to the understanding of the gut microbiome in gout and hyperuricemia. A final revision, with careful attention to both major and minor points, is highly recommended before resubmission.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Some critical comments are provided below：</p>
<p>(1) The data quality still needs to be improved. There are many outliers in the experimental data shown in some figures, e.g. Figure 2D-G. The presence of these outliers makes the results unreliable. The author should thoroughly review the data analysis in the manuscript. In addition, a couple of western blot bands, such as IL-1β in Figure 3C, are not clear enough, please provide clearer western blot results again to support the conclusion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Following our comparative analysis, we have determined that these data do not affect our conclusions. Moreover, our experimental design included a total of six mice per group, with all mouse samples being subjected to testing.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) As shown in Figure 1G-I, foot thickness and IL-1β content in foot tissues of the Aged+Abx group were significantly reduced, but there was no difference in serum uric acid level. In addition, the Abx-untreated group should be included at all ages.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. We have included this data in Supplemental Material 4.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Since FMT (Figure 4) and butyrate supplementation (Figure 8) have different effects on uric acid synthesis enzyme and excretion, different mechanisms may lie behind these two interventions. Transplantation with significantly enriched single strains from young mice, such as <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> and <italic>Akkermansia</italic>, is the more reliable approach to reveal the underlying mechanism between gut microbiota and gout.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. Due to the involvement of multiple bacterial genera in gout and hyperuricemia, and the practical challenge of testing all strains, our focus shifted to the functional implications and metabolism of the microbiota. Experimental validation confirmed that butyrate exerts a dual-therapeutic effect in mitigating gout and hyperuricemia.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In Figure 2F, the results showed the IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α content in serum, which was inconsistent with the authors' manuscript description (Line 171).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. The modifications to the results have been implemented.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Figures 2F-H duplicate Supplementary Figures S1B-D. The authors should prepare the article more carefully to avoid such mistakes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. We have corrected it in the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) In lines 202-206, the authors stated that the elevated serum uric acid levels in the Young+Old or Young+Aged groups, but there is no difference in the results shown in Figure 4A.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. We have corrected it in the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Please visualize the results in Table 2 in a more intuitive manner.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The results have been presented in Table 2 with a more intuitive visual format. The detailed information is presented in Supplement 4.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) The heatmap in Figure 7A cannot strongly support the conclusion &quot;the butyric acid content in the faeces of Young+PBS group was significantly higher than that in the Aged+PBS group&quot;. The author should re-represent the visual results and provide a reasonable explanation. In addition, please provide the ordinate unit of Supplementary Figure 7A-H.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. Figure 7A and Supplementary Figure 7A-H together illustrate &quot;the butyric acid content in the faeces of Young+PBS group was significantly higher than that in the Aged+PBS group&quot;, and the specific units of short-chain fatty acids have been annotated in the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) Uncropped original full-length western blot should be provided.</p>

<p>Thank you for your comment. We have made relevant notes in the paper.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Gout, a prevalent form of arthritis among the elderly, exhibits an intricate relationship with age and gut microbiota. The authors found that gut microbiota plays a crucial role in determining susceptibility to age-related gout. They observed that age-related gut microbiota regulated the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway and modulated uric acid metabolism. &quot;Younger&quot; microbiota has a positive impact on the gut microbiota structure of old or aged mice, enhancing butanoate metabolism and butyric acid content. Finally, they found butyric acid exerts a dual effect, inhibiting inflammation in acute gout and reducing serum uric acid levels. This work's insights emphasize the potential of &quot;young&quot; gut microbiome in mitigating senile gout. The whole study was interesting, but there were some minor errors in the overall writing of the paper. The author should carefully check the spelling of the words in the text and the case consistency of the group names.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Specific comments:</p>
<p>(1) In Figures 1G-H, the Aged+PBS group with antibiotic treatment shows a significant reduction in foot swelling and IL-1β compared to the Young+PBS and Old+PBS groups. The authors state that age-related changes in the gut microbiota exacerbate gout. However, why does only the Aged+PBS group improve with antibiotic treatment? It seems that butyrate alone cannot explain this phenomenon.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We utilize antibiotics for treatment in order to establish the relationship between gut microbiota, age, and gout. Different age groups are directly given antibiotics for treatment. We found that after clearing the gut microbiota and then stimulating with MSU, the trend of inflammation factors changing with age disappears.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In Figure 2, the fecal transplantation from young mice improved the infiltration of inflammatory cells and inflammatory cytokines in the Old and Aged groups. However, in Supplementary Figure 1A, there is no improvement observed in the percentage of foot swelling. Is it appropriate to conclude that inflammation was improved even though foot swelling was not suppressed?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Although we did not observe changes in the swelling of the mice's feet, there were changes in the inflammatory cell infiltration and inflammation factors in the slices. We rely on a comprehensive assessment of various indicators to determine whether the inflammatory condition has improved or worsened.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In line #249, the authors state that &quot;the fecal microbiota from mice in the young group promotes uric acid elimination, inhibits reabsorption, and may contribute to the integrity of the intestinal barrier structure.&quot; However, Supplementary Figure 3F-H shows no significant alterations in Occludin and ZO-1 mRNA expression levels among all groups. Therefore, it is difficult to conclude that the fecal microbiota from the young group promotes the integrity of the intestinal barrier structure. A functional barrier assay, such as oral administration of FITC-dextran, would be necessary to verify the authors' conclusion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In Supplementary Figure 3F-H, we observed that the mRNA expression of Occludin and ZO-1 increased but showed no significant difference. However, after the elderly mice were transplanted with the intestinal microbiota of young mice, the mRNA expression of JAMA showed a significant upward trend. Additionally, due to the scarcity of old mice, we were unable to perform the oral administration of FITC-dextran. However, we supplemented with immunohistochemical slices of Zo-1 and Occludin to support our viewpoint.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In Figure 4, when comparing the young+PBS group with the old+PBS or aged+PBS groups, there are hardly any differences in the proteins involved in uric acid synthesis (ADA, GDA, XOD) or the genes involved in uric acid transport (URAT1, GLUT9, OAT1, OTA3, ABCG2). Since no changes in uric acid synthesis or transport pathways are observed with aging, it is questionable to conclude that fecal transplantation from young mice improves these pathways and lowers blood uric acid levels.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the calculation process, we used different age groups of the control group as references, instead of directly using young mice. We then compared the data of mice of different ages, and the results are in Supplementary Material 4.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) In line 276, the authors describe &quot;the Young +Old and Young+Aged groups tended to be closer to the Old+PBS and Aged+PBS groups, and the Old+Young and Aged+young groups tended to be closer to the Young+PBS group (Figure 5D)&quot;. Please conduct a statistical analysis.</p>
<p>(6) In line 298, the authors hypothesize that butyrate might be the key molecule responsible for controlling gout, as Bifidobacterium and Akkermansia were abundant in the Young group, and the butyrate pathway was prominent. However, neither Bifidobacterium nor Akkermansia are butyrate-producing bacteria. Thus, the conclusion appears to be biased toward butyrate, raising questions about this interpretation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Upon comparison, we discovered other bacteria genera that produce butyrate, such as <italic>Lachnoclostridium</italic>. Additionally, literature (PMID:38126785, 26420851) reports have indicated that <italic>Bifidobacteria</italic> combined with other genera can enhance the production of butyrate. Meanwhile, <italic>Akkermansia</italic>, particularly the species <italic>Akkermansia muciniphila</italic>, has been found to confer several beneficial traits, as evidenced by preclinical studies. These traits include promoting the growth of butyrate-producing bacteria through the production of acetate, which leads to a decrease in the loss of the colonic bilayer and subsequent reduction in inflammation (PMID:35468952). Based on the predicted results of microbiome functions, we observed that the Butanoate_metabolism of the microbiota in young mice and the elderly mice recipients of young mouse microbiota was enhanced. Considering that <italic>Lachnoclostridium</italic> can produce butyrate, and that <italic>Bifidobacteria</italic> and <italic>Akkermansia</italic> can promote the production of butyrate by the intestinal microbiota, we speculated that butyrate might play a role in gout and hyperuricemia.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) In Supplementary Figure 7, acetic acid and propionic acid also show the same behavior as butyric acid. It is possible that these metabolites may also affect the development of gout.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. Indeed, Figure 7 does show a similar trend for acetic and propionic acids as for butyric acid. However, considering the predictive data of microbial function and the non-targeted metabolomic data, there is an enhancement of Butanoate_metabolism in both young mice and elderly mice receiving young mouse intestinal microbiota transplants. Therefore, we prioritized butyrate as the subject of our study. Due to the scarcity of elderly mice, we are unable to conduct subsequent experiments with acetic and propionic acids, which is one of the limitations of this study. This work will be addressed in our follow-up research.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) In Figure 6, the secondary bile acid biosynthesis pathway was also changed. However, there is little mention of secondary bile acid in the discussion section. Please carefully discuss other possibilities besides butyrate.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. We have incorporated a discussion about secondary bile acids into the relevant section of our manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) In line #330, the authors state, 'the metabolites identified as showing differential abundance between the groups were enriched in the butanoate metabolism pathway (Figure 6A-D).' However, there does not appear to be much difference in the butanoate metabolism pathway. Specifically, in Figure 6C, the butanoate metabolism pathway in the Old group does not differ from that in the Young group. Please explain in more detail whether the butanoate metabolism pathway is relevant in the Old group.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The metabolites identified as showing differential abundance between the groups were enriched in the butanoate metabolism pathway. The differential metabolites are enriched in the butyrate metabolism pathway; however, the non-targeted metabolomics did not reveal the extent of their enrichment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) In Figure 7, the authors measured the levels of short-chain fatty acids in the Young and Aged groups. They found butyrate in the feces of mice in the Young group was higher than that in the Aged group. However, I wonder whether the Old group also had low levels of butyrate or not.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the experiment, we selected three representative groups to verify the hypothesis that butyrate may play a significant role in gout and hyperuricemia. Subsequently, we found that supplementing 18-month-old and 24-month-old mice with butyrate indeed reduced blood uric acid levels and alleviated gout symptoms. Since 18-month-old mice are difficult to obtain, we only conducted microbiome sequencing and non-targeted metabolomic analysis.</p>
