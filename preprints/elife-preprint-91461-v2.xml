<title>Abstract</title><p>Genome and epigenome integrity in eukaryotes depends on the proper coupling of histone deposition with DNA synthesis. This process relies on the evolutionary conserved histone chaperone CAF-1 for which the links between structure and functions are still a puzzle. While studies of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> CAF-1 complex enabled to propose a model for the histone deposition mechanism, we still lack a framework to demonstrate its generality and in particular, how its interaction with the polymerase accessory factor PCNA is operating. Here, we reconstituted a complete <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 from fission yeast. We characterized its dynamic structure using NMR, SAXS and molecular modeling together with <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> functional studies on rationally designed interaction mutants. Importantly, we identify the unfolded nature of the acidic domain which folds up when binding to histones. We also show how the long KER helix mediates DNA binding and stimulates <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 association with PCNA. Our study highlights how the organization of CAF-1 comprising both disordered regions and folded modules enables the dynamics of multiple interactions to promote synthesis-coupled histone deposition essential for its DNA replication, heterochromatin maintenance, and genome stability functions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In eukaryotes, genomic DNA is packaged in a dynamic nucleoprotein complex, the chromatin, which protects DNA and regulates its accessibility. The fundamental repeat unit of chromatin, the nucleosome core particle, comprises 146 bp of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer including a tetramer of histone H3−H4 flanked by two dimers of H2A−H2B(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Luger et al. 1997</xref>). Histone chaperones are critical players in ensuring histone traffic and deposition. Without energy consumption, they escort histones, facilitate their transfer and deposition on DNA, and provide links with DNA based-processes such as DNA replication, repair and gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Gurard-Levin et al. 2014</xref>). In line with these key properties, perturbations of histone chaperones are associated with defects in genome and epigenome maintenance and function as found in cancer, aging and viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Yi and Kim 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sultana et al. 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ray-Gallet and Almouzni 2022</xref>). Discovered over thirty years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Smith and Stillman 1989</xref>), conserved in all eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Loyola and Almouzni 2004</xref>), the histone chaperone <underline>C</underline>hromatin <underline>A</underline>ssembly <underline>F</underline>actor 1 (CAF-1) is central and unique in promoting the deposition of replicative histones H3−H4 in a manner coupled to DNA synthesis, i.e. during DNA replication and repair, and is also involved in heterochromatin maintenance (see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ridgway and Almouzni 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Gurard-Levin et al. 2014</xref>) for review). The unique feature of CAF-1 is that it provides a link with DNA synthesis via its association with the trimeric DNA polymerase processivity factor, <underline>P</underline>roliferation <underline>C</underline>ell <underline>N</underline>uclear <underline>A</underline>ntigen (PCNA), through <underline>P</underline>CNA Interacting <underline>P</underline>rotein motifs (PIP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Martini et al. 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Shibahara and Stillman 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Moggs et al. 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Zhang et al. 2000</xref>, Rolef <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ben-Shahar et al. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Pietrobon et al. 2014</xref>, Gopinathan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Nair et al. 2022</xref>), but the precise function of this interaction remains to be examined.</p>
<p>CAF-1 comprises three subunits (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Smith and Stillman 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kaufman et al. 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dohke et al. 2008</xref>). While progress in uncovering its molecular/genetic properties derives from work in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae,</italic> and biochemical work in human cells, there is still a lack of atomic information for the complex. In <italic>cerevisiae,</italic> CAF-1 is a hetero-trimer that binds to a single H3–H4 dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mattiroli et al. 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sauer et al. 2017</xref>). The current model states that histone binding induces a conformational rearrangement promoting its interaction with the DNA. Two complexes must co-associate to ensure the deposition of H3−H4 tetramers on DNA in the first step of nucleosome assembly (see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sauer et al. 2018</xref>) for review). Two domains of the large subunit Cac1 contribute to DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zhang et al. 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sauer et al. 2017</xref>), the conserved low complexity region called KER (for Lys, Glu and Arg rich) and the C-terminal <underline>W</underline>inged <underline>H</underline>elix <underline>D</underline>omain (WHD). These features are conserved in human CAF-1 (Gopinathan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Nair et al. 2022</xref>). However, a comprehensive and dynamic view of the CAF-1 complex is still missing, and most critically understanding how the functional domains cooperate to ensure efficient histone deposition coupled to DNA synthesis remains to be determined. Moreover, the degree of conservation of these properties across species and possible connections with heterochromatin regulation elements such as histone H3K9 trimetylation and HP1 recruitment remain unknown.</p>

<p>To tackle these issues, we isolated the fission yeast complex (Pcf1-Pcf2-Pcf3) and investigated its binding mode with its three main partners, histones H3−H4, DNA and PCNA. Based on novel structural insights, we designed targeted mutations to specifically identify the key features promoting Pcf1 interactions with DNA, PCNA and histones H3−H4. We next monitored functional impacts of these mutations in <italic>vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> by analysing the phenotypes of the corresponding mutants in fission yeast. We show that disordered or partly disordered segments of the large subunit of CAF-1 are key for interactions with H3-H4 and DNA, underscoring the dynamic nature of the binding interface between CAF-1, histones H3-H4, and DNA. Upon histone binding, the acidic domain (ED) of the large subunit folds and this conformational changes impact CAF-1-PCNA interaction <italic>in vivo</italic>. We propose that such conformational changes upon histone binding contribute to PCNA/CAF1 recycling during DNA replication. We further show that PCNA binding accelerates nucleosome assembly <italic>in vitro</italic> and is also essential for the proper targeting of the complex to the chromatin <italic>in vivo</italic>. Finally, we found that the WHD C-terminal domain does not bind DNA but allows to uncouple the unique functions of CAF-1 in replication-dependent chromatin assembly, genome stability and heterochromatin maintenance. We suggest that this domain contributes to specify CAF-1 functions.</p>

<title>Global organization of the full-length <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 complex</title>
<p>The large subunit of CAF-1, present in all major groups of eukaryotes, exhibits significant sequence divergence (16% sequence identity between <italic>Sp</italic>Pcf1 and <italic>Sc</italic>Cac1 and 21% sequence identity between <italic>Sp</italic>Pcf1 and <italic>Hs</italic>CHAF1A/p150, <bold>Figure S1a</bold>). Given this high sequence divergence, conserved biochemical properties between <italic>Sc</italic>CAF-1 and <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 should reveal important functional features. Of particular interest, <italic>S. pombe</italic> heterochromatin shares with human a regulation based on the recruitment of Swi6, the Heterochromatin Function 1 (HP1) orthologue, via histone H3K9 trimethylation. From sequence alignments, the 6 main conserved regions previously proposed to contribute to the nucleosome assembly activity of CAF-1 can be inferred in <italic>Sp</italic>Pcf1 sequence, a KER domain, a single PIP motif, an acidic domain (ED domain), the domains predicted to bind Pcf2 (2BD) and Pcf3 (3BD) and a C-terminal WHD domain (<bold>Figure S1b</bold>). Although <italic>Sp</italic>Pcf1 is shorter than <italic>Sc</italic>Cac1 and <italic>Hs</italic>CHAF1A/p150 (544 residues instead of 606 and 956, respectively) its sequence includes a remarkable high abundance of predicted Intrinsically <underline>D</underline>isordered <underline>R</underline>egions (IDRs) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref></bold>). These IDRs include the predicted histone-binding domain (Pcf1_ED), the PCNA (PIP motif) and the DNA binding domain (Pcf-1 KER).</p>
<p>We produced and purified the three subunits of <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 separately from bacteria and insect cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref></bold>, materials &amp; methods). When isolated, both Pcf2 and Pcf3 are monomeric while Pcf1 forms large soluble oligomers (<bold>Figure S1c</bold>). Mixing the subunits by pairs, we observed stable complexes for Pcf1-Pcf2 and Pcf1-Pcf3 by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Pcf2 and Pcf3 did not interact with each other (<bold>Figure S1c-d</bold>) suggesting that the large subunit Pcf1 mediates the complex assembly. We next reconstituted and isolated the recombinant full-length (FL) <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 complex by SEC (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref></bold>). An experimental molecular weight of 179 kDa was calculated using Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS). Assuming an accuracy of around 10% with this method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Rambo and Tainer 2013</xref>), this value is consistent with a 1:1:1 stoichiometry for the CAF-1 complex (calculated MW 167kDa) (<bold>Figure S1e</bold>). In addition, the position of the maximum for the dimensionless Kratky plot was slightly shifted to higher values in the y and x axis compared to the position of the expected maximum of the curve for a fully globular protein (<bold>Figure S1f</bold>). This shows that the complex was globular with a significant flexibility.</p>
<p>To determine the extent of disorder in the large subunit of <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1, Pcf1 was produced with uniform <sup>15</sup>N (or <sup>15</sup>N-<sup>13</sup>C) labeling. The CAF-1(<sup>15</sup>N-Pcf1) complex with unlabeled Pcf2 and Pcf3 was reconstituted and SEC-purified. Given the size of this complex (167 kDa), we expected that only amide signals from residues in long disordered regions could be observed by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The <sup>15</sup>N-<sup>1</sup>H spectrum shows about 140 amide signals, revealing that up to a quarter of Pcf1 residues are intrinsically disordered in the full <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 complex (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref></bold>). These residues are located in four continuous segments of Pcf1 and define intrinsically disordered regions that we labeled IDR1 to IDR4 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref></bold>). IDR1 corresponds to the ∼50 N-terminal residues of the protein, IDR2 (181-198) is located between the PIP motif and the 3BD region, IDR3 (355-394) overlaps a large segment of the acidic ED domain and IDR4 (451-470) is located between the 2BD region and the C-terminal WHD domain. The boundaries of the four IDRs are in agreement with the segments of Pcf1 predicted to harbor disorder with a high probability <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>)</bold>.</p>
<p>We next built a model of the <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 complex using the AlphaFold2 multimer software (AF2) with one copy of each full-length protein (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1e</xref></bold>, <bold>Figures S1g-m</bold>). The model is consistent with our biochemical data showing that Pcf1 mediates the complex assembly. Also, in agreement with their disordered nature, low values around 0.2-0.3 of the local quality of the model as calculated by the Local Distance Difference Test (pLDDT) were obtained in the four IDR segments with a remarkable match for the delimitations of the four IDR segments by pLDDT values and NMR data (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>)</bold>. Accordingly, these segments are symbolized with a dashed line in <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1e</xref></bold>. In contrast, significantly high pLDDT was obtained for the 3BD, 2BD and WHD domains of Pcf1 and for the two subunits Pcf2 and Pcf3. (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref></bold>, <bold>Figures S1g</bold>). These data allowed to identify four independent modules, not predicted to interact with each other. The first module corresponds to the KER domain of Pcf1, predicted to form a long helix ending by the PIP motif. The second module contains the Pcf2 subunit, composed of 7 WD repeats arranged in a circular fold, and a segment of Pcf1 corresponding to the 2BD domain forming three short beta strands and a short helix (<bold>Figure S1h-j</bold>). In the third module, the 3BD domain of Pcf1 composed of 7 helices and 3 beta strands establishes a large interface with Pcf3, composed of 7 circular WD repeats (<bold>Figure S1k-m</bold>). The fourth domain is the WHD domain. We next used these models to fit our SAXS data allowing flexibility between the four modules. The best model fitted the experimental data with a high accuracy and is in agreement with a relatively globular complex. Superimposing the generated models did not define a unique orientation between the four modules, suggesting that the complex has an inter-module flexibility (<bold>Table S1, Figure S1n-o</bold>).</p>
<p>Taken together, our findings indicate that the large subunit Pcf1 mediates the (1:1:1) complex assembly. Pcf1 includes four IDR, and can organize its key regions (KER, PIP, 3BD, ED, 2BD and WHD) allowing them to be exposed and bound by Pcf2 and Pcf3 simultaneously.</p>

<p>Addition of histones to <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1(<sup>15</sup>N-Pcf1) led to a drastic decrease in intensity of the NMR signal specifically for residues in the IDR3 segment (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref></bold>, <bold>Figure S2a</bold>). To further characterize this domain, we designed a short construct of Pcf1 (325-396), called Pcf1_ED, corresponding to the IDR3 segment extended in its N-terminus with the conserved acidic segment (325-355) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>, Figure S1b</bold>). We confirmed the fully disordered nature of Pcf1_ED by NMR (<bold>Figure S2b-c)</bold>. Signals corresponding to residues 355-394 (IDR3) remarkably overlap in the spectra of Pcf1_ED and <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1(<sup>15</sup>N-Pcf1) (<bold>Figure S2a</bold>), showing that this segment was fully flexible in <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1, and did not interact with other regions of the complex. Upon binding of unlabeled histones H3−H4, we observed the vanishing of almost all NMR signals of <sup>15</sup>N Pcf1_ED as in the full <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 complex (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref></bold>). In contrast, only a shorter fragment (338-347) vanished upon addition of Asf1−H3−H4−Mcm2(69-138), a histone complex preformed with two other histone chaperones, Asf1 and Mcm2, known to compete with CAF-1 for histone binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sauer et al. 2017</xref>) and whose histone binding modes are well established (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2e</xref></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Huang et al. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Richet et al. 2015</xref>). This finding underscores a direct competition between residues (325-338) and (349-396) within the ED domain and Asf1/Mcm2 for histone binding. Fully consistent with this NMR competition experiment, the segment (353-385) of Pcf1_ED domain was predicted by AlphaFold2 to interact with histones H3−H4 through the same surface as the one bound by Mcm2 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2f</xref>, Figure S2d</bold>). Two highly conserved positions in Pcf1, L359 and F380, are thus proposed to mediate histone H3−H4 binding in the same region as Mcm2 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2f</xref></bold>). We next used these AlphaFold2 models to fit the SAXS curve of the <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1−H3−H4 complex allowing reorientation of the different modules (<bold>Figure S1p-q</bold>). Remarkably, all generated models show a significant exclusion of the KER domain from the complex, suggesting that the KER domain of <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 becomes more accessible upon histone binding.</p>
<p>The NMR competition experiment also reveals that an additional region of Pcf1_ED domain (338-351) is involved in the interaction with H3−H4 but is not competing with the Asf1-Mcm2 module. (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref></bold>). In order to alter the interaction of the ED domain with histones without modifying its charge and without interfering with Asf1 or Mcm2 binding, we identified from sequence alignments in this segment <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>)</bold>, two invariant hydrophobic residues, Y340 and W348, that were mutated into alanines (mutant called ED*, <bold>Figure S1b</bold>). As expected, the isolated Pcf1_ED* domain showed almost no histone binding as observed by the intensity of <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N NMR signals (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref></bold>). We next monitored the impact of the ED* mutations in the context of the full <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 complex. To do so, the mutations Y340A-W348A were introduced in the full length Pcf1, and the complex reconstituted with the uniformly <sup>15</sup>N labeled Pcf1-ED* and unlabeled Pcf2 and Pcf3 (<bold>Figure S2e</bold>). The <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N NMR spectrum of this mutant was similar that of the WT complex, but upon addition of unlabeled histones H3−H4 no major change was observed (<bold>Figure S2a</bold>), which strongly suggest an alteration of the histone binding of this mutant.</p>
<p>In summary, we identified critical amino-acids in the ED domain involved in H3−H4 binding. We also showed that addition of histones leads to a conformational change in the <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 complex with less disorder in the ED domain and an increased accessibility of the KER domain.</p>

<title>The KER domain is the main DNA binding region of <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1</title>
<p>The KER and WHD domains of the CAF-1 large subunit were shown to be involved in DNA binding in <italic>Sc</italic>CAF-1 and <italic>Hs</italic>CAF-1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zhang et al. 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sauer et al. 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ayoub et al. 2022</xref>, Gopinathan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Nair et al. 2022</xref>). We were thus interested to explore the conservation of these features in Pcf1. We first isolated the KER domain (Pcf1_KER, <bold>Figure S1b</bold>), and an extended fragment we called Pcf1_KER-PIP (<bold>Figure S1b</bold>), which includes the PIP motif (Q<sub>172</sub>-L-K-L<sub>175</sub>-N-N-F<sub>178</sub>-F<sub>179</sub>). These domains are predicted by AlphaFold2 to form a long helix with partial disorder at both ends and possible extension over the first half of the PIP motif (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref></bold>). Using a combination of circular dichroism (CD) (<bold>Figure S3b-c</bold>), SEC-SAXS (<bold>Figure S1e</bold>-<bold>f, Figure S3d</bold>) and NMR (<bold>Figure S3e-f</bold>), we confirmed that the isolated KER domain of Pcf1 domain forms a straight monomeric helix, partially continuing over the PIP motif. This long helix exhibits a strong bias in amino acid composition and remarkably, almost all basic residues are positioned on the same side of the helix (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref></bold>) providing a suitable interface for DNA binding (Gopinathan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Nair et al. 2022</xref>). We performed EMSA using a DNA ladder as substrate and we found that Pcf1_KER domain binds DNA that are longer than 40bp, as observed with the full <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 complex (<bold>Figure S3e</bold>). EMSAs with double strand 40bp DNA fragment showed the presence of multiple bands for Pcf1_KER bound DNA, indicating a possible cooperative DNA binding of this fragment (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref></bold>). Affinity measurements by MST led to a EC50 of 1.1 ± 0.2 µM for Pcf1_KER with a cooperativity around 3, consistent with EMSA experiments (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). The DNA binding properties of Pcf1_KER-PIP are comparable to that of Pcf1_KER (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, Figure S3f</bold>). The EC50 obtained for the isolated Pcf1_KER are also close that of the full <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 complex (0.7± 0.1µM) suggesting that the KER domain constitutes the principal DNA binding domain of <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1.</p>
<p>Based on these results, we designed a mutant called Pcf1_KER* with a charge inversion for five positive residues at the C-terminus of the potential DNA binding face of the KER helix (R147E-K150E-K154E-R161E-K168E) (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref></bold>, <bold>Figure S1b</bold>). The CD analysis of Pcf1_KER* shows this mutant is mainly helical (<bold>Figure S3g</bold>). MST quantification confirmed that the mutation of Pcf1_KER* impaired DNA binding by a factor of 10 even-though residual DNA binding remained (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref>, Figure S3h-j, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). The KER* mutation was then introduced in the full complex <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1-KER* (<bold>Figure S1b, Figure S2e</bold>) and we confirmed by MST and EMSA its lower affinity for dsDNA (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>, Figure S3k, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>)</bold>. Importantly, this mutant also shows a lower binding cooperativity for DNA binding, as estimated by the Hill coefficient value close to 1, compared to values around 3 for the WT and other mutants. In addition, the NMR signals of all IDR for this mutant with or without histones were close to that of the WT (<bold>Figure S3l-m</bold>) indicating that the KER* mutation did not impair histone binding.</p>

<title>The C-terminal of Pcf1 folds as a WHD domain but does not bind DNA</title>
<p>We next isolated the Pcf1_WHD domain (<bold>Figure S1b</bold>) and confirmed by NMR and AlphaFold2 that its global fold is similar to <italic>Sc</italic>WHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Liu et al. 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zhang et al. 2016</xref>) (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3f</xref>, Figure S3n</bold>). Unexpectedly, Pcf1_WHD does not interact with DNA of any size (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3g</xref>, Figure S3n</bold>). The residues involved in DNA binding in <italic>Sc</italic>WHD, K564 and K568, correspond to S514 and G518 in <italic>Sp</italic>WHD, respectively, leading to a different electrostatic surface, probably not favorable for DNA binding (<bold>Figure S3p-q</bold>). To further investigate the role of the WHD domain of <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1, the WHD domain was deleted in the reconstituted <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1-ΔWHD complex (<bold>Figure S1b Figure S2e</bold>) and analyzed by EMSA and NMR.

<title>Crosstalk between DNA and PCNA binding</title>
<p>The PIP motif of Pcf1 was found crucial for <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 interaction with PCNA <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Pietrobon et al. 2014</xref>). Given its proximity with the KER domain, we further investigated potential cross-talks between PCNA and DNA binding. We first measured by isothermal microcalorimetry (ITC) an affinity of 7.1±1.3 µM between <italic>Sp</italic>PCNA and a short PIP motif segment (<bold>Figure S4a</bold>, <bold><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold>). This affinity is in the same range (2-fold less affine) as a peptide isolated from the replicative polymerase delta from <italic>S. pombe</italic> Cdc27 (<bold>Figure S4a</bold>, <bold><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold>). In agreement with its consensus sequence, the binding mode of Pcf1_PIP motif to <italic>Sp</italic>PCNA is predicted by AlphaFold to be canonical (<bold>Figure S4b</bold>). Consistently, no binding was observed for the Pcf1_PIP* peptide with 4 Alanine mutations, previously designed to disrupt the PIP motif (<bold>Figure S4a</bold>, <bold><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Pietrobon et al. 2014</xref>). We next measured the affinity of the longer fragment Pcf1_KER-PIP for <italic>Sp</italic>PCNA and observed an affinity gain of a factor 10 (0.7 ± 1.3 μM) (<bold>Figure S4c, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold>), revealing interactions between the KER domain and PCNA. ITC also fits a stoichiometry of ∼2 Pcf1_KER-PIP per PCNA trimer, suggesting that, in each PCNA trimer, one monomer remains unbound and potentially accessible for binding to other partners. Pcf1_KER-PIP* did not interact with PCNA confirming the importance of the PIP motif for this association (<bold>Figure S4c, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold>). The KER* mutation impaired the interaction of Pcf1_KER*-PIP with PCNA of a factor 10 reaching the affinity of the short isolated Pcf1 PIP peptide (<bold>Figure S4c, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold>). Collectively these results show that both the PIP motif and the C-terminal part of the KER domain are involved in PCNA binding.</p>

<p>To reveal possible crosstalk between CAF-1 binding to PCNA and DNA, we analysed, in the presence or absence of dsDNA, the binding of the full <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 complexes (WT <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1, <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1-PIP*, <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1-ED*, <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1-KER* and <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1-ΔWHD) with recombinant <italic>Sp</italic>PCNA, using EMSA (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>, Figure S4d</bold>). For all combinations tested, we quantified binding by monitoring the disappearance of free PCNA (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref></bold>) and free DNA (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref></bold>). In this assay, only 20% of free PCNA intensity was lost by addition of DNA (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref></bold>), probably because the PCNA trimer can slide along the linear DNA and dissociates during the migration. In the absence of DNA, we observe a small but significant decrease of free PCNA upon addition of WT <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1, in agreement with the relatively low binding affinity between Pcf1_KER helix and PCNA (<bold><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold>). In contrast, in the presence of dsDNA, addition of an excess of WT <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 leads to the complete disappearing of the free PCNA band and to a large shift of the band corresponding to <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1-DNA, corresponding to a larger complex engaging CAF-1, PCNA and DNA (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref></bold>). <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1-ED* and <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1-ΔWHD show similar binding properties for PCNA and DNA compared to WT CAF-1. In contrast, <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1-PIP* binds DNA like the WT, but is strongly impaired for PCNA binding alone and in the presence of DNA, while <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1-KER* is impaired for binding both DNA and <italic>Sp</italic>PCNA. In agreement, the large shifted band corresponding to a <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1−PCNA−DNA complex is not observed for these two mutants (<bold>Figure S4d</bold>).</p>

<p>Altogether, our data show the stabilization of thee CAF-1−PCNA interaction by DNA that requires both the KER domain and the PIP motif but not the ED and WHD domain. Conversely, the capacity of CAF-1 to bind PCNA does not impair its interaction with DNA.</p>

<title><italic>In vitro</italic> histone deposition properties of <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 mutants</title>
<p>We next examined the ability of the full <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 complex reconstituted with the four Pcf1 mutants (<italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1-PIP*, <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1-ED*, <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1-KER*, <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1-ΔWHD) to promote nucleosome assembly mediated by CAF-1 in a complex environment closer to physiological conditions.

We monitored nucleosome assembly coupled to DNA synthesis using as a template a circular UV-damaged plasmid enabling to analyse by supercoiling assay and nucleotide incorporation simultaneously both repair synthesis and nucleosome formation (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Moggs et al. 2000</xref>). We verified that p150-depleted HSE lacked the capacity to promote nucleosome assembly on labeled DNA when compared to mock depleted HSE, and that the recombinant WT <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 complex efficiently rescued the loss of xp150 as attested by the detection of supercoiled form I. In contrast, when we complemented the depleted extract with <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 mutant complexes <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1-ED*, <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1-KER*, <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1-ΔWHD we did not detect the supercoiled form I. This indicates that these mutants cannot promote nucleosome assembly (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref></bold>). When we used the <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1-PIP* mutant, we did not detect supercoiling on labeled DNA at 45 minutes, yet at 2 hours supercoiling ultimately reached levels achieved using the WT <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref></bold>, bottom, synthesized DNA). Interestingly both for 45 and 2 hours of assembly <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1-PIP* mutant yielded more supercoiling than any of the <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1-ED*, <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1-KER*, <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1-ΔWHD mutants. Thus, while mutation in the PIP motif of Pcf1 impaired chromatin assembly at a short time, when more time is given, it allows ultimately to catch up with the wild type. In contrast, none of the <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1-ED*, <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1-KER*, <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1-ΔWHD mutants could catch up, leading to a <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 complex deficient for nucleosome assembly even after longer incubation time.

<title>Association of <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 with histones impacts PCNA interaction <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>We next investigated the consequences of the four Pcf1 mutations previously characterized <italic>in vitro</italic>, on <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 function <italic>in vivo</italic> by introducing the respective mutations at the endogenous <italic>pcf1</italic> gene, a non-essential gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dohke et al. 2008</xref>).

<p>We first tested PCNA−Pcf1 interaction by co-immunoprecipitation of FLAG-Pcf1 and found that Pcf1-ΔWHD showed a similar PCNA interaction than <italic>WT</italic> Pcf1 (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a-b</xref></bold> and <bold>Figure S6b</bold>).

Surprisingly, we found that Pcf1-ED* binds eight times more to PCNA than the <italic>WT</italic> Pcf1 (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a-b</xref></bold>) although the corresponding <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1-ED* bound PCNA with or without DNA <italic>in vitro</italic>, similarly to <italic>WT</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></bold>, <bold>Figure S4d</bold>).

<p>We next analyzed the ability of CAF-1 mutated forms to form foci during S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Pietrobon et al. 2014</xref>). Since previously reported GFP-tagged forms of Pcf1 are not fully functional, we made use of cells expressing Pcf2-GFP, a functional tagged form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hardy et al. 2019</xref>) (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6c</xref></bold>). As expected, Pcf2-GFP formed discrete foci during the bulk of S-phase (in bi-nucleated cells with septum) but not during G2 phase (mono-nucleated cells) in a Pcf1-dependent manner (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6c-d</xref> and S6c)</bold>. The <italic>pcf1-ΔWHD</italic> mutation behaved like the <italic>WT</italic> in this assay whereas, S-phase Pcf2 foci were undetectable when Pcf1−PCNA interaction is impaired (in <italic>pcf1-KER*</italic> and <italic>pcf1-PIP</italic>* (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6c</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref></bold>).

<title>The WHD domain specifies CAF-1 function in distinct cellular processes</title>
<p>In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, CAF-1 is involved in the replication-coupled maintenance of heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dohke et al. 2008</xref>). We employed a strain in which <italic>ura4<sup>+</sup></italic> is inserted at the peri-centromeric heterochromatin of the chromosome I (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7a</xref></bold>, top panel). The expression of <italic>ura4</italic> is repressed by the surrounding heterochromatin resulting in a poor growth on uracil-depleted media and resistance to 5-fluoro-orotic acid (5FOA) (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7a</xref></bold>, bottom panel). As previously reported, the deletion of <italic>pcf1</italic> resulted in a better cell growth on uracil-depleted media compared to <italic>WT</italic> cells, showing that the heterochromatin is not properly maintained, leading to the derepression of <italic>ura4<sup>+</sup></italic>. All mutants, excepted <italic>pcf1-ΔWHD</italic>, exhibited defects in <italic>ura4</italic> silencing, similar to the one observed in the null mutant. This shows that the inability to interact with histone, PCNA and DNA results in a complete lack of CAF-1 function in maintaining heterochromatin. Interestingly, the WHD domain, while required for chromatin assembly <italic>in vitro</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref></bold>), is dispensable for the maintenance of heterochromatin. We thus investigated further the role of this domain.</p>

<p>We analyzed the accumulation of Rad52-GFP foci as a readout of global accumulation of DNA damage (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7b</xref></bold>). The deletion of <italic>pcf1</italic> led to a modest but significant increase in the frequency of cells showing Rad52-GFP foci. A similar effect was observed in <italic>pcf1-ED*</italic> mutated cells, while the presence of a CAF-1 complex unable to interact with PCNA resulted in a greater increase (in <italic>pcf1-PIP*</italic> and <italic>pcf1-KER*</italic> mutants). In contrast, no significant increase was observed in <italic>pcf1-ΔWHD</italic> cells. Thus, both CAF-1 interaction with histone and PCNA prevent the accumulation of DNA damage, but histone deposition is not absolutely required.</p>
<p>The deletion of <italic>pcf1</italic> is synthetic lethal with the deletion of <italic>hip1</italic>, the gene encoding one subunit of the fission yeast HIRA complex(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hardy et al. 2019</xref>), indicating that in the absence of replication-coupled histone deposition by CAF-1, cell viability relies on H3−H4 deposition by HIRA as suggested in human and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kaufman et al. 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Krawitz et al. 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ray-Gallet et al. 2011</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present work, we provide a comprehensive and dynamic view of key structural features of the histone chaperone CAF-1 from <italic>S. pombe</italic>. Despite the low sequence conservation between orthologues of the large subunit of CAF-1 (<bold>Figure S1a</bold>), Pcf1 from <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 mediates the heterotrimer complex that binds dimeric histones H3−H4, as does <italic>Sc</italic>CAF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kaufman et al. 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Liu et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mattiroli et al. 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sauer et al. 2017</xref>). Using AlphaFold2, we propose a structural model of the <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1, fully supported by our experimental data (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, Figure S1)</bold>). This structure defines the 2BD and 3BD regions in Pcf1 as involved in the binding of Pcf2 and Pcf3, respectively. This matches remarkably the corresponding segments identified by HDX in <italic>Sc</italic>CAF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mattiroli et al. 2017</xref>). In line with previous observations in <italic>Hs</italic>CAF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kaufman et al. 1995</xref>) and <italic>Sc</italic>CAF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Liu et al. 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mattiroli et al. 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mattiroli et al. 2017</xref>), the ED domain of <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 is crucial for histone binding (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref></bold>). Mainly disordered in the free chaperone, we show that this domain folds upon histone binding, promoting a conformational change with increased accessibility of the KER domain (<bold>Figure S1</bold>). <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 binds dsDNA longer than 40bp in the micromolar affinity range (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, Figure S3</bold>) through the KER domain forming a long monomeric helix with a positively charged face. Interestingly, the helix length roughly corresponds to the size of 40bp dsDNA, suggesting that it could lie on DNA and act as a DNA ruler to sense free DNA for histone deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sauer et al. 2017</xref>, Gopinathan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Nair et al. 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Rosas et al. 2023</xref>). Together, our findings highlight the conservation of CAF-1 properties in histone deposition mechanism <italic>in vitro</italic>, and thus unifies the current model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sauer et al. 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>This work revealed strong interdependency between histone deposition by CAF-1 and its association with PCNA. The PIP* mutation did not compromise DNA binding of <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<bold>Figure S4</bold>). Conversely, upon interaction with DNA, <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 interacted tighter with PCNA (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></bold>), consistently with a recent study in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Rouillon et al. 2023</xref>). We show that <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1-PIP* is still able to assemble histones <italic>in vitro</italic>, although slower than WT-<italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1. In contrast, <italic>in vivo</italic>, <italic>pcf1-PIP*</italic> phenocopy the deletion of <italic>pcf1</italic>. From these results, we conclude that the binding of <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 to PCNA though the PIP motif is required for <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 functions <italic>in vivo</italic>, by allowing its recruitment and efficient histone deposition at DNA synthesis sites.</p>
<p><italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1-ED* showed a stronger interaction with PCNA than WT-<italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 <italic>in vivo</italic>, and formed more abundant and intense foci during S-phase. (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref></bold>). This default may not result from a direct competition between PCNA and histones for CAF-1 association since <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1-ED* and WT-<italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 show similar interaction with DNA and PCNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, Figure S4</bold>). In human cells lacking new histones, PCNA accumulates on newly synthetized DNA, and PCNA unloading has recently linked to histone deposition in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Mejlvang et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Janke et al. 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Thakar et al. 2020</xref>). We propose that the accumulation of CAF-1 at replication foci in the ED* mutant may reflect PCNA recycling defects. This cannot be attributed to the inability of <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1-ED* to deposit histones otherwise we should have observed the same accumulation for <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1-ΔWHD also defective for histone deposition. The ED* mutation could rater interfere with other interactions, or with <underline>P</underline>ost-<underline>T</underline>ranslational <underline>M</underline>odifications (PTMs) contributing to recycle PCNA.</p>
<p>Deletion of the WHD domain allowed separating <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 functions in chromatin assembly, heterochromatin maintenance and the prevention of DNA damage. Unlike <italic>Sc</italic>CAF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Liu et al. 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zhang et al. 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mattiroli et al. 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mattiroli et al. 2017</xref>) and <italic>Hs</italic>CAF-1<sup>28</sup>, Pcf1_WHD did not bind DNA nor the ED domain (which remains fully disordered) in the free chaperone. Nevertheless, on the NMR spectra of the free and histone bound <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1(<sup>15</sup>N-Pcf1), the resonances of the isolated WHD domain are not present (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>, S3n</bold>), in agreement with a restricted movement of this domain that could likely interacts with other folded parts of the complex. <italic>In vitro</italic>, we found no impact of the WHD deletion on CAF-1 interaction with DNA, histones or PCNA, but the <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1-ΔWHD was deficient for histone deposition. Thus, the synthetic lethality of this mutant with <italic>hip1</italic> most likely reflects a replication-coupled assembly defect. Unexpectedly, this defect does not cause a problem of heterochromatin maintenance or damage accumulation, showing that the multiple functions of CAF-1 in replication-dependent nucleosome assembly, genome stability and heterochromatin maintenance can be uncoupled thanks to the WHD domain contributing to specify CAF-1 functions. Further investigations will be necessary to understand the role of this domain.</p>
<p>We reveal that disorder is a fundamental feature of Pcf1 supporting its molecular functions. First, the ED domain is disordered in the FL complex and folds upon histone binding. Second, four IDRs demarcate specific domains within Pcf1. We believe that these unfolded regions provide unique ‘plasticity’ properties to Pcf1 allowing these domains to bind concomitantly their multiple specific partners (Pcf1, Pcf3, PCNA, DNA and histones). We also reveal that although these domains individually bind their specific partners, there is an important crosstalk between them as exemplified by the fact that DNA stabilizes the CAF-1−PCNA interaction. Such plasticity and cross-talks provided by structurally disordered domains might be key for the multivalent CAF-1 functions. Human CAF-1 has been reported to form nuclear bodies with liquid-liquid phase separation properties to maintain HIV latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ma et al. 2021</xref>). This raises the question of a potential role of the disordered domains of Pcf1, together with other replisome factor harbouring such disordered regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bedina 2013</xref>), in promoting phase separation of replication factories, if such phenomenon happens <italic>in vivo</italic>. Further studies will be needed to tackle these questions.</p>

These sequences were used as input of mmseqs2 homology search program(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Steinegger and Soding 2017</xref>) used with three iterations to generate a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) against the uniref30_2103 database(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mirdita et al. 2022</xref>). The resulting alignments were filtered using hhfilter(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Steinegger et al. 2019</xref>) using parameters (‘id’=100, ‘qid’=25, ‘cov’=50) and the taxonomy assigned to every sequence keeping only one sequence per species. To increase the number of sequences in the alignment of <italic>S. pombe</italic> Pcf1 we independently generated MSA using mmseqs2 starting from the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> or the human homolog of Pcf1 (Q12495 and Q13111, respectively) and the resulting alignments were combined with the one of <italic>Sp</italic>Pcf1. Full-length sequences in the alignments were then retrieved and the sequences were realigned using MAFFT(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Katoh and Standley 2013</xref>) with the default FFT-NS-2 protocol. To build the so-called mixed co-alignments, sequences in the alignment of individual partners were paired according to their assigned species and left unpaired in case no common species were found(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mirdita et al. 2022</xref>). A first global model with full-length Pcf1, Pcf2 and Pcf3 was generated to map the regions of Pcf1 binding to Pcf2 and Pcf3 and to obtain the pLDDT scores shown in <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref></bold> for Pcf1, <bold>Figure S1g</bold> for Pcf2 and Pcf3. Next, three models of the complex corresponding to independent modules of the complex were generated using different delimitations: model_1 (presented in <bold>Figure S1h-j</bold>) with Pcf1(403-450)-Pcf2(1-453) (MSA with 2180 species, 501 positions), model_2 (presented in <bold>Figure S1k-m</bold>) with Pcf1(200-335)-Pcf3(1-408) (MSA with 2148 species, 544 positions), model_3 Pcf1(352-383)-H3(60-136)-H4(25-103) (presented in <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2f</xref> and S2d</bold>) (MSA with 3530 species, 188 positions).

<title>Standard yeast genetics</title>
<p>Yeast strains were freshly thawed from frozen stocks and grown at 30 °C using standard yeast genetics practices. All <italic><underline>pcf1</underline></italic> mutants were obtained using a two-step transformation approach in which the region of interest of the coding sequence was first replaced by the ura4<sup>+</sup> marker and then by synthetic DNA containing the appropriated mutations. Therefore, all mutations are marker-free and were followed in genetic analysis by PCR and sequencing.. Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Supplementary <bold>Table S2</bold>. For tetrad analysis, the genotypes of viable spores were deduced by checking for resistance to Kanamycin (deletion) and sequencing, which made it possible to deduce the genotype of dead spores for each tetrad. At least 18 tetrads were analyzed for each cross.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper makes important contributions to the structural analysis of the DNA replication-linked nucleosome assembly machine termed Chromatin Assembly Factor-1 (CAF-1). The authors focus on the interplay of domains that bind DNA, histones and replication clamp protein PCNA.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors analyze soluble complexes containing full-length versions of all three fission yeast CAF-1 subunits, an important accomplishment given that many previous structural and biophysical studies have focused on truncated complexes. New data here supports previous experiments indicating that the KER domain is a long alpha helix that binds DNA. Via NMR, the authors discover structural changes at the histone binding site, defined here with high resolution. Most strikingly, the experiments here show that for the S. pombe CAF-1 complex, that the WHD domain at the C-terminus of the large subunit lacks DNA binding activity observed in the human and budding yeast homologs, indicating a surprising divergence in the evolution of this complex. Together, these are important contributions to the understanding of how the CAF-1 complex works.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
1. Given the strong structural predication about the roles of residues L359 and F380 (Fig. 2f), mutation of these residues would be the definitive test of their contribution to histone binding.</p>
<p>2. Could it be that the apparent lack of histone deposition by the delta-WHD mutant complex occurs because this mutant complex is unstable when added to the Xenopus extract?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors describe the structure-functional relationship of domains in S. pombe CAF-1, which promotes DNA replication-coupled deposition of histone H3-H4 dimer. The authors nicely showed that the ED domain with an intrinsically disordered structure binds to histone H3-H4, that the KER domain binds to DNA and that, in addition to a PIP box, the KER domain also contributes to the PCNA binding. The ED and KER domains as well as the WHD domain are essential for nucleosome assembly in vitro. The ED, KER domains and the PIP box are important for the maintenance of heterochromatin.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The combination of structural analysis using NMR and Alphafold2 modeling with biophysical and biochemical analysis provided strong evidence on the role of the different domain structures of the large subunit of SpCAF-1, spPCF-1 in the binding to histone H3-H4, DNA as well as PCNA. The conclusion was further supported by genetic analysis of the various pcf1 mutants. The large amounts of data provided in the paper support the authors' conclusion very well.</p>

<p>Summary: The study conducted by Ouasti et al. is an elegant investigation of fission yeast CAF-1, employing a diverse array of technologies and genetic alterations to dissect its functions and their interdependence. These functions play a critical role in specifying interactions vital for DNA replication, heterochromatin maintenance, and DNA damage repair, and their dynamics involve multiple interactions. The authors have extensively utilized various in vitro and in vivo tools to validate their model and emphasize the dynamic nature of this complex.</p>
<p>Strengths: Their work is supported by robust experimental data from multiple techniques, including NMR and SAXS, which validate their molecular model. They conducted in vitro interactions using EMSA and isothermal microcalorimetry, in vitro histone deposition using Xenopus high-speed egg extract, and systematically generated and tested various genetic mutants for functionality in in vivo assays. They successfully delineated domain-specific functions using in vitro assays and could validate their roles to large extent using genetic mutants. One significant revelation from this study is the unfolded nature of the acidic domain, observed to fold when binding to histones. Additionally, the authors also elucidated the role of the long KER helix in mediating DNA binding and enhancing the association of CAF-1 with PCNA. The paper effectively addresses its primary objective.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: A few relatively minor unresolved aspects persist, which, if clarified or experimentally addressed by the authors, could further bolster the study.</p>
<p>
1. The precise function of the WHD domain remains elusive. Its deletion does not result in DNA damage accumulation or defects in heterochromatin maintenance. This raises questions about the biological significance of this domain and whether it is dispensable. While in vitro assays revealed defects in chromatin assembly using this mutant (Figure 5), confirming these phenotypes through in vivo assays would provide additional assurance that the lack of function is not simply due to the in vitro system lacking PTMs or other regulatory factors.</p>

The observation of increased Pcf2-gfp foci in pcf1-ED* cells, particularly in mono-nucleated (G2-phase) and bi-nucleated cells with septum marks (S-phase), might suggest the presence of replication stress. This could imply incomplete replication in specific regions, leading to the persistence of Caf1-ED*-PCNA factories throughout the cell cycle. To further confirm this, detecting accumulated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) regions outside of S-phase using RPA as an ssDNA marker could be informative.</p>
<p>
3. Moreover, considering the authors' strong assertion of histone binding defects in ED* through in vitro assays (Figure 2d and S2a), these claims could be further substantiated, especially considering that some degree of histone deposition might still persist in vivo in the ED* mutant (Figure 7d, viable though growth defective double ED*+hip1D mutants). For example, the approach, akin to the one employed in Fig. 6a (FLAG-IPs of various Pcf1-FLAG-tagged mutants), could also enable a comparison of the association of different mutants with histones and PCNA, providing a more thorough validation of their findings.</p>
<p>
4. It would be valuable for the authors to speculate on the necessity of having disordered regions in CAF1. Specifically, exploring the overall distribution of these domains within disordered/unfolded structures could provide insightful perspectives. Additionally, it's intriguing to note that the significant disparities observed among mutants (ED*, PIP*, and KER*) in in vitro assays seem to become more generic in vivo, except for the indispensability of the WHD-domain. Could these disordered regions potentially play a crucial role in the phase separation of replication factories? Considering these questions could offer valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms at play.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<p>We thank the three reviewers and the reviewing editor for their positive evaluation of our manuscript. We particularly appreciate that they unanimously consider our work as “important contributions to the understanding of how the CAF-1 complex works”, “The large amounts of data provided in the paper support the authors' conclusion very well” and “The paper effectively addresses its primary objective and is strong”. We also thank them for a careful reading and useful comments to improve the manuscript. We have built on these comments to provide an improved version of the manuscript, and address them point by point below
.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper makes important contributions to the structural analysis of the DNA replication-linked nucleosome assembly machine termed Chromatin Assembly Factor-1 (CAF-1). The authors focus on the interplay of domains that bind DNA, histones, and replication clamp protein PCNA.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors analyze soluble complexes containing full-length versions of all three fission yeast CAF-1 subunits, an important accomplishment given that many previous structural and biophysical studies have focused on truncated complexes. New data here supports previous experiments indicating that the KER domain is a long alpha helix that binds DNA. Via NMR, the authors discover structural changes at the histone binding site, defined here with high resolution. Most strikingly, the experiments here show that for the S. pombe CAF-1 complex, the WHD domain at the C-terminus of the large subunit lacks DNA binding activity observed in the human and budding yeast homologs, indicating a surprising divergence in the evolution of this complex. Together, these are important contributions to the understanding of how the CAF-1 complex works.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. There are some aspects of the experimentation that are incompletely described:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for his/her careful reading of the manuscript. Indeed, we plotted two curves in Figure S1C in a color that does not match the legend, leading to confusion. Curve 1, Pcf1 alone, depicted in red, should appear in pink as indicated in the legend and in the SDS-PAGE analysis below. Curve 1 exhibits two peaks, labeled as 1a and 1b. With an elution volume of 8.5mL close to the dead volume of the column, peak 1a corresponds to soluble oligomers, while peak 1b (10.4mL) likely corresponds to monomeric Pcf1. Curve 5 (Pcf1 + Pcf2 mixture) was in pink instead of purple as indicated in the legend. This curve consists of three distinct peaks (5a, 5b, and 5c). The SDS-PAGE analysis revealed the presence of oligomers of Pcf1-Pcf2 (5a, 8.3mL), the Pcf1-Pcf2 complex (5b, 9.8mL), and Pcf2 alone (5c, 13.6 mL).</p>
<p>The color has now been corrected in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>More importantly, was a particular SEC peak of the three-subunit CAF-1 complex (i.e. 4a or 4b) characterized in the further experimentation, or were the data obtained from the input material prior to the separation of the different peaks? If the latter, how might this have affected the results? Do the forms inter-convert spontaneously?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We conducted all structural analyses and DNA/PCNA interactions Figures (1-4, S1-S4) with freshly SECpurified samples corresponding to the 4b peak (9.7mL). Aliquots were flash-frozen with 50% glycerol for in vitro histone assembly assays (Figure 5).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Given the strong structural predication about the roles of residues L359 and F380 (Fig. 2f), these should be mutated to determine effects on histone binding.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are pleased that our structural predictions are considered as strong. We agree that investigating the role of the L359 and F380 residues will be critical to further refine the binding interface between histone H3-H4 and CAF-1. An in vitro and in vivo analysis of such mutated forms, alongside the current Pcf1-ED mutant characterized in this article and additional potential mutated forms, has the potential to provide a better understanding of the dynamic of histone deposition by CAF-1. However, these additional approaches would require to reach another step in breaking this enigmatic dynamic.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Could it be that the apparent lack of histone deposition by the delta-WHD mutant complex occurs because this mutant complex is unstable when added to the Xenopus extract?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We cannot formally exclude this possibility, and this could potentially applies to all mutated forms tested. However, in the absence of available antibodies against the fission yeast CAF-1 complex, we cannot test this hypothesis for technical reasons. Nevertheless, we feel reassured by the fact that the in vitro assays of nucleosome assembly are overall consistent with the in vivo assays. Indeed, all mutated forms tested that abolished or weakened nucleosome assembly also exhibited synthetic lethality/growth defect in the absence of a functional HIRA pathway, including the delta WHD mutated form. This genetic synergy, that reflects a defective histone deposition by CAF-1, is not specific to the fission yeast S. pombe and was previously reported in S. cerevisiae (Kaufman et al. MCB 1998; Krawitz et al. MCB 2002). This further supports the evolutionary conservation based on genetic assay as a read out for defective histone deposition by CAF-1.</p>

<p>The molecular weight was estimated using the correlation volume (Vc) defined by (Rambo &amp; Tainer, Nature 2013, 496, 477-481). The estimated error with this method is around 10%. We added this information together with supporting arguments for the existence of flexibility: “An experimental molecular weight of 179 kDa was calculated using Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS). Assuming an accuracy of around 10% with this method (Rambo and Tainer 2013), this value is consistent with a 1:1:1 stoichiometry for the CAF-1 complex (calculated MW 167kDa) (Figure S1e). In addition, the position of the maximum for the dimensionless Kratky plot was slightly shifted to higher values in the y and x axis compared to the position of the expected maximum of the curve for a fully globular protein (Figure S1f).</p>
<p>This shows that the complex was globular with a significant flexibility.”</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors describe the structure-functional relationship of domains in S. pombe CAF-1, which promotes DNA replication-coupled deposition of histone H3-H4 dimer. The authors nicely showed that the ED domain with an intrinsically disordered structure binds to histone H3-H4, that the KER domain binds to DNA, and that, in addition to a PIP box, the KER domain also contributes to the PCNA binding. The ED and KER domains as well as the WHD domain are essential for nucleosome assembly in vitro. The ED, KER domains, and the PIP box are important for the maintenance of heterochromatin.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The combination of structural analysis using NMR and Alphafold2 modeling with biophysical and biochemical analysis provided strong evidence on the role of the different domain structures of the large subunit of SpCAF-1, spPCF-1 in the binding to histone H3-H4, DNA as well as PCNA. The conclusion was further supported by genetic analysis of the various pcf1 mutants. The large amounts of data provided in the paper support the authors' conclusion very well.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The paper by Ochesenbein describes the structural and functional analysis of S. pombe CAF-1 complex critical for DNA replication-coupled histone H3/H4 deposition. By using structural, biophysical, and biochemical analyses combined with genetic methods, the authors nicely showed that a large subunit of SpCAF1, SpPCF-1, consists of 5 structured domains with four connecting IDR domains. The ED domain with IDR nature binds to histone H3-H4 dimer with the conformational change of the other domain(s). SpCAF-1 binds to dsDNA by using the KER domain, but not the WHD domain. The experiments have been done with great care and a large amount of the data are highly reliable. Moreover, the results are clearly presented and convincingly written. The conclusion in the paper is very solid and will be useful for researchers who work in the field of chromosome biology.</p>
<p>Major points:</p>
<p>1. DNA binding of the KER mutant shown in Figures S3h and S3i, which was measured by the EMSA, looks similar to that of wild-type control in Figure S3f, which is different from the data in Figures 3b and 3e measured by the MST. The authors need a more precise description of the EMSA result of the KER mutant shown in Figures 3 and S3. The quantification of the EMSA result would resolve the point (should be provided).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A proposed by this reviewer, we performed quantification of all EMSA presented in Figure 3 and Figure S3. We quantified the signal of the free DNA band to calculate a percentage of bound DNA in each condition. All EMSA experiments were conducted in duplicate, allowing us to calculate an average value and standard deviation for each interaction. Representative curves and fitted values are reported below in the figure provided for the reviewer (panel a data for Pcf1_KER domain with two fitting models, panel b for the entire CAF-1 complexes and mutants, panel c for the isolated Pcf1_KER domains), all fitted values in panel d. Importantly, as illustrated in panel a, the complete model for a single interaction (complete KD model, dashed line curve) does not adequately fit the data. In contrast, a function incorporating cooperativity (Hill model) better accounts for the measured data (solid line curve). Consistently, we also used the Hill model to fit the binding curves measured with the MST technique. As also specified now in the text, the Hill model allows to determine an EC50 value (concentration of protein resulting in the disappearance of half of the free DNA band intensity) and a Hill coefficient value (representing cooperativity during the interaction) for each curve.</p>
<p>We measure a value of 3.4 ± 0.4 μM for the EC50 of SpCAF-1 WT, which is higher than the value measured by MST (0.7 ± 0.1 μM). Higher values were also calculated for all mutants and isolated Pcf1_KER domains compared to MST. These discrepancies could raise from the fact that the DNA concentration used in the two techniques were very different (20nM for MST experiments and 1μM for EMSA). Unlike the complete KD model, which includes in the calculation the DNA concentration (considered here as the &quot;receptor&quot;), the Hill model is fitted independently of this value. This model assumes that the “receptor” concentration is low compared to the KD. Here we calculate EC50 values on the same order of magnitude as the DNA concentration (low micromolar), The quantification obtained by EMSA is thus challenging to interpret. In contrast, values fitted by the MST measurements are more reliable since this limitation of low “receptor” concentration is correct.</p>
<p>Therefore, although measurements of EC50 and Hill coefficient from EMSA are reproducible, they may be confusing for quantifying apparent affinity values through EC50. Nevertheless, this quantitative analysis of EMSA, requested by the reviewer, has highlighted an interesting characteristic of the KER* mutant that is consistent across both methods: even though the EMSA pointed by the reviewer (Figures S3h and S3i compared to the wild-type control in Figure 3d and Figure S3f) show similar EC50 values, the binding cooperativity is different. Binding curves for the KER* mutants is no longer cooperative (Hill coefficient ~1), and this is observed for all KER* curves (isolated Pcf1_KER domain and the entire SpCAF-1 complex) with both methods, EMSA and MST. We thus decided to emphasize this characteristic of the KER* mutant in the text (page 9 line 30-32). “Importantly, this mutant also shows a lower binding cooperativity for DNA binding, as estimated by the Hill coefficient value close to 1, compared to values around 3 for the WT and other mutants.”</p>
<p>Since EMSA quantifications did not show a loss of “affinity” (as measured by the EC50 value) for the KER* mutants, compared to the WT contrary to MST measurements and because the DNA concentration was close to the measured EC50, we consider that EC50 values calculated by EMSA do not represent a KD value. If we add this quantification, we should discuss this point in detail. Thus, for sake of clarity, we prefer to put in the manuscript EMSA measurements as illustrations and qualitative validations of the interaction but not to include the quantification.</p>

<p>1. As with the cooperative DNA binding of CAF-1, it is very important to show the stoichiometry of CAF-1 to the DNA or the site size. Given a long alpha-helix of the KER domain with biased charges, it is also interesting to show a model of how the dsDNA binds to the long helix with a cooperative binding property (this is not essential but would be helpful if the authors discuss it).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that having a molecular model for the binding of the KER helix to DNA would be especially interesting, but at this point, considering the accuracy of the tools currently at our disposal for predicting DNA-protein interactions, such a model would remain highly speculative.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Figure 5 shows nucleosome assembly by SpCAF-1. SpCAF-1-PIP* mutant produced a product with faster mobility than the control at 2 h incubation. How much amounts of SpCAF-1 was added in the reaction seems to be critical. At least a few different concentrations of proteins should be tested.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The slightly faster migration of the SpCAF-1-PIP<italic>is not systematically reproduced and we observed in several experiments that the band corresponding to supercoiled DNA migrated slightly above or below the one for the complementation by the SpCAF-1-WT (see Author response image 2 below). Thus this indicates that after 2 hours incubation the supercoiling assay with the SpCAF-1-PIP</italic> mutant compared to those achieved with the SpCAF-1-WT. To further document whether the WT or the PIP mutant are similar or not, we monitored difference of their nucleosome assembly efficiency by testing their ability to produce supercoiled DNA over shorter time, after 45 minute incubation. Under these conditions, we reproducibly detected supercoiled forms at earlier times with SpCAF-1-WT when compared to the SpCAF-1-PIP* (see figure 5 and Author response image 2). These observations indicate that mutation in the PIP motif of Pcf1 affects the rate of supercoiling in a distinct manner when compared to the other mutations that dramatically impair SpCAF-1 capacity to promote supercoiling.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study conducted by Ouasti et al. is an elegant investigation of fission yeast CAF-1, employing a diverse array of technologies to dissect its functions and their interdependence. These functions play a critical role in specifying interactions vital for DNA replication, heterochromatin maintenance, and DNA damage repair, and their dynamics involve multiple interactions. The authors have extensively utilized various in vitro and in vivo tools to validate their model and emphasize the dynamic nature of this complex.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Their work is supported by robust experimental data from multiple techniques, including NMR and SAXS, which validate their molecular model. They conducted in vitro interactions using EMSA and isothermal microcalorimetry, in vitro histone deposition using Xenopus high-speed egg extract, and systematically generated and tested various genetic mutants for functionality in in vivo assays. They successfully delineated domain-specific functions using in vitro assays and could validate their roles to large extent using genetic mutants. One significant revelation from this study is the unfolded nature of the acidic domain, observed to fold when binding to histones. Additionally, the authors also elucidated the role of the long KER helix in mediating DNA binding and enhancing the association of CAF-1 with PCNA. The paper effectively addresses its primary objective and is strong.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A few relatively minor unresolved aspects persist, which, if clarified or experimentally addressed by the authors, could further bolster the study.</p>
<p>1. The precise function of the WHD domain remains elusive. Its deletion does not result in DNA damage accumulation or defects in heterochromatin maintenance. This raises questions about the biological significance of this domain and whether it is dispensable. While in vitro assays revealed defects in chromatin assembly using this mutant (Figure 5), confirming these phenotypes through in vivo assays would provide additional assurance that the lack of function is not simply due to the in vitro system lacking PTMs or other regulatory factors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our work demonstrates that the WHD domain is important CAF-1 function during DNA replication. Indeed, the deletion of this domain lead to a synthetic lethality when combined with mutation of the HIRA complex, as observed for a null pcf1 mutant, indicating a severe loss of function in the absence of the WHD domain. We propose that these genetic interactions, previously reported in S. cerevisiae (Kaufman et al. MCB 1998; Krawitz et al. MCB 2002) are indicative of a defective histone deposition by CAF-1. Moreover, our work establishes that this domain is dispensable to prevent DNA damage accumulation and to maintain silencing at centromeric heterochromatin, indicating that the WHD domain specifies CAF-1 functions. Moreover, our work further demonstrates that, in contrast to the S. cerevisiae and human WHD domain, the S. pombe counterpart exhibits no DNA binding activity. We thus agree that the WHD domain may contribute to nucleosome assembly in vivo via PTMs or interactions with regulatory factors that may potentially lack in in vitro systems. However, addressing these aspects deserves further investigations beyond the scope of this article.</p>

<p>1. The observation of increased Pcf2-gfp foci in pcf1-ED* cells, particularly in mono-nucleated (G2phase) and bi-nucleated cells with septum marks (S-phase), might suggest the presence of replication stress. This could imply incomplete replication in specific regions, leading to the persistence of Caf1-ED*-PCNA factories throughout the cell cycle. To further confirm this, detecting accumulated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) regions outside of S-phase using RPA as an ssDNA marker could be informative.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We cannot formally exclude that cells expressing the Pcf1-ED mutated form exhibit incomplete replication in specific regions, an aspect that would require careful investigations. However, the microscopy analysis (Fig. 6c and S6c) of this mutant showed no alteration in the cell morphology, including the absence of elongated cells compared to wild type, a hallmark of checkpoint activation caused by ssDNA (Enoch et al. Gene &amp; Dev 1992). Therefore, investigating the consequences of the interplay between the binding of CAF-1 to PCNA and histones on the dynamic of DNA replication, is of particular interest but out of the scope of the current manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Moreover, considering the authors' strong assertion of histone binding defects in ED* through in vitro assays (Figure 2d and S2a), these claims could be further substantiated, especially considering that some degree of histone deposition might still persist in vivo in the ED* mutant (Figure 7d, viable though growth defective double ED*+hip1D mutants). For example, the approach, akin to the one employed in Fig. 6a (FLAG-IPs of various Pcf1-FLAG-tagged mutants), could also enable a comparison of the association of different mutants with histones and PCNA, providing a more thorough validation of their findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have provided in the current manuscript data establishing how Pcf1 mutated forms interacted with PCNA (Fig. 6a, 6b). Regarding the interactions with histone H3-H4, the approach based on immunoprecipitation using various Pcf1-FLAG tagged mutants has been unsuccessful in our hands. Indeed, we were unable to obtain robust and reproducible interactions between Pcf1 or  its various mutated form with H3-H4. This is likely because Co-IP approaches do not probe for direct interactions. Indirect interactions between Pcf1 and H3-H4 are potentially bridged by additional factors, including the two other subunits of CAF-1, Pcf2 and Pcf3, or Asf1. Therefore, we are not in a position to address in vivo the direct interactions between Pcf1 and histone H3-H4.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. It would be valuable for the authors to speculate on the necessity of having disordered regions in CAF1. Specifically, exploring the overall distribution of these domains within disordered/unfolded structures could provide insightful perspectives. Additionally, it's intriguing to note that the significant disparities observed among mutants (ED<italic>, PIP</italic>, and KER*) in in vitro assays seem to become more generic in vivo, except for the indispensability of the WHD-domain. Could these disordered regions potentially play a crucial role in the phase separation of replication factories? Considering these questions could offer valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms at play.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the potential mechanistic role of partial disorder in CAF-1 is particularly interesting. Disordered regions of human CAF-1 have been reported to form nuclear bodies with liquid-liquid phase separation properties to maintain HIV latency (Ma et al EMBO J. 2021). As suggested, this raises the question of how disordered domains of Pcf1 could promote phase separation for replication factories, if such phenomenon happens in vivo. Moreover, numerous factors of the replisome also harbor disordered regions (Bedina, A. et al, 2013. Intrinsically Disordered Proteins in Replication Process. InTech. doi:
10.5772/51673), adding complexity in disentangling experimentally such questions. We have added these elements at the end of the discussion in the revised manuscript (page 20, lines 23-29). “Such plasticity and cross-talks provided by structurally disordered domains might be key for the multivalent CAF-1 functions. Human CAF-1 has been reported to form nuclear bodies with liquid-liquid phase separation properties to maintain HIV latency (Ma et al. 2021). This raises the question of a potential role of the disordered domains of Pcf1, together with other replisome factor harbouring such disordered regions (Bedina 2013), in promoting phase separation of replication factories, if such phenomenon happens in vivo. Further studies will be needed to tackle these questions.”</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<p>We thank the three reviewers and the reviewing editor for their positive evaluation of our manuscript. We particularly appreciate that they unanimously consider our work as “important contributions to the understanding of how the CAF-1 complex works”, “The large amounts of data provided in the paper support the authors' conclusion very well” and “The paper effectively addresses its primary objective and is strong”. We also thank them for a careful reading and useful comments to improve the manuscript. We have built on these comments to provide an improved version of the manuscript, and address them point by point below
.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper makes important contributions to the structural analysis of the DNA replication-linked nucleosome assembly machine termed Chromatin Assembly Factor-1 (CAF-1). The authors focus on the interplay of domains that bind DNA, histones, and replication clamp protein PCNA.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors analyze soluble complexes containing full-length versions of all three fission yeast CAF-1 subunits, an important accomplishment given that many previous structural and biophysical studies have focused on truncated complexes. New data here supports previous experiments indicating that the KER domain is a long alpha helix that binds DNA. Via NMR, the authors discover structural changes at the histone binding site, defined here with high resolution. Most strikingly, the experiments here show that for the S. pombe CAF-1 complex, the WHD domain at the C-terminus of the large subunit lacks DNA binding activity observed in the human and budding yeast homologs, indicating a surprising divergence in the evolution of this complex. Together, these are important contributions to the understanding of how the CAF-1 complex works.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. There are some aspects of the experimentation that are incompletely described:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for his/her careful reading of the manuscript. Indeed, we plotted two curves in Figure S1C in a color that does not match the legend, leading to confusion. Curve 1, Pcf1 alone, depicted in red, should appear in pink as indicated in the legend and in the SDS-PAGE analysis below. Curve 1 exhibits two peaks, labeled as 1a and 1b. With an elution volume of 8.5mL close to the dead volume of the column, peak 1a corresponds to soluble oligomers, while peak 1b (10.4mL) likely corresponds to monomeric Pcf1. Curve 5 (Pcf1 + Pcf2 mixture) was in pink instead of purple as indicated in the legend. This curve consists of three distinct peaks (5a, 5b, and 5c). The SDS-PAGE analysis revealed the presence of oligomers of Pcf1-Pcf2 (5a, 8.3mL), the Pcf1-Pcf2 complex (5b, 9.8mL), and Pcf2 alone (5c, 13.6 mL).</p>
<p>The color has now been corrected in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>More importantly, was a particular SEC peak of the three-subunit CAF-1 complex (i.e. 4a or 4b) characterized in the further experimentation, or were the data obtained from the input material prior to the separation of the different peaks? If the latter, how might this have affected the results? Do the forms inter-convert spontaneously?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We conducted all structural analyses and DNA/PCNA interactions Figures (1-4, S1-S4) with freshly SECpurified samples corresponding to the 4b peak (9.7mL). Aliquots were flash-frozen with 50% glycerol for in vitro histone assembly assays (Figure 5).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Given the strong structural predication about the roles of residues L359 and F380 (Fig. 2f), these should be mutated to determine effects on histone binding.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are pleased that our structural predictions are considered as strong. We agree that investigating the role of the L359 and F380 residues will be critical to further refine the binding interface between histone H3-H4 and CAF-1. An in vitro and in vivo analysis of such mutated forms, alongside the current Pcf1-ED mutant characterized in this article and additional potential mutated forms, has the potential to provide a better understanding of the dynamic of histone deposition by CAF-1. However, these additional approaches would require to reach another step in breaking this enigmatic dynamic.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Could it be that the apparent lack of histone deposition by the delta-WHD mutant complex occurs because this mutant complex is unstable when added to the Xenopus extract?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We cannot formally exclude this possibility, and this could potentially applies to all mutated forms tested. However, in the absence of available antibodies against the fission yeast CAF-1 complex, we cannot test this hypothesis for technical reasons. Nevertheless, we feel reassured by the fact that the in vitro assays of nucleosome assembly are overall consistent with the in vivo assays. Indeed, all mutated forms tested that abolished or weakened nucleosome assembly also exhibited synthetic lethality/growth defect in the absence of a functional HIRA pathway, including the delta WHD mutated form. This genetic synergy, that reflects a defective histone deposition by CAF-1, is not specific to the fission yeast S. pombe and was previously reported in S. cerevisiae (Kaufman et al. MCB 1998; Krawitz et al. MCB 2002). This further supports the evolutionary conservation based on genetic assay as a read out for defective histone deposition by CAF-1.</p>

<p>The molecular weight was estimated using the correlation volume (Vc) defined by (Rambo &amp; Tainer, Nature 2013, 496, 477-481). The estimated error with this method is around 10%. We added this information together with supporting arguments for the existence of flexibility: “An experimental molecular weight of 179 kDa was calculated using Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS). Assuming an accuracy of around 10% with this method (Rambo and Tainer 2013), this value is consistent with a 1:1:1 stoichiometry for the CAF-1 complex (calculated MW 167kDa) (Figure S1e). In addition, the position of the maximum for the dimensionless Kratky plot was slightly shifted to higher values in the y and x axis compared to the position of the expected maximum of the curve for a fully globular protein (Figure S1f).</p>
<p>This shows that the complex was globular with a significant flexibility.”</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors describe the structure-functional relationship of domains in S. pombe CAF-1, which promotes DNA replication-coupled deposition of histone H3-H4 dimer. The authors nicely showed that the ED domain with an intrinsically disordered structure binds to histone H3-H4, that the KER domain binds to DNA, and that, in addition to a PIP box, the KER domain also contributes to the PCNA binding. The ED and KER domains as well as the WHD domain are essential for nucleosome assembly in vitro. The ED, KER domains, and the PIP box are important for the maintenance of heterochromatin.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The combination of structural analysis using NMR and Alphafold2 modeling with biophysical and biochemical analysis provided strong evidence on the role of the different domain structures of the large subunit of SpCAF-1, spPCF-1 in the binding to histone H3-H4, DNA as well as PCNA. The conclusion was further supported by genetic analysis of the various pcf1 mutants. The large amounts of data provided in the paper support the authors' conclusion very well.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The paper by Ochesenbein describes the structural and functional analysis of S. pombe CAF-1 complex critical for DNA replication-coupled histone H3/H4 deposition. By using structural, biophysical, and biochemical analyses combined with genetic methods, the authors nicely showed that a large subunit of SpCAF1, SpPCF-1, consists of 5 structured domains with four connecting IDR domains. The ED domain with IDR nature binds to histone H3-H4 dimer with the conformational change of the other domain(s). SpCAF-1 binds to dsDNA by using the KER domain, but not the WHD domain. The experiments have been done with great care and a large amount of the data are highly reliable. Moreover, the results are clearly presented and convincingly written. The conclusion in the paper is very solid and will be useful for researchers who work in the field of chromosome biology.</p>
<p>Major points:</p>
<p>1. DNA binding of the KER mutant shown in Figures S3h and S3i, which was measured by the EMSA, looks similar to that of wild-type control in Figure S3f, which is different from the data in Figures 3b and 3e measured by the MST. The authors need a more precise description of the EMSA result of the KER mutant shown in Figures 3 and S3. The quantification of the EMSA result would resolve the point (should be provided).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A proposed by this reviewer, we performed quantification of all EMSA presented in Figure 3 and Figure S3. We quantified the signal of the free DNA band to calculate a percentage of bound DNA in each condition. All EMSA experiments were conducted in duplicate, allowing us to calculate an average value and standard deviation for each interaction. Representative curves and fitted values are reported below in the figure provided for the reviewer (panel a data for Pcf1_KER domain with two fitting models, panel b for the entire CAF-1 complexes and mutants, panel c for the isolated Pcf1_KER domains), all fitted values in panel d. Importantly, as illustrated in panel a, the complete model for a single interaction (complete KD model, dashed line curve) does not adequately fit the data. In contrast, a function incorporating cooperativity (Hill model) better accounts for the measured data (solid line curve). Consistently, we also used the Hill model to fit the binding curves measured with the MST technique. As also specified now in the text, the Hill model allows to determine an EC50 value (concentration of protein resulting in the disappearance of half of the free DNA band intensity) and a Hill coefficient value (representing cooperativity during the interaction) for each curve.</p>
<p>We measure a value of 3.4 ± 0.4 μM for the EC50 of SpCAF-1 WT, which is higher than the value measured by MST (0.7 ± 0.1 μM). Higher values were also calculated for all mutants and isolated Pcf1_KER domains compared to MST. These discrepancies could raise from the fact that the DNA concentration used in the two techniques were very different (20nM for MST experiments and 1μM for EMSA). Unlike the complete KD model, which includes in the calculation the DNA concentration (considered here as the &quot;receptor&quot;), the Hill model is fitted independently of this value. This model assumes that the “receptor” concentration is low compared to the KD. Here we calculate EC50 values on the same order of magnitude as the DNA concentration (low micromolar), The quantification obtained by EMSA is thus challenging to interpret. In contrast, values fitted by the MST measurements are more reliable since this limitation of low “receptor” concentration is correct.</p>
<p>Therefore, although measurements of EC50 and Hill coefficient from EMSA are reproducible, they may be confusing for quantifying apparent affinity values through EC50. Nevertheless, this quantitative analysis of EMSA, requested by the reviewer, has highlighted an interesting characteristic of the KER* mutant that is consistent across both methods: even though the EMSA pointed by the reviewer (Figures S3h and S3i compared to the wild-type control in Figure 3d and Figure S3f) show similar EC50 values, the binding cooperativity is different. Binding curves for the KER* mutants is no longer cooperative (Hill coefficient ~1), and this is observed for all KER* curves (isolated Pcf1_KER domain and the entire SpCAF-1 complex) with both methods, EMSA and MST. We thus decided to emphasize this characteristic of the KER* mutant in the text (page 9 line 30-32). “Importantly, this mutant also shows a lower binding cooperativity for DNA binding, as estimated by the Hill coefficient value close to 1, compared to values around 3 for the WT and other mutants.”</p>
<p>Since EMSA quantifications did not show a loss of “affinity” (as measured by the EC50 value) for the KER* mutants, compared to the WT contrary to MST measurements and because the DNA concentration was close to the measured EC50, we consider that EC50 values calculated by EMSA do not represent a KD value. If we add this quantification, we should discuss this point in detail. Thus, for sake of clarity, we prefer to put in the manuscript EMSA measurements as illustrations and qualitative validations of the interaction but not to include the quantification.</p>

<p>1. As with the cooperative DNA binding of CAF-1, it is very important to show the stoichiometry of CAF-1 to the DNA or the site size. Given a long alpha-helix of the KER domain with biased charges, it is also interesting to show a model of how the dsDNA binds to the long helix with a cooperative binding property (this is not essential but would be helpful if the authors discuss it).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that having a molecular model for the binding of the KER helix to DNA would be especially interesting, but at this point, considering the accuracy of the tools currently at our disposal for predicting DNA-protein interactions, such a model would remain highly speculative.</p>

<p>1. Figure 5 shows nucleosome assembly by SpCAF-1. SpCAF-1-PIP* mutant produced a product with faster mobility than the control at 2 h incubation. How much amounts of SpCAF-1 was added in the reaction seems to be critical. At least a few different concentrations of proteins should be tested.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The slightly faster migration of the SpCAF-1-PIP<italic>is not systematically reproduced and we observed in several experiments that the band corresponding to supercoiled DNA migrated slightly above or below the one for the complementation by the SpCAF-1-WT (see Author response image 2 below). Thus this indicates that after 2 hours incubation the supercoiling assay with the SpCAF-1-PIP</italic> mutant compared to those achieved with the SpCAF-1-WT. To further document whether the WT or the PIP mutant are similar or not, we monitored difference of their nucleosome assembly efficiency by testing their ability to produce supercoiled DNA over shorter time, after 45 minute incubation. Under these conditions, we reproducibly detected supercoiled forms at earlier times with SpCAF-1-WT when compared to the SpCAF-1-PIP* (see figure 5 and Author response image 2). These observations indicate that mutation in the PIP motif of Pcf1 affects the rate of supercoiling in a distinct manner when compared to the other mutations that dramatically impair SpCAF-1 capacity to promote supercoiling.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study conducted by Ouasti et al. is an elegant investigation of fission yeast CAF-1, employing a diverse array of technologies to dissect its functions and their interdependence. These functions play a critical role in specifying interactions vital for DNA replication, heterochromatin maintenance, and DNA damage repair, and their dynamics involve multiple interactions. The authors have extensively utilized various in vitro and in vivo tools to validate their model and emphasize the dynamic nature of this complex.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Their work is supported by robust experimental data from multiple techniques, including NMR and SAXS, which validate their molecular model. They conducted in vitro interactions using EMSA and isothermal microcalorimetry, in vitro histone deposition using Xenopus high-speed egg extract, and systematically generated and tested various genetic mutants for functionality in in vivo assays. They successfully delineated domain-specific functions using in vitro assays and could validate their roles to large extent using genetic mutants. One significant revelation from this study is the unfolded nature of the acidic domain, observed to fold when binding to histones. Additionally, the authors also elucidated the role of the long KER helix in mediating DNA binding and enhancing the association of CAF-1 with PCNA. The paper effectively addresses its primary objective and is strong.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A few relatively minor unresolved aspects persist, which, if clarified or experimentally addressed by the authors, could further bolster the study.</p>
<p>1. The precise function of the WHD domain remains elusive. Its deletion does not result in DNA damage accumulation or defects in heterochromatin maintenance. This raises questions about the biological significance of this domain and whether it is dispensable. While in vitro assays revealed defects in chromatin assembly using this mutant (Figure 5), confirming these phenotypes through in vivo assays would provide additional assurance that the lack of function is not simply due to the in vitro system lacking PTMs or other regulatory factors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our work demonstrates that the WHD domain is important CAF-1 function during DNA replication. Indeed, the deletion of this domain lead to a synthetic lethality when combined with mutation of the HIRA complex, as observed for a null pcf1 mutant, indicating a severe loss of function in the absence of the WHD domain. We propose that these genetic interactions, previously reported in S. cerevisiae (Kaufman et al. MCB 1998; Krawitz et al. MCB 2002) are indicative of a defective histone deposition by CAF-1. Moreover, our work establishes that this domain is dispensable to prevent DNA damage accumulation and to maintain silencing at centromeric heterochromatin, indicating that the WHD domain specifies CAF-1 functions. Moreover, our work further demonstrates that, in contrast to the S. cerevisiae and human WHD domain, the S. pombe counterpart exhibits no DNA binding activity. We thus agree that the WHD domain may contribute to nucleosome assembly in vivo via PTMs or interactions with regulatory factors that may potentially lack in in vitro systems. However, addressing these aspects deserves further investigations beyond the scope of this article.</p>

<p>1. The observation of increased Pcf2-gfp foci in pcf1-ED* cells, particularly in mono-nucleated (G2phase) and bi-nucleated cells with septum marks (S-phase), might suggest the presence of replication stress. This could imply incomplete replication in specific regions, leading to the persistence of Caf1-ED*-PCNA factories throughout the cell cycle. To further confirm this, detecting accumulated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) regions outside of S-phase using RPA as an ssDNA marker could be informative.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We cannot formally exclude that cells expressing the Pcf1-ED mutated form exhibit incomplete replication in specific regions, an aspect that would require careful investigations. However, the microscopy analysis (Fig. 6c and S6c) of this mutant showed no alteration in the cell morphology, including the absence of elongated cells compared to wild type, a hallmark of checkpoint activation caused by ssDNA (Enoch et al. Gene &amp; Dev 1992). Therefore, investigating the consequences of the interplay between the binding of CAF-1 to PCNA and histones on the dynamic of DNA replication, is of particular interest but out of the scope of the current manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Moreover, considering the authors' strong assertion of histone binding defects in ED* through in vitro assays (Figure 2d and S2a), these claims could be further substantiated, especially considering that some degree of histone deposition might still persist in vivo in the ED* mutant (Figure 7d, viable though growth defective double ED*+hip1D mutants). For example, the approach, akin to the one employed in Fig. 6a (FLAG-IPs of various Pcf1-FLAG-tagged mutants), could also enable a comparison of the association of different mutants with histones and PCNA, providing a more thorough validation of their findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have provided in the current manuscript data establishing how Pcf1 mutated forms interacted with PCNA (Fig. 6a, 6b). Regarding the interactions with histone H3-H4, the approach based on immunoprecipitation using various Pcf1-FLAG tagged mutants has been unsuccessful in our hands. Indeed, we were unable to obtain robust and reproducible interactions between Pcf1 or  its various mutated form with H3-H4. This is likely because Co-IP approaches do not probe for direct interactions. Indirect interactions between Pcf1 and H3-H4 are potentially bridged by additional factors, including the two other subunits of CAF-1, Pcf2 and Pcf3, or Asf1. Therefore, we are not in a position to address in vivo the direct interactions between Pcf1 and histone H3-H4.</p>

<p>1. It would be valuable for the authors to speculate on the necessity of having disordered regions in CAF1. Specifically, exploring the overall distribution of these domains within disordered/unfolded structures could provide insightful perspectives. Additionally, it's intriguing to note that the significant disparities observed among mutants (ED<italic>, PIP</italic>, and KER*) in in vitro assays seem to become more generic in vivo, except for the indispensability of the WHD-domain. Could these disordered regions potentially play a crucial role in the phase separation of replication factories? Considering these questions could offer valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms at play.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the potential mechanistic role of partial disorder in CAF-1 is particularly interesting. Disordered regions of human CAF-1 have been reported to form nuclear bodies with liquid-liquid phase separation properties to maintain HIV latency (Ma et al EMBO J. 2021). As suggested, this raises the question of how disordered domains of Pcf1 could promote phase separation for replication factories, if such phenomenon happens in vivo. Moreover, numerous factors of the replisome also harbor disordered regions (Bedina, A. et al, 2013. Intrinsically Disordered Proteins in Replication Process. InTech. doi:
10.5772/51673), adding complexity in disentangling experimentally such questions. We have added these elements at the end of the discussion in the revised manuscript (page 20, lines 23-29). “Such plasticity and cross-talks provided by structurally disordered domains might be key for the multivalent CAF-1 functions. Human CAF-1 has been reported to form nuclear bodies with liquid-liquid phase separation properties to maintain HIV latency (Ma et al. 2021). This raises the question of a potential role of the disordered domains of Pcf1, together with other replisome factor harbouring such disordered regions (Bedina 2013), in promoting phase separation of replication factories, if such phenomenon happens in vivo. Further studies will be needed to tackle these questions.”</p>
