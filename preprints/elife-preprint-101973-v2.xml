<title>Abstract</title><p>Mounting evidence has demonstrated the genetic association of ORMDL3 (ORMDL Sphingolipid Biosynthesis Regulator 3) gene polymorphisms with bronchial asthma and a diverse set of inflammatory disorders. However, its role in type I interferon (IFN) signaling remains poorly defined. Herein, we report that ORMDL3 is a negative modulator of the type I IFN signaling by interacting with MAVS (Mitochondrial Antiviral Signaling protein) and subsequently promoting the proteasome-mediated degradation of RIG-I (Retinoic Acid-Inducible Gene I). Immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry (IP-MS) assays uncovered that ORMDL3 binds to USP10 (Ubiquitin-Specific Protease 10), which forms a complex with and stabilizes RIG-I through decreasing its K48-linked ubiquitination. ORMDL3 thus disrupts the interaction between USP10 and RIG-I, thereby promoting RIG-I degradation. Additionally, subcutaneous syngeneic tumor models in C57BL/6 mice revealed that inhibition of ORMDL3 enhances anti-tumor efficacy by augmenting the proportion of cytotoxic CD8 positive T cells and IFN production in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Collectively, our findings reveal the pivotal roles of ORMDL3 in maintaining antiviral innate immune responses and anti-tumor immunity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Type I interferons (IFN-Is) play a key role in the innate immune response to viral infections. Under viral stimulations, cells produce and release interferons, which induce the transcription of interferon-stimulated genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Besides their critical role in antiviral immune responses, growing evidence suggests that IFN-Is produced by malignant tumor cells or infiltrating immune cells also influence the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Many traditional chemotherapeutic drugs, targeted anti-tumor drugs, immunoadjuvants, and oncolytic viruses require intact type I IFN signaling to exert their full effects <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Furthermore, studies have shown that high intratumoral expression levels of IFN-Is or IFN-stimulated genes are associated with positive disease outcomes in cancer patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In response to viral RNA molecules, RLRs (RIG-I-like receptors) exposed its CARD domain and then cooperate with mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) and TANK-binding kinase1(TBK1) to promote the production of IFN-Is<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. TBK1 phosphorylates and activates IRF3 and IRF7, which then induce the expression of IFN-Is and various interferon-stimulated genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Thus, targeting RLRs can provoke anti-infection activities, moreover, RLRs also play an important role in anti-tumor immunity, for example, targeting RLRs can sensitize “immune-cold” tumors to become “immune hot” tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors upregulate endogenous retroviruses in tumor cells to induce the activation of the RLR-mediated RNA recognition pathway that potentiates immune checkpoint therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. SB 9200 (also known as inarigivir soproxil or GS 9992) is an orally available prodrug of a dinucleotide agonist of RIG-I and nucleotide binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> and is currently in clinical trials to treat chronically infected HCV patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Another RIG-I agonist, MK-4621, appears to be safe and well-tolerable for patients with advanced or recurrent tumors, with no dose-limiting toxicities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The post-transcriptional modifications (PTMs) of RIG-I are vital for its activation and stability. Several E3-ligases have been reported to catalyze K63- or K48-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I, regulating the RLR pathway. K63-linked ubiquitination,mediated by TRIM25<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> and Mex-3 RNA binding family member C (MEX3C) in the CARD region of RIG-I<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, or by RNF135 in the C-terminus of RIG-I<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, facilitates RLR signal transduction. In addition to K63 ubiquitination that usually associates with signal transduction pathways, classical degradative K48-linked polyubiquitylation also regulates RIG-I’s stability. Several E3 ligases such as Cbl<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, ring finger protein 122 (RNF122)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, RNF125<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> and TRIM40<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, catalyze this process. Conversely, several deubiquitylating enzymes also regulate RIG-I expression. For example, ubiquitin-specific peptidase 3 (USP3), USP21 and CYLD lysine 63 deubiquitinase (CYLD) modulate RIG-I signaling by removing K63-polyubiquitin chains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Deubiquitinase USP4 and USP15 can increase the stability of RIG-I and TRIM25 by decreasing K48 ubiquitination of them<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Discovering new proteins regulating the activity or stability of RIG-I will provide new insights and targets for antiviral and anti-tumor therapies.</p>
<p>ORMDL3 is a member of the three-gene ORDML family (ORMDL1, ORMDL2, and ORMDL3), and it is a 153-aa transmembrane protein primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Genetic variants in <italic>ORMDL3</italic> are associated with sphingolipid synthesis and altered metabolism, which contribute to asthma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Recent evidence has elucidated that ORMDL3 regulates eosinophil trafficking, recruitment, and degranulation, which may induce the formation of allergic asthma and potentially other eosinophilic disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Additionally, ORMDL3 polymorphisms also contribute to a diverse set of inflammatory disorders that include bronchial asthma, inflammatory bowel disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, ankylosing spondylitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, atherosclerosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, SLE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> and cholangitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. However, the role of ORMDL3 in innate immunity remains unknown.</p>
<p>In this study, we illuminate ORMDL3 as a pivotal negative regulator of the type I interferon (IFN) signaling pathway. ORMDL3 forms a complex with MAVS and subsequently directs RIG-I toward degradation. ORMDL3 amplifies the K48-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I by disrupting the interaction between RIG-I and USP10. Animal experiments showed that inhibiting ORMDL3 enhances anti-tumor activity, demonstrated by an augmented proportion of activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and increased interferon production within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Collectively, our results unveil the critical role of ORMDL3 in maintaining the homeostasis of antiviral innate immune responses and suggest ORMDL3 as a candidate target for cancer immunotherapy.</p>

<title>ORMDL3 negatively regulates RLR induced type I IFN signaling pathway</title>
<p>In order to investigate the potential role of ORMDL3 in the antiviral response, HEK293T cell overexpression ORMDL3 was stimulated with poly(I:C) or VSV infection. The result showed that ORMDL3 significantly inhibited poly(I:C) and VSV stimulated transcription of <italic>IFNB1</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Western blots demonstrated a marked reduction in the phosphorylation level of IRF3 when ORMDL3 was overexpressed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Ectopic expressed ORMDL3 in A549 cells attenuated <italic>IFNB1</italic> expression induced by poly(I:C) but not poly(dG:dC) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). This phenomenon was also observed in parallel experiments using primary mouse BMDM cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). These findings highlight ORMDL3 as a repressor of RNA-induced type I IFN expression. To unravel the molecular mechanism underlying the suppression of type I IFN signaling by ORMDL3, luciferase reporter assays were performed. ORMDL3 was found to decrease the luciferase reporter activity induced by RIG-I, while showing no effect on cGAS/STING or TRIF (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). The ISRE luciferase reporter assay also showed similar result (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). We constructed an ORMDL3 stable knockdown cell line of A549 to examine the role of ORMDL3 on viral replication. We found that ORMDL3 knockdown strikingly suppressed the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and overexpression ORMDL3 enhanced the replication of VSV (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). We also infected the A549 stable knockdown cell line with herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), and there is no significance between shNC and shORMDL3 cell lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). These results suggest that ORMDL3 only facilitates RNA virus replication but not DNA virus, which coincides with the finding that ORMDL3 specifically represses RNA but not DNA-induced type I interferon expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>

<p>We next evaluated the influence of VSV, HSV-1 and RIG-I agonist SB9200 on ORMDL3 expression. Given the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) site rs7216389 at ORMDL3 locus is associated with the susceptibility of childhood asthma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> and virus-induced respiratory wheezing illnesses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, we took the genotype of this SNP into account. Upon these stimulations, HSV-1 does not obviously alter the abundance of ORMDL3 (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>). For VSV and SB920, the expression of ORMDL3 is downregulated in some cell lines and is independent of the SNP (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B, S1C</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that ORMDL3 is a negative regulator of RLR RNA sensing pathway, and its expression is reciprocally repressed by this pathway.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>ORMDL3 regulates the protein abundance of RIG-I</title>
<p>Further RT-PCR results indicated that ectopic expression of ORMDL3 inhibited <italic>IFNB1</italic> mRNA expression and transcription of downstream genes <italic>CCL5</italic> and <italic>CXCL10</italic> induced by RIG-I and MAVS but not TBK1 or IRF3-5D (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>,<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2A</xref>). Additionally, MDA5-induced IFN upregulation was also inhibited by ORMDL3 (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2B</xref>). These results revealed that ORMDL3 negatively regulates RLR pathway. Owing to ORMDL3 was down-regulated in response to VSV stimulation in HEK293T, so we firstly transfected cells with siORMDL3 followed by secondary transfection with RIG-I-N (an active form of RIG-I) in HEK293T, and we found that siORMDL3 significantly increase the expression of <italic>IFNB1</italic>, <italic>CCL5</italic> and <italic>ISG54</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>) as well as the protein abundance of RIG-I (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). As ORMDL3 antibody can recognize all ORMDL family members (ORMDL1, 2 and 3), so we also detected the mRNA level of ORMDL3 to further validate knock-down efficiency (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2C</xref>). Subsequent experiments involving various signaling proteins such as RIG-I (WT/N), MDA5, TBK1, and IRF3 indicated a negative correlation between ORMDL3 levels and RIG-I/RIG-I-N protein expression, with maximal degradation observed in RIG-I-N (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). To investigate that whether ORMDL3 is unique in promoting RIG-I degradation, we compared ORMDL1, 2 and 3, when we co-expresssed RIG-I-N with them, we found that only ORMDL3 can facilitate the degradation of RIG-I-N (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2D</xref>). In addition, we also tested whether overexpressing mice Ormdl3 will also lead to mice Rig-i degradation. Interestingly we discovered that mice Rig-I and human RIG-I both can be degraded upon ORMDL3 overexpression, implying that ORMDL3’s function is conservative in human and mice (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2E,F</xref>). In addition, ORMDL3 overexpression also eliminated endogenous RIG-I protein abundance (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2G</xref>).</p>

<p>Based on these observations, we focus on the relationship between RIG-I and ORMDL3. We ectopically expressed an increasing amount of Flag-ORMDL3 with the RIG-I-N (harbors two CARD domains) and the RIG-I-C truncated form (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2H</xref>) and found that ORMDL3 only decreased the protein abundance of RIG-I-N (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). We co-transfected ORMDL3 and RIG-I with or without poly(I:C) and found that RIG-I was degraded upon the stimulation of poly(I:C), suggesting that ORMDL3 degrades RIG-I only when it was activated and the CARD domain was exposed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Further examination showed that co-expression of ORMDL3 suppressed RIG-I-N induced expression of <italic>IFNB1</italic> and <italic>CCL5</italic>, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines <italic>IL-6</italic> and <italic>TNF</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>), suggesting its role on both NF-κB and type I interferon pathways. Given the regulation of ORMDL3 on NF-κB has been reported, we focused on its role in the type I interferon pathway.</p>

<title>ORMDL3 promotes the proteasome degradation of RIG-I</title>
<p>Two major protein degradation pathways including the ubiquitin proteasome pathway and lysosoml proteolysis system. We next identified which degradation system dominantly mediates the degradation of RIG-I by ORMDL3. We co-expressed ORMDL3 and RIG-I and treated cells with proteasome inhibitor MG132, and lysosome inhibitor CQ. We found the degradation of RIG-I mediated by ORMDL3 could be blocked by proteasome inhibitor MG132 but not lysosome inhibitor CQ (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). To rule out the possibility of transcriptional down-regulation of RIG-I, RT-PCR analysis was performed, confirming that the decrease in RIG-I protein was a post-transcriptional event (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A</xref>). To investigate the mechanism, we co-transfected RIG-I-N, ORMDL3 and plasmids encoding different forms of ubiquitin. The results indicated an increase in K48-linked ubiquitin chains on RIG-I-N, implicating ORMDL3 in promoting proteasomal degradation of RIG-I (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). To pinpoint the lysine residues crucial for RIG-I ubiquitination, we engineered a mutant version of RIG-I-N in which all lysines were mutated to arginines, denoted as RIG-I-N-KR. Intriguingly, the degradation-promoting effect of ORMDL3 on RIG-I-N-KR was nullified (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Given there are 18 lysine residues in RIG-I-N, we generated two mutants, mutant1 and mutant2, each mutating the last nine lysines and the first nine lysines (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3B</xref>). Remarkably, the results showed that mutant1 was resistant to degradation by ORMDL3 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>), suggesting that the last nine lysines on RIG-I-N mediated its degradation induced by ORMDL3.</p>

<p>To delve deeper into the intricate mechanism of ORMDL3-induced degradation of RIG-I, we initially introduced single-point mutations, specifically K146R, K154R, K164R, and K172R <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, which have been reported important for the function and stability of RIG-I. Co-transfection with ORMDL3 revealed that these individual mutations did not impede the degradation process, hinting at the potential cooperation of lysine residues (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). We then mutated all four lysine residues and assessed ORMDL3-induced RIG-I-N degradation. Strikingly, the RIG-I-N-4KR mutant, in which K146, K154, K164, and K172 were simultaneously mutated to arginines, displayed resistance to degradation by ORMDL3 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). At the meantime, the 4KR mutant failed to exhibit the upregulation of K48-linked ubiquitination induced by ORMDL3 overexpression, reinforcing the pivotal role played by K146, K154, K164 and K172 in mediating RIG-I ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). In addition, we found that in mice primary BMDM when ORMDL3 was overexpressed, endogenous RIG-I was downregulated (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>).</p>

<title>ORMDL3 interacts with the signaling adaptor MAVS</title>
<p>Next, we sought to determine the binding partner of ORMDL3 in the type I interferon pathway. Co-immunoprecipitation(co-IP) and immunoblot analysis showed that only Flag-tagged MAVS interacted with ORMDL3-GFP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). To delineate the requisite domains of MAVS facilitating this interaction, various MAVS truncations were co-transfected with ORMDL3. Notably, deletion of the transmembrane domain (TM) of MAVS abrogated the interaction, while deletion of the caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) had no discernible impact (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4A</xref>). It has been reported that ORMDL3 contains four TM segments (TM1−TM4) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. To map the essential domains of ORMDL3 that mediate its association with MAVS, we generated different truncations of ORMDL3 based on the structure, which includes four truncations 1-42, 43-82, 83-118, 119-153 (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4B</xref>). Intriguingly, we found that all these four ORMDL3 truncations interact with MAVS (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>) and impede RIG-I-N induced transcription of <italic>IFNB1</italic> and ISGs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). In addition, co-transfection of RIG-I-N-Myc with individual ORMDL3 truncations showed that each domain of ORMDL3 is favorable to RIG-I-N degradation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Moreover, inspired by Guo et al.’s discovery of a naturally occurring short isoform of ORMDL3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, we engineered N- and C-terminal truncations of ORMDL3 to mimic this isoform (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4B</xref>), results revealing that both truncations retained the ability to interact with MAVS (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4C</xref>). Luciferase assays and RT-PCR affirmed the inhibitory efficacy of each domain (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4D, E</xref>). We also tested whether these different domains can promote the degradation of RIG-I-N, results revealed that every domain can amplify the degradation of RIG-I (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4F</xref>). To further validate the association between ORMDL3 and MAVS, we did FRET experiment in Hela cells, we overexpressed YFP-MAVS(donor) and CFP-ORMDL3(acceptor), when we bleached YFP-MAVS, and we noticed that the fluorescence of CFP-ORMDL3 enhanced (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>).</p>

<title>USP10 deubiquitinates and stablizes RIG-I</title>
<p>To identify the E3 ligase or deubiquitinase involved in ORMDL3-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination, we conducted immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) analysis using Flag-ORMDL3 as bait and identified USP10 as a potential candidate (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). We validated the IP-MS results and the co-IP experiment revealed that only USP10 can interact with ORMDL3 but not CAND1 or UFL1(<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>). Subsequent co-IP validation demonstrated the interaction between ORMDL3 and USP10, USP10 and RIG-I, respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). Interestingly, we found that the RIG-I level is decreased in USP10 stable knockdown 293T cells while overexpression of USP10 promotes the accumulation of RIG-I (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>,<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>). As USP10 is a deubiquitinase, we investigated its impact on RIG-I ubiquitination and observed a decrease in K48 ubiquitination of RIG-I upon USP10 overexpression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). Co-expression RIG-I-N or its 4KR mutant with USP10 showed that USP10 failed to increase the RIG-I-N-4KR level, underscoring the indispensability of these residues (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). Upon overexpressing RIG-I-N and ORMDL3 in USP10 knockdown cells, ORMDL3’s ability to degrade RIG-I was markedly compromised, emphasizing the indispensable role of USP10 in this degradation process (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>). This further validates that ORMDL3 disturbs the USP10’s function on RIG-I.</p>

<title>ORMDL3 disturbs USP10 induced RIG-I stabilization</title>
<p>Co-immunoprecipitation experiments unveiled robust interactions between USP10 and both RIG-I and ORMDL3, with ORMDL3 demonstrating the ability to disrupt the RIG-I-USP10 interaction (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Crucially, USP10 exhibited a specific role in stabilizing RIG-I, but not other innate proteins such as MAVS, MDA5, and IRF3, and this effect can be reversed by ORMDL3 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Further investigations showed that the function of ORMDL3 in disturbing USP10-mediated RIG-I stabilization could be rescued by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 but not the lysosome inhibitor CQ (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Subsequent co-transfection experiments delineated that mutations affecting all lysines (KR) or the last nine lysines (mutant1) of RIG-I-N were necessary to prevent USP10-induced accumulation and ORMDL3-mediated degradation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Notably, single-point mutation of the K146, K154, K164, and K172 residues on RIG-I-N does not affect the regulation of USP10 and ORMDL3 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>), while the 4KR mutation abolished this process (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). These findings underscored the importance of these four lysine residues in both ORMDL3-mediated degradation and USP10-stabilization of RIG-I. Building upon these observations, we sought to elucidate whether USP10 stabilizes RIG-I through these four sites. Co-expression of HA-K48Ub and RIG-I-N-GFP with or without USP10 revealed a decrease in K48 ubiquitination of RIG-I by USP10, while this effect was nullified in the presence of the 4KR mutant, consistent with ORMDL3-mediated regulation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). Additionally, we verified the functional consequences of USP10-induced RIG-I stabilization by assessing the mRNA levels of <italic>IFNB1, CCL5,</italic> and <italic>ISG54</italic>, which were increased upon enforced USP10 expression and reduced upon co-expression with ORMDL3 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>).</p>

<title>Knock down of ORMDL3 enhance anti-tumor immunity</title>
<p>To assess the impact of ORMDL3 on anti-tumor activity, we conducted knockdown experiments targeting ORMDL3 in LLC and MC38 murine cancer cell lines, followed by subcutaneous inoculation into C57BL/6 mice. Remarkably, the deficiency of ORMDL3 significantly suppressed LCC tumor growth and reduced the tumor formation rate compared to the control group (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A-C</xref>). This tumor growth inhibition by targeting ORMDL3 was further validated in the MC38 cancer model (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G-I</xref>). Moreover, both in LLC and MC38 knocked down cell lines, the protein level of RIG-I was significantly upregulated (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6A-D</xref>), and this RIG-I upregulation was further verified by westernblots in LLC tumors (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6E</xref>) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in MC38 tumors (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7K</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The RIG-I MAVS pathway is essential for the early detection of viral infections and the initiation of an effective antiviral immune response. This pathway has two major downstream signaling events: the intereferon signaling and the pro-inflammatory cytokine signal axis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. During RNA virus infection, MAVS recruits TBK1, which phosphorylates IRF3 and IRF7, leading to the production of type I interferons. Meanwhile, the pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling pathway primarily operates through the activation of NF-κB, resulting in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6,TNF, etc <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. The activation of RIG-I is critical for innate immunity, and its post-translational modifications play a vital role. For instance, E3 ligases such as TRIM25, TRIM4, RNF135, and RNF194 facilitate RIG-I activation by mediating its K63-linked ubiquitination. Conversely, other E3 ligases, including RNF125, RNF122, casitas B-lineage lymphoma proto-oncogene (c-Cbl, also known as RNF55), and carboxyl terminus of HSC70-interacting protein (CHIP), mediate K48-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I, leading to its degradation through ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and attenuating cascade activation. Additionally, some deubiquitylating enzymes play significant roles in regulating RIG-I activity. For example, USP3, USP21, and CYLD remove K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, thereby repressing RIG-I activity. In contrast, USP4 and USP15 enhance the stability of RIG-I by reducing K48-linked ubiquitylation. Our study discovered that USP10 stabilizes RIG-I by decreasing its K48 ubiquitination at lysine residues146,154,164, and 172.</p>
<p>Research on ORMDL3 has primarily focused on its relationship with asthma and rhinovirus infections. Mechanistic studies have revealed that ORMDL3 regulates intracellular adhesion molecule 1 expression (ICAM1) and modulates ceramide and sphingolipid metabolism <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. However, the effects of ORMDL3 on human innate immunity remain to be elucidated further. In our study, we found that the transcription of <italic>IFNB1</italic> and ISGs was significantly impaired in ORMDL3-overexpressing cells in response to viral infection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Conversely, their transcription induced by RIG-I-N was significantly increased when ORMDL3 was knocked down (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). These findings confirm that ORMDL3 is a negative regulator of antiviral innate immunity. ORMDL3 is a multiple transmembrane structural protein located at the core of the serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) complex, where it stabilizes SPT assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Co-IP experiments showed that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein ORMDL3 interacts with mitochondrial protein MAVS, suggesting the existence of scaffold proteins mediating this interaction. ORMDL3 has also been implicated in calcium transport<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Since calcium transfer between the ER and mitochondria plays an important role in protein synthesis, it is plausible that ER-mitochondria contact site(ERMC) proteins mediate the interaction between ORMDL3 and MAVS. Furthermore, we discovered that the deubiquitinating enzyme USP10 stabilizes RIG-I, while ORMDL3 disturbs this process, thereby negatively regulating IFN production. When USP10 was knocked down, ORMDL3 was unable to degrade RIG-I-N, indicating that USP10 is indispensable for ORMDL3 mediated RIG-I degradation.</p>
<p>Collectively, our findings identify ORMDL3 as a negative regulator of type I interferon pathway and anti-tumor immunity. The proposed working model is that ORMDL3 forms a complex with MAVS and promotes the degradation of RIG-I, thereby attenuating the transcription of type I IFN and cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-mediated tumor killing (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figure S8</xref>). This negative regulatory loop of antiviral innate immunity mediated by ORMDL3 may provide insights for the development of therapeutics targeting viral infections and tumors.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors identified ORMDL3 as a negative regulator of the RLR pathway and anti-tumor immunity. Mechanistically, ORMDL3 interacts with MAVS and further promotes RIG-I for proteasome degradation. In addition, the deubiquitinating enzyme USP10 stabilizes RIG-I and ORMDL3 disturbs this process. Moreover, in subcutaneous syngeneic tumor models in C57BL/6 mice, they showed that inhibition of ORMDL3 enhances anti-tumor efficacy by augmenting the proportion of cytotoxic CD8-positive T cells and IFN production in the tumor microenvironment (TME).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The paper has a clearly arranged structure and the English is easy to understand. It is well written. The results clearly support the conclusion.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>All questions have been answered.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Minor Points:</p>
<p>• HEK293T cells are not typically Type 1 IFN-producing cells; it is recommended to use other immune cell lines to validate results obtained with ORMDL3 overexpression in 293T cells. The same applies to A549 alveolar basal epithelial cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the reviewer’s insightful comment. In Figure 1C, we overexpressed ORMDL3 in mouse primary BMDM cell and stimulated it with poly(I:C) or poly(dG:dC), which suggests that ORMDL3 inhibits IFN expression in primary cell BMDM.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Clarify whether TLR3 is expressed in the cell lines used in Figure 1 and whether TLR3 is present in mouse BMDMs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your suggestions. We identified whether TLR3 is expressed in HEK293T, A549 and BMDM. We designed primers of human TLR3 and murine Tlr3, and the results showed that Tlr3 is expressed in BMDM but not in HEK293T and A549. As it shown in Author response image 1.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Specify the type of luciferase reporter assay used in Figure 1E.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the reviewer’s insightful comment. The Dual-Luciferase® Reporter (DLR™) Assay System efficiently measures two luciferase signals. In brief, the IFN-reporter luciferase is derived from firefly (Photinus pyralis), while the internal control luciferase is from Renilla (Renilla reniformis or sea pansy). These dual luciferases are measured sequentially from a single sample. In Figure 1E, we measured the luciferase activity of IFN (firefly) and internal control gene TK (Renilla), and their ratio is shown in Figure 1E.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Clarify what was knocked down in the A549 stable KD cell line and whether HSV-1 infects and replicates in A549 cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely appreciate the reviewer’s concern and apologize for any ambiguous descriptions. In Figure 1H, we knocked down ORMDL3 and infected the cell with HSV-1, which shows that ORMDL3 does not affect the infection and replication of HSV-1 in A549.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• In Figure 2E, provide the rationale for using the same tag (Flag) in overexpression experiments with different molecules such as Flag-ORDML3 and Flag-RIG-I.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer’s concern. We tried to co-express different tags of ORMDL3 and innate immunity proteins, and we got the same results as before. ORMDL3-Myc overexpression can only promote the degradation of Flag-RIG-I-N, as shown in current Figure 2E.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Address the low knockdown efficiency shown in Figure 2D and consider whether it is sufficient for drawing conclusions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the reviewer’s concern. Because ORMDL3 antibody (Abcam 107639) can recognize all ORMDL family members (ORMDL1, 2 and 3), this may explain why the knockdown efficiency of ORMDL3 is not apparent in Figure2D. We also detect the knockdown efficiency of ORMDL3 at mRNA level, which showed that ORMDL3 was silenced efficiently and specifically (Figure S2C).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Replace the Tubulin/β-Actin WB control with a more distinguishable band.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the suggestion. Owing to different gel concentration, sometimes the protein bands appear fused, but it is distinguishable that the internal controls are consistent.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• In Figures 3D/E, the expression level of the Lysine mutant of RIG-I-N is too low. Please provide an explanation or repeat the experiment to achieve comparable expression levels and update the figure accordingly.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the question. The expression of lysine mutant of RIG-I-N is low, we have increased the amount of plasmid in transfection, but this still hasn't increased its expression level. Though its abundance is low, we provided evidence to show that it would not be degraded by ORMDL3. In some literatures (for example: RNF122 suppresses antiviral type I interferon production by targeting RIG-I CARDs to mediate RIG-I degradation. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2016 Aug 23;113(34):9581-6<bold>;</bold> TRIM4 modulates type I interferon induction and cellular antiviral response by targeting RIG-I for K63-linked ubiquitination. J Mol Cell Biol. 2014 Apr;6(2):154-63.), it has also been reported that lysine mutant can affect RIG-I stability. In addition, we speculate that the 4KR mutant (K146R, K154R, K164R, K172R) may change RIG-I conformation, so its expression is lower.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Explain why there is no difference in MAVS expression levels despite binding with MAVS.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the question. In our experiment, ORMDL3 has no effect on MAVS expression. Our results showed that ORMDL3 interacts with MAVS and promotes the degradation of RIG-I, so only RIG-I level has a significant difference.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Verify if Flag-tagged ORMDL3 is present in the IP sample in Figure 3G.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the comment. We reloaded the samples and blot flag, and we found that ORMDL3 cannot be pulled down by RIG-I. We have added the results in Figure 3G.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Reload the samples in Figure 4C to clearly identify the correct band for GFP-tagged ORMDL3.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the question. As ORMDL3 is small molecular protein, we fused it and its fragments to GFP to increase its molecular weight. In our GFP vector, for some unknown reason, the 26kDa band always exists. This is actually a technical difficulty. Although the GFP-fused protein and GFP band are very close, they can still be distinguished as two bands.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Rerun the Western blot for Actin IB in Figure 4E, as the ORMDL3-GFP (1-153) full-length appears abnormal.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the question. As we first blot GFP and then blot actin on the same membrane, so it appears abnormal. We reloaded the previous sample and blotted the actin again.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Clarify in which figure RIG-I ubiquitination is shown and whether ORMDL3 has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Explain how ORMDL3 facilitates USP10 transfer to RIG-I despite no direct interaction.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your question. In Figure 3B we showed the ubiquitination of RIG-I and ORMDL3 does not have an E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Our results showed that although ORMDL3 does not directly interacted with RIG-I, it forms complex with USP10 (Figure 5B, 5C) and disrupt USP10 induced RIG-I stabilization by decreasing the interaction between USP10 and RIG-I (Figure 6A). The detailed mechanism needs further investigation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Provide quantification for Figure 5D. Explain why the bands are not degraded by RIG-I and USP10.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the concern. We quantified the bands and found that overexpression of USP10 increased RIG-I protein abundance. The quantitative gray values are added into the image. USP10 functions to stabilize RIG-I rather than promoting its degradation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Explain the decrease in RIG-I levels in Figure 5E when USP10 levels decrease.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the concern. As shown in the working model (Supplementary Figure 8), USP10 is a deubiquitinase that stabilizes RIG-I by decreasing its K48-linked ubiquitination. So, in Figure 5E, we knocked down USP10 and found a decrease in RIG-I levels, which is consistent with Figure 5D.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Clarify whether K48 ubiquitination on RIG-I has decreased in Figure 5F, as this is not clear from the image.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the question. In Figure 5F it is shown that the K48 ubiquitination level of RIG-I significantly decreased (please see the density of the bands in the IP samples).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Address whether ORMDL3 reduces RIG-I-N degradation in Figure 5H, as the results do not clearly support this claim.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the concern. We quantified the bands and the results showed that ORMDL3 promotes the degradation of RIG-I-N. The quantitative gray values are added into the image.</p>

<p>(1) In Figure 1G and H, The number of virus-infected cells was observed using a fluorescence microscope. In addition, can the author use other techniques to detect the impact of ORMDL3 on virus replication?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the question. Except for using a fluorescence microscope, we also used RT-PCR to quantify the amount of viral mRNA, and results were added in Figure 1G and H.</p>

<p>(2) In Figure 3C, ORMDL3 overexpression promotes the degradation of RIG-I-N. ORMDL3 is one of three ORMDL proteins with similar amino acid sequences, does ORMDL1/2 also have this function?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the suggestion. We compared the function between ORMDLs and found that only ORMDL3 overexpression facilitated RIG-I-N degradation. The results were shown in Figure S2D.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In Figure 5A, USP10 is not the top protein in the Mass spec assay. Does the author verified the interaction between ORMDL3 and other protein (for example CAND1)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your suggestion. We verified that ORMDL3 has no interaction with CAND1 and UFL1 but only interacts with USP10, as Figure S5 shows.</p>
