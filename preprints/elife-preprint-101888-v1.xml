<title>Abstract</title><p>Approximately 40% ERα-positive breast cancer patients suffer from therapeutic resistance to tamoxifen. Although reduced ERα level is the major cause of tamoxifen resistance, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we report that FRMD8 raises the level of ERα at both transcriptional and post-translational layers. FRMD8 deficiency in <italic>MMTV-Cre</italic><sup>+</sup>; <italic>Frmd8<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>; <italic>PyMT</italic> mice accelerates mammary tumor growth and loss of luminal phenotype, and confers tamoxifen resistance. Single-cell RNA profiling reveals that Frmd8 loss decreases the proportion of hormone-sensing differentiated epithelial cells and downregulates the levels of ERα. Mechanically, on one hand, loss of FRMD8 inhibits <italic>ESR1</italic> transcription via suppressing the expression of FOXO3A, a transcription factor of <italic>ESR1</italic>. On the other hand, FRMD8 interacts both with ERα and UBE3A, and disrupts the interaction of UBE3A with ERα, thereby blocking UBE3A-mediated ERα degradation. In breast cancer patients, <italic>FRMD8</italic> gene promoter is found hypermethylated and low level of FRMD8 predicts poor prognosis. Therefore, FRMD8 is an important regulator of ERα and may control therapeutic sensitivity to tamoxifen in ERα-positive breast cancer patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Sung in drugi, 2021</xref>) and more than 70% of breast cancer are estrogen receptor α (ERα)-positive(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Habara in Shimada, 2022</xref>). Although endocrine therapy is the most common systemic treatment for ERα-positive breast cancer in clinical practice, approximately 40% of patients still develop primary or secondary resistance to endocrine therapy(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Badia in drugi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Légaré in Basik, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Rondón-Lagos in drugi, 2016</xref>). Therefore, it is urgent and necessary to explore the mechanisms of endocrine therapy resistance and search for new therapeutic targets.</p>
<p>Tamoxifen (TAM), a selective estrogen receptor antagonist, is the most widely used medicine in endocrine therapy. Tamoxifen competes with estrogen to bind with ERα and changes the conformation of ERα, thereby preventing the interaction between co-activators and ERα and inhibiting activation of ERα(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Katzenellenbogen in drugi, 2018</xref>). Thus, the level of ERα is strongly correlated with reactivity and resistance of endocrine therapy. Uncovering the mechanisms by which ERα expression is regulated is essential for overcoming endocrine therapy resistance. Multiple transcription factors, such as AP-2γ, FOXO3, FOXM1, and GATA3, have been reported to bind to the promoter region of <italic>ESR1</italic> and participate in transcriptional regulation of <italic>ESR1</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Jia in drugi, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Koš in drugi, 2001</xref>). In addition, post-translational modifications of ERα, including phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination, also have effects on subcellular localization, transcriptional activity, and stability of ERα(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Rogatsky in drugi, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Williams in drugi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Zhou in Slingerland, 2014</xref>). However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of ERα expression are still not clear and require further investigation.</p>
<p>FERM domain-containing proteins are widely involved in processes such as the formation of macromolecular complexes, subcellular localization, functional activation, and signal transduction, thereby regulating the occurrence and development of tumors(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Frame in drugi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Moleirinho in drugi, 2013</xref>; Zhan in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Zhang, 2018</xref>). FRMD8, as a member of FERM domain-containing proteins, has been reported to bind with iRhom and enhance the stability of the iRhom/TACE complex on the cell surface, thereby preventing iRhom/TACE degradation mediated by lysosomes. TACE is responsible for cleaving and releasing TNF, and the absence of FRMD8 impairs the production of TNF(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Künzel in drugi, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Oikonomidi in drugi, 2018</xref>). Additionally, FRMD8 expressions in both microenvironment and tumor cells promote lung tumor growth(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Badenes in drugi, 2023</xref>). FRMD8 inhibits colon cancer growth by preventing cell cycle progression. FRMD8 disrupts the interaction of CDK7 with CDK4, subsequently inhibiting CDK4 activation. Furthermore, FRMD8 competes with MDM2 to bind RB, thereby attenuating MDM2-mediated RB degradation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Yu in drugi, 2023</xref>). However, the roles of FRMD8 in breast tumorigenesis and progression need further exploration.</p>
<p>In this study, we found that loss of Frmd8 in luminal epithelial cells of <italic>MMTV-PyMT</italic> mice accelerates mammary tumor progression and luminal epithelial phenotype loss, and confers tamoxifen resistance. Single-cell RNA profiling reveals that the number of hormone-sensing differentiated cells is diminished and the level of ERα is decreased in Frmd8-knocked-out mammary tumors. FRMD8 not only increases <italic>ESR1</italic> expression, but also prevents ERα degradation by interrupting the interaction between ERα and E3 ligase UBE3A. Further, a low FRMD8 level predicts poor prognosis in human breast cancer patients. Thus, we demonstrated that FRMD8 is an important ERα regulator and a vital tumor suppressive protein in breast cancer growth and drug resistance.</p>

<p>To examine whether FRMD8 plays a role in breast tumorigenesis, we established luminal epithelium-specific <italic>Frmd8</italic> knockout mice (<italic>MMTV-Cre</italic><sup>+</sup>; <italic>Frmd8<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>) and further generated a Frmd8-deletion breast cancer mouse model (<italic>MMTV-Cre</italic><sup>+</sup>; <italic>Frmd8<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>; <italic>PyMT</italic>) by crossing <italic>MMTV-Cre</italic><sup>+</sup>; <italic>Frmd8<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice with <italic>MMTV-PyMT</italic> (<italic>PyMT</italic>) mice, a widely used transgenic mouse model of mammary tumorigenesis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>, S1A and S1B). Compared with <italic>MMTV-Cre</italic><sup>-</sup>; <italic>Frmd8<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>; <italic>PyMT</italic> mice, Frmd8 depleted in mice significantly promotes mammary tumor development (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>). The total tumor weight (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>) and number of tumors (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>) were markedly higher in <italic>MMTV-Cre</italic><sup>+</sup>; <italic>Frmd8<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>; <italic>PyMT</italic> mice than the control mice. Histological examination of the breast tumors from <italic>PyMT</italic> mice using haematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E) staining revealed that the luminal epithelium was poorly differentiated in <italic>MMTV-Cre</italic><sup>+</sup>; <italic>Frmd8<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>; <italic>PyMT</italic> mice tumors compared with the control mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>). Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining showed that the percentage of Ki67-positive cells was significantly elevated in mammary tumors of <italic>Frmd8</italic>-depleted mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1K</xref>). Consistently, 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assays demonstrated that FRMD8 depletion promoted human breast cancer cell MCF7 and T47D proliferation (Fig. S1C and S1D). These findings indicated that <italic>Frmd8</italic> deficiency in the luminal epithelium accelerates mammary tumor growth in <italic>MMTV-PyMT</italic> mice and promotes cell proliferation.</p>

<p>Since tamoxifen is commonly used for the treatment of ERα<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup> breast cancer, we thus investigated whether loss of Frmd8 affects sensitivity of mammary tumors to tamoxifen treatment in mice. To this end, <italic>MMTV-Cre</italic><sup>-</sup>; <italic>Frmd8<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>; <italic>PyMT</italic> mice and <italic>MMTV-Cre</italic><sup>+</sup>; <italic>Frmd8<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>; <italic>PyMT</italic> mice were injected intraperitoneally with tamoxifen or corn oil as control every two days. The results showed that tamoxifen significantly prevents mammary tumor progression in the control mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1L</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1M</xref>). However, mammary tumors of <italic>MMTV-Cre</italic><sup>+</sup>; <italic>Frmd8<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>; <italic>PyMT</italic> mice showed no response to tamoxifen treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1L</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1M</xref>). Consistently, the total tumor weight (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1N</xref>) and number of tumors (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1O</xref>) of <italic>MMTV-Cre</italic><sup>-</sup>; <italic>Frmd8<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>; <italic>PyMT</italic> mice were markedly decreased after tamoxifen treatment, whereas there was no difference in <italic>MMTV-Cre</italic><sup>+</sup>; <italic>Frmd8<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>; <italic>PyMT</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1N</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1O</xref>). Taken together, these findings demonstrated that loss of Frmd8 accelerates mammary tumor growth and generates resistance to tamoxifen therapy in Frmd8-depleted mice.</p>

<title>Frmd8 knockout decreases the proportion of the hormone-sensing differentiated epithelial cells</title>
<p>To investigate the mechanism through which Frmd8 loss promotes mammary tumor growth and leads to tamoxifen resistance, we then performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis. Mammary tumors from 4-month-old <italic>MMTV-Cre</italic><sup>-</sup>; <italic>Frmd8<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>; <italic>PyMT</italic> and <italic>MMTV-Cre</italic><sup>+</sup>; <italic>Frmd8<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>; <italic>PyMT</italic> mice were harvested and analyzed using the Chromium Single Cell 3’ Reagent Kitsv3 (10× Genomics). Cells that passed quality control (QC) filter totaled 24,320, of which 11,606 cells were from <italic>MMTV-Cre</italic><sup>-</sup>; <italic>Frmd8<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>; <italic>PyMT</italic>, and 12,714 cells were from <italic>MMTV -Cre</italic><sup>+</sup>; <italic>Frmd8<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>; <italic>PyMT</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). After that, we profiled the three major cell lineages, including epithelial cells, immune cells and stromal cells by the UMAP visualization (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Their associated top-expressed and canonical markers were shown in Figure S2A and S2B, respectively. Based on the expression of known markers, a total of 12 clearly separated cell lineages were finally identified (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). In particular, they were as follows: B cells highly expressing <italic>Cd19</italic>, <italic>Cd79a</italic>, <italic>Cd79b</italic>; CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells characterized with high <italic>Cd3g</italic> and <italic>Cd4</italic> expression; CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells highly expressing <italic>Cd3g</italic> and <italic>Cd8a</italic>; dendritic cells (DCs) expressing <italic>Cd74</italic> and <italic>Cd14</italic>; endothelial cells specifically expressing the markers <italic>Pecam1</italic> and <italic>Emcn</italic>; epithelial cells expressing <italic>Epcam</italic> and <italic>Krt8</italic>; fibroblast cells high expressing <italic>Col1a1</italic> and <italic>Col3a1</italic>; granulocyte cells specifically expressing the markers <italic>S100a9</italic>; macrophage cells highly expressing <italic>Cd14</italic>, <italic>Cd68</italic> and <italic>C1qa</italic>; monocyte cells highly expressing <italic>Cd14</italic> and <italic>Ccr2</italic>; natural killer (NK) cells specifically expressing <italic>Nkg7</italic> and <italic>Ncr1</italic> (Fig. S2C).

<p>To further explore whether the proportions of epithelial cells in mammary tumors were affected by Frmd8 loss, we subset and re-identified four epithelial cell clusters(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Valdes-Mora in drugi, 2021</xref>), including alveolar progenitor (Avp), basal (Bsl), hormone-sensing differentiated (Hsd) and luminal progenitor (Lp) epithelial cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). As expected, the epithelial cells were composed of luminal epithelial cells and basal epithelial cells, which were consistent with the cellular characteristics of the mammary glands. In contrast to control mice, the proportion of the Hsd epithelial cells was significantly decreased in <italic>MMTV-Cre</italic><sup>+</sup>; <italic>Frmd8<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>; <italic>PyMT</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>).</p>
<p>To define the tumor cells in the mouse mammary tumors, we applied inferCNV algorithm to calculate the copy number variations (CNVs) of the single cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). To this end, we analyzed CNV scores of epithelial subclusters, immune and stromal cells, revealing immune cells with low CNV score (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>). Given that Hsd epithelial cells which specifically expressed <italic>Esr1</italic> and <italic>Pgr</italic> had lower CNV score than alveolar progenitor (Avp), basal (Bsl) and luminal progenitor (Lp) epithelial cells, we defined the low CNV score Hsd epithelial cells as normal cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2I</xref>). Furthermore, we defined the high CNV score epithelial cells as tumor cells, and plotted the UMAP visualization (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2J</xref>). The results also showed that the expression of <italic>Frmd8</italic> was decreased in tumor cells compared with normal cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2K</xref> and S2E). In addition, we observed that loss of Frmd8 significantly decreased the expression of <italic>Esr1</italic> and <italic>Pgr</italic> in normal cells of mammary tumors, and decreased expression of Frmd8 in tumor cells accompanied with low expression of <italic>Esr1</italic> and <italic>Pgr</italic> compared with normal cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2L</xref> and S2E). Taken together, these findings indicated that Frmd8 depletion in <italic>PyMT</italic> mice leads to decreases of the Hsd epithelial cells proportion and the expression of <italic>Esr1</italic> and <italic>Pgr</italic>.</p>

<p>Given that scRNA-seq results suggested that loss of Frmd8 reduced the proportion of Hsd epithelial cells and the expression of <italic>Esr1</italic> and <italic>Pgr</italic>, multiple immunofluorescence staining analyses were then performed to examine the change of ERα and PR at the protein levels <italic>in situ</italic> in mammary tumors of 4-month-old Frmd8-depleted mice. Consistent with the scRNA-seq results, deficiency of Frmd8 dramatically decreased the levels of ERα, PR and CK8, a marker of mammary luminal epithelium, in normal tissues adjacent to tumors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). <italic>In situ</italic> tissue flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that in normal tissues adjacent to tumor of the control mice, the proportion of ERα-positive cells among CK8<sup>+</sup> cells were 45.49%, whereas this proportion was just 9.28% in <italic>MMTV-Cre</italic><sup>+</sup>; <italic>Frmd8<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>; <italic>PyMT</italic> mice (Fig. S3A).

In mammary tumor tissues from both control mice and <italic>MMTV-Cre</italic><sup>+</sup>; <italic>Frmd8<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>; <italic>PyMT</italic> mice, the expressions of ERα and PR were almost negative (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). Since the expression of ERα is loss with tumor progression, to further clarify the regulation of Frmd8 on ERα, we performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of mammary glands of 7-week-old <italic>PyMT</italic> mice, which had no palpable tumors. The results showed that Frmd8 depletion also markedly decreased the expression of ERα in normal and atypical hyperplasia breast tissues (Fig. S3E). Taken together, these data suggested that deficiency of FRMD8 downregulates the protein levels of ERα and PR in mammary tissues of <italic>MMTV-PyMT</italic> mice, and accelerates the loss of luminal phenotype in mammary gland.</p>

<p>It was known that the common endocrine treatment for non-metastatic breast cancer relies on the expression of ERα(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Waks in Winer, 2019</xref>) and our results demonstrated that loss of Frmd8 promotes mammary tumor growth and confers tamoxifen resistance in mice, we thus aim to further examine whether FRMD8 regulates ERα expression. To this end, we transiently transfect Flag-FRMD8 vector or FRMD8 siRNA in human breast cancer cells. Our results showed that FRMD8 overexpression drastically increased the levels of ERα, while ERα expression was greatly downregulated when FRMD8 was knocked down (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). Moreover, qRT-PCR results indicated that depletion of FRMD8 significantly decreased the mRNA level of <italic>ESR1</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>).</p>
<p>FOXO3A is a crucial transcription factor for ERα(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Jia in drugi, 2019</xref>). To answer whether FOXO3A is involved in the regulation of FRMD8 on ERα, we examined the expression of FOXO3A after silencing FRMD8 through transfecting siRNA into MCF7 and T47D cells. The results showed that FRMD8 silencing dramatically decreased the level of FOXO3A (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). Consistently, overexpression of FRMD8 in MCF7 and T47D cells markedly raised the level of FOXO3A (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). To examine whether FRMD8 promotes <italic>ESR1</italic> transcription through FOXO3A, HA-tagged FRMD8 as well as FOXO3A siRNA were co-transfected into MCF7 cells. Although exogenous FRMD8 significantly upregulated ERα expression, depletion of endogenous FOXO3A greatly reduced the effect of FRMD8 on ERα (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3I</xref>). Besides, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR was performed and revealed that depletion of FRMD8 significantly decreased the occupancy of FOXO3A at the <italic>ESR1</italic> promoters (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3J</xref>).

<title>FRMD8 stabilizes ER<italic>α</italic> via prevention of its degradation</title>
<p>Although our results suggest that FRMD8 depletion inhibits the mRNA level of <italic>ESR1</italic>, unexpectedly, we also observed that decreased expression of FRMD8 led to a decreased level of exogenous Flag-ERα (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). This result suggested that in addition to inhibiting mRNA expression of ERα, FRMD8 may also regulate ERα protein expression at the post-translational level. To this end, T47D cells were treated with cycloheximide (CHX), a protein synthesis inhibitor. Depletion of FRMD8 greatly increased the ERα turnover rate and the half-life of ERα decreased from 6 h to approximately 2 h (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>). Furthermore, MCF7 and T47D cells were treated with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, and chloroquine (CQ), a lysosome inhibitor, to determine whether ERα degradation was mediated by the proteasome or the lysosome. The results showed that the reduction of ERα levels by FRMD8 depletion was blocked by treatment with MG132 but not CQ (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4E</xref>).

<p>Given that FERM domain containing proteins play roles via regulating protein-protein interaction, we wonder whether there is an interaction between FRMD8 and ERα. To this end, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays were performed using Flag-FRMD8 in MCF7 and T47D cells to examine the association of exogenous FRMD8 with endogenous ERα. The results showed that FRMD8 interacts with ERα (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). Importantly, an interaction between endogenous FRMD8 and endogenous ERα was also observed in MCF7 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Furthermore, a glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay using purified recombinant GST-FRMD8 and Flag-tagged ERα proteins was also performed. The results indicated that FRMD8 interacts directly with ERα <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>).

<p>The aforementioned findings demonstrated that FRMD8 prevents ERα degradation via proteasome pathway. To explore the mechanism by which FRMD8 inhibits ERα degradation, co-IP assay and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis were performed in HEK293A cells transiently expressing Flag-FRMD8 (Table S1). We next searched for the FRMD8-interacting proteins identified by MS matched with the known E3 ubiquitin ligases of ERα. Interestingly, UBE3A, a ubiquitin ligase for ERα(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Sun in drugi, 2012</xref>), is the only matched protein that interacts with FRMD8 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). We thus examined the interaction between FRMD8 and UBE3A through co-IP. The results indicated an interaction between FRMD8 and UBE3A (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5G</xref>). Further, we assumed that FRMD8 may interfere with the interaction between ERα and UBE3A. To test this idea, co-IP assays were performed in HEK293T and T47D cells. In both cell types, the level of ERα ubiquitination and the interaction between ERα and UBE3A were markedly increased by FRMD8 depletion (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5I</xref>). Intriguingly, FRMD8 depletion led to a marked decrease of ERα expression, while depletion of UBE3A dramatically rescued the effect of FRMD8 depletion (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5J</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5K</xref>). Taken together, these results strongly demonstrated that FRMD8 binds to ERα and UBE3A, and prevents UBE3A interaction with ERα, thereby blocking UBE3A-mediated ERα ubiquitination and degradation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5L</xref>).</p>

<p>Hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes is one of the major causes for tumorigenesis. Therefore, we investigated whether the promoter region of FRMD8 is hypermethylated in breast cancer patients. An analysis based on TCGA database showed that the <italic>FRMD8</italic> promoter was highly methylated in primary breast tumors (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). Subsequently, breast cancer cells were treated with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC). The results showed that 5-Aza-dC treatment significantly upregulated both mRNA and protein levels of FRMD8 in claudin-low but not luminal breast cancer cell lines (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>, 6E and S4A), which was consistent with the lower expression of FRMD8 in claudin-low breast cancer cell lines (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). These findings demonstrated that <italic>FRMD8</italic> gene promoter is hypermethylated, which could be the reason for the reduced FRMD8 expression in triple-negative breast cancer cells.</p>
<p>To further investigate the clinical significance of FRMD8 in breast cancer patients, we performed immunohistochemical staining of FRMD8 in a tissue microarray of breast cancer patients and evaluated the level of FRMD8 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>).

<p>In this study, we found that FRMD8 plays a tumor suppressive role in breast cancer progression.

FRMD8 depletion not only suppresses transcription of <italic>ESR1</italic> through decreasing the level of FOXO3A, but also promotes the E3 ligase UBE3A binding with ERα to disrupts ERα protein stability.

FRMD8 acts as a scaffold protein, inhibiting CDK4 activation mediated by CDK7 and preventing MDM2-mediated RB degradation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Yu in drugi, 2023</xref>). In this study, our results suggested that FRMD8 inhibits mammary tumor progression in <italic>MMTV-PyMT</italic> mice. Besides, FRMD8 also acts as a scaffold molecule, which interacts simultaneously with ERα and UBE3A, and renders UBE3A unable to bind with ERα, thus stabilizing ERα.</p>

Gene expression profiling revealed that mammary tumors in <italic>MMTV-PyMT</italic> mice are similar with luminal B subtype of human breast cancer(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Pfefferle in drugi, 2013</xref>). Early-stage mammary tumors in <italic>MMTV-PyMT</italic> mice express ERα and PR, while they loss ERα and PR as the tumor progresses(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Lapidus in drugi, 1998</xref>). Our findings suggested that FRMD8 depletion downregulates the level of ERα through a dual mechanism at both the transcriptional and post-translational levels, which accelerates the loss of luminal features in mammary tumor.</p>
<p>In this study, we identified that loss of FRMD8 inhibiting <italic>ESR1</italic> expression through downregulating the level of FOXO3A. FOXO3A locates in nucleus and blocks cell cycle progression via activating the cell cycle blocking protein p27<sup>KIP1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Seoane in drugi, 2004</xref>). In addition, FOXO3A contributes to cell death through a Fas ligand-dependent mechanism(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Seoane in drugi, 2004</xref>). Phosphorylated FOXO3A mediated by AKT binds to 14-3-3 protein and remains in the cytoplasm, resulting in loss of activity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arden, 2004</xref>). Thus, FRMD8 may also be involved in the regulation of cell cycle or apoptosis in an ERα-independent manner by regulating FOXO3A. Furthermore, FOXO3A is closely associated with the stemness of breast cancer cells. FOXO3A suppresses breast cancer stem cell properties and tumorigenicity via inhibition of FOXM1/SOX2 signaling(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Liu in drugi, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Yan in drugi, 2017</xref>), suggesting that FRMD8 may have an effect on breast cancer stem cells. However, the mechanisms by which FRMD8 promotes FOXO3A expression remain unclear and need to be further investigated.</p>
<p>The proportion of luminal subtype is increasing in new cases of breast cancer(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Waks in Winer, 2019</xref>). Tamoxifen therapy is one of the most important systemic treatment for ERα<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup> subtype breast cancer patients(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Waks in Winer, 2019</xref>). Unfortunately, primary or secondary tamoxifen resistance occurs in about 40% of patients treated with tamoxifen therapy, and tamoxifen resistance often leads to the development of resistance to other selective estrogen receptor modulators(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Badia in drugi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Légaré in Basik, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Rondón-Lagos in drugi, 2016</xref>). As a regulator of ERα, FRMD8 may be a therapeutic target for rescue tamoxifen resistance.</p>
<p>In summary, we identified FRMD8 as a prognostic marker in breast cancer. FRMD8 regulates ERα level through a dual mechanism. Loss of FRMD8 inhibits <italic>ESR1</italic> transcription via downregulating FOXO3A expression. FRMD8 also stabilizes ERα protein by preventing UBE3A from binding to ERα. Deficiency of FRMD8 promotes mammary luminal features loss and confers tamoxifen resistance. Our findings indicated that targeting <italic>FRMD8</italic> promoter methylation may provide a novel therapeutic approach for reversing tamoxifen resistance.</p>

<title>Single-cell RNA sequence (scRNA-seq)</title>
<p>Single-cell RNA sequencing libraries were meticulously prepared utilizing the Chromium Single Cell 3’ Reagent Kits v3 according to the protocols recommended by 10× Genomics. Briefly, an initial quantity of approximately 1×10<sup>5</sup> cells, which had been sorted through fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), underwent a triple wash process in DPBS containing 0.04% BSA. These cells were subsequently resuspended to a final concentration of 700 to 1,200 cells/μl, with a minimum viability threshold of 85%. During the library preparation process, cells were encapsulated within droplets to facilitate a precise targeted recovery rate. After the reverse transcription phase, the generated emulsions were disrupted, and the barcoded cDNA was isolated using Dynabeads technology. This was followed by PCR amplification to enrich the cDNA pool. The amplified cDNA served as the template for constructing the 3’ gene expression libraries. Specifically, for this construction phase, 50 ng of the amplified cDNA was fragmented and subjected to end repair. This material was then subjected to a double-size selection process using SPRIselect beads. The prepared libraries were sequenced on NovaSeq system provided by Illumina, generating 150 bp paired-end reads.</p>

<title>Single-cell RNA sequence original data process</title>
<p>Prior to commencing the analysis, cellular data underwent a stringent filtering process. Cells with unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts below 30,000 and those exhibiting gene counts within the range of 200 to 5,000 were excluded. Additionally, cells displaying a mitochondrial content exceeding 20% were also removed from further analysis. Following this preprocessing step, the Seurat package (version 2.3) was employed for both dimensionality reduction and cluster identification. The normalization and scaling of gene expression data were accomplished using the NormalizeData and ScaleData functions, respectively. Subsequently, the FindVariableFeatures function facilitated the selection of the 2,000 genes demonstrating the most significant variation for principal component analysis (PCA). Cluster identification was achieved through the FindClusters function, which partitioned the genes into distinct groups. To mitigate batch effects across samples, the Harmony package was utilized. The refined dataset was then visualized in a two-dimensional space employing Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) techniques, thereby providing insightful representations of the underlying cellular heterogeneity.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Tamoxifen resistance is a common problem in partially ER-positive patients undergoing endocrine therapy, and this manuscript has important research significance as it is based on clinical practical issues. The manuscript discovered that the absence of FRMD8 in breast epithelial cells can promote the progression of breast cancer, thus proposing the hypothesis that FRMD8 affects tamoxifen resistance and validating this hypothesis through a series of experiments. The manuscript has a certain theoretical reference value.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>At present, research on the role of FRMD8 in breast cancer is very limited. This manuscript leverages the MMTV-Cre+;Frmd8fl/fl;PyMT mouse model to study the role of FRMD8 in tamoxifen resistance, and single-cell sequencing technology discovered the interaction between FRMD8 and ESR1. At the mechanistic level, this manuscript has demonstrated two ways in which FRMD8 affects ERα, providing some new insights into the development of ER-positive breast cancer in patients who are resistant to tamoxifen.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This manuscript repeatedly emphasizes the role of FRMD8/FOXO3A in tamoxifen resistance in ER-positive breast cancer, but the specific mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated. Whether FRMD8 can become a biomarker should be verified in large clinical samples or clinical data.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript presents a valuable finding on the impact of FRMD8 loss on tumor progression and the resistance to tamoxifen therapy. The author conducted systematic experiments to explore the role of FRMD8 in breast cancer and its potential regulatory mechanisms, confirming that FRMD8 could serve as a potential target to revere tamoxifen resistance.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The majority of the research is logically clear, smooth, and persuasive.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Some research in the article lacks depth and some sentences are poorly organized.</p>
