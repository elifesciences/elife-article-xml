<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Exposure to an acute stressor triggers a complex cascade of neurochemical events in the brain. However, deciphering their individual impact on stress-induced molecular changes remains a major challenge. Here we combine RNA-sequencing with selective pharmacological, chemogenetic and optogenetic manipulations to isolate the contribution of the locus coeruleus - noradrenaline (LN-NA) system to the acute stress response. We reveal that NA-release during stress exposure regulates a large and reproducible set of genes in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus via β-adrenergic receptors. For a smaller subset of these genes, we show that NA release triggered by LC stimulation is sufficient to mimic the stress-induced transcriptional response. We observe these effects in both sexes, independent of the pattern and frequency of LC activation. Using a retrograde optogenetic approach, we demonstrate that hippocampus-projecting LC neurons directly regulate hippocampal gene expression. Overall, a highly selective set of astrocyte-enriched genes emerges as key targets of LC-NA activation, most prominently several subunits of protein phosphatase 1 (<italic>Ppp1r3c</italic>, <italic>Ppp1r3d</italic>, <italic>Ppp1r3g</italic>) and type II iodothyronine deiodinase (<italic>Dio2</italic>). These results highlight the importance of astrocytic energy metabolism and thyroid hormone signaling in LC mediated hippocampal function, and offer new molecular targets for understanding LC function in health and disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>When an organism faces an acutely stressful situation, a set of evolutionarily conserved mechanisms are triggered to re-route all available resources to body functions that enhance performance and increase the chance of survival (<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">Floriou-Servou et al. 2021</xref>; <xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">Joëls and Baram 2009</xref>). In the brain, stress exposure immediately activates the locus coeruleus-noradrenaline (LC-NA) system. Although the LC is a heterogeneous structure with modular organization, it appears that in strongly stressful situations broad activation of the LC - and subsequent widespread NA release throughout the brain - serves as a broadcast signal to orchestrate re-routing of computational resources to meet situational demands (<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">Likhtik and Johansen 2019</xref>; <xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr">Poe et al. 2020</xref>). On the network level, for example, NA release from the LC is sufficient to trigger a rapid reconfiguration of large-scale networks that shift processing capacity towards salience processing (<xref rid="c68" ref-type="bibr">Zerbi et al. 2019</xref>; <xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">Oyarzabal et al. 2022</xref>). On a circuit level, forebrain regions seem to be particularly important targets of the LC-NA system to influence cognitive processes and ultimately behavior. This involves the engagement of anxiety and memory circuits including the amygdala, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, which leads to an increase in avoidance behavior (<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">McCall et al. 2015</xref>, <xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; <xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">Hirschberg et al. 2017</xref>; <xref rid="c68" ref-type="bibr">Zerbi et al. 2019</xref>) and supports memory formation of salient events (<xref rid="c63" ref-type="bibr">Uematsu, Tan, and Johansen 2015</xref>; <xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">Hansen 2017</xref>; <xref rid="c56" ref-type="bibr">Sara 2015</xref>; <xref rid="c57" ref-type="bibr">Schwabe et al. 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>While the insights into network and circuit dynamics of the LC have been galvanized by recent advances in circuit neuroscience tools, our understanding of the molecular impact of NA release has remained largely unexplored. However, we know that the stress response triggers multifaceted molecular cascades that profoundly change brain function and behavior in response to stressful events (<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">Floriou-Servou et al. 2021</xref>; <xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">Joëls and Baram 2009</xref>). These molecular changes are mediated by a large number of neurotransmitters, neuropeptides and hormones, which operate on different time scales, to allow rapid activation, sustained activity and successful termination of the stress response. Many of the rapid molecular changes induced by stress exposure seem to be driven by NA. For example, several of the genes that are induced by an acute stress challenge can be blocked by β-adrenergic receptor antagonists (<xref rid="c54" ref-type="bibr">Roszkowski et al. 2016</xref>). However, a similar analysis on the genome-wide level has not been conducted. Further, it remains unknown whether NA release alone is sufficient to trigger transcriptomic changes in the first place. Here, we profile the molecular fingerprint of stress-induced NA release by combining pharmacologic, chemogenetic and optogenetic manipulation of the LC-NA system with genome-wide transcriptomic analyses. We focus on the hippocampus, as it receives its sole NA supply from the LC (<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">Loy et al. 1980</xref>; <xref rid="c53" ref-type="bibr">Robertson et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">Oleskevich, Descarries, and Lacaille 1989</xref>), and because the molecular response to acute stress has been characterized in great detail in this region (<xref rid="c70" ref-type="bibr">von Ziegler et al. 2022</xref>; <xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">Mifsud et al. 2021</xref>; <xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">Floriou-Servou et al. 2018</xref>). As the dorsal hippocampus (dHC) and ventral hippocampus (vHC) are involved in different circuits (<xref rid="c60" ref-type="bibr">Strange et al. 2014</xref>) and are transcriptionally very distinct (<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">Cembrowski et al. 2016</xref>; <xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">Floriou-Servou et al. 2018</xref>), we analyze these regions separately.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A recent multi-omic characterization of the acute stress response in the mouse hippocampus revealed that stress-induced transcriptional changes peak between 45-90 min after stress exposure, before gradually returning to baseline (<xref rid="c70" ref-type="bibr">von Ziegler et al. 2022</xref>). To determine how NA might contribute to these effects, we first measured the dynamics of NA turnover in response to a cold swim stress exposure in the brain. Using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (uHPLC), we determined concentrations of NA and its main metabolite 3-Methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) at various time points over 3 hours after swim stress exposure in the cortex (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). NA turnover (as measured by the MHPG/NA ratio) peaked at 45 min and returned to baseline within 90 min after stress onset (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). Therefore, we chose the 45 min time point to assess the contribution of NA signaling to stress-induced transcriptomic changes. To this end, we blocked adrenergic receptors using either the α1-adrenergic receptor antagonist prazosin, or the β-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol prior to stress exposure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). In line with our previous work (<xref rid="c70" ref-type="bibr">von Ziegler et al. 2022</xref>; <xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">Floriou-Servou et al. 2018</xref>; <xref rid="c54" ref-type="bibr">Roszkowski et al. 2016</xref>), acute swim stress induced a robust transcriptional response 45 min after stress exposure in both dorsal hippocampus (dHC) and ventral hippocampus (vHC) (see Veh-C vs Veh-S in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 1a). Prazosin only mildly impacted stress-dependent transcriptional changes in the dHC and vHC (see Veh-S vs Pra-S in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 1a). Surprisingly, prazosin seemed to slightly amplify - rather than prevent - some stress effects (Supplementary Fig. 1b). In contrast, propranolol had a profound impact, preventing many of the stress-induced changes in the dHC and vHC (see Veh-S vs Pro-S in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 1a). Indeed, a direct comparison between the stress group and the stress + propranolol group found many genes that were significantly altered by propranolol administration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 1c). This response to propranolol was very similar in the dHC and vHC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>).</p>

<p>While blocking β-adrenergic receptors was able to block stress-induced gene expression, we did not test whether propranolol might decrease gene expression already at baseline, independent of stress. Additionally, all tests had thus far been conducted in male mice, raising the question about potential sex differences in NA-mediated transcriptomic responses. To address these two issues, we repeated the experiment in both sexes and included a group that received a propranolol injection but was not exposed to stress (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref>). As we did not detect major differences between noradrenergic responses in the dHC and vHC, we restricted our analysis to the vHC for this experiment. Using an appropriate multiplicative statistical model (stress * injection) we found again that many stress-responsive genes also had a significant stress:propranolol interaction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h</xref>). We also found no significant differences in propranolol-mediated effects between male and female mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h</xref>). Furthermore, we could show that the stress-induced genes that were sensitive to propranolol treatment in the initial experiment were again activated by stress and blocked by propranolol (Supplementary Fig. 1d); at the same time, we confirmed that propranolol did not change the expression level of these genes in the absence of stress (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h</xref>). We then expanded our analysis across all vHC samples of both experiments. We employed a method that corrects for inter-experimental baseline effects prior to the statistical analysis of the combined dataset (<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">Leek et al. 2012</xref>). The results corroborate the initial findings, providing a <italic>bona fide</italic> list of stress-responsive genes that are blocked by propranolol (Supplementary Fig. 1e). To differently visualize this, we manually selected a few genes whose stress-induced induction was blocked by propranolol pre-treatment either partially (<italic>Apold1</italic>), or completely (<italic>Dio2</italic>, <italic>Sik1</italic> and <italic>Ppp1r3c</italic>) (Supplementary Fig. 1f). We then used these genes to test whether direct activation of hippocampal β-adrenergic receptors is sufficient to induce these changes. To this end, we infused animals with the β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol into the dHC and assessed the expression of these genes by targeted qRT-PCR assays in the dHC (Supplementary Fig. 1g). Isoproterenol directly increased hippocampal expression of <italic>Apold1</italic>, <italic>Dio2</italic> and <italic>Sik1</italic> (Supplementary Fig. 1h). Taken together, this shows that for a large number of genes, NA signaling via β-adrenergic receptors is required to regulate the stress-induced transcriptional response, or to determine the magnitude of stress-induced changes.</p>
<p>An acute stress exposure triggers the release of a plentitude of stress mediators - neurotransmitters, peptides and hormones - that interact to regulate molecular changes (<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">Joëls and Baram 2009</xref>). As it is unclear how NA interacts with other stress mediators, we asked whether we could isolate the molecular changes for which NA release is not only required, but sufficient, by triggering NA release in the hippocampus. Because hippocampal NA supply is provided exclusively by long-range projections from the LC (<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">Loy et al. 1980</xref>; <xref rid="c53" ref-type="bibr">Robertson et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">Oleskevich, Descarries, and Lacaille 1989</xref>), we first pharmacologically activated NA release using the α2-adrenergic receptor antagonist yohimbine, which strongly disinhibits noradrenergic neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). As expected, systemic administration of yohimbine (3 mg/kg, i.p.) led to a strong increase in cFos expression within the LC (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>) and increased NA turnover in the cortex (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Because NA mediates the stress-induced increase in anxiety (<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">McCall et al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="c68" ref-type="bibr">Zerbi et al. 2019</xref>), we also evaluated behavioral changes in the open field test. We had shown previously that acute stress increases anxiety in the open field test (<xref rid="c61" ref-type="bibr">Sturman, Germain, and Bohacek 2018</xref>; <xref rid="c70" ref-type="bibr">von Ziegler et al. 2022</xref>) (Supplementary Fig. 3a), and very similarly yohimbine also suppressed locomotion and exploratory behaviors (Supplementary Fig. 3b). To directly compare the impact of stress and yohimbine injection on the transcriptomic response in the hippocampus, we then exposed mice to acute swim stress, or to yohimbine injection without stress exposure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). Yohimbine induced a clear and consistent transcriptional response in the dHC and vHC. Direct comparison between stress and yohimbine disclosed no significant differences (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d-e</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 2b), suggesting that yohimbine administration alone can mimic a large fraction of the stress-induced transcriptional response. To more specifically probe whether selective activation of the LC-NA system alone is sufficient to trigger the observed changes in gene expression, we turned to direct activation of the LC. First, we used the chemogenetic actuator hM3Dq (<xref rid="c69" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al. 2016</xref>) to trigger a strong and prolonged activation of the LC (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>). In support of previous work (<xref rid="c68" ref-type="bibr">Zerbi et al. 2019</xref>; <xref rid="c52" ref-type="bibr">Privitera et al. 2020</xref>), injection of an ultra-low dose of the potent hM3Dq-actuator clozapine (0.03 mg/kg) led to a strong cFos increase in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive LC neurons in hM3Dq+, but not in hM3Dq-animals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref>). Chemogenetic LC activation, similar to yohimbine, also induced an anxiety-like phenotype in the open field test (Supplementary Fig. 3c). Transcriptomic analysis revealed that chemogenetic LC activation induced significant transcriptomic changes that were similar in the dHC and vHC (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h</xref>). Overall, these transcriptional changes affected fewer genes than those observed after systemic noradrenergic activation by yohimbine administration.</p>

<p>Despite its specificity, chemogenetic LC activation does not provide the temporal control to restrict LC activation to shorter periods of time. Thus, we repeated the experiment using optogenetic LC activation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2i</xref>). To mimic stress-induced LC activity, LC neurons were unilaterally stimulated with 5 Hz in a 3 min off/on paradigm for 21 min, which has previously been shown to phenocopy stress-induced effects on behavior in mice (<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">McCall et al. 2015</xref>, <xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Again, tissue was collected 45 min after the start of stimulation, and in a separate cohort also 90 min afterwards, to study how LC-mediated responses evolve over time. Optogenetic LC activation led to a significant cFos increase only in the stimulated LC hemisphere of ChR2+ animals, and these changes were significant at both time points (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2j</xref>). Stimulated ChR2+ animals also showed a significant increase in the MHPG/NA ratio 45 and 90 min after stimulation onset compared to controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2k</xref>). Additionally, we found that tonic 5 Hz activation of the LC led to immediate pupil dilation in ChR2+, but not in ChR2-animals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2l</xref>), as previously described (<xref rid="c52" ref-type="bibr">Privitera et al. 2020</xref>). Unilateral 5 Hz stimulation also reduced exploratory rearing behaviors in ChR2+ animals in the open field test (Supplementary Fig. 3d). Similar to the effects of acute stress and chemogenetic LC activation, unilateral 5 Hz stimulation of the LC induced significant transcriptomic changes at the 45 min time point in the ipsilateral vHC of ChR2+ mice compared to controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2m</xref>). Notably, most of these changes disappeared again 90 min after stimulation onset, indicating that the LC-NA system mainly induces an early wave of transcriptomic changes in the hippocampus, which are not maintained over longer periods of time.</p>
<p>Next, we leveraged the extensive transcriptional data presented thus far to test which genes were consistently responsive to the various manipulations of the noradrenergic system across experiments. First, we compared gene expression changes induced by yohimbine, chemogenetic and optogenetic LC activation in the vHC. This allowed us to identify a small set of genes that are very consistently regulated across all modes of LC activation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2n</xref>). Second, we ranked genes across all the transcriptomic experiments according to their responsiveness to NA manipulations (based on p-value). This analysis includes acute stress exposure with pharmacological inhibition of NA receptors, as well as yohimbine treatment, chemogenetic and optogenetic LC activation. We then calculated the cumulative rank for each gene across all experiments to find genes with the most consistent response to NA manipulations (Supplementary table 1). This analysis reproduced most of the genes identified in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2n</xref>, and additionally revealed more genes with particularly robust changes in response to LC-NA manipulations across experiments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2o</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 4). The top 10 genes were <italic>Dio2</italic>, <italic>Ppp1r3c</italic>, <italic>Ppp1r3g</italic>, <italic>Sik1</italic>, <italic>Tsc22d3</italic>, <italic>Ppp1r3d</italic>, <italic>F3</italic>, <italic>Sertad1</italic>, <italic>Nr4a1</italic> and <italic>Timp3</italic>. For visualization, the top 4 of these genes are shown across all LC-NA manipulations in Supplementary Fig. 4. Going forward, we use this as a <italic>bona fide</italic> list of LC-NA-responsive genes.</p>
<p>Our optogenetic data have demonstrated that LC neurons engage transcriptomic responses when firing at 5 Hz. Recent work has suggested that the effects of LC stimulation on brain processes, from behavior to brain network activity, depend on the firing pattern and frequency of the LC (<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">Harley and Yuan 2021</xref>; <xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">Ghosh et al. 2021</xref>; <xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">Grimm et al. 2022</xref>). To investigate if the molecular responses would differ between these stimulation conditions, we optogenetically activated the LC using two tonic paradigms (3 and 5 Hz), and one phasic paradigm (15 Hz, see schematic in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). Stimulation was again conducted unilaterally in a 3 min off/on paradigm for 21 minutes for each of the stimulation groups, and tissue was collected for RNAseq 45 min after stimulation onset (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). To increase statistical power in the face of higher variability due to the relatively small sample sizes (n=5-6 mice per group), we restricted our analysis to the ten most LC-NA-responsive genes identified earlier. Surprisingly, we found that expression of these genes was mostly indiscriminately affected by tonic 3 Hz, 5 Hz and phasic 15 Hz LC stimulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3b</xref>). These findings suggest that in contrast to circuit-wide changes, the molecular consequences to NA release seem to be rather robust and not sensitive to different firing intensities of the LC. While these transcriptomic changes seem to depend on LC-NA activity, our approach so far was not able to resolve whether NA mediates gene expression via direct effects within the hippocampus. Specifically, due to the widespread projections of the LC, it is possible that activation of other brain regions or other neurotransmitter systems might have led to indirect regulation of gene expression in the hippocampus. Thus, we selectively targeted only a subpopulation of LC neurons projecting to the hippocampus (LC<sub>HC</sub>) using a unilateral, retrograde optogenetic approach (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). Retrograde virus expression was restricted to dorsomedially located LC neurons ipsilateral to the injection site (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>), as previously described (<xref rid="c53" ref-type="bibr">Robertson et al. 2013</xref>). To confirm successful LC<sub>HC</sub> stimulation, we directly assessed NA turnover in the cortex and dHC. Indeed, 5Hz stimulation of LC<sub>HC</sub> neurons led to an increased MHPG/NA ratio 45 min after stimulation onset in the ipsilateral dHC but not in the cortex (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). In addition, 5 Hz stimulation of LC<sub>HC</sub> neurons did not impact pupil size, emphasizing the modular organization of the LC (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>). Within the vHC of the same animals we then assessed the transcriptional impact of targeted LC<sub>HC</sub> 5 Hz activation on the top ten NA-sensitive genes in the vHC at the 45 min time point. Indeed, activation of hippocampus-projecting LC neurons affected most target genes, including <italic>Dio2</italic>, <italic>Ppp1r3c</italic> and <italic>Ppp1r3g</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g-h</xref>).</p>

<p>To understand in more detail how these genes are affected by stress we compared their expression across various publicly available datasets. First, we investigated whether the expression of <italic>Dio2, Ppp1r3c, Ppp1r3g, Sik1</italic> and <italic>Nr4a1</italic> is specific to acute swim stress exposure or independent of the stress context. Therefore, we compared their expression in a dataset comparing the effect of multiple stressors on the hippocampal transcriptome (<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">Floriou-Servou et al. 2018</xref>). We found that these genes are not only upregulated by swim stress, but also by novelty stress, restraint and footshock stress (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). This suggests that expression of these genes is robustly induced by a wide range of stressors.</p>

<p>We then interrogated a recently published stress resource, which tracks stress-induced transcriptional changes over time in the hippocampus (<xref rid="c70" ref-type="bibr">von Ziegler et al. 2022</xref>). Across 4 hours following acute swim stress exposure, we found two distinctive expression patterns among these genes. While <italic>Sik1</italic> and <italic>Nr4a1</italic> show the characteristics of an immediate early gene with a sharp rise and fall in expression within 90 min of stress onset, upregulation of <italic>Dio2, Ppp1r3c</italic> and <italic>Ppp1r3g</italic> is maintained for at least 2-4 hours following stress exposure (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>), suggesting that mechanisms are in place to prolong expression beyond the initial rise in NA.

<p>The widespread molecular changes induced in the brain by an acute stress exposure (<xref rid="c59" ref-type="bibr">Stankiewicz et al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="c70" ref-type="bibr">von Ziegler et al. 2022</xref>; <xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">Floriou-Servou et al. 2018</xref>; <xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">Mifsud et al. 2021</xref>) are part of a healthy stress response, and their dysregulation is often a hallmark of neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">Girgenti, Pothula, and Newton 2021</xref>; <xref rid="c55" ref-type="bibr">Rubin, Gray, and McEwen 2014</xref>). To date, the contribution of corticosteroid signaling to stress-induced transcriptional changes has been well characterized (<xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">Mifsud et al. 2021</xref>; <xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">Gray et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">Meijer et al. 2022</xref>), yet the contribution of other stress-mediators remains unexplored. Here, we extensively characterize the contribution of noradrenergic signaling to the transcriptomic response in the hippocampus during stress. By combining transcriptomics with circuit-specific manipulation of the LC-NA system, our unbiased approach reveals a small, but highly reproducible set of genes that are regulated directly by NA release from the LC. This gene set identifies astrocytes as a key target for NA-induced transcriptional changes.</p>

<sec id="s3b">
<title>Complex interactions between stress mediators</title>
<p>Our results indicate that the transcriptomic response to a natural stressor is more complex than the gene expression changes induced solely by NA. This is well in line with the notion that multiple stress-mediators contribute to the molecular response, and that these systems can also interact with each other. In this context, it is noteworthy that the response to LC-NA activation we observe in our experiments is short in duration. Following temporally-precise optogenetic LC activation, gene expression changes did resolve within 90 min. This is noticeably different from an actual stress response, where gene expression evolves over a 4-hour period (<xref rid="c70" ref-type="bibr">von Ziegler et al. 2022</xref>). Specifically, LC-NA regulated genes like <italic>Ppp1r3c, Ppp1r3g</italic> and <italic>Dio2</italic>, were elevated for several hours after stress exposure (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). This suggests that other stress-induced signals can also regulate these genes more slowly or with a greater delay. Indeed, a recent study reported that activation of the glucocorticoid receptor by dexamethasone can induce strong transcriptomic changes 4 hours after injection across multiple brain regions (<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">Gerstner et al. 2022</xref>). Analyzing their data we found that <italic>Dio2</italic>, <italic>Ppp1r3c</italic> and <italic>Ppp1r3g</italic> were all upregulated 4 hours after dexamethasone injection. This supports the concept that NA can act as a rapid molecular regulator, whereas glucocorticoid signaling can extend these stress-induced changes over longer time periods (<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">Hermans et al. 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to the small set of genes triggered by isolated LC-NA activation, blocking β-receptors prevents the induction of a large fraction of genes normally activated by natural stressors. This suggests that even if NA release alone is not sufficient to activate large numbers of genes, it is required to enable or enhance gene expression triggered via other mechanisms. A powerful regulator of transcription is neuronal activity linked to enhanced glutamate release (<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">Fernandez-Albert et al. 2019</xref>; <xref rid="c62" ref-type="bibr">Tyssowski et al. 2018</xref>). The notion that NA release could enhance glutamate-dependent transcriptional cascades is in line with physiological evidence that NA can increase the excitability of neurons (<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">Bouret and Sara 2002</xref>), and with the “glutamate amplifies noradrenergic effects” (GANE) model, which posits that NA can amplify local glutamate release to create hot-spots of activity (<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">Mather et al. 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, our observation that systemic administration of the α2-adrenergic receptor antagonist yohimbine very closely recapitulates the transcriptional response to stress stands in contrast to the much more selective transcriptional changes observed after chemogenetic or optogenetic LC-NA activation. This difference could in part be due to the fact that systemic yohimbine injection will also antagonize postsynaptic α2-adrenergic receptors. This could have a more widespread impact on the hippocampus (and other brain regions) than isolated LC-NA activation, further enhancing excitability by preventing α2-mediated inhibition of cAMP production. Additionally, systemic yohimbine administration and noradrenergic activity have been shown to induce corticosterone release into the blood (<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">Johnston, Baldwin, and File 1988</xref>; <xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">Leibowitz et al. 1988</xref>; <xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">Fink 2016</xref>), while propranolol does not (<xref rid="c64" ref-type="bibr">Villain et al. 2018</xref>). Thus, yohimbine injection could have broader transcriptional consequences, including corticosteroid-mediated effects on gene expression.</p>

<title>Transcriptomic fingerprinting of NA effects using LC circuit manipulation</title>
<p>While systemic pharmacological treatments have been a common approach in studying the effects of different stress mediators and their receptors, they lack specificity and do not provide causal evidence that the release of a given stress mediator is sufficient to trigger molecular changes. By directly combining selective chemogenetic activation of the LC with transcriptomic analyses in the hippocampus, we were able to identify a subset of stress-responsive genes that depend on β-adrenergic signaling, and which can be triggered by NA alone in the absence of a physiological stress response. Using optogenetics we were able to validate these findings and further demonstrate that the strongest NA-mediated changes are similarly affected by tonic (3 Hz and 5 Hz) and phasic (15 Hz) LC stimulation. Interestingly, this is in contrast with our previous findings that these stimulation patterns differentially affect brain network connectivity (<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">Grimm and Duss et al, 2022</xref>). This suggests that engagement of a transcriptomic response via β-adrenergic receptors seems common across these LC activity patterns, while changes on a network level might rely more on α1-mediated effects (<xref rid="c68" ref-type="bibr">Zerbi et al. 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>We found that direct activation of hippocampus-projecting LC neurons (LC<sub>HC</sub>) was sufficient to increase expression of our top target genes, suggesting that local LC-NA release in the hippocampus is directly contributing to these changes during stress. While we did not extensively characterize LC<sub>HC</sub> neurons, our data further show that in contrast to whole LC activation with 5 Hz, LC<sub>HC</sub> neurons do not seem to project to the cortex nor do they affect pupil size.</p>

<title>Differences in the noradrenergic response across the hippocampal axis and sex</title>
<p>Our results suggest that the transcriptomic response is independent of sex, and uniform across the dorsal and ventral hippocampus. However, due to the multivariate design and our genome-wide approach, subtle changes might not have survived multiple-testing correction, particularly given that our study was not sufficiently powered to specifically identify sex differences. An example for this is the expression of <italic>Ctla2b</italic>, a gene which has previously been shown to be dependent on β-adrenergic signaling and selectively increased in females after stress exposure (<xref rid="c54" ref-type="bibr">Roszkowski et al. 2016</xref>). Indeed, targeted interrogation of our dataset shows that <italic>Ctla2b</italic> is increased by stress only in females but not males, yet this effect fails to pass multiple testing correction (Supplementary Fig. 6). Similarly, it is possible that subtle differences exist between dHC and vHC. As our data are publicly available, they can be used for targeted hypothesis testing of individual genes to generate leads for follow-up work.</p>

<title>LC-NA targeted genes</title>
<p>Across experiments, our transcriptomic screening revealed a conserved set of genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2o</xref>, Supplementary table 1) that are selectively regulated by NA from LC projections in the hippocampus following acute stress exposure. Cross-referencing our data with publicly available single-cell databases suggests that - among the top ten LC-NA sensitive genes - most are enriched in astrocytes (<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">Endo et al. 2022</xref>; <xref rid="c70" ref-type="bibr">von Ziegler et al. 2022</xref>). Interestingly, immediate early genes commonly upregulated during stress and associated with neuronal activation like <italic>Fos</italic>, <italic>Egr1</italic>, <italic>Arc</italic>, <italic>Dusp1</italic> and <italic>Npas4</italic> (<xref rid="c58" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al. 1992</xref>; <xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">Benito and Barco 2015</xref>; <xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">Fernandez-Albert et al. 2019</xref>; <xref rid="c62" ref-type="bibr">Tyssowski et al. 2018</xref>), are not upregulated by LC activation (Supplementary Fig. 5). Taken together, our findings further add to accumulating evidence highlighting astrocytes as a direct and major cellular target of the LC-NA system (<xref rid="c67" ref-type="bibr">Zenger et al. 2017</xref>; <xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr">O’Donnell, Ding, and Nedergaard 2015</xref>; <xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">Dienel 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Our screen revealed <italic>Dio2</italic> as the most prominent target influenced by LC activity. <italic>Dio2</italic> is selectively expressed in astrocytes and encodes for the intracellular type II iodothyronine deiodinase, which converts thyroxine (T4) to the bioactive thyroid hormone 3,3’,5-triiodothyronine (T3) and therefore regulates the local availability of T3 in the brain (<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">Bianco et al. 2019</xref>). Enzymatic activity of DIO2 has further been shown to be increased by prolonged noradrenergic transmission through desipramine treatment in LC projection areas (<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">Campos-Barros et al. 1994</xref>). This suggests that the LC-NA system and its widespread projections could act as a major regulator of brain-derived T3. Along the same line, we found that three subunits of the astrocytic protein phosphatase 1 (<italic>Ppp1r3d</italic>, <italic>Ppp1r3g</italic> and <italic>Ppp1r3c</italic>) respond strongly to LC-NA activity. All three subunits enhance protein phosphatase 1 mediated glycogen synthesis. Especially <italic>Ppp1r3c</italic> expression has been found to be a master regulator of astrocytic glycogen synthesis and has previously been linked to NA activity (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">Allaman, Pellerin, and Magistretti 2000</xref>; <xref rid="c49" ref-type="bibr">Petit et al. 2021</xref>). Another important mechanism might include regulating sodium homeostasis via the widely expressed salt-inducible kinase 1 (<italic>Sik1</italic>). SIK1 has been shown to respond to neuronal activity and regulate Na+/K+-ATPase activity (<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">Jaitovich and Bertorello 2010</xref>; <xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">Huang, White, and Leenen 2012</xref>; <xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">Feldman et al. 2000</xref>; <xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">Bertorello and Zhu 2009</xref>). It was also found to detect low glucose availability and initiate gluconeogenesis in liver cells (<xref rid="c65" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. 2020</xref>), a process which could also be important for noradrenergic activity in the brain. Our findings support the idea of the LC-NA system as a major regulator of brain-wide energy metabolism, stimulating astrocytic glycogen breakdown and consequently increasing energy supply to target areas (<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">Coggan et al. 2018</xref>; <xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">Dienel 2017</xref>). Another interesting molecular target is the Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4 Group A Member 1 (<italic>Nr4a1</italic>), a widely expressed transcription factor that could trigger broader downstream changes. Within astrocytes, Nr4a1 activity was found to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation (<xref rid="c66" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">Popichak et al. 2018</xref>) and might further regulate blood brain barrier integrity (<xref rid="c48" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al. 2021</xref>; <xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">Paillasse and de Medina 2015</xref>). Our re-analysis of published data showed that <italic>Dio2</italic>, <italic>Ppp1r3c</italic>, <italic>Ppp1r3g</italic> and <italic>Nr4a1</italic> are actively translated in somatosensory cortical astrocytes following acute stress exposure. However, it remains to be tested whether protein levels, transcription factor activity or enzymatic activity of these genes are also altered in the hippocampus, and what this ultimately means mechanistically for stress-related NA signaling.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>Overall, we provide the first genome-wide characterization of the molecular impact of NA release in vivo in the brain. The set of genes that are sensitive to NA release from the LC point to astrocytes as key molecular targets of NA during stress, and suggest that astrocytic processes involving glycogen and thyroid hormone metabolism could be key to the neuromodulatory effects of NA in the hippocampus.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>All experiments were conducted in accordance with the Swiss federal guidelines for the use of animals in research and under licenses ZH161/17, ZH106/20 and ZH067/2022 approved by the Zurich Cantonal veterinary office. For experiments with wild type animals, 2-3 month old C57Bl/6J mice were obtained directly from Janvier (France). For experiments involving chemo- and optogenetic LC manipulations, heterozygous C57BL/6-Tg(Dbh-icre)1Gsc mice were kept in breeding trios with wild-type C57BL/6J mice at the ETH Zurich animal facility (EPIC). All mice were housed in groups of 2-5 per cage in a temperature- and humidity-controlled facility on a 12-hour reversed light-dark cycle (lights off: 9:15 am; lights on: 9:15 pm), with food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>, and used for experiments at the age of 2-4 months. All experiments were conducted during the animals’ active (dark) phase. For all experiments, mice were single-housed 24 hours before exposure to stress or LC activation, which reduces corticosterone levels in both sexes, and avoids confounding gene expression effects from social stressors (<xref rid="c54" ref-type="bibr">Roszkowski et al. 2016</xref>; <xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">Bohacek et al. 2015</xref>).</p>

<title>Stereotactic Surgeries</title>
<p>For experiments involving hippocampal infusions, female C57BL/6-Tg(Dbh-icre)1Gsc mice at the age of 2-3 months were subjected to stereotactic surgery. The mice were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane and then placed in a stereotaxic frame with continuous anesthesia of 2% isoflurane. For analgesia, animals received a subcutaneous injection of 5 mg/kg Meloxicam and buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg), as well as application of the local analgesics lidocaine (2 mg/kg) and bupivacaine (2 mg/kg) before and after surgery. After the skull was exposed, bregma (defined as the intersection of the coronal and sagittal suture) was located and the skull placement corrected for tilt and scaling. Bilateral holes were drilled above the hippocampus at −1.8 mm AP and +/− 1.5 mm ML from bregma, followed by the implantation of a bilateral guide cannula (62036, RWD Life Science, China) into the hippocampus (coordinates from bregma: −1.8 mm AP, +/− 1.5 mm ML, −1.5 mm DV).</p>
<p>For chemo- and optogenetic experiments male C57BL/6-Tg(Dbh-icre)1Gsc mice at the age of 2-3 months were subjected to stereotactic surgery. The mice were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane and then placed in a stereotaxic frame with continuous anesthesia of 2% isoflurane. For analgesia, animals received a subcutaneous injection of 5 mg/kg Meloxicam and a local anesthetic (Emla cream; 5% lidocaine, 5% prilocaine) before and after surgery. After the skull was exposed, bregma was located and the skull placement corrected for tilt and scaling. Bilateral (chemogenetics) or unilateral (Right hemisphere, optogenetics) small holes were drilled above the LC at −5.4 mm AP and 0.9 mm ML from bregma. A pneumatic injector (Narishige, IM-11-2) and calibrated microcapillaries (Sigma-Aldrich, P0549) were then used to inject 1 μL of virus to the LC (coordinates from bregma: −5.4 mm AP, ± 1.0 mm ML, −3.8 mm DV). All Viral vectors were obtained from the Viral Vector Facility (VVF) of the Neuroscience Center Zurich. For chemogenetic experiments, either ssAAV-5/2-hSyn1-dlox-hM3D(Gq)_mCherry(rev)-dlox-WPRE-hGHp(A) (hM3Dq+) or ssAAV-5/2-hSyn1-dlox-mCherry(rev)-dlox-WPRE-hGHp(A) (hM3Dq-) were injected bilaterally.</p>
<p>For optogenetic experiments, ssAAV-5/2-hEF1α-dlox-hChR2(H134R)_EYFP(rev)-dlox-WPRE-hGHp(A) (ChR2+) or ssAAV-5/2-hEF1a-dloxEGFP(rev)-dlox-WPRE-bGHp(A) (ChR2-) were delivered unilaterally to the right hemisphere locus coeruleus. For retrograde activation of hippocampus projecting LC neurons, animals received one injection of either ssAAV-retro/2-hEF1a-dlox-hChR2(H134R)_EYFP(rev)-dlox-WPRE-hGHp(A) (ChR2+) or ssAAV-retro/2-hEF1a-dlox-mCherry(rev)-dlox-WPRE-hGHp(A) (ChR2-) to the ipsilateral dHC (coordinates from bregma: −2.10 mm AP, 1.5 mm ML; −1.8 mm DV) and vHC (coordinates from bregma: −3.30 mm AP, 2.75 mm ML; −4.0 mm DV). Additionally, all optogenetic animals were unilaterally implanted with an optic fiber (200 μm diameter, 0.22 NA) above the LC (coordinates from bregma: −5.4 mm AP, 0.9 mm ML, −3.5 mm DV). The health of all animals was monitored over the course of 3 consecutive days post-surgery. Experiments on operated animals were conducted 4-8 weeks post-surgery to allow for recovery and sufficient virus expression. All viruses were obtained from the Viral Vector Facility of the University of Zurich and ETH Zurich.</p>

<title>Drug injections/infusions</title>
<p>All drugs were freshly prepared immediately before experiments and dissolved in phosphate-buffered 0.9% saline (Gibco, pH 7.4). Drugs were administered intraperitoneally at their corresponding dosages: Yohimbine-Hydrochloride (3 mg/kg, Merck, Germany), Propranolol-Hydrochloride (10 mg/kg, Merck, Germany), Prazosin-Hydrochloride (1 mg/kg, Merck, Germany) and Clozapine (0.03mg/kg, Merck, Germany).</p>
<p>For intra-hippocampal infusions of isoproterenol hydrochloride (Merck, Germany), animals were restrained and the guide cannula was inserted with an injector needle (62236, RWD Life Science, China) connected to an infusion pump (R462 Syringe Pump, RWD Life Science, China) via plastic tubing. Prior to attachment, the tubing was filled with sunflower seed oil (Merck, Germany) and vehicle (0.9% saline) or isoproterenol, separated by a small air bubble. Afterwards, animals were allowed to freely roam their home cage for 2 minutes followed by bilateral intra-hippocampal infusions of vehicle drug or 1 μl of isoproterenol (3 μg/μl diluted in phosphate-buffered 0.9% saline) at 50 μl/min. Diffusion of vehicle and isoproterenol was allowed for another 2 min, before the animal was detached from the infusion setup and returned to its homecage.</p>

<title>Forced swim test</title>
<p>For the forced cold swim stress, mice were placed for 6 min in a plastic beaker (20 cm diameter, 25 cm deep) filled with 18 ± 0.1°C water to 17 cm, in a room with dim red lighting. Immediately after stress exposure, mice returned to their assigned single-housing homecage.</p>

<title>Open field test (OFT)</title>
<p>Open-field testing was performed in a square 45 cm (l) × 45 cm (w) × 40 cm (h) arena, and consisted of four black Plexiglas walls and a white PVC floor. Mice were tested under dim lighting (5 lux at the center of the arena). Mice were placed directly into the center of the open field and the tracking/recording was initiated 2 seconds after the mouse was detected. The test lasted 10 min for acute stress exposed animals, 21 min for yohimbine and optogenetic stimulated animals and 30 min for chemogenetic stimulated animals. Distance, time in center, supported and unsupported rearings were tracked by the software EthoVision XT14 (Noldus, Netherlands) and manual scoring. For pharmacological and chemogenetic experiments, animals received an i.p injection of yohimbine (3 mg/kg) or clozapine (0.03 mg/kg) immediately before being placed into the arena. For optogenetic experiments, animals were attached to the optic fiber and directly placed into the arena.</p>

<title>Tissue collection</title>
<p>At the appropriate time point after initiation of stress (for immediate groups within maximum 1 min after offset of stress) or LC activation, mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation and decapitation. The brain was quickly dissected on a cold glass plate and isolated hippocampi were separated by a cut at a ratio of 1:2 to divide the dHC and vHC. For experiments that were analyzed with uHPLC additionally the whole cortex was also collected. Isolated tissues were then snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until further processing. For immunohistochemistry, the hindbrain (containing the LC) was isolated with a single cut from a razor blade at the beginning of the cerebellum and directly transferred to a tube with 4% paraformaldehyde solution.</p>

<sec id="s4i">
<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>LC containing hindbrain samples were fixed for 2 hours in ice-cold paraformaldehyde solution (4% PFA in PBS, pH 7.4). The tissue then was rinsed with PBS and stored in a sucrose solution (30% sucrose in PBS) at 4°C, overnight. The tissue was frozen in tissue mounting medium (Tissue-Tek O.C.T Compound, Sakura Finetek Europe B.V., Netherlands), and sectioned coronally using a cryostat (Leica CM3050 S, Leica Biosystems Nussloch GmbH) into 40 μm thick sections. The sections were immediately transferred into ice-cold PBS. LC containing sections were stained in primary antibody solution with 0.05% Triton X-100, and 4% normal goat serum in PBS at 4C under continuous agitation over 2 nights. The primary antibodies used were: mouse anti-TH (22941, Immunostar, 1:1000), chicken anti-GFP (ab13970, Abcam, 1:1000) and rabbit anti-cFOS (226 003, Synaptic Systems, 1:5000). Afterwards, the sections were washed 3 times in PBS, and transferred to secondary antibody solution containing 0.05% Triton X-100, and 4% normal goat serum in PBS. The secondary antibodies used were: goat anti-mouse Alexa 488 (ab150113, Abcam, 1:300), goat anti-mouse Cy3 (115-165-003, Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:300), goat anti-chicken Alexa 488 (A-11039, Thermo Fischer Scientific, 1:300), goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 (A-11008 Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1:500), goat anti-rabbit Alexa 546 (A-11035, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1:300) and donkey anti-mouse Alexa 647 (A-31571, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1:300). Nissl was stained by NeuroTrace 640/660 Nissl stain (N21483, Thermo Fisher Scientific). After 3 more PBS washes, the sections were mounted onto glass slides (Menzel-Glaser SUPERFROST PLUS, Thermo Scientific), air-dried and coverslipped with Dako fluorescence mounting medium (Agilent Technologies).

<title>Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (uHPLC)</title>
<p>To quantify noradrenergic (NA; MHPG) compounds from cortical and hippocampal tissue, a reversed-phase uHPLC system coupled with electrochemical detection (RP-uHPLC-ECD) was used (Alexys™ Neurotransmitter Analyzer, Antec Leyden, Zoeterwoude, Netherlands). In short, our previously validated RP-HPLC method with ion pairing chromatography was applied as described (Van Dam et al., 2014), albeit with minor modifications regarding the installed column (BEH C18 Waters column, 150 mm x 1 mm, 1.7 μm particle size) and pump preference (LC110S pump, 470-480 bar; flow rate of 62 L/min), achieving the most optimal separation conditions in a RP-UHPLC setting. Brain samples were defrosted to 4°C and subsequently homogenized in 800-900 μL ice-cold sample buffer (50 mM citric acid, 50 mM phosphoric acid, 0.1 mM EDTA, 8 mM KCl and 1.8 mM octane-1-sulfonic acid sodium salt (OSA), adjusted to pH = 3.6), using a Precellys® Minilys Personal Tissue Homogenizer (Bertin Technologies™, France) with CK14 1.4 mm ceramic beads (40-60 sec approximately, full speed). To remove excess proteins, 450 mL homogenate was transferred onto a 10,000 Da Amicon Ultra 0.5 Centrifugal Filter (Millipore, Ireland) that had been pre-washed twice using 450 μL sample buffer (centrifugation: 14,000 x g, 20 min, 4°C). The Amicon filter loaded with the homogenate was then centrifuged (14,000 x g, 20 min, 4°C). Finally, the filtrate was transferred into a polypropylene vial (0.3 mL, Machery-Nagel GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Germany) and automatically injected into the uHPLC column by the Alexys AS110 Autosampler (5 μL sample loop).

RNA integrity was assessed with high sensitivity RNA screen tape on an Agilent Tape Station/Bioanalyzer, according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The RIN values of all samples ranged from 8.4 to 10.0. For library preparation, the TruSeq stranded RNA kit (Illumina Inc.) was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For bulk sequencing library preparation, the TruSeq stranded RNA kit (Illumina Inc.) was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The mRNA was purified by polyA selection, chemically fragmented and transcribed into cDNA before adapter ligation. Single-end (100nt) sequencing was performed with HiSeq 4000. Samples within experiments were each run on one or multiple lanes and demultiplexed. A sequencing depth of ~20M reads per sample was used. Bulk mRNA sequencing for experiments shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1g-h</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> were performed at Novogene UK. Total RNA samples were used for library preparation using NEB Next® Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina®. Indices were included to multiplex multiple samples. Briefly, mRNA was purified from total RNA using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads. After fragmentation, the first strand cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer primers followed by the second strand cDNA synthesis. The library was ready after end repair, A-tailing, adapter ligation, and size selection. After amplification and purification, insert size of the library was validated on an Agilent 2100 and quantified using quantitative PCR (Q-PCR). Libraries were then sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 S4 flowcell with PE150 according to results from library quality control and expected data volume. Samples within experiments were each run on one or multiple lanes and demultiplexed. A sequencing depth of ~40M reads per sample was used.</p>
<p>For all experiments, adapters were trimmed using cutadapt (<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">Martin 2011</xref>) with a maximum error rate of 0.05 and a minimum length of 15. Kallisto (v0.44.0) (<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">Bray et al. 2016</xref>) was used for pseudo alignment of reads on the transcriptome level using the genecode.vM17 assembly with 30 bootstrap samples and an estimated fragment length of 200 ± 20 for single-end samples. For differential gene expression (DGE) analysis we aggregated reads of protein coding transcripts and used R (v. 4.0.3) with the package “edgeR” (v 3.32.1) for analysis. A filter was used to remove genes with low expression prior to DGE analysis. EdgeR was then used to calculate the normalization factors (TMM method) and estimate the dispersion (by weighted likelihood empirical Bayes). For two group comparisons the genewise exact test was used, for more complex designs we used a generalized linear model (GLM) with empirical Bayes quasi-likelihood F-tests.

For analyses of data-sets originating from multiple experiments we further employed SVA correction to correct for processing specific effects (<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">Leek et al. 2012</xref>). Surrogate variables independent of experimental groups were identified using the SVA package (v3.38.0) on data after DESeq2 (v1.30.1) variance-stabilization (<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">Love, Huber, and Anders 2014</xref>), and were then included as additive terms in the GLMs. Heatmaps were produced with the SECHM (v1.5.1) package. To avoid rare extreme values from driving the scale, the color scale is linear for values within a 98% interval, and ordinal for values outside it. Unless otherwise specified, the rows were sorted using the features’ angle on a two-dimensional projection of the plotted values, as implemented in SEtools (v1.9.4).</p>
<p>For the combined analysis of consistent effects across yohimbine injection, chemogenetic and optogenetic stimulation we first combined all three datasets and modeled batch effects using SVA correction. We then designed a combined response variable that was set to control (homecage in the injection experiment, hM3Dq-in chemogenetic and ChR2-in optogenetic) or response (yohimbine in the injection experiment, hM3Dq+ in chemogenetic and ChR2+ in optogenetic). We then fit an additive generalized linear model with the newly defined response variable and the surrogate variables from the SVA correction and tested it for the response variable coefficient.</p>
<p>For the cumulative rank analysis, statistical results were used from multiple analyses (Stress group vs propranolol group in vHC of the first injection experiment; Stress group vs propranolol group in dHC of the first injection experiment; Stress:Propranolol interaction in second injection experiment; effect of chemogenetic LC activation in vHC; effect of chemogenetic LC activation in dHC; effect of optogenetic LC activation after 45 minutes). Then, in each analysis the gene with the lowest p-value was set to rank 1, the one with the highest to rank N. These ranks were then summed up across all analyses to generate the cumulative rank.</p>

<title>Reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)</title>
<p>Reactions were conducted using SYBR green (Roche) on a CFX384 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad) and normalized against Tubulin delta 1 (Tubd1). Cycling conditions were 5 min at 95 °C, then 50 cycles with denaturation (10 s at 95 °C), annealing (10 s at 60 °C), and elongation (10 s at 72 °C). Primers were designed using PrimerBlast (<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">Kozyreva et al. 2021</xref>) and tested for quality and specificity by melt-curve analysis, gel electrophoresis and appropriate negative controls. Forward (FP) and reverse (RP) primer sequences were as follows:</p>
<p>Tubd1: FP: TCTCTTGCTAACTTGGTGGTCCTC / RP: GCTGGGTCTTTAAATCCCTCTACG</p>
<p>Apold1: FP: ACCTCAGGCTCTCCTTCCATCATC / RP: ACCCGAGACAAAGCACCAATGC</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>We used a block design for experiments. Animals and samples were split into multiple blocks, containing one replicate of each condition. Experimental and processing order within these blocks was randomized. Investigators were blinded during behavior and sample processing, but not during the analysis process. However, the same algorithmic analysis methods were used for all samples within each sequencing experiment. Analysis was performed in R or GraphPad Prism 9.2.0. For statistical analyses of behavior, pupillometry, immunohistochemistry and uHPLC data, we used independent samples t tests when comparing two independent groups. When comparing more than two groups we used one-way ANOVAs if there was a single independent variable, or two-way ANOVAs for two-factorial designs (e.g., injection x group). Significant main effects and interactions were analyzed using Tukey’s post hoc tests. For linear model analysis we used the function lm() from the “stats” package in R and F-statistics for significance testing. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. No data were excluded from the analyses.</p>

<p>This manuscript provides novel and <bold>important</bold> findings regarding the impact of noradrenergic signaling from the locus coeruleus on hippocampal gene expression. The locus coeruleus is the sole source of noradrenaline to the hippocampus and many rapid molecular changes induced by stress are regulated by noradrenaline. This manuscript provides a rigorous investigation into hippocampal genes uniquely regulated by noradrenaline in the presence or absence of stress. Data were collected and analyses were performed using <bold>solid</bold> methodology, and the results mostly <bold>convincingly</bold> support the conclusion made with few weaknesses. The study would benefit from a more comprehensive analyses of sex differences.</p>

<p>Privitera et al., provide a comprehensive and rigorous assessment of how noradrenaline (NA) inputs from the locus coeruleus (LC) to the hippocampus regulate stress-induced acute changes in gene expression. They utilize RNA-sequencing with selective activation/inhibition of LC-NA activity using pharmacological, chemogenetic and optogenetic manipulations to identify a great number of reproducible sets of genes impacted by LC activation. It is noteworthy that this study compares transcriptomic changes in the hippocampus induced by stress alone, as compared with selective circuit activation/inhibition. This reveals a small set of genes that were found to be highly reproducible. Further, the publicly available data will be highly useful to the scientific community.</p>
<p>A major strength of the study is the inclusion of both males and females. However, with this aspect of the study also lies the biggest weakness. While the experiments tested males and females, they were not powered for identifying sex differences. There are vast amounts of literature documenting the inherent sex differences, both under resting and stress-evoked conditions, in the LC-NA system and this is a major missed opportunity to better understand if there is an impact of these sex-specific differences at the genetic level in a major LC projection region. There are many instances whereby sex effects are apparent, but do not pass multiple testing correction due to low n's. The authors highlight one of them (Ctla2b) in supplemental figure 6. This gene is only upregulated by stress in females. It is appreciated that the manuscript provides an incredible amount of novel data, making the investigation of sex differences ambitious. Data are publicly available for others to conduct follow up work, and therefore it may be useful if a list of those genes that were different based on targeted interrogation of the dataset be provided with a clear statement that multiple testing corrections failed. This will aid further investigations that are powered to evaluate sex effects.</p>
<p>A major finding of the present study is the involvement of noradrenergic transcriptomic changes occurring in astrocytic genes in the hippocampus. Given the stated importance of this finding within the discussion, it seems that some additional dialogue integrating this with current literature about the role of astrocytes in the hippocampus during stress or fear memory would be important.</p>
<p>The comparison of the candidate genes activated by the LC in the present study (swim) with datasets published by Floriou-Servou et al., 2018 (Novelty, swim, restraint, and footshock) is an interesting and important comparison. Were there other stressors identified in this paper or other publications that do not regulate these candidate genes? Further, can references be added to clarify to the reader, that prior studies have identified that novelty, restraint and footshock all activate LC-NA neurons.</p>
<p>Comparisons are made between chemogenetic studies and yohimbine, stating that fewer genes were activated by chemogenetic activation of LC neurons. There is clear justification for why this may occur, but a caveat may need to be mentioned, that evidence of neuronal activation in the LC by each of these methods were conducted at 90 (yohimbine) versus 45 (hM3Dq) minutes, and therefore it cannot be ruled out that differences in LC-NA activity levels might also contribute.</p>
<p>
Please add information about how virus or cannula placement was confirmed in these studies. Were missed placements also analyzed separately?</p>
<p>Time of day for tissue collection used in genetic analysis should be reported for all studies conducted or reanalyzed.</p>

<p>The present manuscript investigates the implication of locus coeruleus-noradrenaline system in the stress-induced transcriptional changes of dorsal and ventral hippocampus, combining pharmacological, chemogenetic, and optogenetic techniques. Authors have revealed that stress-induced release of noradrenaline from locus coeruleus plays a modulatory role in the expression of a large scale of genes in both ventral and dorsal hippocampus through activation of β-adrenoreceptors. Similar transcriptional responses were observed after optogenetic and chemogenetic stimulation of locus coeruleus. Among all the genes analysed, authors identified the most affected ones in response to locus coeruleus-noradrenaline stimulation as being Dio2, Ppp1r3c, Ppp1r3g, Sik1, and Nr4a1. By comparing their transcriptomic data with publicly available datasets, authors revealed that these genes were upregulated upon exposure to different stressors. Additionally, authors found that upregulation of Ppp1r3c, Ppp1r3g, and Dio2 genes following swim stress was sustained from 90 min up to 2-4 hours after stress and that it was predominantly restricted to hippocampal astrocytes, while Sik1 and Nr4a1 genes showed a broader cellular expression and a sharp rise and fall in expression, within 90 min of stress onset.</p>
<p>Overall, the paper is well written and provides a useful inventory of dorsal and ventral hippocampal gene expression upregulated by activation of LC-NA system, which can be used as starting point for more functional studies related to the effects of stress-induced physiological and pathological changes. However, I believe that the study would have benefited of a more comprehensive analyses of sex differences. Experiments in females were conducted only in one experiment and analyses restricted to the ventral hippocampus. Although, the experiments were overall sound and the results broadly support the conclusion made, I think some methodological choices should be better explained and rationalized. For instance, the study focuses on identifying transcriptional changes in the hippocampus induced by stress-mediated activation of the LC-NA system, however NA release following stress exposure and pharmacological or optogenetic manipulation was mostly measured in the cortex. Furthermore, behavioral changes following systemic pharmacologic or chemogenetic manipulation were observed in the open field task immediately after peripheral injections of yohimbine or CNO, respectively. Is this timing sufficient for both drugs to cross the blood brain barrier and to exert behavioral effects? Finally, the study shows that activation of noradrenergic hippocampus-projecting LC neurons is sufficient to regulate the expression of several hippocampal genes, although the necessity of these projection to induce the observed transcriptional effects has been tested to some extent through systemic blockade of beta-adrenoceptor, I believe the study would have benefited of more selective (optogenetic or chemogenetic) necessity experiments.</p>
