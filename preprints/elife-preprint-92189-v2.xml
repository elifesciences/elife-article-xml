<title>Abstract</title><p>During macroautophagy, cytoplasmic constituents are engulfed by autophagosomes. Lysosomes fuse with closed autophagosomes but not with unclosed intermediate structures. This is achieved in part by the late recruitment of the autophagosomal SNARE syntaxin 17 (STX17) to mature autophagosomes. However, how STX17 recognizes autophagosome maturation is not known. Here, we show that this temporally regulated recruitment of STX17 depends on the positively charged C-terminal region of STX17. Consistent with this finding, mature autophagosomes are more negatively charged compared with unclosed intermediate structures. This electrostatic maturation of autophagosomes is likely driven by the accumulation of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) in the autophagosomal membrane. Accordingly, dephosphorylation of autophagosomal PI4P prevents the association of STX17 to autophagosomes. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations support PI4P-dependent membrane insertion of the transmembrane helices of STX17. Based on these findings, we propose a model in which STX17 recruitment to mature autophagosomes is temporally regulated by a PI4P-driven change in the surface charge of autophagosomes.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>We added the result of an experiment using the PI 4-kinase inhibitor NC03 (<xref rid="figs4-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1</xref>), which shows no significant effect on the autophagosomal PI4P level and STX17 recruitment.
We performed the molecular dynamics simulation using membranes with phosphatidylinositol, a negatively charged lipid. STX17 TM approached the PI-containing membrane but was not inserted into the membrane within a time scale of 100 ns in simulations of all five structures (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">F</xref>, Video 3).
We have added the number of independent experimental repeats in the figure legends.
We monitored the association of GFP-STX17TM with liposomes in the presence or absence of 1 M NaCl and found that it was blocked in a high ionic buffer (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). This data supports the electrostatic interaction of STX17 with membranes.
We confirmed that the CERT(PHD)(W33A) mutant, which is deficient for PI4P binding (Sugiki et al., JBC. 2012), was diffusely present in the cytosol and did not localize to STX17-positive autophagosomes (<xref rid="figs3-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 2A</xref>).
We examined the localization of STX17 TM and the PI4P probe CERT(PHD) in ATG8 family (LC3/GABARAP) hexa KO HeLa cells that were established by the Lazarou lab (Nguyen et al., JCB 2016). As in WT cells, STX17 TM and CERT(PHD) were still colocalized with each other in hexa KO cells, suggesting that neither STX17 recruitment nor PI4P enrichment depends on ATG8 family proteins (<xref rid="figs3-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 2F</xref>).</p></fn>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Macroautophagy (hereafter, autophagy) is a highly conserved process of intracellular degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49"><italic>Mizushima and Levine</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67"><italic>Soreng et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). Membrane cisternae (called isolation membranes or phagophores) elongate, bend, and engulf cytoplasmic components. Closure of the rim of the cup-shaped structures results in the formation of autophagosomes. Subsequently, the autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes to degrade their enclosed contents. Autophagosomeâlysosome fusion is strictly regulated; lysosomes fuse with only fully closed autophagosomes. If lysosomes were to fuse with intermediate unclosed structures and their inner membrane is degraded, then harmful lysosomal enzymes would leak out into the cytosol. This temporal regulation of autophagosomeâlysosome fusion is achieved in mammals by two mechanisms. One is the regulated translocation of the autophagosomal SNARE syntaxin 17 (STX17), which is recruited immediately before or after the closure of autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29"><italic>Itakura et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71"><italic>TakÃ¡ts et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72"><italic>Tsuboyama et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). The other is the activation of YKT6, a conserved autophagosomal SNARE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48"><italic>Matsui et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>), which is kept inactivated by ULK1 (a homolog of yeast Atg1)-mediated phosphorylation until the completion of autophagosome formation (ULK1/Atg1 is dissociated at this time) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7"><italic>Barz et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19"><italic>Gao et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61"><italic>Sanchez-Martin et al.</italic>, 2023</xref>). Then, STX17 interacts with SNAP29 and the lysosomal SNARE protein VAMP7 or VAMP8, and YKT6 interacts with SNAP29 and the lysosomal STX7 to mediate the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes.</p>
<p>However, the molecular mechanism underlying the late recruitment of STX17 is not known. A previous study reported that LC3/GABARAP family proteins and immunity-related GTPase M (IRGM) are involved in autophagosomal recruitment of STX17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37"><italic>Kumar et al.</italic>, 2018a</xref>), whereas other studies have shown that LC3/GABARAP family proteins are not required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52"><italic>Nguyen et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72"><italic>Tsuboyama et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). It has also been recently reported that phosphorylation of STX17 and binding to filamin A are important for STX17 recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76"><italic>Wang et al.</italic>, 2023</xref>). Although these factors may help STX17 recruitment, these mechanisms do not explain the strict temporal regulation of STX17 recruitment.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we hypothesized that there exists a yet unknown change in some autophagosomal properties during maturation that is recognized by STX17. In this study, we reveal that STX17 recruitment to autophagosomes requires positively charged amino acids in the C-terminal region of STX17. Consistently, the membrane of autophagosomes becomes more negatively charged when autophagosomes acquire STX17. Furthermore, we show that phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P), a negatively charged phospholipid, accumulates during autophagosome maturation and is required for STX17 recruitment. Based on these findings, we propose a model in which STX17 recruitment to mature autophagosomes is temporally regulated by the electrostatic change of autophagosomes.</p>

<title>Autophagosomal localization of STX17 requires a positively charged C-terminal region</title>
<p>STX17 has an N-terminal Habc domain, followed by a SNARE domain, two tandem transmembrane helices, and a short C-terminal region, with both N- and C-terminal ends facing the cytosol (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29"><italic>Itakura et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). A short construct containing only the transmembrane helices and the C-terminal region (STX17TM), which behaves similarly to full-length STX17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29"><italic>Itakura et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), colocalized with ring-shaped autophagosomes labeled with the general autophagic membrane marker microtubule-associated protein light chain 3B (LC3B) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). STX17 is a tail-anchored protein, and the C-terminal region of tail-anchored proteins is generally important for specific membrane targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57"><italic>Rao et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77"><italic>Yagita et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Therefore, we determined the role of the C-terminal region of STX17. In the following experiments, we used the STX17TM construct in order to avoid detecting an indirect effect of SNARE domain-mediated translocation. Deletion of the C-terminal cytosolic region from STX17TM (TMÎC) resulted in a diffuse cytosolic pattern (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), indicating that not only the transmembrane helices but also the C-terminal region of STX17 are required for its proper autophagosomal localization. Although the role of STX17 in autophagosomeâlysosome fusion is conserved in both <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (Dm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71"><italic>TakÃ¡ts et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (Ce) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21"><italic>Guo et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), the amino acid sequence of the C-terminal region is not conserved in these organisms (<xref rid="figs1-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Nevertheless, when expressed in mammalian cells, DmSTX17TM and CeSTX17TM were recruited to autophagosomes, although less efficiently (<xref rid="figs1-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that recruitment of STX17 does not depend on the specific amino acid sequence in the C-terminal region.</p>

<p>In general, cationic amino acids in the C-terminal region of tail-anchored proteins are important for targeting membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9"><italic>Borgese et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27"><italic>Horie et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77"><italic>Yagita et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). STX17 has cationic amino acids in its C-terminal region, and the replacement of lysine and arginine with alanine impaired autophagosomal localization in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">D</xref>, <xref rid="figs1-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, the replacement of the C-terminal region with artificial sequences consisting of five residues of positively charged lysine or arginine, but not negatively charged aspartic acid or uncharged alanine, restored the localization of STX17 to autophagosomes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref rid="figs1-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). These data suggest that autophagosomal localization of STX17 requires positively charged residues, but not sequence-specific structures, in its C-terminal region.</p>

<title>The membrane of autophagosomes becomes negatively charged during maturation</title>
<p>Given the importance of positively charged residues in the C-terminal region, we hypothesized that STX17 favors negatively charged membranes. To evaluate this hypothesis, we first conducted an <italic>in vitro</italic> membrane binding assay using liposomes with different compositions of phospholipids. STX17TM was efficiently recruited to liposomes containing anionic phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-phosphate (PI3P) or PI4P (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The association of STX17TM with PI4P-containing membranes was abolished in the presence of 1 M NaCl (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). These data suggest that STX17 can be recruited to negatively charged membranes via electrostatic interaction independent of the specific lipid species.</p>

<p>Next, we tested whether autophagosomal membranes are indeed negatively charged. To monitor membrane charge <italic>in vivo</italic>, we used membrane surface charge biosensors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66"><italic>Simon et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81"><italic>Yeung et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). These surface charge probes have a diverse range of positively charged peptides and a farnesylated anchor at their C terminus, with GFP fused to their N terminus. The name of each probe is indicated by the number of lysine (positively charged) followed by that of glutamine. The probe for the most negatively charged membrane (9K0Q) labeled the plasma membrane, which is known to have a highly negative charge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44"><italic>Li et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), but not autophagosomes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">E</xref>, <xref rid="figs2-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). However, the probes for intermediate (5K4Q and 3K6Q) and weakly (1K8Q) negative charges labeled not only the plasma membrane but also LC3B- and STX17-positive autophagosomes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">E</xref>, <xref rid="figs2-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). The recruitment kinetics differed between the intermediate and weakly negative charge probes. The 1K8Q probe was recruited to not only STX17-positive spherical autophagosomes but also STX17-negative, LC3B-positive elliptic structures that should correspond to unclosed autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72"><italic>Tsuboyama et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). In contrast, the intermediate charge probes (3K6Q and 5K4Q) were recruited to spherical LC3B-positive autophagosomes at almost the same time as STX17 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref rid="figs2-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Structures positive for ATG5, a marker for unclosed autophagosomes, were labeled with 1K8Q but not with 3K6Q or 5K4Q (<xref rid="figs2-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). These results, which are summarized in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>, suggest that mature autophagosomes are more negatively charged compared with unclosed intermediate structures.</p>

<title>The accumulation of PI4P in mature autophagosomes coincides with STX17 recruitment</title>
<p>We next explored the mechanism that generates the negative charges of autophagosomal membranes. As the change in the membrane charge was rapid and robust, we reasoned that it could be caused by a change in lipid composition or modification. We screened negatively charged lipids that are enriched in autophagosomal membranes using various phospholipid probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54"><italic>Platre and Jaillais</italic>, 2016</xref>).

<p>PI4P is an important lipid component of the Golgi complex and the plasma membrane as well as a major regulator of conserved eukaryotic cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4"><italic>Balla</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55"><italic>Platre et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62"><italic>Schink et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). In the context of autophagy, it was previously reported that GABARAP-dependent PI4P production by PI4K2A (PI4KIIÎ±) is required for autophagosomeâlysosome fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75"><italic>Wang et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>), and that PI4KB (PI4KIIIÎ²) is detected in ATG9A vesicles and early autophagic structures and is furthermore required for autophagosome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31"><italic>Judith et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>). Consistently, we detected faint signals of PI4K2A and PI4KB on LC3B-positive structures (<xref rid="figs3-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). However, the dynamics of PI4P production during autophagosome maturation has not been systematically determined.</p>
<p>The PI4P probes (CERT(PHD), FAPP(PHD), OSBP(PHD), and P4M-SidMx2) colocalized with STX17 but not with ATG5 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref rid="figs3-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2B</xref> and <xref rid="figs3-2" ref-type="fig">C</xref>), suggesting that PI4P accumulates in mature autophagosomes. We then investigated the dynamics of PI4P enrichment by time-lapse microscopy. The signal of the CERT(PHD) probe appeared on LC3B-positive membranes only after the disappearance of the unclosed autophagosome markers ATG5 and WIPI2B (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">C</xref>) and almost at the same time as STX17 localized (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). This was followed by the appearance of LysoTracker signals (note that LysoTracker signals have been previously observed to appear ring-shaped until inner membrane degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72"><italic>Tsuboyama et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>)) (<xref rid="figs3-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2D</xref>). To confirm that PI4P accumulation was independent of autophagosomeâlysosome fusion, we evaluated the colocalization among the PI4P probe, LC3B, and LAMP1 in STX17- and YKT6-double-knockdown cells, in which unfused autophagosomes accumulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48"><italic>Matsui et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). The punctate structures of CERT(PHD) were still colocalized with LC3B-positive and LAMP1-negative structures in these double-knockdown cells (<xref rid="figs3-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3â figure supplement 2E</xref>). In addition, STX17 recruitment and PI4P enrichment occurred normally in cells lacking all ATG8 family proteins (LC3A, LC3B, LC3C, GABARAP, GABARAPL1, and GABARAPL2) (<xref rid="figs3-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2F</xref>). These results suggest that PI4P accumulates in mature autophagosomal membranes independent of lysosome fusion and ATG8 proteins, and that the kinetics of the accumulation of STX17, the PI4P probes, and the negative charge probes are correlated.</p>

<title>STX17 recruitment to autophagosomes depends on PI4P</title>
<p>To determine whether PI4P is required for the recruitment of STX17 to autophagosomes, we first tried to dephosphorylate PI4P by ectopic expression of SAC1, a PI4P-phosphatase, on autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47"><italic>Manford et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). To this end, we fused the phosphatase domain of yeast Sac1 (Sac1PD) to the N terminus of LC3B and expressed them in different cell lines, using several methods, including lipofection and retrovirus- and adenovirus-mediated transfection. Although Sac1PDâLC3B localized to autophagosomes, it did not reduce either the level of autophagosomal PI4P or STX17 recruitment (unpublished observation). High expression of Sac1PDâLC3B inhibited autophagosome formation (unpublished observation). Mammals possess four PI 4-kinases. We next tried to deplete each or combinations of these PI 4-kinases by using siRNA or an auxin-inducible degron system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78"><italic>Yesbolatova et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>) or inhibit them using PI 4-kinase inhibitors, including PI-273 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43"><italic>Li et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>), BF738735 (unpublished observation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73"><italic>van der Schaar et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), and NC03 (<xref rid="figs4-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64"><italic>Sengupta et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>), but ultimately failed to reduce the autophagosomal PI4P levels and STX17 recruitment.

<p>Therefore, we instead used an <italic>in vitro</italic> system to determine whether PI4P is important for STX17 recruitment to autophagosomes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>).

Recombinant Sac1PD, its phosphatase-dead mutant (C392S), and mGFPâSTX17TM were generated using insect cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Autophagosomes were first incubated with or without Sac1PD or Sac1PD (C392S) for 30 min and then further incubated with mGFPâSTX17TM for another 30 min. Recombinant mGFPâSTX17TM was associated with autophagosomes, but it was significantly impaired by treatment with Sac1PD. Phosphatase-dead Sac1PD (C392S) showed no effect (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). These data suggest that PI4P is important for autophagosomal recruitment of STX17.</p>
<p>We further determined the effect of PI4P on the dynamics of STX17TM on a membrane by performing a molecular dynamics simulation. We used all-atom models for STX17TM and the highly mobile membrane-mimetic (HMMM) model for the lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53"><italic>Ohkubo et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).

The initial configuration was prepared such that the center of mass of STX17TM was located 3 nm above the membrane surface, after which the movement of STX17TM was tracked. In independent simulations using four out of the five predicted STX17TM structures, STX17TM was inserted into the membrane with PI4P (PC:PE:PI4P = 70:20:10) within a short time scale of 100 ns (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A, B</xref>, Video 1).</p>

Moreover, if the membrane contained PI instead of PI4P, STX17TM approached the PI-containing membrane but was not inserted into the membrane (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E, F</xref>, Video 3).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Based on the results of this study, we propose a model in which temporally regulated autophagosomeâlysosome fusion involves a dynamic change in electrostatic status during autophagosome maturation; the recruitment of STX17 to mature autophagosomes is primarily mediated by the electrostatic interaction between the positively charged C-terminal region of STX17 and negatively charged autophagosomal membranes likely due to accumulation of PI4P (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). During revising this manuscript, JuhÃ¡szâs group also reached a consistent model that PI4P is required for autophagosomal localization of STX17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40"><italic>LaczkÃ³-Dobos et al.</italic>, 2024</xref>). Because STX17 does not localize to all negatively charged membranes (e.g., the plasma membrane), the transmembrane helices appear to also regulate the specificity of target membranes. This is consistent with the âcoincidence detectorâ mechanism in which both a cationic motif and a nearby membrane-anchored moiety are important for membrane targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10"><italic>Carlton and Cullen</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80"><italic>Yeung and Grinstein</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>A striking finding of this study is that the membrane of autophagosomes become more negatively charged during maturation, most likely through an increase in the PI4P content of their membranes, although we do not exclude the possible involvement of other negatively charged molecules. Given the possibility that fluorescence lipid probes may give false-negative results, a more comprehensive biochemical analysis, such as lipidomics analysis of mature autophagosomes, would be imperative to elucidate the potential involvement of other negatively charged lipids.</p>
<p>While PI3P is important for autophagosome formation, we do not think that PI3P contributes to the increase in negative charge. It was reported that PI3P is dephosphorylated to PI during autophagosome formation or maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1"><italic>Allen et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11"><italic>Cebollero et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70"><italic>Taguchi-Atarashi et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), and that the PI3P effectors DFCP1 and WIPI family proteins are not detected on mature autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36"><italic>Koyama-Honda et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). In fact, we did not detect WIPI2B and the PI3P reporter GFPâ2ÃFYVE on PI4P-enriched structures (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>) and STX17-positive structures (<xref rid="figs3-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), respectively. Considering the change in autophagosomal membrane charge, the amount of PI4P produced during autophagosome maturation is likely to be higher than that of PI3P in the early stages. Our data of the 1K8Q probe suggest that immature autophagosomal membranes may also have slight negative charges (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Although the source of the negative charge of immature autophagosomes is currently unknown, it may be derived from low levels of PI4P, which is undetectable by the PI4P probes and/or other negatively charged lipids such as PI and PS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63"><italic>Schmitt et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>PI4P is involved in many cellular processes, including autophagosome formation and maturation. It was reported that PI4KB regulates the early stage of autophagosome formation through interaction with ATG9A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31"><italic>Judith et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>). It was also reported that PI4K2A is recruited to autophagosomes by binding to the ATG8 family proteins GABARAP and GABARAPL1 and produces PI4P in the autophagosomal membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75"><italic>Wang et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Furthermore, the knockdown of PI4K2A resulted in the accumulation of abnormally enlarged autophagosomes, presumably owing to a defect in autophagosomeâlysosome fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75"><italic>Wang et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Indeed, a freeze-fracture replica labeling study showed that autophagosomal membranes contain PI4P in the cytoplasmic leaflets of the outer and inner membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39"><italic>Kurokawa et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>). Very recently, it was reported that the knockdown of PI4KIIÎ± in <italic>Drosophila</italic> blocked autophagic flux at a late step of autophagy in the fat body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45"><italic>Liu et al.</italic>, 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Although these studies are consistent with our finding that PI4P production induces STX17 recruitment for fusion with lysosomes, our repeated attempts to deplete PI4P genetically (i.e., by depletion of PI 4-kinases or attachment of Sac1 to autophagosomes) or pharmacologically did not deplete autophagosomal PI4P or inhibit STX17 recruitment. Liu et al. also showed that the knockdown of PI4KIIÎ± in <italic>Drosophila</italic> did not inhibit STX17 recruitment. This may be because PI 4-kinases function redundantly. In any case, it would be important to elucidate how PI 4-kinase activity or PI4P synthesis is upregulated during autophagosome maturation.</p>
<p>Surface charge, which is now recognized as one of the key physical properties of cellular membranes, regulates various biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80"><italic>Yeung and Grinstein</italic>, 2007</xref>). For example, the negatively charged plasma membrane, where anionic phospholipids such as PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and PS are enriched, recruits positively charged proteins, including K-Ras and Rac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8"><italic>Bigay and Antonny</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26"><italic>Heo et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44"><italic>Li et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55"><italic>Platre et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79"><italic>Yeung et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81"><italic>Yeung et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), some of which are released from the membrane when the negative charge of the surface is reduced during phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81"><italic>Yeung et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). However, little has been reported on the role of electrostatic properties of other organelles, including autophagosomes.</p>
<p>Generally, PI4P can be structurally recognized by a series of PI4P-binding domain-containing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41"><italic>Lemmon</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50"><italic>Moravcevic et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). However, recent studies suggest that PI4P can also generate a negatively charged electrostatic field and recruit positively charged proteins independent of specific amino acid motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22"><italic>Hammond et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66"><italic>Simon et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Examples of the role of PI4P in electrostatic signature include the recruitment of the polar auxin transport regulator PINOID and other signaling molecules to the cell plate in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66"><italic>Simon et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>); the recruitment of D6 protein kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6"><italic>Barbosa et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>), NPH3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58"><italic>Reuter et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>), and the exocyst complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69"><italic>Synek et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>) to the plasma membrane in plants; the recruitment of Lgl and Dlg proteins, which function in cell polarity and tumorigenesis, to the plasma membrane in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14"><italic>Dong et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46"><italic>Lu et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>); and the recruitment of NLRP3 to the disassembled trans-Golgi network during inflammasome activation in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12"><italic>Chen and Chen</italic>, 2018</xref>). In the present study, we showed that autophagosomal PI4P also serves as a regulator of surface charge. Given that the function of elongating unclosed autophagosomes (i.e., sequestration) and mature closed autophagosomes (i.e., fusion with lysosomes) differs despite using seemingly the same membrane, electrostatic maturation would be an efficient way for the function to switch.</p>

The lipid bilayer was modeled using the HMMM model, which was developed to study proteinâmembrane interactions more efficiently by replacing the membrane lipids with short-chain lipid and organic solvents to facilitate lateral diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53"><italic>Ohkubo et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). The lipid headgroups in the HMMM model were identical to those in the all-atom model and faithfully represented the membrane surface. The lipid membrane consisted of 150 lipid molecules in each leaflet. The membranes with and without PI4P were examined for lipid compositions of POPC:POPE:POPI4P (POPI14) = 70:20:10, 70:30:0 or POPC:POPE:POPI = 70:20:10 respectively. The initial configuration was prepared so that the center of mass of STX17TM was located 3 nm above the membrane surface and the first principal axis of the atomic configuration was tilted 45 degrees from the z axis. The protein and lipids were solvated in a 10 nm Ã 10 nm Ã 30 nm box with the TIP3P water model and 0.15 M KCl ions. The initial configurations were built by the Membrane Builder module in the CHARMM-GUI server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30"><italic>Jo et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). All molecular dynamics simulations were performed using GENESIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32"><italic>Jung et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). The CHARMM36 force-field was used to describe the interactions in the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28"><italic>Huang et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Energy minimization was performed for 1000 steps by the steepest descent algorithm and then by the conjugate gradient algorithm. Then, a 250 ps NVT simulation was performed at 303.15 K for solvent equilibration, followed by a 1.6 ns NPT equilibration to 1 atm using the Langevin thermostat/barostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56"><italic>Quigley and Probert</italic>, 2004</xref>). The production simulations were performed for 100 ns with a time-step of 2.5 fs and the Langevin thermostat/barostat. Long-range electrostatic interactions were simulated using the particle-mesh Ewald method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13"><italic>Darden et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18"><italic>Essmann et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>). The short-range electrostatic and van der Waals interactions both used a cutoff of 12 Ã. All bonds were constrained by the SHAKE/RATTLE algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2"><italic>Andersen</italic>, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59"><italic>Ryckaert et al.</italic>, 1977</xref>).</p>

<p>This paper addresses a <bold>fundamental</bold> issue in the field of autophagy: how is a protein responsible for autophagosome-lysosome fusion recruited to mature autophagosomes but not immature ones? The work succeeds in its ambition to provide a new conceptual advance. The evidence supporting the conclusions is <bold>convincing</bold>, with fluorescence microscopy, biochemical assays, and molecular dynamics simulations.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Syntaxin17 (STX17) is a SNARE protein that is recruited to mature (i.e., closed) autophagosomes, but not to immature (i.e., unclosed) ones, and mediates the autophagosome-lysosome fusion. How STX17 recognizes the mature autophagosome is an unresolved interesting question in the autophagy field. Shinoda and colleagues set out to answer this question by focusing on the C-terminal domain of STX17 and found that PI4P is a strong candidate that causes the STX17 recruitment to the autophagosome.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The main findings are: 1) Rich positive charges in the C-terminal domain of STX17 are sufficient for the recruitment to the mature autophagosome; 2) Fluorescence charge sensors of different strengths suggest that autophagic membranes have negative charges and the charge increases as they mature; 3) Among a battery of fluorescence biosensors, only PI4P-binding biosensors distribute to the mature autophagosome; 4) STX17 bound to isolated autophagosomes is released by treatment with Sac1 phosphatase; 5) By dynamic molecular simulation, STX17 TM is shown to be inserted to a membrane containing PI4P but not to a membrane without it. These results indicate that PI4P is a strong candidate that STX17 binds to in the autophagosome.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>â¢ It was not answered whether PI4P is crucial for the STX17 recruitment in cells because manipulation of the PI4P content in autophagic membranes was not successful for unknown reasons.</p>
<p>
â¢ The question that the authors posed in the beginning, i.e., why is STX17 recruited to the mature (closed) autophagosome but not to immature autophagic membranes, was not answered. The authors speculate that the seemingly gradual increase of negative charges in autophagic membranes is caused by an increase in PI4P. However, this was not supported by the PI4P fluorescence biosensor experiment that showed their distribution to the mature autophagosome only. Here, there are at least two possibilities: 1) The increase of negative charges in immature autophagic membranes is derived from PI4P. However the fluorescence biosensors do not bind there for some reason; for example, they are not sensitive enough to recognize PI4P until it reaches a certain level, or simply, their binding does not occur in a quantitative manner. 2) The negative charge in immature membranes is not derived from PI4P, and PI4P is generated abundantly only after autophagosomes are closed. In either case, it is not easy to explain why STX17 is recruited to the mature autophagosome only. For the first scenario, it is not clear how the PI4P synthesis is regulated so that it reaches a sufficient level only after the membrane closure. In the second case, the mechanism that produces PI4P only after the autophagosome closure needs to be elucidated (so, in this case, the question of the temporal regulation issue remains the same).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors set out to address the question of how the SNARE protein Syntaxin 17 senses autophagosome maturation by being recruited to autophagosomal membranes only once autophagosome formation and sealing is complete. The authors discover that the C-terminal region of Syntaxin 17 is essential for its sensing mechanism that involves two transmembrane domains and a positively charged region. The authors discover that the lipid PI4P is highly enriched in mature autophagosomes and that electrostatic interaction with Syntaxin 17's positively charged region with PI4P drives recruitment specifically to mature autophagosomes. The temporal basis for PI4P enrichment and Syntaxin 17 recruitment to ensure that unsealed autophagosomes do not fuse with lysosomes is a very interesting and important discovery. Overall, the data are clear and convincing, with the study providing important mechanistic insights that will be of broad interest to the autophagy field, and also to cell biologists interested in phosphoinositide lipid biology. The author's discovery also provides an opportunity for future research in which Syntaxin 17's c-terminal region could be used to target factors of interest to mature autophagosomes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study combines clear and convincing cell biology data with in vitro approaches to show how Syntaxin 17 is recruited to mature autophagosomes. The authors take a methodical approach to narrow down the critical regions within Syntaxin 17 required for recruitment and use a variety of biosensors to show that PI4P is enriched on mature autophagosomes.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are no major weaknesses, overall the work is highly convincing. It would have been beneficial if the authors could have shown whether altering PI4P levels would affect Syntaxin 17 recruitment. However, this is understandably a challenging experiment to undertake and the authors outlined their various attempts to tackle this question.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Syntaxin17 (STX17) is a SNARE protein that is recruited to mature (i.e., closed) autophagosomes, but not to immature (i.e., unclosed) ones, and mediates the autophagosome-lysosome fusion. How STX17 recognizes the mature autophagosome is an unresolved interesting question in the autophagy field. Shinoda and colleagues set out to answer this question by focusing on the C-terminal domain of STX17 and found that PI4P is a strong candidate that causes the STX17 recruitment to the autophasome.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The main findings are: 1) Rich positive charges in the C-terminal domain of STX17 are sufficient for the recruitment to the mature autophagosome; 2) Fluorescence charge sensors of different strengths suggest that autophagic membranes have negative charges and the charge increases as they mature; 3) Among a battery of fluorescence biosensors, only PI4P-binding biosensors distribute to the mature autophagosome; 4) STX17 bound to isolated autophagosomes is released by treatment with Sac1 phosphatase; 5) By dynamic molecular simulation, STX17 TM is shown to be inserted to a membrane containing PI4P but not to a membrane without it.

<p>As we explained in the initial submission, we tried to deplete PI4P in autophagosomes by multiple methods but did not succeed. In this revised manuscript, we added the result of an experiment using the PI 4-kinase inhibitor NC03 (Figure 4âfigure supplement 1), which shows no significant effect on the autophagosomal PI4P level and STX17 recruitment.</p>

<p>â¢ The molecular simulation study did not show whether PI4P is necessary for the STX17 TM insertion or whether other negatively charged lipids can play a similar role.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As the reviewer suggested, we performed the molecular dynamics simulation using membranes with phosphatidylinositol, a negatively charged lipid. STX17 TM approached the PI-containing membrane but was not inserted into the membrane within a time scale of 100 ns in simulations of all five structures. This data suggests that PI4P, which is more negatively charged than PI, is required for STX17 insertion. Thus, we have included these data in Figure 5E and F and added the following text to Lines 242â244.
âMoreover, if the membrane contained phosphatidylinositol (PI) instead of PI4P, STX17 approached the PI-containing membrane but was not inserted into the membrane (Figure 5E, F, Video 3).&quot;</p>

<p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out. While the probe for weakly negative charges (1K8Q) labeled both immature and mature autophagosomes, the probes for intermediate charges (5K4Q and 3K6Q) and PI4P labeled only mature autophagosomes (Figure 2F, Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B). Thus, we think that the autophagosomal membrane rapidly and drastically becomes negatively charged, and at the same time, PI4P is enriched. Although immature membranes may have weak negative charges, we did not examine which lipids contribute to the negative charges. Thus, we have added the following sentences to the Discussion part.</p>
<p>âOur data of the 1K8Q probe suggest that immature autophagosomal membranes may also have slight negative charges (Figure 2E). Although the source of the negative charge of immature autophagosomes is currently unknown, it may be derived from low levels of PI4P, which is undetectable by the PI4P probes and/or other negatively charged lipids such as PI and PS (Schmitt et al., EMBO Rep, 2022).â (Lines 279â283)

<p>We have asked Reviewer #1 through the editor what this experiment meant and understood that it was to see the effects of high salt concentrations. We monitored the association of GFP-STX17TM with liposomes in the presence or absence of 1 M NaCl and found that it was blocked in a high ionic buffer. This data supports the electrostatic interaction of STX17 with membranes. We have included this data in Figure 2B and added the following sentences to Lines 124â126.</p>
<p>âThe association of STX17TM with PI4P-containing membranes was abolished in the presence of 1 M NaCl (Figure 2B). These data suggest that STX17 can be recruited to negatively charged membranes via electrostatic interaction independent of the specific lipid species.â</p>

<p>(2) The authors claim that &quot;Autophagosomes become negatively charged during maturation&quot;, based on experiments using membrane charge probes. Since it's mainly about the membrane, it's better to refine the claim to &quot;The membrane of autophasosomes becomes...&quot;, which would be more precise and close to the topic of this paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to thank the reviewer for pointing this out. This point is valid. As recommended, we have collected the phrases âAutophagosomes become negatively charged during maturationâ to âThe membrane of autophagosomes becomes negatively charged during maturationâ (Line 72, 118, 262, 969 (title of Figure2), 1068 (title of Figure2âfigure supplyment1)).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors should add more discussion regarding the &quot;specificity&quot; for recruiting Syn17 through the charge interaction. Particularly, how Syn17 could be maintained before the closure of autophagosomes? For the MD simulations in Fig. 5, the current results don't add much to the manuscript. The cell biology experiments have demonstrated the conclusion. The authors could try to find more details about the insertion by analyzing the simulation movies. Do membrane packing defects play a role during the insertion process? A similar analysis was conducted for alpha-synuclein (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33437978/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33437978/</ext-link>).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Regarding the mechanism of STX17 maintenance in the cytosol, we do not think that other molecules, such as chaperones, are essential because purified recombinant mGFP-STX17TM used in this study is soluble. However, it does not rule out such a mechanism, which would be a future study.</p>
<p>In the paper by Liu et al. (PMID: 33437978), small liposomes with diameters of 25â50 nm are used. Therefore, there are packing defects in the highly curved membranes, to which alpha-synuclein helices are inserted in a curvature-dependent manner. On the other hand, autophagosomes are much larger (~1 um in diameter) and almost flat for STX17 molecules, so we think it is unlikely that STX17 recognizes the packing defect.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>â¢ The two (and other) possibilities with regards to the interpretation of the negative charge/PI4P result in autophagic membranes are hoped to be discussed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As mentioned above, we have added the following sentences to the Discussion section.
âOur data of the 1K8Q probe suggest that immature autophagosomal membranes may also have slight negative charges (Figure 2E). Although the source of the negative charge of immature autophagosomes is currently unknown, it may be derived from low levels of PI4P, which is undetectable by the PI4P probes and/or other negatively charged lipids such as PI and PS (Schmitt et al., EMBO Rep, 2022).â (Lines 279â283)</p>
<p>âIn any case, it would be important to elucidate how PI 4-kinase activity or PI4P synthesis is upregulated during autophagosome maturation.â (Lines 302â303)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>â¢ Fluorescence biosensors are convenient to give an overview of the intracellular distribution of various lipids, but some of them show false-negative results. For example, evectin-2-PH for PS binds to endosomes but not to the plasma membrane, even though the latter contains abundant PS. With regards to PI4P, some biosensors illuminate both the Golgi and autophagosome, while others do not appear to bind the Golgi. Moreover, fluorescence biosensors for PI(3,5)P2 and PI(3,4)P2, which are also candidates for the STX17 insertion issue, are less reliable than others (e.g., those for PI3P and PI(4,5)P2). These problems need to be considered.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with Reviewer #2 that fluorescence biosensors are not perfect for detecting specific lipids. Based on the Reviewerâs suggestion, we have included a comment on this in the Discussion section as follows (Lines 265â268).</p>
<p>âGiven the possibility that fluorescence lipid probes may give false-negative results, a more comprehensive biochemical analysis, such as lipidomics analysis of mature autophagosomes, would be imperative to elucidate the potential involvement of other negatively charged lipids.â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>â¢ A negative control for the PI4P biosensor, i.e., a mutant lacking the PI4P binding ability, is better to be tested to confirm the presence of PI4P in autophagosomes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to thank the Reviewer for this comment. We conducted the suggested experiment and confirmed that the CERT(PHD)(W33A) mutant, which is deficient for PI4P binding (Sugiki et al., JBC. 2012), was diffusely present in the cytosol and did not localize to STX17-positive autophagosomes. This data supports our conclusion that PI4P is indeed present in autophagosomes. We have included this data in Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A and explained it in the text (Lines 164â166).</p>

<p>â¢ As a control to the molecular dynamic simulation study, STX17 TM insertion into a membrane containing other negative charge lipids, especially PI, needs to be tested. PI is a negative charge lipid that is likely to exist in autophagic membranes (as suggested by the authors' past study).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. As mentioned above (Reviewer #2, Public Review), we performed the molecular dynamics simulation using membranes containing PI and added the results in Figure 5E and F and Video 3.</p>

<p>â¢ If the putative role of PI4P could be shown in the cellular context, the authors' conclusion would be much strengthened. I wonder if overexpression of PI4P fluorescence biosensors, especially those that appear to bind to the autophagosome almost exclusively, may suppress the recruitment of STX17 there.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to thank the Reviewer for asking this question. In MEFs stably overexpressing PI4P probes driven by the CMV promoter, STX17 recruitment was not affected. Thus, simple overexpression of PI4P probes does not appear to be effective in masking PI4P in autophagosomes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Another idea is to use an appropriate molecule (e.g., WIPI2, ATG5) and to recruit Sac1 to autophagic membranes by using the FRB-FKBP system or the like. I hope these and other possibilities will be tested to confirm the importance of PI4P in the temporal regulation of STX17 recruitment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We tried the FRB-FKBP system using the phosphatase domain of yeast Sac1 fused to FKBP and LC3 fused to FRB, but unfortunately, this system failed to deplete PI4P from the autophagosomal membrane.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>A few areas for suggested improvement are:</p>
<p>(1) It would be helpful if the authors could clarify for all figures how many independent experiments were conducted for all experiments, particularly those that have quantitation and statistical analyses.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As pointed out by Reviewer #3, we have added the number of independent experimental repeats in the figure legends.</p>

<p>The authors made several attempts to modulate PI4P levels on autophagosomes although understandably this proved to be challenging. A couple of suggestions are provided to address this area:</p>
<p>(2) Given the reported role of GABARAPs in PI4K2a recruitment and PI4P production on autophagosomes, as well as autophagosome-lysosome fusion (Nguyen et al (2016) J Cell Biol) it would be worthwhile to assess whether GABARAP TKO cells have reduced PI4P and reduced Stx17 recruitment</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>According to the Reviewerâs suggestion, we examined the localization of STX17 TM and the PI4P probe CERT(PHD) in ATG8 family (LC3/GABARAP) hexa KO HeLa cells that were established by the Lazarou lab (Nguyen et al., JCB 2016). As in WT cells, STX17 TM and CERT(PHD) were still colocalized with each other in hexa KO cells, suggesting that neither STX17 recruitment nor PI4P enrichment depends on ATG8 family proteins (note: the size of autophagosomes in HeLa cells is smaller than in MEFs, making it difficult to observe autophagosomes as ring-shaped structures). We have included this result in Figure 3âfigure supplement 2(F) and explained it in the text (Lines 194â196, 198).</p>

<p>(3) Can the authors try fusing Sac1 to one of the PI4P probes (CERT(PHD)) that were used, or alternatively to the c-terminus of Syntaxin 17? This approach would help to recruit Sac1 only to mature autophagosomes and could therefore prevent the autophagosome formation defect observed when fused to LC3B that targeted Sac1 to autophagosomes as they were forming. Understandably, this approach might seem a bit counterintuitive since the phosphatase is removing PI4P which is what is recruiting it but it could be a viable approach to keep PI4P levels low enough on mature autophagosomes so that Syntaxin 17 is no longer recruited. A Sac1 phosphatase mutant might be needed as a control.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to thank the Reviewer for these suggestions. We tried the phosphatase domain of yeast Sac1 or human SAC1 fused with STX17TM, but unfortunately, these fusion proteins did not deplete PI4P from autophagosomes.</p>
