<abstract>
<p>We investigated the role of the nucleolar protein Treacle in organizing and regulating the nucleolus in human cells. Our results support Treacle’s capacity to form liquid-phase condensates through electrostatic interactions among molecules. The formation of these biomolecular condensates is crucial for segregating nucleolar fibrillar centers from the dense fibrillar component, as well as ensuring high levels of rRNA gene transcription and accurate pre-rRNA processing. The presence of both the central and C-terminal domains of Treacle is necessary for the creation of liquid-phase condensates. Initiation of phase separation is attributed to the C-terminal domain, while the central domain, characterized by repeated stretches of alternatively charged amino-acid residues, is vital for maintaining the condensate’s liquid state. When mutant forms of Treacle, incapable of forming liquid-phase condensates, are overexpressed in cells, it compromises the establishment of fibrillar centers, leading to the suppression of rRNA transcription and disruption of its processing. Additionally, these mutant forms fail to recruit TOPBP1, resulting in the suppression of the DNA damage response in the nucleolus.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Applying polymer chemistry principles to biological molecules has significantly widened our understanding of membraneless compartments’ functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Mehta &amp; Zhang, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Mittag &amp; Pappu, 2022</xref>). Multiple weak, cooperative, and dynamic interactions underlie the assembly of these self-organized structures, termed biomolecular condensates. Mechanistically, liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS)—a process of de-mixing that yields a condensed protein-enriched phase and a dilute phase—can mediate the self-assembly of biomolecular condensates. In biological systems, phase separation is mainly a characteristic of multivalent or intrinsically disordered proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Banani et al, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Shin &amp; Brangwynne, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Uversky, 2019</xref>). Biomolecular condensates serve as functional hubs in diverse cellular processes such as transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Sabari et al, 2020</xref>), microtubule nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Woodruff et al, 2017</xref>), and adaptive stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Franzmann &amp; Alberti, 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Nucleolus, a large and complex subnuclear compartment, can also be considered a multicomponent and multilayered biomolecular condensate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lafontaine et al, 2021</xref>). The nucleolus is formed around arrays of ribosomal gene repeats (rDNA), which are transcribed by RNA polymerase I (Pol I) to produce pre-ribosomal RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cerqueira &amp; Lemos, 2019</xref>). In the nucleolus, RNAs and hundreds of different proteins are segregated into three immiscible liquid phases: the fibrillar center (FC), which is the inner layer that contains the machinery for rDNA transcription by Pol I; the dense fibrillar component (DFC), which is the intermediate layer that is rich in fibrillarin; the granular component (GC), which is the outer layer that is rich in nucleophosmin (NPM1, B23). Although purified fibrillarin and NPM1 can separate into two distinct phases <italic>in vitro</italic> to create the droplet compartments of DFC and GC, respectively, the nature of the FC droplet compartment remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Feric et al, 2016</xref>). By examining the behavior of the FC in living cells, it has been proposed that the FC’s organization is a result of phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Falahati et al, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Falahati &amp; Wieschaus, 2017</xref>). Furthermore, several studies have shown that the FC components relocate to the periphery of the nucleolus and aggregate to form large structures called nucleolar caps when Pol I transcription is inhibited by actinomycin D (AMD) or genotoxic drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Harding et al, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Korsholm et al, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Reynolds et al, 1964</xref>). This transformation process exhibits similarities to the fusion of liquid droplets. Treacle is the main molecule present in the FC, and it has both transcription-dependent and - independent functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gal et al, 2022</xref>). Its role in ribosome biogenesis is well-documented since it assists in the transcription and processing of rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gonzales et al, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lin &amp; Yeh, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Valdez et al, 2004</xref>). In addition, it is a master regulator of DNA damage response (DDR) in the nucleolus, mediating recruitment of repair factors to rDNA damage caused by IPpoI-induced breaks, replication stress, or R-loop formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Ciccia et al, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Korsholm et al, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Larsen et al, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Mooser et al, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Velichko et al, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Velichko et al, 2019</xref>). Thus, it acts as a nucleolar hub with both transcriptional and DNA repair functions. The reason for its multifunctionality can be attributed to its possible ability to undergo phase separation and engage in multivalent interactions. Protein structure predictors indicate that Treacle is one of the most intrinsically disordered proteins. In addition, Treacle’s partners in transcription and DNA repair (Pol I and TOPBP1, respectively) also utilize phase separation as a functioning mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Frattini et al, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ide et al, 2020</xref>). Transcription of ribosomal genes can be regulated by phase separation of Pol I, while TOPBP1 condensation can activate the ATR signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Frattini et al, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ide et al, 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we present experimental evidence that Treacle can form biomolecular condensates, and we thoroughly characterize the structural determinants of Treacle regulating this process. Due to its ability for LLPS, Treacle facilitates the formation of nucleolar FCs, recruiting and concentrating transcription factors at rDNA, and separating FC components from the DFC. Collectively, this segregates rRNA synthesis and its subsequent processing in distinct compartments of the nucleolus. Disruption of Treacle’s LLPS capability, leading to the mixing of FC and DFC components, results in reduced efficiency of both processes, equivalent to the consequences of complete depletion of endogenous Treacle. Additionally, we demonstrate that Treacle’s phase separation is critical for its interaction with TOPBP1 and activation of DDR in rDNA during genotoxic stress. Our findings reveal the role of Treacle not only as a structural scaffold for FCs but also as a nucleolar hub integrating functions of ribosomal gene transcription, rRNA processing, and preserving rDNA integrity.</p>
<sec id="s1a">
<title>Treacle is a scaffold protein for nucleolar FCs and DFCs</title>
<p>First, we defined the role of Treacle in the structural organization of the nucleolus. We employed the CRISPR-Cas9 system to knock out the TCOF1 gene encoding Treacle in HeLa cells to obtain a population of cells lacking Treacle signals (Treacle-negative cells) (Fig. S1A). Immunocytochemical staining of UBF and RPA194 (FC markers), fibrillarin (DFC marker), and B23 and nucleolin (GC markers) revealed that Treacle-positive cells exhibited a classical tripartite nucleolar structure, with Treacle co-localizing with UBF1 and RPA194 (large sub-unit of Pol I) in FCs, fibrillarin in DFCs, and B23 and nucleolin surrounding FCs and DFCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Treacle depletion led to the disappearance of distinct FC and DFC structures, causing RPA194, UBF, and fibrillarin to diffuse throughout the nucleolus and partially relocate to the nucleoplasm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, S1A), whereas GC components remained unaffected (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). These results indicated that Treacle played a critical role in generating the integrated structure of FCs and DFCs.</p>

<p>Next, we investigated the impact of nucleolar FC disintegration on the efficiency of ribosomal gene transcription and the recruitment of Pol I transcription machinery to rDNA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed reduced occupancy of UBF and RPA194 at the ribosomal gene coding region in Treacle-negative cells, indicating that Treacle amplifies the recruitment rather than initiates the primary binding of transcription machinery to rDNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Depleting Treacle led to substantial suppression of ribosomal gene transcription, though not a complete shutdown, in contrast to the repression induced by AMD (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D,E</xref>). Furthermore, cells with Treacle depletion also exhibit impairment in the processing of the 5′ external transcribed spacer, particularly in the cleavage of the A′ site (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>) which is one of the initial steps in the 18S rRNA maturation.</p>
<p>In summary, Treacle functions as a scaffold protein in nucleolar FCs, and its depletion compromises both rRNA gene transcription and the processing of rRNA.</p>

<title>Treacle drives the formation of biomolecular condensates</title>
<p>Currently, it has become evident that various scaffold proteins can self-organize through the formation of liquid-phase condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Banani et al, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Shin &amp; Brangwynne, 2017</xref>). According to protein structure predictors (e.g., AlphaFold, IUPred2, PONDR, FuzDrop), Treacle is one of the most intrinsically disordered proteins (Fig. S2A). To investigate Treacle’s ability to self-organize into biomolecular condensates, we initially examined its LLPS properties in an in vitro system.</p>
<p>Purified recombinant Treacle underwent phase separation from the buffer and formed liquid droplets at low salt concentrations and in the presence of dextran as a crowding agent (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Under these conditions, Treacle efficiently self-organized into large droplets, and their size positively correlated with the strength of crowding (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). These droplets exhibited a spherical shape and frequently fused with one another (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To investigate Treacle’s ability to self-organize into biomolecular condensates within cells, we generated fusion proteins by linking Treacle to FusionRed (a non-self-dimerizing fluorescent protein) and Arabidopsis thaliana cryptochrome 2 (Cry2), known to oligomerize upon exposure to blue light, facilitating the formation of &quot;optoDroplets&quot; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Shin &amp; Brangwynne, 2017</xref>). Expression of this opto–Treacle chimeric protein in HeLa cells revealed foci formation in nucleoli in the absence of blue light, consistent with Treacle’s natural tendency to occupy FCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>; controls in Fig. S2B). Upon blue light exposure, opto– Treacle formed multiple small foci throughout the nucleoplasm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). We next explored Treacle’s ability to form biomolecular condensates when overexpressed as a fusion with the fluorescent protein Katushka2S (referred to as 2S) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Shcherbo et al, 2007</xref>). Initially, at low expression levels (16-24 hours post-transfection), Treacle’s fusion protein formed foci only in nucleoli reflecting its natural occupation of FCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref> top panel). However, with increased expression levels (48-72 hours post-transfection), it began to form large spherical structures in the nucleoplasm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2D</xref>). Both intranucleolar and extranucleolar Treacle–2S foci, induced by low and high levels of fusion protein expression respectively, exhibited a spherical shape with an aspect ratio close to one, suggesting susceptibility to surface tension (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Transmission electron microscopy confirmed the internal homogeneity of Treacle droplets, showing circular structures with homogeneous protein content without any electron-dense or -light regions inside the droplets (Fig. S2C).</p>
<p>Similar to the in vitro-formed Treacle condensates, intracellular Treacle condensates demonstrated the ability to fuse. Our observations reveal that during AMD-induced (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, Movie S1) or DNA damage-induced (Fig. S2D, Movie S2) rDNA transcriptional repression, nucleolar caps form due to the fusion of intranucleolar Treacle–2S foci. Prolonged live-cell imaging further demonstrated that extranucleolar biomolecular condensates from highly overexpressed Treacle–2S also frequently fuse, indicating dynamic clustering (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>, Movie S3).</p>
<p>Liquid condensates exhibit a high molecular exchange rate, often assessed through fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ganser &amp; Myong, 2020</xref>). FRAP analysis of the entire FC showed slow fluorescence recovery of Treacle, likely due to limited molecule diffusion between different FCs (Fig. S2E). However, when bleaching a specific region within the FC, rapid fluorescence recovery was observed, indicating liquid-like dynamics (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G, I</xref>). We then analyzed the molecular exchange rate of Treacle in nucleolar caps induced by AMD (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H, I</xref>) and in extranucleolar droplets induced by high-level expression of Treacle-2S (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2J, L</xref>). Both types of condensates exhibited dynamics consistent with liquid behavior, with slightly higher rates than in FCs. Fluorescence recovery in FCs, nucleolar caps, and extranucleolar condensates never reached the initial values over the analyzed time periods. This suggests that the high molecular exchange rate occurs through the mixing of Treacle molecules within the condensate boundaries and does not involve external diffusion. It is important to note that liquid dynamics were characteristic of Treacle droplets formed 16-48 hours post-transfection, while FRAP analysis of protein dynamics in large extranucleolar droplets 72-96 hours after transfection revealed a shift towards gel-like behavior of the observed condensates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 K,L</xref>). Presumably, Treacle condensates undergo a liquid-to-gel phase transition over time or upon reaching a critical protein concentration within the condensate. Thus, using diverse model systems, we illustrated that Treacle can indeed create biomolecular condensates exhibiting the primary features of structures mediated by LLPS.</p>

<title>Treacle’s phase separation is regulated by its central and C-terminal domains</title>
<p>We next searched the structural determinants of Treacle contributing to its LLPS characteristics. Despite being a low-complexity protein, Treacle consists of three functional domains: the N-terminal domain (ND) containing the LisH motif, the C-terminal domain (CD) which includes nuclear (NLS) and nucleolar (NOLC) localization signals, and the central or Repeated Domain (RD) consisting of 14 low complexity regions, 11 of which are homologous to each other (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). To identify the domains contributing to LLPS, we generated Treacle mutants with deleted ND (Δ1-83), RD (Δ83-1121), or CD (Δ1121-1488), and overexpressed them in HeLa cells. We decided to overexpress the deletion mutants in wild-type cells and assess their LLPS capacity using several intracellular condensate models: (i) formation of FCs and (ii) nucleolar caps under low expression levels (24 hours post-transfection), and (iii) formation of large extranucleolar condensates under high expression levels (48 hours post-transfection).</p>

<p>The Δ1-83 mutant demonstrated LLPS properties indistinguishable from full-length Treacle: it concentrated in FCs, formed stable nucleolar caps during transcriptional repression, and, upon increased expression levels, generated numerous large extranucleolar condensates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B, D</xref>). Similar to full-length Treacle, Δ1-83 exhibited a high rate of molecular exchange in all types of model condensates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C, E</xref>, S3A-C).</p>
<p>The mutant lacking the central domain (Δ83-1121) exhibited LLPS properties distinct from full-length Treacle. Under low expression levels, it failed to concentrate in FCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>) and diffusely localized in the nucleoplasm (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>) while still maintaining a high molecular dynamics rate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>, S3D). During rDNA transcriptional repression, Δ83-1121 did not form classical nucleolar caps but partially redistributed between the nucleolar periphery and nucleoplasm, where it began to form condensates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). Surprisingly, such relocation was associated with a change in its phase state. FRAP analysis demonstrated that both perinucleolar and nucleoplasmic condensates of Δ83-1121, formed due to nucleolar transcriptional repression, began to transition into a solid state (liquid-solid phase separation,LSPS) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>, S3E-F). It is possible, that without the central domain, Treacle can maintain LLPS only through heterotypic interactions with rRNA. A similar liquid-solid transition was observed for Δ83-1121 under high expression levels. In this case, it no longer formed distinct extranucleolar condensates but merged into a unified pan-nuclear solid-state network (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F, G</xref>, S3G).</p>
<p>The Δ1121-1488 mutant could not translocate into the nucleus due to the absence of its own NLS (data not shown), so it was additionally fused with the NLS from the SV40 virus. Interestingly, in this form, Δ1121-1488 began to localize in the nucleus but failed to form condensates even under high expression levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>).</p>
<p>These results suggest that it is the RD that provides the liquid behavior of the Treacle. However, RD is not capable of autonomous condensation and utilizes the CD as a platform for its own nucleation. In turn, CD cannot phase separate independently and requires either RD or rRNA, without which it undergoes a LSPS. Next, we investigated the features of the amino acid sequences of RD and CD that could contribute to these properties.</p>
<p>We started by analyzing the type of low-complexity region (LCR) interactions in full-length Treacle condensates. We first examined the assembly of Treacle droplets <italic>in vitro</italic> in the presence of 1,6-hexanediol, high salt concentrations, or at different pH values. The efficiency of Treacle droplet formation in vitro remained unchanged in the presence of 1,6-hexanediol (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I</xref>), whereas increasing salt concentration blocked droplet formation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I</xref>). Additionally, in vitro, condensation of Treacle was sensitive to changes in pH. The droplet size significantly decreased under acidic conditions (pH 5.5) or alkalization of the environment (pH 10), and was maximal at pH 8.5, corresponding to the isoelectric point for Treacle (Fig. S3H). Intracellular Treacle condensates were also sensitive to changes in ionic strength. Treatment with the cell-permeable salt ammonium acetate disrupted both FCs and extranucleolar condensates formed at low and high Treacle expression levels, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3J</xref>). In contrast, treatment with 1,6-hexanediol did not have a similar effect (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3J</xref>). Thus, it is evident that Treacle’s LLPS is driven by electrostatic, but not hydrophobic, interactions Analysis of the charge distribution along the amino acid sequence of Treacle revealed that the repeats in the central domain constitute strong diblock ampholytes, where a block of positive charge is followed by a block of negative charge (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3K</xref>). To determine the physiological importance of this charge distribution, a variant of Treacle, Treacle CS, was created with the same overall net charge but with scrambled blocks (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3K</xref>). In Treacle CS, regions of opposite charge were removed while maintaining the same overall isoelectric point, amino acid composition, and positions of all other residues. As anticipated, scrambling the charges in RD completely blocked Treacle’s phase separation ability. Similar to Δ83-1121, CS was unable to form FCs or nucleolar caps (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3L</xref>), remained in a liquid state only in the presence of rRNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3M</xref>), and underwent a liquid-solid phase transition during nucleolar transcriptional repression or high levels of overexpression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3L, M</xref>, S3I-K). This indicates the importance of the charge distribution pattern in RD for maintaining the phase separation properties of Treacle.</p>
<p>The C-terminal domain of Treacle exhibited a significantly positive charge, attributed to the K-rich region at the C-terminus, which is also a NOLC. To analyze the significance of this charge, a Treacle variant with a deletion of the 1350-1488 region (ΔNOLC), including most lysines in CD, was created. As expected, this form of Treacle did not localize to the nucleolus but, nonetheless, was capable of forming individual perinucleolar condensates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3N</xref>). These condensates demonstrated a liquid state, and the molecular exchange rate within them was even slightly higher than in condensates of full-length Treacle (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3O</xref>, S3L-N). Interestingly, with an increase in the expression level of ΔNOLC, a significant increase in the volume of such condensates was observed, but not an increase in their number (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3N</xref>). This suggests that positively charged lysines in CD serve as nucleation points for autonomous Treacle condensate formation.</p>
<p>In summary, the results indicate that the central and C-terminal domains cooperatively control the phase separation properties of Treacle, while the N-terminal domain does not make a substantial contribution. The highly positively charged CD serves as the nucleation center for RD but exhibits ambivalent phase properties, transitioning from LLPS to LSPS in the absence of rRNA. In turn, RD, with alternating charge blocks in the repeating domains, maintains Treacle condensates in a stably liquid state, thus counteracting rRNA-dependent phase fluctuations in CD. The combination of CD and RD supports a balance of viscoelastic properties in Treacle condensates.</p>

<title>Treacle LLPS is essential for the transcription and processing of rRNA</title>
<p>In the previous part of the study, we demonstrated that Treacle supports the transcription and processing of rRNA. We hypothesized that this functionality of Treacle could be attributed to its ability for LLPS. To test this hypothesis, we significantly downregulated the endogenous Treacle expression using RNA interference (Fig. S4A) and then analyzed the structure of FC/DFC and rRNA transcription levels in the context of the expression of full-length or LLPS-defective (Δ83-1121 or CS) forms of Treacle. It was observed that compared to the full-length Treacle, which formed classical FC/DFC, each of the LLPS-defective mutants induced dispersion and mixing of FC and DFC components (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4 A,C</xref>), similar to what occurs during CRISPR/Cas9-mediated depletion of endogenous Treacle (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B,D</xref>). In this process, GC did not undergo visible changes (Fig. S4B-D). Additionally, we found that the expression of LLPS-defective mutants significantly reduced the transcription level of rRNA compared to full-length Treacle (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4E</xref>). This effect could not be explained by a possible loss of the ability of LLPS-defective mutants of Treacle to bind to rDNA, as both LLPS-defective mutants occupied the coding region of ribosomal repeats in a manner similar to full-length Treacle (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>).</p>

<p>Thus, this observation suggests that the LLPS properties of Treacle provide its ability to concentrate components of the transcriptional machinery in FC and separate them from DFC. Moreover, such separation is likely required to maintain highly efficient transcription of ribosomal genes. We hypothesized that the same principle could regulate the role of Treacle in the processing of rRNA. To test this assumption, we depleted the level of endogenous Treacle using RNA interference (Fig. S4A) and then analyzed the spatial localization of newly synthesized 47S-rRNA and its processing level in cells expressing miRNA-resistant full-length or LLPS-defective (Δ83-1121 or CS) forms of Treacle. Microscopy analyses with FISH-labeled rRNA revealed that newly synthesized 47S-rRNA transcript clustered at the periphery of FCs in full-length Treacle-expressing cells, reflecting the radial flow of rRNA from FC to GC (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). However, in cells expressing LLPS-defective Treacle mutants, no clear clustering of newly synthesized rRNA was observed. Instead, the newly synthesized transcripts were diffusely mixed with Δ83-1121 and CS Treacle (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). In cells with depleted endogenous Treacle, nascent pre-rRNA transcripts were similarly mixed with delocalized UBF (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>). Finally, reverse transcription-qPCR analysis confirmed that cells overexpressing LLPS-defective Treacle mutants demonstrated impairment of 5′ external transcribed spacer processing compared to cells overexpressing full-length Treacle (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4I</xref>). Thus, it can be concluded that the mixing of FC and DFC components induced by the expression of LLPS-defective Treacle, as well as the depletion of endogenous Treacle, disrupts the directional traffic of nascent pre-rRNA from FC to DFC and further to GC, which may be a cause of inefficient processing.</p>
<p>Our results indicate that Treacle’s phase separation properties provide separation of FC and DFC, leading to the spatial segregation of rRNA synthesis and its subsequent processing. The mixing of FC and DFC components due to the disruption of Treacle’s LLPS ability results in reduced efficiency of both processes, equivalent in consequences to the complete depletion of endogenous Treacle.</p>

<title>Treacle phase separation is essential for DDR activation in ribosomal genes under genotoxic stress conditions</title>
<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that Treacle is critically required for the induction of DDR in ribosomal genes under certain types of stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Korsholm et al, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Larsen et al, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Mooser et al, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Velichko et al, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Velichko et al, 2019</xref>). Here, we aimed to investigate the contribution of Treacle’s phase separation to rDNA damage response. To induce rDNA damage, we used the widely used chemotherapeutic drug etoposide (VP16), which acts as a topoisomerase II poison inducing double-strand breaks (DSBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bax et al, 2019</xref>). Treatment of cells with 90 µM VP16 for 30 minutes resulted in the rapid recruitment of TOPBP1 to nucleoli and its colocalization with Treacle (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Furthermore, proximity ligation assay (PLA) analysis conducted after DNA damage induction provided evidence of a physical association between TOPBP1 and Treacle (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). The reduction of endogenous Treacle levels, achieved either through RNA interference (Treacle kd) or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated depletion (Treacle kn), effectively blocked the relocalization of TOPBP1 to nucleoli and its occupancy of rDNA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>, S5A). Interestingly, with RNA interference, a substantial amount of Treacle still remained in nucleoli (Fig. S5A). However, this amount was insufficient to facilitate its interaction with TOPBP1, likely due to the need for specific stoichiometric ratios for efficient interaction.</p>

<p>Next, we investigated whether the interaction between Treacle and TOPBP1 in Treacle kd cells could be restored by the overexpression of different Treacle variants. The results of immunocytochemical analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation with antibodies against TOPBP1 indicated that the expression of full-length Treacle in Treacle kd cells effectively restored the VP16-induced interaction between Treacle and TOPBP1, as well as the enrichment of TOPBP1 at the promoters of ribosomal genes. However, the expression of LLPS-defective forms of Treacle (Δ83-1121 or CS) did not lead to such restoration (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D,E</xref>).</p>
<p>The response to DNA damage involves the activation of various signaling kinases and the recruitment of different repair factors to the DNA break site. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) with antibodies against a panel of DNA repair proteins, it was confirmed that VP16 indeed induced DDR at the promoters of rDNA, including the activation of ATM/ATR kinases, phosphorylation of histone H2AX, and recruitment of repair factors such as 53BP1 and BRCA1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>, S5C). As expected, nucleolar DDR was fully controlled by the interaction between Treacle and TOPBP1, as the knockdown of either of these proteins led to a dramatic reduction in VP16-induced repair signaling at rDNA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>, S5B,C). Finally, it was confirmed that nucleolar DDR could be efficiently restored in Treacle kd cells by overexpressing full-length Treacle, but not its LLPS-defect mutants (Δ83-1121 or CS) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>, S5D). Thus, we can conclude that the phase separation by Treacle plays a crucial role in facilitating its binding to TOPBP1 and activating DDR in conditions of genotoxic damage to rDNA.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The nucleolus is a multicomponent phase condensate formed on the platform of rRNA, which is processed and incorporated into assembling ribosomes simultaneously with migration from FCs to DFCs and further to GC. Each of the nucleolar compartments provides a special environment formed by the demixing of a particular protein that constitutes a permanent component of a given compartment. Essential client proteins are subsequently recruited to this phase condensate. The constitutive components of DFC and GC are nucleolin and nucleophosmin (B23), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Feric et al, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lafontaine et al, 2021</xref>). The debate continues regarding which protein plays a comparable role in FCs. The results of our study suggest that the phosphoprotein Treacle serves as the scaffold protein for nucleolar fibrillar centers in human cells. This aligns entirely with the findings of the E. Calo group, demonstrating that the evolutionary emergence of Treacle correlates with the appearance of the three-partite nucleolus in amniotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jaberi-Lashkari et al, 2023</xref>). They demonstrated that the introduction of human Treacle into zebrafish, which lack a competent ortholog for FC formation, induced the reorganization of the nucleolar structure from bipartite to tripartite, accompanied by the formation of FC-like structures.</p>
<p>Here, we demonstrated that Treacle organizes nucleolar FCs through its LLPS properties and also investigated the underlying mechanism leading to the phase separation of Treacle. The phase behavior of polymers is determined by interactions through associative motifs, referred to as stickers, separated by spacers, which are not the primary driving forces for phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Choi et al, 2020</xref>). In Treacle, stickers consist of K/R and E/D residues in repeated disordered regions (RD) which generate alternating charged blocks. Meanwhile, a large number of glycine, proline, and glutamine residues, well-known as disorder-promoting residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Romero et al, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Theillet et al, 2013</xref>), can serve as effective spacers.</p>
<p>While the central domain of Treacle is responsible for its liquid behavior, this domain alone is unable to undergo autonomous phase separation within the cell. To undergo phase separation, the central domain requires a positively charged C-terminal domain, acting as a platform for nucleation. The mechanism by which the C-terminal domain facilitates nucleation is not entirely clear. We hypothesize that positively charged K residues in the C-terminal domain may interact with negatively charged E/D residues in RD, utilizing electrostatic interactions. Interestingly, the zebrafish ortholog of Treacle is homologous to human Treacle only in the central domain, lacking a homologous sequence for the C-terminal domain. This likely accounts for its inability to condense and form fully functional FC.</p>
<p>Endogenous Treacle may undergo post-translational modifications. Specifically, the central domain of Treacle is known to be heavily phosphorylated and ubiquitinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Mooser et al, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Werner et al, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Werner et al, 2015</xref>). Currently, the role of these modifications is primarily attributed to facilitating interactions with partner proteins such as CUL3KBTBD8 or NOLC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Werner et al, 2018</xref>). However, it is known that phosphorylation can modulate phase separation, particularly by enhancing or reducing the polyampholytic properties of disordered regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Yamazaki et al, 2022</xref>). As LLPS of Treacle relies on its polyampholytic nature, we do not exclude that post-translational ubiquitination and phosphorylation may alter charge ratios in its central domain, thereby modulating ampholytic properties and finely tuning phase separation.</p>
<p>The synthesis of 47S pre-rRNA occurs at the FC/DFC boundary, while primary processing initiates in the DFC. DFC formation is mediated by phase separation of fibrillarin gathered on pre-rRNA scaffold and is maintained as long as there is a directed radial flow of rRNA from FC to DFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Yao et al, 2019</xref>). The role of Treacle in ensuring rRNA processing has been repeatedly described in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Calo et al, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gonzales et al, 2005</xref>), but the mechanism of this phenomenon remained unclear. We demonstrated that the efficiency of rRNA processing is compromised not only with the complete depletion of endogenous Treacle but also with the expression of LLPS-defective mutants of Treacle. This led us to propose that Treacle facilitates rRNA processing not only through the direct recruitment of specific factors but also by organizing the cooperative structure of FC/DFC and separating FC components from DFC. Disruption and mixing of FC and DFC components due to Treacle’s impaired LLPS properties may interfere with the radial flow of rRNA, thus hindering its normal processing.</p>
<p>Additionally, we explored the role of Treacle’s phase separation in nucleolar DDR. Treacle’s well-known partner, TOPBP1, plays a crucial role in the activation of ATR during DNA replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Day et al, 2021</xref>). The interaction between TOPBP1 and Treacle is essential for nucleoli-specific DDR and replication stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Mooser et al, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Velichko et al, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Velichko et al, 2019</xref>). This interaction occurs via phosphoserines 1227/1228 in a conserved acidic motif of C-terminal domain of Treacle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Mooser et al, 2020</xref>). However, we showed that Treacle with intact phosphoserines 1227/1228 but unable to undergo LLPS loses the ability to interact with TOPBP1 during genotoxic stress. This implies that for interaction with TOPBP1 and subsequent activation of nucleolar DDR, Treacle must also possess corresponding phase separation characteristics.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study unveils Treacle’s role not merely as a structural scaffold for FC/DFC but as a nucleolar hub protein that integrates functions in ribosomal gene transcription, rRNA processing, and rDNA repair.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Velichko et al. argues that the ability of nucleolar protein Treacles to form phase-separated condensates is necessary for its function in nucleolar organization, rRNA transcription, and rDNA repair. These findings may be of interest to the communities studying biomolecular condensates, nucleolar organization, and ribosome biogenesis. The authors propose that Treacle's ability to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation is the key to its role as a scaffold for the FC of the nucleolus. The experiments in this study were designed and performed well, particularly the overexpression studies, done in the absence of endogenous protein and accounted for the protein expression levels. However, in my view, the interpretation of these data should consider the possibility that specific protein-protein interactions of Treacle may also play a role in the organization of the FC compartment in vivo. The in vivo results do not exclude, and sometimes imply the presence of specific protein-protein interactions that may drive the organization of FC instead of, or in addition to LLPS.</p>
<p>Main points:</p>
<p>In the first part of the manuscript, the depletion of Treacle disrupted the FC and its (somewhat arbitrary) boundary with the dense fibrillar component, as well as rRNA biogenesis. The phenotypic effects of Treacle depletion by gene knockout or siRNA knockdown were evaluated thoroughly, and I see no issues here except that all experiments were conducted in HeLa cells, and it may not hurt to validate some key findings in a more normal cell line.</p>
<p>Next, the authors tested the hypothesis that the function of Treacle is due to its ability to form biomolecular condensates. In vitro, recombinant Treacle displayed classical phase separation behavior, forming liquid droplets at low salt concentrations and in the presence of dextran. Similarly, overexpression of fluorescently tagged Treacle at high concentrations showed classical liquid droplet behavior, characterized by round shapes and rapid fusion, which is illustrated by beautiful live cell video microscopy. The issue I see here is with the interpretation: the formation of classical phase-separated droplets at high concentrations suggests that Treacle may require reaching a certain saturating concentration to undergo phase separation. In other words, high levels of overexpressed protein might lead to abnormal phase separation that may not happen under normal expression levels. Based on these results, it is not necessarily correct to assume that its normal conformation is solely due to phase separation, as the formation of condensates at saturating concentrations does not automatically imply that the same components undergo phase separation under physiological conditions.</p>
<p>Treacle had been previously reported to interact with other proteins, specifically RPA194 and UBF, and these interactions were mapped to specific domains: the central repeated domain reportedly binds to RNA Pol I, while the C-terminus is involved in rDNA promoter recognition and UBF recruitment. Both of these proteins are necessary for rRNA transcription and nucleolar formation. Authors showed that overexpressing mutants impaired in phase separation resulted in defects in ribosomal RNA transcription and processing, as well as reduced DNA damage response efficiency. Specific protein-protein interactions as potential drivers of compartmentalization should be factored into the interpretation of these results. For instance, the deletion of the C-terminal (Δ1121-1488) results may indicate that the interaction with UBF is important. A charge-scrambled central domain mutant may have lost its interaction with Pol I. These specific interactions may establish the architecture of the compartment and increase the local concentration of Treacle, which in turn could facilitate phase separation locally. LLPS and specific protein-protein interactions are not mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>Overall, the data supports the idea that the overexpressed Treacle behaves like a classic phase-separated protein, but it is still possible that at physiological levels its specific interactions with other proteins are also important for the organization of FC. I am not suggesting that authors performed a conceptually different work, but this aspect should be discussed in the manuscript.</p>
<p>Other points:</p>
<p>FACS - sorting used throughout the study to separate treatment from the control essentially distinguishes transfected vs untransfected cells. Since the transfection itself can have odd effects, it might be beneficial to include an additional control involving Cas9 transfection with a non-targeting guide RNA.</p>
<p>The authors convincingly demonstrated in Figure 1 that the depletion of Treacle reduces RPA194 occupancy on the rDNA. This raises a question: which Treacle mutants can restore RPA194 occupancy, and which cannot?</p>
<p>Figure 2 - measuring FRAP recovery rates as indicative of LLPS, at least for the full-length Treacle, would be more informative if authors assessed the protein turnover within the compartment (half or partial FRAP) versus exchange in and out of the compartment (full compartment FRAP).</p>
<p>Statement related to Figure 2: &quot;Fluorescence recovery in FCs, nucleolar caps, and extranucleolar condensates never reached the initial values over the analyzed time periods. This suggests that the high molecular exchange rate occurs through the mixing of Treacle molecules within the condensate boundaries and does not involve external diffusion&quot;. Assuming the post-bleach data were normalized to the cell's total fluorescent intensity, the presence of a substantial immobile fraction could also suggest high-affinity binding of that fraction to something within the compartment.</p>
<p>Data related to DDR activation in ribosomal genes under genotoxic stress (Figure 5) is convincing, but it would not hurt to confirm the key findings in a more normal cell line, since HeLa cells may not accurately represent all aspects of healthy DDR.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Velichko, Artem, et al. investigate the role played by the long intrinsically disordered protein Trecle in nucleolar morphology and function, with an interest in its potential ability to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation. The authors explore Treacle's role in core functions of the nucleolus (rRNA biogenesis and DNA repair), which has been a subject of continual investigation since it was identified that truncation of Treacle is the major genetic cause of Treacher-Collins syndrome. They show that knock out of Treacle leads to de-mixing of canonical markers of the FC (UBF, RPA194) and DFC (FBL) phases of the nucleolus. They also show that replacing Treacle with mutants that disrupt its bulk dynamics leads to the de-mixing of FBL. These mutants either remove the central region of Treacle (∆83-1121) or, more subtly, reduce the segregation of charged residues by scrambling them (CS- Charge Scrambled). The observed morphological disruptions mirrored disruptions to the production of rRNA and the ability to recruit the DNA-damage response factor TOPBP1. These data give new insight into the role played by the central region of Treacle in affecting its bulk dynamics and the potential effects of disruptions therein to nucleolar morphology and function.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The characterizations of changes to nuclear morphology upon Treacle knockout is the major strength of this study (Figure 1). Methodologically the CRISPR knockout appears sound. The characterized effects on the canonical markers of the FC and DFC phases support the idea that Treacle has a scaffolding function. While the effect of Treacle perturbations has been studied before, this has often been phenotyped in the context of development or rRNA biogenesis, and less often on the sub-cellular level.</p>
<p>The other major strength of this study is its characterization of the effects of the charge scramble mutant. The authors find that replacing endogenous Treacle with this mutant reduces the bulk dynamics of Treacle (Figure 3K-M), de-mixes FBL from the DFC (Figure 4C-D), lowers pre-rRNA synthesis (Figure 4E-G), and abolishes the recruitment of the DNA-damage response factor TOPBP1 (Figure 5).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Clarity around the reagents used and deeper analyses would bolster the author's claims about the condensation behavior of Treacle.</p>
<p>Limited characterization and sparse methodological details regarding recombinant Treacle lead to a concern about the observation that Treacle condenses in vitro. The concerns are offset by the fact that most of the paper uses cellular data to draw conclusions.</p>
<p>The authors ascribe liquid-like behavior to Treacle based on spherical morphology and fusion events of Treacle-Katushka2S condensates as well as fluorescence recovery after a photobleaching (FRAP); these are accepted characterizations in the biomedical field. Nonetheless, the authors only use FRAP to characterize mutants, which limits conclusions about their apparent material state. Overall, FRAP data are better interpreted as a readout of bulk dynamics. For example, the FRAP traces of Treacle plateau at a recovery percentage between 40 and 60%, indicating complex bulk dynamics and the possibility of an immobile pool that is not liquid-like.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Treacle-Katushka2S construct is the predominant construct used throughout the paper. The known tetrameric nature of Katushka2S contrasts with the presumptively monomeric Treacle-FusionRed-Cry2 construct. This is relevant because multi-valance is known to increase the driving forces for condensation and affect condensate material properties. The authors report that the Treacle-FusionRed-Cry2 construct (monomeric) exhibits less condensation than the Treacle-Katushka2S construct (tetrameric). Thus, one is left concerned that the latter construct is not wholly representative of intrinsic Treacle condensation behavior.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study provides evidence that the protein Treacle plays an essential role in the structure and function of the fibrillar center (FC) of the nucleolus, which is surrounded by the dense fibrillar component (DFC) and the granular component (GC). The authors provide new evidence that, like the DFC and GC, the functional FC compartment involves a biomolecular condensate that contains Treacle as a key component. Treacle is essential to the transcription of the rDNA as well as proper rRNA processing that the authors tie to a role in maintaining the separation of FC components from the DFC. In vitro and in vivo experiments highlight that Treacle is itself capable of undergoing condensation in a manner that depends on concentration and charge-charge interactions but is not affected by 1,6 hexanediol, which disrupts weak hydrophobic interactions. Attempting to generate separation-of-function mutants, the authors provide further evidence of complex interactions that drive proper condensation in the FC mediated by both the central repeat (low-complexity, likely driving the condensation) and C-terminal domain (which appears to target the specificity of the condensation to the proper location). Using mutant forms of Treacle defective in condensation, the authors provide evidence that these same protein forms are also disrupted in supporting Treacle's functions in rDNA transcription and rRNA processing. Last, the authors suggest that cells lacking Treacle are defective in the DNA damage response at the rDNA in response to VP16.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>In general, the data are of high quality, the experiments are well-designed and the findings are mostly carefully interpreted. The findings of the work complement prior high-impact studies of the DFC and GC that have identified constituent proteins as the lynchpins of the biomolecular condensates that organize the nucleolus into its canonical three concentric compartment structure and are therefore likely to be of broad interest. The attempts to generate separation-of-function mutants to dissect the contribution of condensation to Treacle function are ambitious and critical to demonstrating the relevance of this property to the biology of the FC. The complementarity of the methods applied to investigate the Treacle function is appropriate and the findings integrate well towards a compelling narrative.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although the attempt to generate separation of function mutants of Treacle is laudable (and essential), there still remain possible alternative explanations for the observed defects in such mutants as most of the experimental approaches give rise to negative results. The DDR angle of the manuscript seems somewhat more preliminary as it is largely restricted to looking at the recruitment of DDR factors to the rDNA in response to a specific insult (VP16). It would be more compelling if the authors could investigate a more biologically relevant outcome (e.g. rDNA repeat number stability).</p>
