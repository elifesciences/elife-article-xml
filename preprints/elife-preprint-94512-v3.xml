<abstract>
<p>Cardiac arrhythmia leads to increased risks for stroke, heart failure, and cardiac arrest. Arrhythmic pathology is often rooted in the cardiac conduction system, but the mechanism is complex and not fully understood. For example, how metabolic diseases, like obesity and diabetes, increase the risk for cardiac arrhythmia. Glucagon regulates glucose production, mobilizes lipids from the fat body, and affects cardiac rate and rhythm, attributes of a likely key player. <italic>Drosophila</italic> is an established model to study metabolic diseases and cardiac arrhythmias. Since glucagon signaling is highly conserved, we used high-fat diet (HFD)-fed flies to study its effect on heart function. HFD led to increased heartbeat and an irregular rhythm. The HFD-fed flies showed increased levels of adipokinetic hormone (Akh), the functional equivalent to human glucagon. Both genetic reduction of Akh and eliminating the Akh producing cells (APC) rescued HFD-induced arrhythmia, whereas heart rhythm was normal in Akh receptor mutants (<italic>AkhR<sup>null</sup></italic>). Furthermore, we discovered a pair of cardiac neurons that express high levels of Akh receptor. These are located near the posterior heart, make synaptic connections at the heart muscle, and regulate heart rhythm. Altogether, this Akh signaling pathway provides new understanding of the regulatory mechanisms between metabolic disease and cardiac arrhythmia.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Arrhythmia refers to an irregular, decreased (bradycardia), or increased (tachycardia) heartbeat. Temporary disruption is usually benign, however chronic arrhythmia has been linked to significantly increased risks for stroke, heart failure, and cardiac arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kannel et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Nattel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Roberts-Thomson et al., 2011</xref>). Its pathogenesis is rooted in the cardiac conduction system; however, the mechanism is complex and much remains unknown. Two well-established risk factors that directly contribute to the development of cardiovascular disorders and arrhythmia are obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gupta et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Powell-Wiley et al., 2021</xref>) and diabetes mellites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Aune et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Huxley et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). In fact, a longitudinal study into obesity (13.7 years mean follow-up; 5,282 participants) found a 4% increased risk for atrial fibrillation (a form of arrhythmia) per 1-unit increased body mass index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). The other major risk factor, diabetes mellitus has been shown to impact the cardiac conduction system, leading to increased risk of developing atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kannel et al., 1998</xref>). A meta-analysis found that patients with diabetes had a 28-40% increased risk for developing atrial fibrillation, with a 20% risk increase reported for pre-diabetic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Aune et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Huxley et al., 2011</xref>). The relationship between higher blood glucose levels and increased risk for atrial fibrillation was dose-responsive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Aune et al., 2018</xref>). Diabetes mellites, when considered a cause of disrupted metabolism, as well as obesity have been independently associated with increased risk for atrial fibrillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). However, to what extent diabetes, blood glucose, and obesity contribute to atrial fibrillation, independently or collectively, and through which pathomechanism requires further study.</p>
<p>Antagonistic actions by glucagon and insulin regulate glucose metabolism. Besides regulating glucose release from the liver, glucagon facilitates the release of glucose as well as lipids from the fat body, acts as a satiety factor in the central nervous system, affects the glomerular filtration rate, and regulates intra-islet secretion of insulin, glucagon and somatostatin to meet increased energy demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Habegger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Heppner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Vuguin and Charron, 2011</xref>). These glucagon regulatory effects are evident in patient studies that showed that an impaired counter-regulatory glucagon response, observed as increased free plasma insulin levels, contributes to glucose instability in patients with long-term diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Scott et al., 1980</xref>); that consumption of dietary fats leads to increased plasma glucagon levels in healthy volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Radulescu et al., 2010</xref>); and that plasma glucagon levels were significantly higher in people considered obese compared to those considered lean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Stern et al., 2019</xref>). Glucagon has been repeatedly shown to affect heart contraction and heart rate. However, the nature of this effect is complex; whether glucagon acts anti- or pro-arrhythmogenic seems to depend on context, such as a non-failing heart or a heart at acute or chronic failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Neumann et al., 2023</xref>). That said, glucagon-producing tumors, <italic>i.e.</italic>, glucagonomas, can cause tachycardia (a form of arrhythmia defined as &gt;100 heart beats per minute) and heart failure without secondary cause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chang-Chretien et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, glucagonoma tumor resection resulted in a normalized heart rate and a return to typical heart size and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chang-Chretien et al., 2004</xref>). Similarly, glucagon infusion in healthy human volunteers induced arrhythmias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jaca et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Markiewicz et al., 1978</xref>). Thus, while glucagon clearly affects heart rhythm, when considering the underlying mechanism much remains unknown.</p>
<p>The link between high-fat diet (HFD), glucagon, and cardiac arrhythmia is conserved and well-established in animal models. In fact, studies from the 1960s already showed that glucagon increases heart rate in a variety of mammalian species, including dogs, cats, guinea pigs, and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Farah and Tuttle, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lucchesi et al., 1968</xref>). More recently, it was shown in mice that both glucagon and the glucagon receptor (Gcgr) are involved in heart rate regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Mukharji et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Sowden et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> adipokinetic hormone (Akh), the functional equivalent to human glucagon, is expressed in a small cluster of endocrine neurons, Akh producing cells (APC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kim and Rulifson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lee and Park, 2004</xref>). These cells in the corpora cardiaca near the esophagus function similar to islet cells in mammals, including the mechanism that regulates hormone secretion, and are essential for larval glucose homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kim and Rulifson, 2004</xref>). Like glucagon, Akh is known to also mobilize lipids from the fat body to regulate glucose levels, in the form of trehalose, in the circulating hemolymph to accommodate increased energy demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Isabel et al., 2005</xref>). Likewise, increased Akh increases the heart rate in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Noyes et al., 1995</xref>). These studies together suggest that glucagon and glucagon signaling, aside from regulating blood sugar levels, play an evolutionarily conserved role in heart rate regulation.</p>
<p><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> is a well-established model to study heartbeat and heart arrhythmia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Birse et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Ding et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Ocorr et al., 2007</xref>). For example, HFD-fed flies were used to study the genetic mechanisms of cardiac dysfunction in obesity. It found that HFD leads to reduced cardiac contractility and a reduced heart period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Birse et al., 2010</xref>). Notably, this phenotype was attenuated by intervention at the insulin-TOR signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Birse et al., 2010</xref>), thus supporting a connection between obesity, glucagon, insulin and cardiac function. Here, we used <italic>Drosophila</italic> fed a HFD to study heart arrhythmia. HFD led to increased Akh in the APC of the corpora cardiaca. We then identified a hitherto undescribed pair of cardiac neurons near the posterior heart that highly express the Akh receptor (AkhR) and directly innervate the fly heart. We show that these AkhR cardiac neurons (ACN) regulate heart rhythm in the flies and mediate the HFD-induced arrhythmia. Given the conservation of Akh/glucagon signaling, these findings likely have implications for arrhythmia in patients. Given the significance of the vagus nerve in cardiac rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ambache and Lippold, 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cai et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Freeman, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">González et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kharbanda et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">van Weperen and Vaseghi, 2023</xref>) it could fulfill a similar function.</p>

<title>High-fat diet increases heart rate and arrhythmia index</title>
<p>All flies (<italic>w</italic><sup>1118</sup>) that eclosed (<italic>i.e.</italic>, adults that emerged from pupa) within 8 hours were sorted (females only) and transferred to fresh food vials (25 flies per vial) containing normal fat diet (NFD) or high-fat diet (HFD, NutriFly diet supplemented with 14% fat) for 7 days. At which point, we determined the heartbeat of the flies using optical coherence tomography (OCT) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Flies on a HFD show a significantly reduced heart period and increased arrhythmia index compared to NFD-fed flies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-D</xref>). These findings are in agreement with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Birse et al., 2010</xref>) and indicate that HFD imposes a pathogenic effect on heart function.</p>

<title>High-fat diet up-regulates Akh expression and increases Akh producing cell (APC) activity</title>
<p>The ingestion of superfluous macronutrients has a great impact on metabolism and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Liao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zhao et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">2022</xref>). We observed enlarged crops, the functional equivalent to the human stomach, in the HFD-fed flies (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1</xref>). We asked whether the metabolic signaling pathways contributed to the HFD-caused pathogenic effect on the heart. Akh, the functional equivalent to human glucagon, is expressed by a group of neuroendocrine cells known as APC in the corpora cardiaca (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lee and Park, 2004</xref>). Indeed, flies that carried <italic>Akh-</italic>Gal4 to express GFP showed Akh producing cells at the corpora cardiaca, which attaches to the esophagus, just anterior to the proventriculus (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>).

<p>Next, to test whether HFD affects APC neuron activity, we used CaLexA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Masuyama et al., 2012</xref>). A basal level of CaLexA fluorescence was observed in the APC of NFD-fed flies, while a significantly higher fluorescence was detected in the APC of HFD-fed flies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C, D</xref>).

<title>The role of AkhR, glucagon-like receptor, in regulating heart rate and rhythm</title>
<p>Heart function is dependent on ATP continuous synthesis. Cardiac ATP comes from fatty acids, glucose, and lactate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kodde et al., 2007</xref>). Glucagon converts stored glycogen, in the liver and fat tissue, into glucose that is released into the blood stream/ Its link to cardiac arrhythmia has been well-established. The glucose signaling pathway is conserved across species, including <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kim and Rulifson, 2004</xref>). Like in humans, in flies the glucagon-like hormone Akh regulates the glucose levels in hemolymph (fly equivalent to blood) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kim and Rulifson, 2004</xref>). Under starvation conditions, Akh mobilizes glycogen and lipids to maintain the circulatory glucose levels. The flies become hyperactive and show increased food searching behavior. Flies without Akh, either by depletion or APC elimination, show starvation resistant behavior, suggesting that the behavioral change is mediated by Akh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lee and Park, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Yu et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, in flies fed a HFD, the AkhR expressing neurons in the brain become hypersensitive to Akh stimulation, due to upregulated AkhR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Huang et al., 2020</xref>). Finally, prepupae injected with low pharmacological doses of Akh, <italic>i.e.</italic>, doses higher than physiologically expected, showed increased heart rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Noyes et al., 1995</xref>). Thus, in both humans and flies, heart rate and rhythm respond to nutritional changes (flies, see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), this mechanism likely supports the higher metabolic demands and possibly mediates the switch from glucose to stored lipids as the main energy source.</p>
<p>To date, studies have focused on the direct effect of glucagon on cardiac tissue, based on the notion that cardiomyocytes express glucagon receptors (GCGR). However, evidence of GCGR expression in human heart tissue has been conflicting. No cardiac signal was detected when using radioactively labeled glucagon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bomholt et al., 2022</xref>), results of mRNA data have been inconsistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Aranda-Domene et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bomholt et al., 2022</xref>), and protein data for GCGR to support cardiac expression is lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Neumann et al., 2023</xref>). Here, we identified an endocrine neuron-heart axis using a fly model for high-fat diet-induced arrhythmia. In this fly model (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>), the consumption of a HFD elevates the expression of Akh, a glucagon-like hormone, and activity of the APC. The elevated circulatory Akh is transported to the AkhR cardiac neurons (ACN) located near the posterior end of the heart, where the increased signaling leads to an escalated heart arrhythmia index. We speculate that the ACNs are sympathetic in the adults, which is in line with Akh functioning as a cardioaccelerator in prepupae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Noyes et al., 1995</xref>). These findings revealed a hitherto undescribed regulatory signaling pathway that links the consumption of superfluous macronutrients with heart arrhythmia.</p>

The ACN are a pair of neurons located at the posterior end of the adult fly heart, that regulate the heartbeat.

<title>Cardiac regulatory neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic></title>
<p><italic>Drosophila</italic> have a cardiac cycle that consists of alternating retrograde and anterograde heart beats that correlate to the multi-chamber diastole and systole, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dulcis and Levine, 2005</xref>). Accordingly, two signaling systems that innervate the fly heart were identified. The retrograde beat being regulated by glutamatergic innervation. Its transverse nerves run bilaterally along the longitudinal muscle and innervate the cardiac muscles of the conical chamber as well as the alary muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dulcis and Levine, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">2003</xref>). The anterograde heartbeat being regulated by crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP) innervation. Its bipolar neurons (BpN) extent CCAP fibers that innervate each segment of the abdominal heart. Four additional large CCAP-positive neurons innervate the terminal chamber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dulcis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dulcis and Levine, 2003</xref>). These earlier studies, leave the possibility of synaptic input or hormonal regulation of the BpN neurosecretory signals to the heart. The authors comment on the absence of direct descending input from the corpora cardiaca to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> abdominal heart as has been observed in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dulcis and Levine, 2003</xref>). Here, we identified corpora cardiaca released Akh signaling to previously unreported AkhR cardiac neurons (ACN) that could exercise this function in flies. Given their localization at the terminal end of the cardiac chamber, where the four large CCAP-positive neurons are located as well, it is possible that the ACN modulate CCAP signaling at the heart. In fact, the previous study detected synaptotagmin on the BpN (BpN6) cell bodies which suggests the presence of presynaptic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dulcis and Levine, 2003</xref>). We are currently investigating if the BpN and ACN act together, whether in concert or opposingly.</p>

<title>Relevance of findings in fly for humans</title>
<p>This study revealed how glucagon-like hormone Akh is released by APCs in response to HFD and stimulates AkhR cardiac neurons (ACN) to regulate heart rhythm in flies. Like in the flies, glucagon infusion in healthy human volunteers induces arrhythmias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jaca et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Markiewicz et al., 1978</xref>). Moreover, a preliminary study in infants and children demonstrated the potential of glucagon to treat atrioventricular (AV) block, a heart rhythm disorder marked by a slow heart rate caused by dysfunctional electrical conduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hurwitz, 1973</xref>). Clinical guidelines by the American Heart Association recommend the use of glucagon to treat bradycardia due to beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker overdose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kusumoto et al., 2019</xref>). However, the mechanism by which glucagon exerts these beneficial clinical effects remains poorly understood. Our findings implicate a potentially conserved signaling pathway in which elevated glucagon leads to increased cardiac neuronal activity and subsequent increased heart rate and arrhythmia. Multiple trials are investigating the possible benefits of glucagon receptors (GCGR) agonists alone or in combination with GLP-1 agonists to treat arrhythmia, but so far the results have been mixed. An initial trial with a GCGR antagonist in patients with type 2 diabetes was halted prematurely due to the detrimental side effects, which included elevated blood cholesterol and steatosis (liver dysfunction) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agrawal and Gupta, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kazda et al., 2016a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Pearson et al., 2016</xref>). Our findings provide new possible glucagon-related targets for treating obesity-associated cardiac arrhythmia by targeting cardiac neurons receptive to glucagon signaling rather than the cardiomyocytes as had been the leading hypothesis to date. Studies into the human equivalent of ACN would be interesting; possibly the vagus nerve could fulfill a similar function as its importance for cardiac rhythm has been firmly established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ambache and Lippold, 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cai et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Freeman, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">González et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kharbanda et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">van Weperen and Vaseghi, 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, while the exact implications of these findings for new therapeutics remain to be seen, they do support the avoidance of a high-fat diet. If unavoidable, for example in the case of a therapeutic ketogenic diet or in the subset of patients with diabetes that have elevated glucagon blood levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">D’Alessio, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Unger et al., 1970</xref>), then targeting the glucagon pathway might protect against harmful cardiac side effects.</p>

The following antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal anti-Brp 1:100 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA; nc82, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:RRID:AB_2314866">RRID:AB_2314866</ext-link>); rabbit anti-Akh (1:1000); goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 568 1:500 (ThermoFisher; A-11011); goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 647 1:500 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA; 115-605-003). Alexa Fluor 647 Phalloidin 1:1,000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA; A22287) was used to stain the filament actin. Antibodies were diluted in the blocking buffer. The specimens were mounted with Vectashield antifade mounting media (Vector Laboratories, Newark, CA; H-1000). The samples were imaged using a ZEISS LSM 900 confocal microscope and ZEISS ZEN blue edition (version 3.0) acquisition software under a 20x Plan-Apochromat 0.8 N.A. air objective or a 63x Plan-Apochromat 1.4 N.A. oil objective. For quantitative comparison of intensities, settings were chosen to avoid oversaturation (using range indicator in ZEN blue) and applied across images for all samples within an assay. Image J was used for image processing (version 2.9.0/1.53t; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>).</p>

            <title>Reverse Transcriptase-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)</title>
            <p>For quantification of Akh and AkhR mRNA levels, adult female flies fed NFD or HFD for 7 days were transferred into 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes (10 flies/tube) and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, Cat# 15596026) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In brief, 0.5 mL TRIzol was added to each tube, then flies were grinded using a pestle. Following, 0.1 ml chloroform was added, sample tubes securely capped, and vigorously shaken by hand for 15 seconds. Samples were incubated at 22°C for 2 minutes, then centrifuged at 12,000x<italic>g</italic> for 15 minutes at 4°C, and supernatants transferred to a clean tube in which total RNA was precipitated using isopropanol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO; 67-63-0). Synthesis of cDNA using reverse transcriptase was performed with the RNA to cDNA EcoDry Premix kit (Takara Bio, San Jose, CA; 639549) and and the subsequent quantitative PCR using PowerSYBR Green (Applied Biosystems - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA; 4367659), according to the manufacturers’ protocols. qPCR was performed using a QuantStudio 6 Pro Real-Time PCR machine (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The following primers (5’-3’) were used: Akh_F TTTCGAGACACAGCAGGGCA, with Akh_R GGTGCTTGCAGTCCAGAAA; AkhR_F ACAATCCGTCGGTGAACA, with AkhR_R CATCACCTGGCCTCTTCCAT. For each treatment, three biological replicates were prepared.

The newly eclosed adults were transferred to fresh food vials containing NFD or HFD for 3 days. The flies were then dissected in 1x phosphate buffered saline (1xPBS) (Quality Biological, Gaithersburg, MD; 119-069-131) at room temperature and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA; J19943.K2) in 1xPBS for 1 hour at room temperature, followed by three 15 min washes in 1xPBS with Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO; 9002-93-1) (PBST). The specimens were then stained in DAPI (0.5 μg/ml in PBST) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA; D1306) for 10 min and washed once for 15 min in 1xPBS before mounting with Vectashield antifade mounting media (Vector Laboratories, Newark, CA; H-1000).

<p>This study reports <bold>useful</bold> information on the mechanisms by which a high-fat diet induces arrhythmias in the model organism Drosophila. Specifically, the authors propose that adipokinetic hormone (Akh) secretion is increased with this diet, and through binding of Akh to its receptor on cardiac neurons, arrhythmia is induced. The authors have revised their manuscript, but in some areas the evidence remains <bold>incomplete</bold>, which the authors say future studies will be directed to closing the present gaps. Nonetheless, the data presented will be helpful to those who wish to extend the research to a more complex model system, such as the mouse.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the manuscript submission by Zhao et al. entitled, &quot;Cardiac neurons expressing a glucagon-like receptor mediate cardiac arrhythmia induced by high-fat diet in Drosophila&quot; the authors assert that cardiac arrhythmias in Drosophila on a high fat diet is due in part to adipokinetic hormone (Akh) signaling activation. High fat diet induces Akh secretion from activated endocrine neurons, which activate AkhR in posterior cardiac neurons. Silencing or deletion of Akh or AkhR blocks arrhythmia in Drosophila on high fat diet. Elimination of one of two AkhR expressing cardiac neurons results in arrhythmia similar to high fat diet.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors propose a novel mechanism for high fat diet induced arrhythmia utilizing the Akh signaling pathway that signals to cardiac neurons.</p>

<p>Zhao et al. provide new insights into the mechanism by which a high-fat diet (HFD) induces cardiac arrhythmia employing Drosophila as a model. HFD induces cardiac arrhythmia in both mammals and Drosophila. Both glucagon and its functional equivalent in Drosophila Akh are known to induce arrhythmia. The study demonstrates that Akh mRNA levels are increased by HFD and both Akh and its receptor are necessary for high-fat diet-induced cardiac arrhythmia, elucidating a novel link. Notably, Zhao et al. identify a pair of AKH receptor-expressing neurons located at the posterior of the heart tube. Interestingly, these neurons innervate the heart muscle and form synaptic connections, implying their roles in controlling the heart muscle. The study presented by Zhao et al. is intriguing, and the rigorous characterization of the AKH receptor-expressing neurons would significantly enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying HFD-induced cardiac arrhythmia.</p>
<p>Many experiments presented in the manuscript are appropriate for supporting the conclusions while additional controls and precise quantifications should help strengthen the authors' arguments. The key results obtained by loss of Akh (or AkhR) and genetic elimination of the identified AkhR-expressing cardiac neurons do not reconcile, complicating the overall interpretation.</p>
<p>The most exciting result is the identification of AkhR-expressing neurons located at the posterior part of the heart tube (ACNs). The authors attempted to determine the function of ACNs by expressing rpr with AkhR-GAL4, which would induce cell death in all AkhR-expressing cells, including ACNs. The experiments presented in Figure 6 are not straightforward to interpret. Moreover, the conclusion contradicts the main hypothesis that elevated Akh is the basis of HFD-induced arrhythmia. The results suggest the importance of AkhR-expressing cells for normal heartbeat. However, elimination of Akh or AkhR restores normal rhythm in HFD-fed animals, suggesting that Akh and AkhR are not important for maintaining normal rhythms. If Akh signaling in ACNs is key for HFD-induced arrhythmia, genetic elimination of ACNs should unalter rhythm and rescue the HFD-induced arrhythmia. An important caveat is that the experiments do not test the specific role of ACNs. ACNs should be just a small part of the cells expressing AkhR. Specific manipulation of ACNs will significantly improve the study. Moreover, the main hypothesis suggests that HFD may alter the activity of ACNs in a manner dependent on Akh and AkhR. Testing how HFD changes calcium, possibly by CaLexA (Figure 2) and/or GCaMP, in wild-type and AkhR mutant could be a way to connect ACNs to HFD-induced arrhythmia. Moreover, optogenetic manipulation of ACNs may allow for specific manipulation of ACNs.</p>
<p>Interestingly, expressing rpr with AkhR-GAL4 was insufficient to eliminate both ACNs. It is not clear why it didn't eliminate both ACNs. Given the incomplete penetrance, appropriate quantifications should be helpful. Additionally, the impact on other AhkR-expressing cells should be assessed. Adding more copies of UAS-rpr, AkhR-GAL4, or both may eliminate all ACNs and other AkhR-expressing cells. The authors could also try UAS-hid instead of UAS-rpr.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the manuscript submission by Zhao et al. entitled, &quot;Cardiac neurons expressing a glucagon-like receptor mediate cardiac arrhythmia induced by high-fat diet in Drosophila&quot; the authors assert that cardiac arrhythmias in Drosophila on a high fat diet is due in part to adipokinetic hormone (Akh) signaling activation. High fat diet induces Akh secretion from activated endocrine neurons, which activate AkhR in posterior cardiac neurons. Silencing or deletion of Akh or AkhR blocks arrhythmia in Drosophila on high fat diet. Elimination of one of two AkhR expressing cardiac neurons results in arrhythmia similar to high fat diet.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors propose a novel mechanism for high fat diet induced arrhythmia utilizing the Akh signaling pathway that signals to cardiac neurons.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The authors have addressed my other concerns. The only outstanding issue is in regard to the following comment:</p>
<p>The authors state that &quot;HFD led to increased heartbeat and an irregular rhythm.&quot; In representative examples shown, HFD resulted in pauses, slower heart rate, and increased irregularity in rhythm but not consistently increased heart rate (Figures 1B, 3A, and 4C). Based on the cited work by Ocorr et al (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0609278104">https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0609278104</ext-link>), Drosophila heart rate is highly variable with periods of fast and slow rates, which the authors attributed to neuronal and hormonal inputs. Ocorr et al then describe the use of &quot;semi-intact&quot; flies to remove autonomic input to normalize heart rate. Were semi-intact flies used? If not, how was heart rate variability controlled? And how was heart rate &quot;increase&quot; quantified in high fat diet compared to normal fat diet? Lastly, how does one measure &quot;arrhythmia&quot; when there is so much heart rate variability in normal intact flies?</p>
<p>The authors state that 8 sec time windows were selected at the discretion of the imager for analysis. I don't know how to avoid bias unless the person acquiring the imaging is blinded to the condition and the analysis is also done blind. Can you comment whether data acquisition and analysis was done in a blinded fashion? If not, this should be stated as a limitation of the study.</p>

<p>Drosophila heart rate is highly variable. During the recording, we were biased to choose a time window when heartbeat was fairly stable. This is a limitation of the study, which we mentioned in the revised version. We chose to use intact over “semi-intact” flies with an intention to avoid damaging the cardiac neurons.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Zhao et al. provide new insights into the mechanism by which a high-fat diet (HFD) induces cardiac arrhythmia employing Drosophila as a model. HFD induces cardiac arrhythmia in both mammals and Drosophila. Both glucagon and its functional equivalent in Drosophila Akh are known to induce arrhythmia. The study demonstrates that Akh mRNA levels are increased by HFD and both Akh and its receptor are necessary for high-fat diet-induced cardiac arrhythmia, elucidating a novel link. Notably, Zhao et al. identify a pair of AKH receptor-expressing neurons located at the posterior of the heart tube. Interestingly, these neurons innervate the heart muscle and form synaptic connections, implying their roles in controlling the heart muscle. The study presented by Zhao et al. is intriguing, and the rigorous characterization of the AKH receptor-expressing neurons would significantly enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying HFD-induced cardiac arrhythmia.</p>
<p>Many experiments presented in the manuscript are appropriate for supporting the conclusions while additional controls and precise quantifications should help strengthen the authors' arguments. The key results obtained by loss of Akh (or AkhR) and genetic elimination of the identified AkhR-expressing cardiac neurons do not reconcile, complicating the overall interpretation.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for the positive comments. We believe that more signaling pathways are active in the AkhR neurons and regulate rhythmic heartbeat. We are current searching for the molecules and pathways that act on the AkhR cardiac neurons to regulate the heartbeat. Thus, AkhR neuron x shall have a more profound effect. Loss of AkhR is not equivalent to AkhR neuron ablation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The most exciting result is the identification of AkhR-expressing neurons located at the posterior part of the heart tube (ACNs). The authors attempted to determine the function of ACNs by expressing rpr with AkhR-GAL4, which would induce cell death in all AkhRexpressing cells, including ACNs. The experiments presented in Figure 6 are not straightforward to interpret. Moreover, the conclusion contradicts the main hypothesis that elevated Akh is the basis of HFD-induced arrhythmia. The results suggest the importance of AkhR-expressing cells for normal heartbeat. However, elimination of Akh or AkhR restores normal rhythm in HFD-fed animals, suggesting that Akh and AkhR are not important for maintaining normal rhythms. If Akh signaling in ACNs is key for HFD-induced arrhythmia, genetic elimination of ACNs should unalter rhythm and rescue the HFD-induced arrhythmia. An important caveat is that the experiments do not test the specific role of ACNs. ACNs should be just a small part of the cells expressing AkhR. Specific manipulation of ACNs will significantly improve the study. Moreover, the main hypothesis suggests that HFD may alter the activity of ACNs in a manner dependent on Akh and AkhR. Testing how HFD changes calcium, possibly by CaLexA (Figure 2) and/or GCaMP, in wild-type and AkhR mutant could be a way to connect ACNs to HFD-induced arrhythmia. Moreover, optogenetic manipulation of ACNs may allow for specific manipulation of ACNs.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for suggesting the detailed experiments and we believe that address these points shall consolidate the results. As AkhR-Gal4 also expresses in the fat body, we set out to build a more specific driver. We planned to use split-Gal4 system (Luan et al. 2006. PMID: 17088209). The combination of pan neuronal Elav-Gal4.DBD and AkhRp65.AD shall yield AkhR neuron specific driver. We selected 2580 bp AkhR upstream DNA and cloned into pBPp65ADZpUw plasmid (Addgene plasmid: #26234). After two rounds of injection, however, we were not able to recover a transgenic line.</p>
<p>We used GCaMP to record the calcium signal in the AkhR neurons. AkhR-Gal4&gt;GCaMP has extremely high levels of fluorescence in the cardiac neurons under normal condition.</p>
<p>We are screening Gal4 drivers, trying to find one line that is specific to the cardiac neurons and has a lower level of driver activity.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Interestingly, expressing rpr with AkhR-GAL4 was insufficient to eliminate both ACNs. It is not clear why it didn't eliminate both ACNs. Given the incomplete penetrance, appropriate quantifications should be helpful. Additionally, the impact on other AhkR-expressing cells should be assessed. Adding more copies of UAS-rpr, AkhR-GAL4, or both may eliminate all ACNs and other AkhR-expressing cells. The authors could also try UAS-hid instead of UASrpr.</p>

<p>We quantified the AkhR neuron ablation and found that about 69% (n=28) showed a single ACN in AkhR-Gal4&gt;rpr flies. It is more challenging to quantify other AkhR-expressing cells, as they are wide-spread distributed. We tried to add more copies of UAS-rpr or AkhR-Gal4, which caused developmental defects (pupa lethality). Thus, as mentioned above, we are trying to find a more specific driver for targeting the cardiac neurons.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>The authors refer 'crop' as the functional equivalent of the human stomach. Considering the difference in their primary functions, this cannot be justified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In Drosophila, the crop functions analogously to the stomach in vertebrates. It is a foregut storage and preliminary processing organ that regulates food passage into the midgut. It’s more than a simple reservoir. Crop engages in enzymatic mixing, neural control, and active motility.</p>

<p>Line 163 and 166, APCs are not neurons.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Akh-producing cells (APCs) in Drosophila are neuroendocrine cells, residing in the corpora cardiaca (CC). While they produce and secrete the hormone AKH (akin to glucagon), they are not brain interneurons per se. APCs share many neuronal features (vesicular release, axon-like projections) and receive neural inputs, effectively functioning as a peripheral endocrine center.</p>
