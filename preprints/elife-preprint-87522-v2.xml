<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The use of siblings to infer the factors influencing complex traits has been a cornerstone of quantitative genetics. Here we utilise siblings for a novel application: the inference of genetic architecture, specifically that relating to individuals with extreme trait values (e.g. in the top 1%). Inferring the genetic architecture most relevant to this group of individuals is important because they are at greatest risk of disease and may be more likely to harbour rare variants of large effect due to natural selection. We develop a theoretical framework that derives expected distributions of sibling trait values based on an index sibling’s trait value, estimated trait heritability, and null assumptions that include infinitesimal genetic effects and environmental factors that are either controlled for or have combined Gaussian effects. This framework is then used to develop statistical tests powered to distinguish between trait tails characterised by common polygenic architecture from those that include substantial enrichments of <italic>de novo</italic> or rare variant (Mendelian) architecture. We apply our tests to UK Biobank data here, although we note that they can be used to infer genetic architecture in any cohort or health registry that includes siblings and their trait values, since these tests do not use genetic data. We describe how our approach has the potential to help disentangle the genetic and environmental causes of extreme trait values, and to improve the design and power of future sequencing studies to detect rare variants.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The fields of quantitative genetics and genetic epidemiology have exploited the shared genetics and environment of siblings in many applications, notably to estimate heritability, using theory developed a century ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>), and more recently to infer a so-called ‘household effect’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>), which contributes to genetic risk indirectly via correlation between genetics and household environment. Here we leverage sibling trait data to infer genetic architecture departing from polygenicity, specifically affecting the tails of the trait distribution and consistent with enrichment in rare variants of large effect.</p>
<p>The genetic architecture of a complex trait is typically inferred from findings of multiple independent studies: genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identifying common variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>), whole exome or whole genome sequencing studies detecting rare variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>), and family sequencing studies designed to identify <italic>de novo</italic> and rare Mendelian mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). The relative contribution of each type of variant to trait heritability is a function of historical selection pressures on the trait in the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). If selection has recently acted to increase the average value of a trait, then the lower tail of the trait distribution may become enriched for large effect rare variants over time because trait-reducing alleles will be subject to negative selection, and so those with large effects - most likely to ‘push’ individuals to the lower tail - will be reduced to low frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Similarly, if the trait is subject to stabilising selection, then both tails of the trait distribution may be enriched for rare variant aetiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). This can result in less accurate polygenic scores in the tails of the trait distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>), and can also produce dissimilarity between siblings beyond what is expected under polygenicity. For example, studies on the intellectual ability of sibling pairs have demonstrated similarity for average intellectual ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>), regression-to-the-mean for siblings at the upper tail of the distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>), and complete discordance when one sibling is at the lower extreme tail of the distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). However, no theoretical framework has been developed to formally infer genetic architecture from sibling trait data.</p>
<p>We introduce a novel theoretical framework that allows widely available sibling trait data in population cohorts and health registries to be leveraged to perform statistical tests that can infer complex genetic architecture in the tails of the trait distribution. These tests are powered to differentiate between polygenic, <italic>de novo</italic> and Mendelian (i.e. rare variants of large effect) architectures (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>); while these are simplifications of true complex architectures, our tests allow enrichments of the different architectures to be inferred and compared across traits. This framework establishes expectations about the trait distributions of siblings of index individuals with extreme trait values (e.g. the top 1% of the trait) according to null assumptions of polygenicity, random mating and environmental factors that are either controlled for or have combined Gaussian effects. Critical to our framework is our derivation of the “conditional-sibling trait distribution”, which describes the trait distribution for one individual given the quantile value of one or more “index” siblings. Our statistical framework, derivation of the conditional-sibling trait distribution, and simulation study, allow us to develop statistical tests to infer genetic architecture from data on siblings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) without the need for genetic data (see Model &amp; Methods). We validate the statistical power of our tests using simulated data and apply our tests across a range of traits from the UK Biobank. We also release <italic>sibArc</italic>, an open-source software tool that can be used to apply our tests to sibling trait data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Our novel framework can be extended to applications such as estimating heritability, characterising mating patterns, and inferring historical selection pressures.</p>

<title>Model &amp; Methods</title>
<p>Here we outline a framework that models the <italic>conditional-sibling trait distribution</italic>, which describes an individual’s trait distribution conditioned on an <italic>index</italic> sibling’s trait value. In this section, we describe our derivation of the distribution for a completely polygenic trait, outline development of statistical tests that infer enrichments of rare genetic architectures via departures from polygenicity, and describe the simulation study used to validate and benchmark our results. Full derivations that complement this high-level summary of our methodology, as well as extended results from application of our tests to UK Biobank data, are included in the Appendices.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Conditional-Sibling Inference Framework</title>
<p>Assuming completely polygenic (i.e. infinitesimal) architecture, siblings of individuals with extreme trait values are expected to be less extreme. This regression-to-the-mean can be understood through the two factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>) that determine inherited genetic variation: <bold>(i)</bold> average genetic contribution of the parents (<italic>mid-parent</italic>) to the trait value, and, <bold>(ii)</bold> random genetic reassortment occurring during meiosis. Assuming that an individual presenting an upper-tail trait value does so due to <italic>both</italic> high mid-parent trait value <italic>and</italic> genetic reassortment favouring a higher value, then a sibling sharing common midparent trait value - but subject to independent reassortment - is likely to be less extreme. How much less extreme can be derived by first considering the conditional distribution that relates mid-parents and their offspring. In the simplest case, for a completely heritable continuous polygenic trait in a large population, the offspring trait values, <italic>s</italic>, are normally distributed around their mid-parent trait value, <italic>m</italic>, irrespective of selection and population structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>)
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="529159v2_eqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="529159v2_inline1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> represents within family variance, which is constant across the population. This result does not require the trait distribution across the population to be Gaussian. If we assume that the population distribution is Gaussian and there is random mating and no selection, then <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="529159v2_inline2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> half the population variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). For a trait with heritability <italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup>, trait variance can be partitioned into genetic, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="529159v2_inline3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> ,and environmental, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="529159v2_inline4.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> , contributions, such that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="529159v2_inline5.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="529159v2_inline6.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> . Assuming meancentred genetic and environmental trait contributions, and a trait variance of 1 (a standard normalised trait), the distribution for offspring conditioned on the mid-parent genetic trait value, <italic>m</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub>, is:
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="529159v2_eqn2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Since <italic>p</italic>(<italic>m</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub>) = <italic>𝒩</italic> (0, <italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup><italic>/</italic>2), from Bayes’ Theorem it can be shown that the mid-parent genetic trait value conditional on offspring trait value, <italic>s</italic>, is distributed as follows:
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="529159v2_eqn3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>From <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Equations 2</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3">3</xref>, the sibling trait distribution conditional on an index sibling can be calculated as:
<disp-formula id="eqn4">
<graphic xlink:href="529159v2_eqn4.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>A full derivation is provided on Appendix 1. This derivation via mid-parents can be generalised to cases where assumptions of random mating, Gaussian population trait distribution and no selection do not hold. When these assumptions do hold, then the conditional sibling distribution can also be derived from the joint sibling distribution defined by the relationship matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). In the Appendix, we use the joint sibling distribution to derive the distribution conditional on two sibling values. From (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>), we can infer that under complete heritability, the siblings of an individual with a standard normal trait value of <italic>z</italic>, will have a mean trait value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="529159v2_inline7.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> , with variance equal to three quarters of the population variance. In Appendix 1, we further generalise the result to binary phenotypes, increasing the utility of this framework for further applications and theoretical development.</p>

<title>Statistical Tests for Complex Tail Architecture</title>
<p>In <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, the strategy employed to develop statistical tests for complex tail architecture is depicted. Our approach corresponds to testing for deviations from the expected conditional-sibling trait distribution under the null hypothesis of complete polygenicity in trait tails (see above for other null assumptions): excess discordance is indicative of an enrichment of <italic>de novo</italic> mutations, while excess concordance indicates an enrichment of Mendelian variants, i.e. large effect variants segregating in the population. The heritability, <italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup>, required to define the null distribution, is estimated by maximising the log-likelihood of the conditional-sibling trait distribution (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">Equation 4</xref>) with respect to <italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup>:</p>

where <italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>s</italic><sub>2</sub> represent index and conditional-sibling trait values, respectively, and <italic>n</italic> is number of sibling pairs. This allows <italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup> to be estimated for given quantiles of the trait distribution by restricting sibling pair observations to those index siblings in the quantile of interest. To maximise power to detect non-polygenic architecture in the tails of the trait distribution, we estimate “polygenic heritability”, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="529159v2_inline8.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, from sibling pairs for which the index sibling trait value is between the 5<sup><italic>th</italic></sup> and 95<sup><italic>th</italic></sup> percentile (labelled “Distribution Body” in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Tests for complex architecture are then performed in relation to index siblings whose trait values are in the tails of the distribution (e.g. the lower and upper 1%).

<p>It should be noted that our estimate of <italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn5">Equation 5</xref> assumes no effects of shared environment. Polderman and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) found limited contribution of shared environment for most complex traits and, critically, our statistical tests are robust to shared environmental effects with consistent effects throughout the trait distribution (see Discussion).</p>

<title>Statistical Test for De Novo Architecture</title>

<title>Simulation of Conditional Sibling Data</title>

<p>In <bold>step D</bold>, we generate offspring trait values for different degrees of heritability by adding a Gaussian environmental effect. For heritability, <italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup>, offspring trait values are given by <italic>T</italic> = <italic>hG</italic> + <italic>E</italic>, where <italic>G</italic> is the genetic effect, standardised to have mean 0 and variance 1, and the environmental effect <italic>E</italic> is drawn from a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance (1<italic>− h</italic><sup>2</sup>). The simulated trait has a <italic>𝒩</italic> (0, 1) distribution.</p>
<p>In <bold>step E</bold>, we simulate the effect of complex tail architecture on the conditional-sibling trait distribution. We assume that rare variants are sufficiently penetrant to move individuals into the tails of the distribution, independent of their polygenic contribution. We, thus, modify sibling trait values for individuals already in the tails (from Step D) to minimise perturbation of the trait distribution. We simulate <italic>de novo</italic> tail architecture by resampling the less extreme sibling from the background distribution, and simulate Mendelian tail architecture by resampling the less extreme sibling from the background distribution with probability 0.5, and from the same tail as the extreme sibling with probability 0.5.</p>

<title>Application to UK Biobank Data</title>
<p>The UK Biobank includes data from over 21,000 siblings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). To apply our tests to this dataset we began by identifing continuous traits (at least 50 unique values) with at least 5,000 sibling pairs, as defined by kinship coefficient 0.18 - 0.35 and &gt; 0.1% SNPs with IBS0 to distinguish from parent-offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). After removing outliers with absolute trait value &gt; 8 standard deviations from the mean, we removed all traits with absolute skew or excess kurtosis greater than 0.5 to reduce the likelihood that skewed or heavy-tailed trait distributions impact our statistical tests. The remaining traits were standardised using rank-based inverse normal transformation and adjusted for age, sex, recruitment centre, batch covariates and the first 40 principle components. After this, to ensure a primarily additive polygenic aetiology, we required that traits have heritability <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="529159v2_inline10.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>) and that no single SNP contribute more than 0.01 to <italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>We applied our method to estimate heritability from sibling pairs (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn5">Equation 5</xref>) across the distribution and within the trait body (5<sup><italic>th</italic></sup> to 95<sup><italic>th</italic></sup> percentiles) on the remaining traits, and selected the eighteen traits for which both measures exceeded 30% for further analysis. For each of these eighteen traits, siblings were randomly assigned index and conditional status and both trait tails were tested for departures from polygenicity using our <italic>De Novo</italic> and Mendelian tests, as well as a general Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>) to identify departures from the conditional sibling distribution assuming polygenicity (Appendix 2).</p>

</fig>
<p>In <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4:B</xref> the conditional-sibling z-distribution is transformed into percentiles for interpretation in rank space. This distribution is skewed, especially at the tails, due to truncation at extreme quantiles (i.e. siblings cannot be more extreme than the top 1%). For a trait with <italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.95, siblings of individuals at the 99<sup><italic>th</italic></sup> percentile (z=2.32) have a mean trait value at the 80<sup><italic>th</italic></sup> percentile. Note that this is less extreme than the result of transforming their expected z-value into percentile space (Φ<sup><italic>−</italic>1</sup>(1.1) = 86%), which is a consequence of Jensen’s inequality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>) given that the inverse cumulative distribution function of the normal is convex above zero.</p>
<p>We compared the theoretical conditional-sibling trait distributions to those generated from simulated data (see Appendix 3) and found that irrespective of trait used to simulate data (e.g. fluid intelligence, height) the two distributions did not differ significantly, suggesting that our analytically derived distributions are a valid model for the conditional-sibling trait distribution (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">Equation 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Power of Statistical Tests to Identify Complex Tail Architecture</title>
<p>Building on the theoretical framework introduced in the Model &amp; Methods and illustrated in the previous section, we develop statistical tests to identify complex architecture in the tails of the trait distribution. These tests leverage the fact that the similarity (or dissimilarity) in trait values among siblings provides information about the underlying genetic architecture (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). For example, high-impact <italic>de novo</italic> mutations generate large dissimilarity between siblings when only one carries the unique mutant allele, while Mendelian variants can create excess similarity in the tails of the distribution when siblings both inherit the same mutant allele.</p>
<p>In Appendix 2, we provide detailed derivations for the statistical tests described at a high level in Model &amp; Methods and explain how they identify tail signatures in contrast to a polygenic background where conditional siblings regress-to-the-mean at a rate proportional to <italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup><italic>/</italic>2 (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">Equation 4</xref>). The performance of the two tests evaluated using simulated sibling data is shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>. These tests demonstrate that power to identify <italic>de novo</italic> architecture is greatest when heritability is high, while power to identify Mendelian architecture is greatest when heritability is low. These patterns can be explained by the fact that high heritability should lead to relatively high similarity among siblings, and low heritability to low similarity, under polygenicity. When heritability is estimated near 50% and at least 0.1% of the population has high-impact rare aetiology, both tests are well-powered to identify each class of complex tail architecture.</p>

<title>Identifying Complex Tail Architecture in UK Biobank Data</title>
<p>We applied our statistical tests for complex tail architecture to sibling-pair data on eighteen traits from the UK Biobank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Here were present results from a set of six traits with varied tail architecture: <italic>Sitting Height, Forced Expiratory Volume, Urate, Ankle Spacing, Left Hand Grip Strength, and Waist Circumference</italic>. For each trait we estimated conditional sibling heritability via <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn5">Equation 5</xref>, and performed tests to identify <italic>de novo</italic> and Mendelian architecture in the lower and upper tails of the distribution of each trait. Additionally, we also performed a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>) to provide a general test for any departures from our null model. We observed expected polygenic architecture in both tails for <italic>Ankle Spacing</italic>. We inferred Mendelian architecture in the lower tail for <italic>Urate</italic>, and the upper tail for <italic>Wait Circumference</italic> and <italic>Left Hand Grip Strength. De novo</italic> architecture was inferred in the lower tail for <italic>Forced Expiratory Volume</italic> and strongly inferred in both tails for <italic>Sitting Height</italic>, which is supported by evidence from deep sequencing studies indicating that rare variants play a substantial role in the genetic aetiology for this trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). In the lower tail for <italic>Left Hand Grip Strength</italic> we infer the presence of both <italic>De Novo</italic> (greater than expected mean) and Mendelian (more concordant siblings than expected) architecture. We note that this could occur as a result of highly penetrant variants that are only shared among some siblings or perhaps because at the extremes, siblings with different handedness are un-expectedly divergent and siblings with matching handedness are unexpectedly concordant. Extended results for all eighteen traits analysed can be found in Appendix 4.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this paper, we present a novel approach to infer the genetic architecture of continuous traits, specifically in the tails of the distributions, from sibling trait data alone. Our approach is based on a theoretical framework that we develop, which derives the expected trait distributions of siblings conditional on the trait value of an index-sibling and the trait heritability, assuming polygenicity, random mating and environmental factors that are either controlled for or have combined Gaussian effects. The key intuition underlying the approach is that departures from the expected <italic>conditional-sibling trait distribution</italic> in relation to index-siblings selected from the trait tails may be due to non-polygenic architecture in the tails.</p>
<p>We demonstrate the validity of our conditional-sibling analytical derivations through simulations and show that our tests for identifying <italic>de novo</italic> and Mendelian architecture in the tails of trait distributions are well-powered when large effect alleles are present in the population on the order of 1 out of 1000 individuals. Applying our test to a subset of well-powered traits in the UK Biobank, we find evidence of complex genetic architecture in at least one tail (<italic>α</italic> &lt; 0.05) in sixteen of eighteen traits and find <italic>de novo</italic> architecture occurring more frequently than Mendelian architecture (19 vs 6 of 36 total tails).</p>
<p>There are several areas in which our work could have short-term utility. Firstly, those individuals inferred as having rare variants of large effect could be followed up in multiple ways to gain individuallevel insights. For example, they could undergo clinical genetic testing to identify potential pathogenic variants with effects beyond the examined trait, either in the form of diseases or disorders that the individual has already been diagnosed with or else that they have yet to present with but may be at high future risk for. Furthermore, investigation of their environmental risk profile may indicate an alternative - environmental - explanation for their extreme trait value (see below), rather than the rare genetic architecture inferred by our tests.</p>
<p>Our framework could also help to refine the design of sequencing studies for identifying rare variants of large effect. Such studies either sequence entire cohorts at relatively high cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>) or else perform more targeted sequencing of individuals in the trait tails with the goal of optimising power per cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). However, even the latter approach is usually performed blind to evidence of enrichment of rare variant aetiology in the tails. Since our approach enables identification of individuals that may be most likely to harbour rare variants, then these individuals could be prioritised for (deep) sequencing. Moreover, our ability to distinguish between <italic>de novo</italic> and Mendelian architecture could influence the broad study design, with the former suggesting that a family trio design may be more effective than population sequencing, which may be favoured if Mendelian architecture is inferred. Furthermore, our approach could be applied as a screening step to prioritise those traits, and corresponding tails, most likely to harbour rare variant architecture. Finally, if sequence data have already been collected, either cohort-wide or using a more targeted design, then our approach could be utilised to increase the power of statistical methods for detecting rare variants by upweighting individuals most likely to harbour rare variants.</p>
<p>This study has several limitations. First and foremost, departures from the expected conditionalsibling trait distributions could be due to environmental risk factors, such as medication-use or work related exposures, rather than rare genetic architecture. Thus, while we believe that tail-specific deviations from polygenic expectation are interesting whether they arise primarily from genetic or environmental factors, we caution against over-interpretation of our results. Rejection of the null hypothesis from our tests should be considered only as indicating effects <italic>consistent with</italic> non-polygenic genetic architecture, alongside alternative explanations such as tail-specific unshared (<italic>de novo</italic>) or shared (“Mendelian”) environmental risks. We suggest that further investigation of individuals’ clinical, environmental and genetic profiles are required to achieve greater certainty about the causes of their extreme trait values. Nevertheless, given knowledge that rare variants of large effect contribute to complex trait architecture, we expect that traits for which we infer non-polygenic architecture, will, on average, be more enriched for rare architecture in the tail(s) than other traits. Secondly, our modelling assumes that environmental risk factors of siblings are independent of each other. If in fact shared environmental risk factors contribute significantly to trait similarity among siblings, then our heritability estimates will be upwardly biased. However, this would only impact our tests if the degree of shared environmental risk differed in the tails relative to the rest of the trait distribution. Moreover, a large meta-analysis of heritability estimates from twin studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) concluded that the contribution of shared environment among siblings (even twins) is insubstantial, and so we might expect this to have limited impact on results from our tests. Thirdly, our modelling assumes random mating and so the results from our tests in relation to traits that may be the subject of assortative mating should be considered with caution. Likewise, our modelling assumes additivity of genetic effects and so, while additivity is well-supported by much statistical genetics research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>), results from our tests should be reconsidered for any traits with evidence for significant non-additive genetic effects.</p>
<p>Our approach not only provides a novel way of inferring genetic architecture (without genetic data) but can do so specifically in the tails of trait distributions, which are most likely to harbour complex genetic architecture, due to selection, and are a key focus in biomedical research given their enrichment for disease. This work could also have broader implications in quantitative genetics since we derive fundamental results about the relationship among family members’ complex trait values. The conditional-sibling trait distribution provides a simple way of understanding the expected trait values of individuals according to their sibling’s trait value, which could be used to answer questions of societal importance and inform future research. For example, it can be used to answer questions such as: as a consequence of genetics alone, how much overlap should there be in the traits of offspring of mid-parents at the 5<sup><italic>th</italic></sup> and 95<sup><italic>th</italic></sup> percentile and how does that contrast with what we observe in highly structured societies? Moreover, further development of the theory described here could lead to a range of other applications, for example, estimating levels of assortative mating, inferring historical selection pressures, and quantifying heritability in specific strata of the population.</p>

<title>Derivation of Conditional Sibling Distributions</title>
<p>Here we derive the distribution that describes the probability density of the “conditional” sibling (<italic>S</italic><sub>2</sub>) given the genetic liability, trait value and case-status of one or more index siblings. In each case we assume a population of unrelated parents and rely on the results from the <italic>infinitesimal polygenic model</italic> that show that within family variance is normally distributed around midparent genetic liability (average of parents) with half the ancestral trait variance even when selection, drift, population structure or dominance effects alter the between family trait distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>).</p>
<sec id="s5">
<title>Case 1) Index liability known, continuous trait (<italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup> = 1): <italic>P</italic> (<italic>S</italic><sub>2</sub>|<italic>S</italic><sub>1</sub> = <italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub>)</title>
<p>We begin with the simplest case, a polygenic normally distributed trait which is fully heritable (<italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup> = 1) where the genetic liability of an index sibling in a population is known. Throughout we denote the midparent, index sibling and conditional sibling by <italic>M, S</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>S</italic><sub>2</sub>. We begin by calculating the midparent distribution conditional on index liability using Bayes theorem:
<disp-formula id="eqn10">
<graphic xlink:href="529159v2_eqn10.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Then using the following identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>):
<disp-formula id="eqn11">
<graphic xlink:href="529159v2_eqn11.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
we calculate the conditional sibling distribution similarly:
<disp-formula id="eqn12">
<graphic xlink:href="529159v2_eqn12.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Thus, as predicted by the <italic>infinitesimal polygenic model</italic> the conditional sibling liability is normally distributed around the midparent liability distribution with additional variance equal to half the population liability variance.</p>

<sec id="s6">
<title>Case 2) Index trait value known, continuous trait (<italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup> ≠ 1): <italic>P</italic> (<italic>S</italic><sub>2</sub> | <italic>S</italic><sub>1</sub> = <italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub>)</title>
<p>In this case, the primary result considered in this manuscript, a trait z-value, or equivalently, the percentile rank of an index sibling in genome wide association where the rank-based inverse transformation has been applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>) is known. Transformation to a <italic>Z</italic> distribution (<italic>σ</italic><sup>2</sup> = 1) means that for heritability <italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup> the genetic liability and environmental contributions to trait variance are are <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="529159v2_inline11.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="529159v2_inline12.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> ,respectively. Similar to the previous case we begin by calculating the conditional mid-parent liability from Bayes’ theorem:
<disp-formula id="eqn13">
<graphic xlink:href="529159v2_eqn13.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Then, we again use <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn11">Equation 11</xref> to derive the distribution conditional sibling distribution:

<p>The conditional sibling distribution can also be derived using the joint trait distribution for related individuals:
<disp-formula id="ueqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="529159v2_ueqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>

where the covariance <bold>G</bold> is the genetic relationship matrix. Thus for a sibling pair

</p>
<p>As shown by Bernardo and Smith (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>), if <italic>X</italic> is multivariate normal 𝒩(<italic>µ, λ</italic><sup><italic>−</italic>1</sup>), where <italic>λ</italic> = Σ<sup><italic>−</italic>1</sup> is the precision matrix, and <italic>X</italic> is partitioned into <italic>x</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>x</italic><sub>2</sub>, with corresponding partitions of <italic>µ</italic> and <italic>λ</italic> of:
<disp-formula id="ueqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="529159v2_ueqn3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>

</p>
<p>then the conditional distribution of <italic>x</italic><sub>1</sub> given <italic>x</italic><sub>2</sub> is also normal with mean and precision matrix:
<disp-formula id="eqn15">
<graphic xlink:href="529159v2_eqn15.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Thus, given the joint distribution for three siblings:

<title>Case 4) Binary trait: <italic>P</italic> (<italic>S</italic><sub>2</sub>|<italic>S</italic><sub>1</sub> = <italic>Affected</italic>)</title>
<p>Here we again assume an underlying distribution that is <italic>𝒩</italic>(0, 1) and made up of genetic and environmental components. However, we only know the index sibling’s <italic>status</italic>, which, as described under the liability threshold model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>), is equivalent to conditioning on the event where than index sibling’s trait value is above or below a z-value threshold <italic>T</italic> :
<disp-formula id="eqn16">
<graphic xlink:href="529159v2_eqn16.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>T</italic> = Φ<sup>−1</sup>(1−<italic>K</italic>), Φ<sup><italic>−</italic>1</sup> is the inverse normal cumulative distribution function, and <italic>K</italic> is the incidence of the binary trait in the population. Thus, the conditional distribution one sibling given an <italic>Affected</italic> index sibling can be can be calculated integrating over the normal distribution truncated at <italic>T</italic> :
<disp-formula id="eqn17">
<graphic xlink:href="529159v2_eqn17.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>

<p>The first two moments of the this truncated normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>) are:
<disp-formula id="ueqn7">
<graphic xlink:href="529159v2_ueqn7.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Approximating the index sibling distribution using a normal whose moments are taken from this truncated distribution, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn17">Equation 17</xref> becomes:
<disp-formula id="eqn18">
<graphic xlink:href="529159v2_eqn18.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>

which can be solved using the identity given in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn11">Equation 11</xref>:
<disp-formula id="eqn19">
<graphic xlink:href="529159v2_eqn19.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>

</p>
<p>Thus, conditional on an <italic>Affected</italic> sibling, the probability of concordance is:
<disp-formula id="ueqn8">
<graphic xlink:href="529159v2_ueqn8.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
which is equivalent to Reich’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>) correction to Falconer’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>) approximation where the relationship between the relatives is 0.5 for siblings. The probability of discordance given an <italic>Unaffected</italic> sibling can be calculated from Bayes’ Theorem:
<disp-formula id="ueqn9">
<graphic xlink:href="529159v2_ueqn9.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>

which allow the conditional probability of case status to be determined given a index sibling’s status.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p>
<p>The authors present valuable findings on how to determine the genetic architecture of extreme phenotype values by using data on sibling pairs. While the authors' derivations of the method are correct, the scenarios considered are incomplete, making it difficult to have confidence in the interpretation of the results as demonstrating the influence of de-novo or Mendelian (rare, penetrant-variant) architectures. The method nevertheless shows promise and will be of interest to researchers studying complex trait genetics.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A.1: We have now expanded our consideration of the scenarios and we have ensured that we do not over-interpret our results as being due to de novo or Mendelian architectures. Instead, we make clear that our statistical tests are powered to identify these architectures but that there are other potential causes of significant results (e.g. measurement error or uncontrolled environmental factors from heavy-tailed distributions), making follow-up validation studies necessary before underlying architectures can be confirmed. We consider this to be typical of observational research, in which significant results may indicate causal effects unless uncontrolled confounding factors explain the observed associations, requiring experimental/trial follow-up for validation. We believe that our tests are useful for providing initial inference, and that in some settings – e.g. prioritising samples for sequencing to identify rare variants – could be useful as an initial screening step to increase the efficacy of a planned analysis or study.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have now developed “SibArc”, an openly available software tool that takes input sibling trait data and estimates conditional sibling heritability across the trait distribution. Then - based on our theoretical framework developed and described in the paper - for each tail of the trait distribution, estimates effect sizes and generates P-values corresponding to our de novo and Mendelian tests, and performs a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to identify general departures from our null model. Furthermore, SibArc also provides additional functionality for users under preliminary beta form, for example, running an iterative optimisation routine to infer approximate relative degrees of polygenic, de novo, and Mendelian architectures prevailing in each trait tail. We have made this software tool, Quick Start tutorial, and sample data available online at Github and are hosting these on a dedicated website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sibarc.net">www.sibarc.net</ext-link>.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>This is a clever and well-done paper that should be published. The authors sought to craft a method, applicable to biobank-scale data but without necessarily using genotyping or sequencing, to detect the presence of de novo mutations and rare variants that stand out from the polygenic background of a given trait. Their method depends essentially on sibling pairs where one sibling is in an extreme tail of the phenotypic distribution and whether the other sibling's regression to the mean shows a systematic deviation from what is expected under a simple polygenic architecture.</p>
<p>Their method is successful in that it builds on a compelling intuition, rests on a rigorous derivation, and seems to show reasonable statistical power in the UK Biobank. (More biobanks of this size will probably become available in the near future.)  It is somewhat unsuccessful in that rejection of the null hypothesis does not necessarily point to the favored hypothesis of de novo or rare variants. The authors discuss the alternative possibility of rare environmental events of large effect. Maybe attention should be drawn to this in the abstract or the introduction of the paper. Nevertheless, since either of these possibilities is interesting, the method remains valuable.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A.2: We agree with the reviewer that we should have made it clearer that - while our statistical tests are powered to identify de novo and Mendelian architectures – significant findings from our tests could also be explained by rare environmental events of large effect (specifically by uncontrolled environmental factors with heavy-tailed distributions). We have now made this clear throughout the manuscript (see A.1).</p>
<p>Moreover, we agree with the reviewer that whether the cause of deviations from expectations are due to de novo or rare variants, or environmental factors, either possibility is interesting. For example, in either scenario, our results can highlight inaccuracy in PRS prediction of extreme trait values for certain traits, and also provides a relative measure across different traits of large effects impacting on the trait tails, irrespective of whether genetic or environmental. We now place more emphasis on this point throughout the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Souaiaia et al. attempt to use sibling phenotype data to infer aspects of genetic architecture affecting the extremes of the trait distribution. They do this by considering deviations from the expected joint distribution of siblings' phenotypes under the standard additive genetic model, which forms their null model. They ascribe excess similarity compared to the null as due to rare variants shared between siblings (which they term 'Mendelian') and excess dissimilarity as due to de-novo variants. While this is a nice idea, there can be many explanations for rejection of their null model, which clouds interpretation of Souaiaia et al.'s empirical results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A.3: We agree with the reviewer that we should have made clearer that there are other explanations for significant results from our tests and we have now fully addressed this point – (see A.1, A.2, A.4, A.5 for more detail).  In addition, we now elaborate on exactly what our null hypothesis is: which is not only that the expected joint distribution of siblings’ phenotypes is governed by the standard additive genetic model, but that environmental effects are either controlled for or else their combined effect is approximately Gaussian. Furthermore, by selecting only those traits whose raw trait distribution most closely corresponds to a Gaussian distribution from the UK Biobank, we increase the probability that significant results from our tests are due to rare variants (shared or unshared among siblings).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors present their method as detecting aspects of genetic architecture affecting the extremes of the trait distribution. However, I think it would be better to characterize the method as detecting whether siblings are more or less likely to be aggregated in the extremes of the phenotype distribution than would be predicted under a common variant, additive genetic model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A.4: As discussed above we should have stated more clearly that significant results could be due to non-genetic factors, we have now addressed this.</p>
<p>However, we do not think that it would be appropriate to characterise our tests as merely corresponding to over and under aggregation of siblings in the tails. Firstly, environmental factors should be controlled for as part of our testing, increasing the probability that significant results are due to genetic, and not environmental factors. Secondly, tests for identifying broad over and under aggregation of siblings in the tails should be designed differently and, accordingly, the tests that we have developed here would not be optimal to detect over/under aggregation of siblings in trait tails. Our test for inference of de novo variants, for example, exploits the fact that de novo alleles of large effect result in one sibling being extreme and all others being drawn from the background distribution, so that the mean of other siblings is relatively low – not merely that other siblings are less likely to be found in the tail. For more discussion on this issue in relation to one of reviewer 1’s points, see A.9.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Exactly how the rareness and penetrance of a genetic variant influence the conditional sibling phenotype distribution at the extremes is not made clear. The contrast between de-novo and 'Mendelian' architectures is somewhat odd since these are highly related phenomena: a 'Mendelian' architecture could be due to a de-novo variant of the previous generation. The fact that these two phenomena are surmised to give opposing signatures in the authors' statistical tests seems suboptimal to me: would it not be better to specify a parameter that characterizes the degree or sharing between siblings of rare factors of large effect? This could be related to the mixture components in the bimodal distribution displayed in Fig 1. In fact, won't the extremes of all phenotypes be influenced by all three types of variants (common, rare, de-novo) to greater or lesser degree? By framing the problem as a hypothesis testing problem, I think the authors are obscuring the fact that the extremes of real phenotypes likely reflect a mixture of causes: common, de-novo, and rare variants (and shared and non-shared environmental factors).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A.5: We absolutely recognise that there will typically be a complex and continuous mix of genetic architectures underlying complex traits in their tails, dictated by the 2-dimensional relationship between allele frequency and effect size. We did consider developing a fully Bayesian statistical framework to model this, but soon realised that doing this properly would require a substantial amount of model development, accounting for multiple factors in ways that would require a great deal of further investigation; for example, performing a range of complex simulations to investigate the effects of different selective pressures over time, different patterns of assortative mating, and effect size generating distributions. We are in the process of applying for funding for a multi-year project that will perform exactly these investigations as a step towards developing more sophisticated models of inference. In the meantime, we do believe that the simpler hypothesis-testing framework that we have developed here does have important value. Assuming that environmental factors are accounted for, or that any that are not accounted for have combined Gaussian effects, then our tests will indeed infer enrichments of de novo and ‘Mendelian’ rare alleles of large effect in the tails of complex traits. Results from these tests can also be compared within and across traits to compare the relative degree of such enrichments among traits. For some traits we observe significant results from both tests, and for other traits we observe highly significant results from one of our tests but not the other. Thus, while our tests do not provide a complete picture about the genetic architecture in the tails of complex traits, they do offer some intriguing initial insights into tail architecture, important given the enrichment of disease in trait tails.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>To better enable interpretation of the results of this method, a more comprehensive set of simulations is needed. Factors that may influence the conditional distribution of siblings' phenotypes beyond those considered include: non-normal distribution, assortative mating, shared environment, interactions between genetic and shared environmental factors, and genetic interactions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A.6: As described above (see A.5) we do agree that a more comprehensive set of simulations is exactly what is needed to further extend this work. However, we believe that the tests that we have developed so far, which make some simplifying assumptions that we think would often hold in practice, is a useful start to what is an entirely novel approach to inferring genetic architecture from family trait-only (non-genetic) data. Our work could already be useful for method developers who may wish to extend our approach in ways that we may not think of. It could also be useful for applied scientists focusing on specific traits who will be able to gain initial, inference-level, insights by applying our tests to their data, while the results of applying our tests may even guide study design of rare variant mapping studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In summary, I think this is a promising method that is revealing something interesting about extreme values of phenotypes. Determining exactly what is being revealed is going to take a lot more work, however.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A.7: We thank the reviewer for highlighting the promise in our approach and agree that it is revealing something interesting about complex traits. We also agree that it is going to take a lot more work to reveal exactly what that is for different traits, which we plan to work on ourselves and hope that this paper will help other interested scientists to follow-up on and extend as well.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>R.1.1: Why these particular traits (body fat, mean corpuscular haemoglobin, neuroticism, heel bone mineral density, monocyte count, sitting height)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A.8: Traits were initially selected to cover a variety of traits (anthropometric, metabolic, personality..) and to illustrate different examples of tail architecture. However, in response to a point from reviewer 2 (see A.17), we have now overhauled our quality control of traits to ensure that only traits closely matching Gaussian distributions are included. In total, 18 traits were selected, with detailed results presented in Appendix 4 and results corresponding to 6 of the traits presented in the main text (Figure 6) to show examples of different types of tail architecture.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>R.1.2: Why are there separate tests for de novo and Mendelian architectures? It seems that one could use either of the derived tests for both purposes, simply by switching to a two-sided test for each tail. My guess is that the score test of whether alpha is zero would be the more statistically powerful test.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A.9: The score test of whether alpha is zero has limited power to detect Mendelian architectures. This is because under Mendelian effects, half the siblings in a family have trait values reflecting the background distribution, such that the mean of sibling trait values is not so different from the polygenic expectation (i.e. alpha close to 0). The Mendelian score test that we developed is substantially more powerful because it evaluates co-occurrence of siblings in the tails, which is far higher under Mendelian architecture in the tail than compared to polygenic architecture.</p>
<p>However, in order test for general departures from our null model, including those of non-Gaussian environmental factors, we now include results from performing a Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test of difference from the expected distribution, and also provide this test as an option in our ‘SibArc’ software tool.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>R.1.3: This method assumes that assortative mating is absent. I worry that sitting height might not be a good trait to analyze, since there is some assortative mating (~0.3) for height (e.g., Yengo et al., 2018). Perhaps this trait should not be included among those that are analyzed in this paper. Then again, it is possible that there is less assortative mating for sitting height than total height (i.e., leg length) (Jensen &amp; Sinha, 1993).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A.10:  It is true that our method assumes random mating. We note that while  assortative mating increases sibling similarity relative to expectation, if it is stable across the trait distribution it will also bias heritability estimation upward which is likely it’s potential impact in our framework.  However, if assortative mating is more prevalent in the tails of the distribution, it can result in excess kurtosis – an impact that can increase false positive Mendelian tests and false negative de novo tests.  Given that the trait distribution for Sitting Height has only moderate excess Kurtosis (~0.4, see Fig 9, Appendix 4) and we inferred de novo architecture only for this trait, we feel that including it in the paper is appropriate.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>R.1.4: I wonder if it's possible to discuss the impact of non-additive genetic variance on the method. How does this affect the estimation of heritability, which calibrates the expectation for regression to the mean? Can non-additive genetic deviations explain a rejection of the null hypothesis of simple polygenicity?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A.11: Yes, the heritability estimation, which calibrates expectation for regression to the mean, assumes additivity of effects, as do the most popular estimators of heritability from GWAS data in the field: GCTA-GREML, LD Score regression and LDAK. Accordingly, non-additive genetic effects could result in rejection of the null hypothesis. We have highlighted this point in the Discussion. However, we also point out that current evidence suggests that the contribution of non-additive genetic effects to complex trait variation is relatively small (Hivert 2021) and that non-additive genetic effects that have a similar impact across the trait distribution should not be a problem for our approach (only those that have an increasing effect towards the tails would be).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>R.1.5: p.5: Maybe a more realistic way to simulate a genetic architecture is to draw the MAF from the distribution [MAF(1 - MAF)]^{-1} and then an effect of the minor allele from some mound-shaped distribution (e.g., mixture of normals). The absolute or squared effect of the minor allele should increases as the MAF decreases, and there have been some papers trying to estimate this relationship (e.g., Zeng et al., 2021). Maybe make the number of causal SNPs 10,000. I don't rate this as an urgent suggestion because my sense is that the method should be robust, making adequate even a fairly minimal simulation confirming its accuracy.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A.11: In separate work, we have performed a comprehensive simulation study using the forward-in-time population genetic simulator SLIM-3 (Haller and Messer, 2019), which generates genetic effects according to Gaussian and Gamma distributions and models different selective pressures on complex traits. We plan to publish this work shortly and also extend the simulations to family data, from which we will be able to test the performance of our methods here under a range of different scenarios of genetic variation generation, including a variety of relationships between allele frequency and effect sizes. We agree with the reviewer that at this point, however, our minimal simulation should be sufficient to confirm our tests’ general robustness and so we will perform further testing once we have extended our more sophisticated simulation study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>R.1.6: p.6: Step D seems to leave out a normalization of G to have unit variance. Also, the last part should say &quot;the square of the correlation between the genetic liability and the trait is equal to the heritability.&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A.12: Corrected – we thank the reviewer for spotting this.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>R.1.7: Figure 5: The power being adequate if roughly 1 of a 1000 index siblings with an extreme trait value owes their values to de novo mutations makes me think that there should be a discussion of the prior probability. The average person carries about 80 de novo mutations. How many of these are likely to affect, e.g., height? Zeng et al. (2021) gave estimates of mutational targets. Given that a mutation affects height, will its likely effect size be large enough to be detected with the method? Kemper et al. (2012) discussed this point in a perhaps useful way.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A.13: We find the work investigating mutational target sizes and generating effect sizes of different mutations (de novo or rare) to be extremely interesting and critical for understanding the causes of observed genetic variation. However, we think that this work is insufficiently progressed at this point to build on directly here for making more nuanced interpretation of our results. We are, however, exploring the impact of mutational target sizes, effect size distributions and selection effects, on the genetic architecture of complex traits via population genetic simulations (see A.11), and so we hope to be able to provide more in-depth interpretation of our results in the future.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>R.1.8: Figure 6: The number in the tables for Mendelian architecture are presumably observed and expected counts. But what about the numbers for de novo architecture? Those don't look like counts. Maybe they are conditional expectations of standardized trait values. Whatever the case may be, the caption should provide an explanation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A.14: The observed and expected values for the de novo statistical test represent the expected and observed mean standardized trait values for siblings of individuals in the bottom and top 1% of the distribution. We have now made this clear in our updated figure.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>R.2.1: The first concern that I have is that their statistical tests rely heavily on an assumption of bivariate normal distribution for sibling pair's phenotypes. Real phenotypes do not have such a distribution in general. The authors rely upon an inverse-normal transform when applying their method to real data. While the inverse-normal transform will ensure that the siblings' phenotypes have a marginal normal distribution, such a transform does not ensure that the joint distribution is bivariate normal. The authors should examine their procedure for simulated phenotypes with a non-normal distribution to see if their statistical tests remain properly calibrated. Related to this, I am concerned about applying an inverse normal transform to the neuroticism phenotype that contains only 13 unique values in UKB. How does the transform deal with tied values? Can we sensibly talk about extreme trait values for such a set of observations?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A.17: The reviewer is correct that a bivariate normal distribution for sibling pairs’ trait values does not necessarily hold, and only does so if the assumptions of our null model are met (polygenic effects, Gaussian environmental effects, random mating..). We have now more clearly described the assumptions of our null model, and to increase the matching of our selected traits to those assumptions we have expanded our analyses and now present results on traits that are close to Gaussian. As part of this more strict quality control, only traits with more than 50 unique values are included, meaning that neuroticism is excluded in our final analysis. We also now note that performing an inverse normal transformation on the traits only increases the robustness of the tests to some of our modelling assumptions. In future work we plan to investigate how best to model the conditional sibling distribution under a variety of non-Gaussian environmental effects and different non-random patterns of mating.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>R.2.2: The joint sibling phenotype distribution (Equation 4) can be derived by applying the formula for the conditional distribution of a multivariate Gaussian to the standard additive genetic model. The authors' derivation is unnecessarily complex. Furthermore, many of the formulae have been used in Shai Carmi's work on embryo screening, but this work is not cited.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A.18: We now state in the text that the conditional sibling distribution can also be derived from the joint trait distribution of related individuals, which we use in our extension to the 3-sibling scenario, and cite Shai Carmi’s work where this is used. The joint distribution is a more straightforward way to derive the conditional sibling distribution, but our derivation based on considering mid-parents is generalisable to cases where assumptions of random mating, Gaussian population trait distribution and no selection do not hold. We also think that our mid-parent based derivation will be more intuitive to many readers, leading to greater understanding and potential for extension. Therefore, overall we believe that its presentation is worthwhile and we have now elaborated on this in the Methods.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>R.2.3: Equation 8: this probability should be conditional on s1</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A.19: Corrected – we thank the reviewer for spotting this.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>R.2.4: The empirical application to UKB data is lacking methodological details. Also, the number of siblings used is low compared to the number of available sibling pairs. Around 19k sibling pairs are available in the UKB white British subsample, but only 10k were used for height. Why? Also, why are extreme values excluded? Isn't this removing the signal the authors are looking to explain?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A.20: We have now provided more methodological details throughout the Methods section, in particular in relation to the samples used and quality control performed. The removal of individuals with extreme values, in particular, is because unusually low/high trait values are more likely to be due to measurement error (e.g. due to imperfect measuring device, or storage/assaying) than for typical values, and so while this may also result in some loss in power (albeit small due to few individuals having values +/- 8 s.d. trait means) we consider it worth it for the potential reduction in type I error. In performing our newly expanded analysis (described above), and accounting for the reviewer’s point here about sample size, we did find a bug in our pipeline that meant that we did not include as many sibling pairs as available. We thank the reviewer for spotting this, since this contributed to our new analysis being substantially more powerful than the original (including up to ~17k sibling pairs depending on completeness of trait data).</p>
