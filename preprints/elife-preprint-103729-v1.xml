<title>Abstract</title><p>A conserved <italic>N</italic>-glycan-dependent endoplasmic reticulum protein quality control (ERQC) system has evolved in eukaryotes to ensure accuracy during glycoprotein folding. The human pathogen <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> possesses a unique <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation pathway that lacks the glucose addition step to the core <italic>N</italic>-glycan precursors in the ER but includes additional basidiomycetes-specific mannosidases. To investigate the molecular features and functions of the ERQC system in <italic>C. neoformans,</italic> we characterized a set of mutants with deletion of genes coding for the ERQC sensor UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (<italic>UGG1</italic>) and putative α1,2-mannose trimming enzymes (<italic>MNS1</italic>, <italic>MNS101</italic>, <italic>MNL1</italic>, and <italic>MNL2</italic>). The <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ, <italic>mns1</italic>Δ, <italic>mns101</italic>Δ, and <italic>mns1</italic>Δ<italic>101</italic>Δ mutants showed alterations in <italic>N</italic>-glycan profiles, defective cell surface organization, decreased survival in host cells, and varying degrees of reduced <italic>in vivo</italic> virulence. The <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ strain exhibited severely impaired extracellular secretion of capsular polysaccharides and virulence-related enzymes. Comparative transcriptome analysis showed the upregulation of protein folding, proteolysis, and cell wall remodeling genes, which is indicative of induced ER stress in <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ. However, no apparent changes were observed in the expression of genes involved in protein secretion or capsule biosynthesis. Additionally, extracellular vesicle (EV) analysis combined with proteomic analysis showed significant alterations in the number, size distribution, and cargo composition of EVs in <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ. These findings highlight the essential role of the functional ERQC system for cellular fitness under adverse conditions and proper EV-mediated transport of virulence bags, which are crucial for the full fungal pathogenicity of <italic>C. neoformans</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Glycoproteins, destined for the secretory pathway, are synthesized on ribosomes attached to the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). They then enter the ER lumen where protein folding occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Rapoport, 2007</xref>). However, the accumulation of misfolded proteins affects cell viability and homeostasis; therefore, eukaryotes have evolved a conserved ER quality control (ERQC) system that recognizes folding defects, repairs them, and ensures the translocation of irreparable misfolded proteins into the cytosol for proteasome-mediated degradation via the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Thibault and Ng, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Xu and Ng, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Balchin et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>N</italic>-glycosylation is the most common post-translation modification, and the ERQC system relies on it to determine protein folding conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aebi, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Varki, 2017</xref>). Most eukaryotes synthesize a Dol-PP-linked Glc<sub>3</sub>Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> oligosaccharide as a common core <italic>N</italic>-glycan, which attaches to nascent polypeptides in the ER via an asparagine residue. Then, glucosidases I and II (Gls1 and Gls2) remove two glucose residues from the core oligosaccharide, after which, the glycoproteins are transported from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. Proteins containing the core monoglucosylated <italic>N</italic>-glycans (Glc<sub>1</sub>Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>) enter a calnexin and/or calreticulin (CNX/CRT in mammals; CNE in yeast) chaperone-mediated folding cycle. Finally, Gls2 cleaves the remaining glucose residue. If the proteins are misfolded, they are recognized by the ERQC checkpoint enzyme, UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT), which reglucosylates them for re-entry into the folding cycle (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Then, the <italic>N</italic>-glycans of the accurately folded proteins are further processed by Gls2 and α1,2-mannosidase I (Mns1) and moved to the Golgi apparatus. However, irreparably misfolded glycoproteins are targeted for ERAD. They undergo demannosylation and retro-translocation for proteasomal degradation in the cytosol. Recently, <italic>N</italic>-glycan precursors in the ER of some protists and fungi were found to be shorter than the typical 14-sugar <italic>N</italic>-glycan precursors in most eukaryote organisms. The length of these <italic>N</italic>-glycan precursors significantly impacts <italic>N</italic>-glycan-dependent QC of glycoprotein folding and ERAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Banerjee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Samuelson et al., 2015</xref>).</p>

<p>The basidiomycetous fungus <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> is an opportunistic, encapsulated human pathogen that primarily affects immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS, causing fatal meningoencephalitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gottfredsson and Perfect, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kwon-Chung et al., 2000</xref>). The <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation pathway of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> is evolutionarily conserved; nevertheless, the structure and biosynthesis of its <italic>N</italic>-glycans shows several unique features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Park et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>C. neoformans</italic> contains serotype-specific high-mannose-type <italic>N</italic>-glycans with or without a β-1,2-xylose residue attached to the trimannosyl core. Additionally, the acidic <italic>N</italic>-glycans of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> contain xylose phosphates attached to the mannose residues both within the <italic>N</italic>-glycan core and outer mannose chains. The intact core <italic>N</italic>-glycan structure is crucial for <italic>C. neoformans</italic> pathogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Thak et al., 2020</xref>); hence, alterations in the <italic>N</italic>-glycan structure modulates the interaction between the cell surface mannoproteins of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> and host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lee et al., 2023</xref>). Unlike that observed in most eukaryotes, the <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation pathway in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> lacks homologous genes to <italic>ALG6</italic>, <italic>ALG8</italic>, and <italic>ALG10</italic>, which encode the glucosyltransferases that add three glucose residues to the core <italic>N</italic>-glycan before its attachment to proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Park et al., 2012</xref>). Man<sub>7</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> and Man<sub>8</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> without glucose residues are primarily detected in Dol-PP-linked glycans of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Samuelson et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, the mature core <italic>N</italic>-glycan structures assembled on the cell surface mannoproteins of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> are primarily Man<sub>6–7</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>, which are shorter than the expected Man<sub>8</sub>GlcNac<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Park et al., 2012</xref>). This observation led to the speculation that the terminal α-1,2-mannose residues of <italic>C. neoformans N</italic>-linked glycans may be more susceptible to trimming by ER-1,2 mannosidases due to the lack of glucose residues compared to those of most eukaryotes. Alternatively, the presence of multiple 1,2 mannosidases may generate more extensively trimmed core <italic>N</italic>-glycans in <italic>C. neoformans</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> uses several virulence factors to evade the host immune system and enhance its pathogenicity. These include an extensive polysaccharide capsule composed of glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) and galactoxylomannan (GXMGal) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Doering et al., 2009</xref>; Zaragozza et al., 2009), melanin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Qiu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zhu and Williamson, 2004</xref>), and various extracellular enzymes such as phosphatase and urease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Singh et al., 2013</xref>). These essential virulence factors are primarily transported within the EVs in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Casadevall et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rizzo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rodrigues et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, <italic>C. neoformans</italic> EVs represent a heterogeneous population of “virulence bags” containing numerous fungal survival and pathogenicity-associated molecules. Additionally, recent proteomics analysis of EV cargos has identified several cell surface glycoproteins including members of the CDA family, which are well-known immunomodulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rizzo et al., 2021</xref>; Spetch et al., 2017).</p>
<p>In this study, we report for the first time the molecular features and function of <italic>N</italic>-glycan-dependent ERQC in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> through a systematic analysis of mutant strains lacking a set of ERQC gene homologs. Notably, our results revealed the pivotal roles of the ERQC system not only in maintaining cellular fitness but also in the EV-mediated transport of virulence factors in <italic>C. neoformans</italic>.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Evolutionary unique features of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> ERQC components</title>
<p>We performed BLAST analysis of the <italic>C. neoformans</italic> H99 genome to identify the ERQC pathway-associated homologous genes of <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, followed by comparison with the ERQC components in other eukaryotic organisms (Supplementary Fig. S1, A). Unlike most eukaryotes, several yeast species within the Ascomycota phylum, such as <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Candida albicans,</italic> do not possess a functional UGGT. In contrast, the UGGT homologs were identified in most fungal species belonging to Basidiomycota, including <italic>C. neoformans</italic> (Supplementary Fig. S1, A and B). The <italic>C. neoformans</italic> UGGT (CNAG_03648), which has been named as Ugg1, consists of 1,582 amino acids (aa) and features a signal peptide (1–20 aa) along with four tandem-like thioredoxin-like (TRXL) domains: TRXL12 (33–320 aa), TRXL13 (28–416 aa), TRXL14 (432–618 aa), and TRXL15 (712–950 aa). All these domains show a highly conserved structural organization. Ugg1 also contains a glucosyltransferase (GT) 24 domain with a DXD motif (1,369–1,371 aa) and a KDEL-like ER retention signal (1579–1582 aa), which facilitates its retrieval from the Golgi apparatus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, Supplementary Fig. S2, A).</p>
<p>Additionally, we identified two <italic>C. neoformans</italic> ORFs, Mns1 (CNAG_02081) and Mns101 (CNAG_03240), as homologs of the eukaryote α1,2-mannosidase I, which processes <italic>N</italic>-glycans before exporting them to the Golgi. The <italic>C. neoformans</italic> Mns1 and Mns101 show 42.4% and 28.8% amino acid identities to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> ER-α1,2-mannosidase I, respectively, and share 30.9% identity between them. Furthermore, <italic>C. neoformans</italic> Mnl1 (CNAG_01987) and <italic>C. neoformans</italic> Mnl2 (CNAG_04498) were identified as putative components of ERQC in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> (Supplementary Fig. S1, A and C). Whereas <italic>C. neoformans</italic> Mnl1 is a homolog of the yeast α1,2-mannosidase-like protein (Htm1), which processes <italic>N</italic>-glycans that are re-directed towards ERAD, <italic>C. neoformans</italic> Mnl2 encodes a mannosidase that does not show similarity to other eukaryotes mannosidases. Mns1, Mns101, and Mnl1 possess glucosyl hydrolase (GH) 47 domains, which are essential for mannosidase activity, whereas Mnl2 contains a GH92 domain, also known for its mannosidase activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). The Mns1 and Mnl1 protein families are characterized by the presence of a conserved cysteine (Cys) and alanine (Ala) residue (Jakob et al., 2001). These residues are located within the activity domain of cryptococcal Mns1, Mns101 and Mnl1, but not of Mnl2 (Supplementary Fig. S2, B). Notably, Mns101 and Mnl2 have been identified only in Basidiomycota yeasts (Supplementary Fig. S1, A) and seem to have diverged early from other mannosidase clades in the phylogenetic tree of fungal mannosidases (Supplementary Fig. S1, C). This indicates that Mns101 and Mnl2 are basidiomycete-specific proteins.</p>
<p>To examine the changes in ERQC-related gene expression under stress conditions, <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, which was cultivated in the presence of tunicamycin (TM, 5 µg/ml) or dithiothreitol (DTT, 20 mM) at 37 °C for 1 h, was subjected to quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). The analysis showed that <italic>KAR2</italic>, which encodes for a molecular chaperone associated with the unfolded protein response (UPR) system, was upregulated in response to inhibition of <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation by TM treatment, blockage of disulfide bond formation by DTT treatment, and heat stress at 37 °C. The ERQC components <italic>UGG1</italic>, <italic>MNS1</italic>, <italic>MNS101</italic>, <italic>MNL1</italic>, and <italic>MNL2</italic> were upregulated by DTT treatment; however, they were not significantly induced after 1 h of TM treatment. Under high-temperature conditions, only <italic>UGG1</italic> and <italic>MNL2</italic> exhibited an induced expression pattern. Notably, DTT treatment, which results in rapid accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER, induced a 10-fold higher expression of <italic>MNS1</italic> and <italic>MNL1</italic>. These results strongly suggest that the <italic>C. neoformans</italic> genes <italic>UGG1</italic>, <italic>MNS1</italic>, <italic>MNS101</italic>, <italic>MNL1</italic>, and <italic>MNL2</italic> are crucial components of the ERQC and ERAD systems.</p>

<title>Loss of <italic>UGG1, MNS1</italic>, and <italic>MNS101</italic> causes alteration of <italic>N</italic>-glycan profiles in <italic>C. neoformans</italic></title>
<p>We performed high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of the cell wall mannoproteins (cwMPs) from both the wild-type (WT) and ERQC mutant strains to investigate the ERQC malfunction-induced structural differences in <italic>N</italic>-glycans (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The HPLC profiles of cwMPs from the WT strain showed an M8 peak as the major species. This peak corresponded to <italic>N</italic>-glycans with 8 mannose residues (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, top). The glycan structure at the M8 peak (Man<sub>8</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>) in the WT primarily corresponded to the Man<sub>7</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> core <italic>N</italic>-glycan with an additional mannose residue that is linked via an α1,6-linkage and added in the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Park et al., 2012</xref>). In the <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ mutant, M8 was also the main <italic>N</italic>-glycan species, but the pools of hypermannosylated <italic>N</italic>-glycans (larger than the M11 peak) were markedly reduced (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, middle). The altered <italic>N</italic>-glycan profile of the <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ mutant was restored to that of the WT after complementation with the WT <italic>UGG1</italic> gene (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, bottom). Additionally, lectin blotting of the extracellularly secreted proteins from WT and <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ strains showed a distinct increase in the quantity of lower molecular weight secretory glycoproteins in the <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ strain compared with that of the WT (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). These results suggest that Ugg1 function is essential for the hypermannosylation of <italic>N</italic>-glycans that occurs in the Golgi apparatus.</p>

<p>The <italic>mns1</italic>Δ mutant <italic>N</italic>-glycan profile showed a peak shift from an M8 to an M9 form, which strongly indicates that <italic>C. neoformans</italic> Mns1 could be the well-known ER α1,2-mannosidase I (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, <italic>mns1</italic>Δ). Notably, the loss of Mns101, which is present only in Basidiomycota, increased the fractions containing hypermannosylated glycans (&gt; M10) while maintaining M8 as a primary core <italic>N</italic>-glycan form. This suggests that the basidiomycete-specific Mns101 may potentially be a novel α1,2-mannosidase that functions to remove mannose residues from hypermannosylated <italic>N</italic>-glycans in the Golgi apparatus or further trims the M8 glycan in the ER before the glycoproteins are transported to the Golgi (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, <italic>mns101</italic>Δ). The matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer analysis of neutral <italic>N</italic>-glycans, collected from HPLC fractionation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), further confirmed the shift of the major M8 peak in the WT strain to M9 in the <italic>mns1</italic>Δ mutant and the increase in the hypermannosylation profile in the <italic>mns101</italic>Δ mutant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). The <italic>N</italic>-glycan profiles of the <italic>mns1</italic>Δ<italic>101</italic>Δ double mutant showed the combined effect of each null mutation, and it showed both increased hypermannosylated glycans and a shift from the M8 to the M9 peak in both the HPLC (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, <italic>mns1</italic>Δ<italic>101</italic>Δ) and MALDI-TOF analyses. This indicates that Mns1 and Mns101 serve as mannosidases and play independent roles at different stages of <italic>N</italic>-glycan processing in <italic>C. neoformans</italic>.</p>
<p>In contrast, the loss of both <italic>MNL1</italic> and <italic>MNL2</italic> did not show notable differences in the HPLC profile of <italic>N</italic>-glycans from cell surface mannoproteins (Supplementary Fig. S3, A). Considering the expected function of Mnl1 and Mnl2 in ERAD, their substrates are mostly misfolded proteins that have not been transported to the Golgi apparatus. Thus, we speculate that only the normally processed <italic>N</italic>-glycan profiles of cell surface mannoproteins in the <italic>mnl1</italic>Δ <italic>mnl2</italic>Δ mutant strain were observed.</p>

<title>Loss of ERQC components results in defective growth fitness and increased stress sensitivity</title>
<p>We investigated the growth of the <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ mutant under various stress-inducing conditions to elucidate the roles of the ERQC components in ER stress response and adaptation, which are closely associated with <italic>C. neoformans</italic> virulence. The <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ mutant showed impaired growth even under normal growth conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>) and increased sensitivity to ER stress-inducing agents such as DTT, TM and cell wall stressors such as calcofluor white (CFW), Congo red (CR), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and caffeine. Additionally, <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ showed hindered growth in the presence of antifungal drugs such as azole agents (fluconazole and ketoconazole) and the glucose transport inhibitor fludioxonil.

<p>To determine whether the defective <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ phenotypes were induced partially by ER stress caused by the accumulation of misfolded proteins, we performed a growth analysis in the presence of 5’,5’,5’-trifluoroleucine (TFL), which is a leucine analog (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). We hypothesized that TFL incorporation into proteins could cause improper folding, which would ultimately negatively impact cell growth. <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ showed noticeably inhibited growth in the presence of TFL, whereas the WT strain showed no growth inhibition. The <italic>mns1</italic>Δ<italic>101</italic>Δ strain also exhibited slightly increased sensitivity to TFL compared with that of the WT strain. As a defense mechanism against misfolded protein accumulation-mediated ER stress, UPR is induced by the unconventional splicing of the <italic>HXL1</italic> transcription factor in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cheon et al., 2011</xref>).

Moreover, enhanced <italic>HXL1</italic> splicing in <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ strongly suggests that <italic>UGG1</italic> loss results in misfolded protein accumulation, which causes ER stress even under normal growth conditions. Furthermore, green fluorescence protein (GFP)-tagged Ugg1, Mns1, and Mns101 proteins colocalized with the ER marker, confirming them to be functional ERQC components based on their subcellular localization in the ER (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>).</p>

<p>Defects in the ERQC system led to a more apparent decrease in pathogenicity in a murine model of systemic cryptococcosis.

Furthermore, <italic>MNS1</italic> and <italic>MNS101</italic> single disruptions did not cause a detectable decrease in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> pathogenicity; however, their double disruption resulted in decreased virulence. Histopathological analysis of infected mice lungs showed significantly reduced lung colonization by both <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ and <italic>mns1</italic>Δ<italic>101</italic>Δ cells (Supplementary Fig. S4, A). Additionally, the fungal burden of <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ-infected animals showed a notable decrease in organ colonization at 60 days post-infection (dpi) (Supplementary Fig. S4, B). Analysis of the fungal burden at 7 dpi showed significantly reduced organ colonization of the <italic>mns1</italic>Δ<italic>101</italic>Δ mutant compared with that of the WT (Supplementary Figure S4, C). Next, we co-cultured the mutant strains with the macrophage-like cell line J447A.1 to investigate the effects of ERQC defects on cryptococcal survival within macrophages (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>).

<title>Loss of Ugg1 function manifests defects in extracellular transport of GXM</title>
<p>Cryptococcal capsule materials are synthesized intracellularly and secreted to the cell surface. Subsequently, they are assembled and bound to the cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Yoneda and Doering, 2006</xref>). The observed capsule defects in the <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ and <italic>mns1</italic>Δ<italic>101</italic>Δ mutant strains may be attributed to issues in the capsule polysaccharide synthesis or transport steps. Alternatively, defective capsule formation may result from increased shedding of capsule polymers without proper attachment to the cell surface. To determine the cause of the capsule defects, we examined the amounts of capsular polysaccharides synthesized intracellularly and those shed into the culture supernatant by a capsule blotting assay. We used the GXM-specific antibody 18B7 to analyze the WT and ERQC mutant strains, together with the <italic>cap59</italic>Δ and <italic>rim101</italic>Δ strains, which exhibit capsule formation defects. GXM is a major capsule component comprising α1,3-linked mannose residues with xylosyl and glucuronyl side groups. The <italic>cap59</italic>Δ strain lacks a visible capsule because of a defect in GXM synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Grijpstra et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>C. neoformans rim101</italic>Δ exhibits a hypocapsular phenotype because of defective capsule attachment, despite normal polysaccharide synthesis and secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">O’Meara et al., 2010</xref>). Intracellular GXM quantities did not notably differ between the WT, <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ, <italic>mns1</italic>Δ<italic>101</italic>Δ, and <italic>rim101</italic>Δ strains, although <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ showed slightly reduced GXM level (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, left). In contrast, no intracellular GXM was detected in <italic>cap59</italic>Δ, which was consistent with its defect in GXM synthesis. Moreover, the <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ strain did not show shedding of capsule polymers, whereas the <italic>mns1</italic>Δ<italic>101</italic>Δ strain showed shedding of GXM-containing polymers that were shorter in length than the WT-type polymers. This indicates poor polysaccharide polymerization (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, right). Reduced capsule thickness in <italic>mns1</italic>Δ<italic>101</italic>Δ is consistent with previous reports that capsule size is mediated at the polymer level (Yoneda et al., 2008). Therefore, these results suggest that <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ contains a defect in polysaccharide trafficking to the extracellular space, whereas <italic>mns1</italic>Δ<italic>101</italic>Δ contains a defect in polysaccharide polymerization, which results in defective capsule elaboration, albeit with differential degrees of severity in both ERQC mutants.</p>

<p>Furthermore, to determine whether the ERQC mutants are also impaired in capsule attachment, we performed a capsule transfer assay, which is a technique that assesses whether exogenously shed capsule polysaccharides bind to acapsular mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Reese and Doering, 2003</xref>). The hypocapsular <italic>rim101</italic>Δ mutant did not show reassociation of capsular polysaccharides; however, the acapsular <italic>cap59</italic>Δ mutant showed recovery of capsule formation when co-incubated with exogenous GXM (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Similarly, <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ reverted its acapsular phenotype on incubation with the WT-shed polysaccharides, which strongly suggests that the defective capsule phenotype of <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ is primarily due to defective GXM synthesis or secretion rather than impaired attachment of capsule polymers. We further conducted a capsule transfer assay using capsular polysaccharides shed from <italic>mns1</italic>Δ<italic>101</italic>Δ. The <italic>cap59</italic>Δ mutant reverted to the capsular phenotype by attaching to the <italic>mns1</italic>Δ<italic>101</italic>Δ-shed polymers. However, the fluorescence intensity of the capsule generated by the <italic>mns1</italic>Δ<italic>101</italic>Δ-shed polymers was significantly lower than that of the cells attached with polysaccharides obtained from the WT. This result suggests that the <italic>mns1</italic>Δ<italic>101</italic>Δ double mutant secretes incomplete capsule polysaccharides (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>), which leads to a hypocapsular phenotype. These results collectively indicate that the defective GXM trafficking to the extracellular space is caused by disruptive ERQC, impairing capsule formation.</p>
<p>Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging of the WT and mutant cells distinctly showed a diminished capsule structure and loss of capsule shedding in the <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ strain compared with that of the WT strain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). Additionally, we observed considerable thinning of the cell walls in both ERQC mutant cells. Notable changes in intracellular structures along with an increase in the number of pigmented vesicles were observed in the mutant cells even under YPD culture conditions. Under capsule-inducing conditions, a significant accumulation of vesicular structures (electron-lucent structures) was observed inside the cells, particularly in <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ. We performed LD staining to determine whether these vesicular structures might be lipid droplets (LDs). We observed a notable increase in LDs in <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ under capsule-inducing culture conditions (Supplementary Fig. S5, A). LDs impact proteostasis by sequestering misfolded proteins intended for degradation and providing an “escape hatch” when the ERQC is overloaded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Ploegh, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Vevea et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, FM4-64 dye staining showed increased number of vacuoles in the <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ cells compared with that in the WT (Supplementary Fig. S5, B). Moreover, all the observed abnormal phenotypes were less pronounced in the <italic>mns1</italic>Δ<italic>101</italic>Δ mutant than in the <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ strain. Taken together, the altered vesicular structures observed in the <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ and <italic>mns1</italic>Δ<italic>101</italic>Δ strains indicate that the ERQC function is crucial for maintaining proper vesicular structure and cell surface organization as both these functions are closely associated with the extracellular trafficking of virulence factors and cell wall remodeling.</p>

<p>Notably, the <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ mutant showed upregulation of genes such as <italic>SKN1</italic> and <italic>KRE6</italic> (transmembrane glucosidases involved in the sphingolipid biosynthesis and β-glucan biosynthesis), <italic>CAT2</italic> (a putative peroxisomal catalase), <italic>CHS7</italic> (chitin synthase export chaperone), and CNAG_05458 (a putative endo-1,3(4)-β-glucanase). In contrast, genes encoding <italic>ERG3</italic> and <italic>ERG25</italic> (associated with the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway) and <italic>FHB1</italic> (flavohemoglobin denitrosylase associated with counteracting nitric oxide stress) were significantly downregulated. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis in <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ showered pronounced induction of genes implicated in various cellular processes, including the hydrolysis of <italic>O</italic>-glycosyl compounds for cell wall remodeling, DNA replication, proteolysis, ribosome biogenesis, protein folding, and serine/threonine kinase activity. In contrast, the genes associated with carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, chaperone binding, iron homeostasis, and mitochondrial intermembrane space were considerably downregulated (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). The transcriptome profile strongly suggests that loss of Ugg1 function induces the expression of several genes involved in maintaining cell wall integrity to compensate for cell wall defects, particularly those associated with chitin (<italic>CDA2</italic>, <italic>CHS7</italic>, <italic>QRI1</italic>, and CNAG_06898) and glucan biosynthesis (<italic>SKN1</italic>, <italic>KRE6</italic>, <italic>EBG1</italic>, <italic>LPI9</italic>, CNAG_05458, and <italic>BLG2</italic>). Furthermore, genes coding for ER chaperones that aid in protein folding (<italic>ERO1</italic>, <italic>KAR2</italic>, <italic>LHS1</italic>, and <italic>PDI1</italic>) and chaperone regulator (<italic>SCJ1</italic>), and genes involved in proteolysis in the ER (CNAG_04635, CNAG_06658) were induced, likely as part of the ER stress response induced by the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the presence of a defective ERQC.</p>
<p>Further investigation of the effects of <italic>UGG1</italic> disruption in the expression of genes involved in capsule biosynthesis, cell wall remodeling, and the secretion pathways of protein virulence factors using qRT-PCR analysis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>) showed no noticeable repression of the expression of genes related to capsule biosynthesis and conventional or unconventional secretion pathways at the mRNA level, despite the aberrantly displayed defective phenotypes. Notably, <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ mutant showed notable upregulation of the genes involved in cell wall remodeling, as indicated by the GO analysis of transcriptome data. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that ERQC system malfunction caused by <italic>UGG1</italic> disruption may exert negative effects on the production of virulence factors at post-transcriptional levels, most likely during the extracellular transport process.</p>

<title>EV-mediated protein trafficking and non-conventional secretion is impaired in the <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ mutant strain</title>
<p>Many enzymes contribute to the composite cryptococcal virulence phenotype. Some of these virulence-associated enzymes are secreted through traditional secretion pathways, whereas others are packaged into EVs and released into the extracellular milieu via non-conventional secretion mechanisms (Amelida et al., 2015). The defects observed in the ERQC mutant strains, particularly in the production of melanin and polysaccharide capsules, both of which are primarily transported by EVs, suggest a possible impairment in the EV-mediated extracellular transport of virulence-associated enzymes such as acid phosphatase, urease, and laccase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Rodrigues et al., 2008</xref>) in these mutants. Laccase enables melanin synthesis (Salas et al., 1996), urease hydrolyzes urea into ammonia, which facilitates <italic>C. neoformans</italic> invasion into the CNS (Olszewski et al., 2014), and acid phosphatase serves as an adhesion-related enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Collopy-Junior et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, we examined the <italic>in vitro</italic> activity of these virulence-related enzymes in both intracellular and extracellular secreted fractions.</p>
<p>Comparative analysis showed that whereas the changes in the intracellular activities of acid phosphatase, urease, and laccase were negligible, their activities were significantly low in the extracellular fractions of the <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7C</xref>, and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7D</xref>). Urease analysis was performed in both solid and liquid media, and it showed a notable loss of secreted urease activity in <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ cells with a slight decrease in the <italic>mns1</italic>Δ<italic>101</italic>Δ double mutant cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>). As urease lacks a signal peptide required for conventional protein secretion, low urease secretion strongly indicates a compromised EV-mediated non-conventional secretory pathway in the <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ mutant strain.</p>

<p>Next, we tested cellulase and α-amylase activities to assess the impact of disrupted ERQC system on the conventional secretion pathway of non-virulence-related enzymes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7F</xref>). The activities of these carbohydrate polymer-degrading enzymes in the extracellular fraction of <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ were slightly lower than those of the WT; this likely indicates decreased intracellular production rather than significantly compromised secretion efficiency. Furthermore, we investigated the localization of chitin deacetylase I (Cda1), which is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein that is involved in the conversion of chitin to chitosan for proper maintenance of cell wall integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Baker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Upadhya et al., 2021</xref>). Cda1 was predominantly detected in the insoluble cellular protein fraction, which includes the cell wall and membranes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G</xref>, left). This result is consistent with the localization of Cda1 on the cell surface via a GPI anchor. Cda1 is secreted extracellularly on cleavage of the GPI anchor. Notably, the <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ mutant strain shows much higher intracellular and extracellular Cda1 levels compared with that of the WT and <italic>mns1</italic>Δ<italic>101</italic>Δ strains (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G</xref>, right). This concurs with the approximate 1.87-fold increase in <italic>CDA1</italic> mRNA levels observed in the RNAseq data. Thus, the efficient surface localization and secretion of Cda1 strongly support the conclusion that the conventional secretion pathway remains functional without significant compromise in <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ.</p>
<p>The acapsular mutant <italic>cap59</italic>Δ strain was previously reported to have secretion defects, based on observations that the <italic>cap59</italic>Δ strain generated in the serotype D background (<italic>C. deneoformans</italic>) displayed defective secretion of enzymes involved in the hydrolysis of raffinose or urease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Garcia-Rivera et al., 2004</xref>). However, the <italic>cap59</italic>Δ strain used in this study, which was constructed from the serotype A strain H99 background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Thak et al., 2020</xref>), showed defective alkaline phosphatase secretion but only marginally defective urease secretion. The <italic>cap59</italic>Δ acapsular mutant constructed from the <italic>C. deneoformans</italic> background does not use raffinose as a carbon source because of poor protein secretion of raffinose hydrolyzing enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Garcia-Rivera et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, to test whether the ERQC-related mutant strains utilize raffinose as a carbon source, we performed a growth test using SC media containing raffinose as the sole carbon source. Notably, <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ and <italic>cap59</italic>Δ strains showed no evident defects in raffinose utilization compared with that of the WT (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7H</xref>). This suggests that the conventional secretion pathway is functional in both mutant strains. Overall, the results suggest that the UGGT-mediated ERQC defect exerts a more pronounced negative impact on EV-mediated protein transport and only a marginal effect on the conventional secretion pathway.</p>

<p>We analyzed the number and size distribution of EVs to determine if defects in the assembly and transport of EVs in the <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ mutant might cause abnormal EV-mediated trafficking of virulence factors. Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) showed a major peak in size distribution at approximately 150 (134±28) nm in the WT strain, which was similar in size to mammalian exosomes and typical microbial EVs. Additionally, a minor peak ranging from 300–500 nm was observed and corresponded to the microvesicles (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>).

<p>We observed a significant reduction in the total number of secreted EVs in the <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ mutant (approximately 40%), which suggests defective EV biogenesis or stability in the absence of functional Ugg1 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>). Cryo-TEM analysis of EV morphology confirmed that the sizes of EVs released by <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ were significantly smaller and more diverse than those of the WT or the acapsular mutant (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>); this further supports the NTA results. Examining EV size distribution by measuring their diameter (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>) further confirmed that although the EVs in the WT strain ranged from approximately 50–550 nm in size with distribution primarily concentrated at approximately 150 nm, the EVs in the <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ mutant were smaller (&lt; 100 nm) with heterogeneous sizes. Notably, <italic>cap59</italic>Δ EVs were uniformly distributed at approximately 150 nm and were present at a higher concentration than those of EVs from the WT. An increase in EV release and virulence factors has been also observed in acapsular mutant strains of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> and <italic>C. gattii</italic> (Rodrigues et al., 20007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Reis et al., 2019</xref>), which supports the notion that the capsule serves as a barrier in EV release in capsule forming species.</p>
<p>To examine the protein content in EVs from WT and <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ, EV-associated proteins were extracted in triplicate using 8 M urea from purified EVs, and the equivalent concentration of EV proteins were subjected to proteomics analysis (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S6, A). We identified 1,688 proteins and quantified 1,625 proteins (Supplementary Table S3). Among them, 1,008 proteins showed differences between WT and <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ (Supplementary Fig. S6, B). Compared with that of the WT EVs, the <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ EVs exhibited altered protein abundance with only 64 proteins showing upregulation and 777 proteins showing &gt; 2-fold downregulation (Supplementary Fig. S6, C, D). Three proteomic analyses of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> EVs have been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Rodrigues et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wolf et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rizzo et al., 2021</xref>), identifying 76, 202, and 1,847 proteins associated with EVs in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic>, respectively. Using the same culture medium and EV preparation method, the number and content of identified EV-associated proteins in our study was mostly similar to that reported by Rizzo et al., who further defined 71 non-ribosomal proteins as EV-enriched proteins after proteomic data enrichment analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rizzo et al., 2021</xref>). We compared the protein content between WT and <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ among the EV proteins identified in our study with focus on the proteins commonly detected among either the 71 non-ribosomal EV-enriched proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rizzo et al., 2021</xref>) or 50 overlapped proteins from two <italic>C. neoformans</italic> EV proteomic data sets reported by Rodrigues et al. and Wolf et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bleackley et al., 2021</xref>). Among 59 EV-associated proteins that were commonly detected by previous and current studies, 24 proteins were detected at lower concentration, whereas 5 were present in higher concentrations of 2-fold difference in <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ mutant EVs compared with that of WT EVs (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>; Supplementary Table S4). Thus, the proteome analysis showed that the absence of functional Ugg1 not only caused morphological alterations and reduced EV numbers but also altered EV protein abundance in <italic>C. neoformans</italic>.</p>
<p>To examine the loading defect of GXM in the <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ EVs, we examined the presence of GXM in purified EVs samples and compared the detected GXM quantities in the total cell extracts from WT, <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ, and <italic>cap59</italic>Δ strains (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F</xref>). Cda1 was used as the representative EV-associated protein because the presence of Cda1 was reported within the <italic>C. neoformans</italic> EV membrane despite a substantial portion of Cda1 being secreted through the conventional secretion pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rizzo et al., 2021</xref>). The 8 M urea extracts were obtained from the purified EVs and the whole cells that were subjected to pelleting during EV purification. The extracted samples, which contained equivalent protein concentrations, were subjected to blotting analysis using GXM-specific (18B7) and Cda1-specific antibodies (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F</xref>). No GXM polysaccharides were detected in the EVs released from the <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ, although the whole-cell extract of <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ mutant strain contained a significant quantity of GXM. Taken together with the reduced quantity of EV-associated proteins, the absence of GXM polysaccharides in the <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ EVs strongly indicates that EV cargo loading is defective when the ERQC is dysfunctional in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As glycoproteins pass through the secretory pathway, which starts at the ER, their <italic>N</italic>-linked glycans undergo extensive modifications in association with protein quality control. In mammals, the ERQC system is composed of ER glucosyltransferases (ALG6, ALG8, and ALG10), ER glucosidases (GLS1 and GLS2), ER chaperones (calnexin and calreticulin, CNX/CRT), and the folding sensor UGGT. The addition and removal of glucose residues enables the substrates to undergo cycles of binding and release, which promote accurate folding and prevent incompletely folded proteins from exiting the ER. After glucose trimming, α1,2-mannosidase I (ERManI) in the ER cleaves a mannose residue at the B branch of the M9 oligosaccharides and converts the core M9 <italic>N</italic>-glycans (Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>) to M8 forms (Man<sub>8</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>). This step occurs before the accurately folded proteins are exported to the Golgi apparatus or misfolded proteins are redirected towards degradation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Ziegler et al., 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Herscovics, 2001</xref>). Thus, in most eukaryotes, Man<sub>8</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> is the final mature core <italic>N</italic>-glycan attached to glycoproteins in the ER before their transport to the Golgi complex for further <italic>N</italic>-glycan modification.</p>
<p>In contrast to higher eukaryotes, the ERQC system of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is composed of glucosidase I, glucosidase II, and the calnexin Cne1 without a functional UGGT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 1A). Although Kre5 is homologous to UGGT, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Kre5 functions are unrelated to the putative calnexin cycle in the ERQC, and the function of ER glucosidases I/II is primarily associated with the synthesis of cell wall β1,6-glucan (Fernandez et al., 1996; Simons et al., 1998). The ERQC composition of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> is unique in that it possesses UGGT but lacks the three glucosyltransferases necessary for adding glucose residues to the core precursor <italic>N</italic>-glycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Park et al., 2012</xref>). This step is essential for generating the monoglucosylated form, which is recognized by CNE/CRT for initiating the folding mechanisms. Additionally, <italic>C. neoformans</italic> lacks CRT, which is the chaperone that aids CNE, and carries multiple α1,2-mannosidases. In this study, we investigated the molecular features and functions of the <italic>N</italic>-glycan-dependent ERQC in the human pathogen <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, which generates unique <italic>N</italic>-glycan precursors without glucose addition and shorter in length than those of most eukaryotes in the ER. Our data strongly suggest that despite the incomplete composition of the ERQC components, the UGGT-centered ERQC plays pivotal roles in cellular fitness, particularly in EV-mediated extracellular transport, which is crucial for pathogenicity.</p>
<p>The <italic>C. neoformans ugg1</italic>Δ mutant was avirulent in mice, a phenotype consistent with the observed defects in key virulence determinants, such as the polysaccharide capsule and melanin, as well as poor growth at 37 °C. The <italic>mns1</italic>Δ<italic>101</italic>Δ mutant displayed intermediate phenotypes between those of the WT and <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ. Our data from the UPR induction analysis and comparative transcriptomic analysis strongly indicate that the ERQC mutation generates ER stress; this accounts for significant similarity of the defective phenotypes of the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> ERQC mutants to those reported in other mutants that exhibit defective protein folding in the ER, particularly in terms of increased stress sensitivity and decreased virulence. Connections between ER stress and thermotolerance have previously been established in <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, as growth at 37 °C requires key ER protein chaperones and protein processing machinery, including components of the UPR signaling pathway Ire1 and the ER stress-responsive transcription factor Hxl1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cheon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Havel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jung et al., 2013</xref>). Other mutations causing defects in ER function in <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, such as mutants lacking <italic>DNJ1</italic> (an ER J-domain containing co-chaperone) and <italic>CNE1</italic> (an ER chaperone), resulted in growth inhibition. The <italic>dnj1</italic>Δ mutant strain displayed impaired elaboration of virulence factors, such as the exopolysaccharide capsule and extracellular urease activity, when cultured at human body temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Horianopoulos et al., 2021</xref>). Taken together with our data from the ERQC mutants, these findings strongly support the notion that maintaining ER homeostasis is crucial for survival and virulence factor production at elevated temperatures.</p>
<p>It is quite notable that the <italic>C. neoformans ugg1</italic>Δ EVs exhibited defective loading of GXM and many protein cargos, alongside a decrease in the number and changes in the size distribution of the extracellular EVs. Combined with compromised cell fitness, these defects in EV biogenesis and cargo loading, even under normal growth conditions, likely contribute to the complete loss of virulence owing to the defective export of virulence factors in the <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ mutant. EV generation involves complex molecular networks that function cooperatively or independently to mediate the invagination and fission of membranes and selective sorting of cargo molecules. Fungal EVs are produced and released under the maturation of endosomes into multivesicular bodies (MVBs). These MVBs are targeted to the cell surface, where they fuse with the plasma membrane and release luminal MVB vesicles into the outer space, serving as an unconventional secretion pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Oliveira et al., 2010</xref>). MVB formation requires the functionality of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCR). The ESCRT pathway is highly complex and involves a series of finely regulated events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Henne et al., 2011</xref>). Deletion of several EV transport-related genes through the ESCRT complex directly impacts the cryptococcal capsule, primarily by reducing capsule size. Specifically, the <italic>C. neoformans vps27</italic>Δ strain, which is involved in the ESCRT complex, showed altered EV size distribution, reduced capsule dimensions, defects in laccase export to the cell wall, and poor extracellular export of urease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Park et al., 2020</xref>). Other regulators of unconventional secretion are also linked to EV biogenesis in <italic>C. neoformans</italic>. For example, the Golgi reassembly and stacking proteins (GRASPs) regulate EV cargo and dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Peres et al., 2018</xref>). In <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, a <italic>grasp</italic>Δ mutant strain produced EVs with dimensions that significantly differed from those produced by WT cells, along with attenuated virulence and abnormal RNA composition. Moreover, the GRASP protein Grasp homology 1 (GRH1) serves as a chaperone that directly influences EV cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Malhotra, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Peres da Silva et al., 2018</xref>). Autophagy regulators, which participate in EV formation in other eukaryotes, also play a role in cryptococcal EV formation. An <italic>atg7</italic>Δ strain manifests hypovirulence, and EVs produced by this strain show slightly different RNA composition compared with that of the WT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Oliveira et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>It is intriguing how the absence of UGGT, leading to ERQC defects, results in defective EV biogenesis and cargo loading in <italic>C. neoformans</italic>. The ER is one of the largest organelles in the cell and is involved in multiple fundamental biological processes such as protein folding and secretion, Ca<sup>2+</sup> storage, and lipid synthesis. In addition to protein folding, the ER is crucial for regulating lipid metabolism (Moncan et al., 2020). Several enzymes involved in triglyceride (TG) biosynthesis, cholesterol biosynthesis, and enzymes regulating membrane turnover and dynamics are located in the ER. Consequently, ER stress significantly impacts lipid and sterol synthesis, although some of these mechanisms are yet to be clarified. LDs aid the UPR and ERAD in degrading misfolded proteins during ER stress in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (Garcia et al., 2020). In the present study, we observed a drastic increase in LDs in the <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ mutant, consistent with the previous hypothesis that LDs help to maintain ER homeostasis. Furthermore, we observed increased number of vacuoles in <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ. The altered vesicular structures observed in the <italic>ugg1</italic>Δ and <italic>mns1</italic>Δ<italic>101</italic>Δ strains may indicate abnormal lipid homeostasis caused by the ERQC defects, which could, in turn, affect EV biogenesis. The importance of lipids and membrane regulators in proper EV formation and GXM export has been suggested in a previous study on the Apt1 flippase in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> (Rizzo et al., 2019). Additionally, ergosterol is essential for membrane fluidity, permeability, and protein transport (Ermakova and Zuev, 2017). Erg6 is an enzyme involved in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway and was identified as essential for the trans-Golgi network transport of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Proszynski et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Nes et al., 2009</xref>). In <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, the <italic>erg6</italic>Δ mutant released EVs with a significantly larger diameter than those of the WT, carrying increased levels of proteins and sterols. This highlights the role of ergosterol in cryptococcal EV biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Oliveira et al., 2020</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that ER stress caused by misfolded glycoprotein accumulation in ERQC-defective mutants may alter lipid composition, which could affect EV biogenesis.</p>
<p>A recent study presented strong evidence for a key role of ER stress in modulating EV biogenesis by demonstrating that ER stress decreases exosome production through both adiponectin/T-cadherin-dependent and -independent pathways in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fukuoka et al., 2023</xref>). They showed that T-cadherin is downregulated by ER stress through IRE1α activation at the mRNA and protein levels and that ER stress decreases EV production through adiponectin/T-cadherin-independent way, which might involve interferon pathway activation in mice. In this study, we similarly observed induced activity of Ire1 in <italic>C. neoformans ugg1</italic>Δ strain, even under normal culture conditions, which suggests a possible association between the Ire1-mediated UPR pathway and cryptococcal EV biogenesis (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). Additionally, glycosylation regulates the biogenesis of small EVs and affects protein cargo loading efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Harada et al., 2020</xref>). This suggests that the altered <italic>N-</italic>glycosylation observed in <italic>C. neoformans ugg1</italic>Δ may influence cargo loading of certain EV-targeting glycoproteins. Future studies are needed to investigate the ERQC-mediated modulation of EV biogenesis and cargo loading in <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, as this will provide further insights into the mechanisms underlying the regulation, production, composition, and diversity of fungal EVs, which would enable a better understanding of their biological function. Expanding our knowledge on pathogenic fungal EVs would pave the way for utilizing native or engineered EVs as promising candidates for therapeutic applications, including fungal infection diagnosis and vaccine development.</p>

<caption><title>Impact of ERQC disruption on glycoprotein folding and EV-mediated transport of virulence factors in <italic>C. neoformans</italic></title><p>(A) In WT strain, <italic>C. neoformans</italic> UGGT homolog, Ugg1, functions as a sensor for misfolded glycoproteins within the ER, playing a crucial role in protein quality control. Functional ERQC is essential not only for ensuring the proper folding of glycoproteins, which is critical for maintaining cellular fitness, but also for facilitating EV-mediated secretion of capsule polysaccharides and virulence-related enzymes necessary for pathogenicity. (B) In the UGGT<italic>-</italic>deficient strain (<italic>ugg1</italic>Δ), ER stress is increased because of misfolded protein accumulation within the ER lumen. This heightened stress leads to decreased cellular fitness, which negatively impacts EV biogenesis and cargo loading. Consequently, significant defect occurs in EV-mediated transport, which ultimately leads to a complete loss of virulence. Nc: nucleus, Vc: vacuoles</p></caption>

<title>Animal study and <italic>in vitro</italic> survival analysis</title>
<p>Animal studies were conducted at the Chung-Ang University Animal Experiment Center. The study design was approved by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS, South Korea). Survival and fungal burden were assayed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cheon et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, eight mice (6-week-old female A/J Slc mice; Japan SLC) per strain were infected with 10<sup>5</sup> cells via intranasal instillation. The mice were weighed and monitored once daily and euthanized after rapid 30% weight loss or identification of signs of morbidity. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were generated using Prism version 7 (GraphPad Software). For performing the fungal burden assay, the lungs of <italic>C. neoformans</italic>-infected mice were dissected on days 7 or 60. Half-organ portions of the excised lungs were homogenized, serially diluted, and plated onto YPD medium containing 100 μg/ml chloramphenicol (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). The other half-lung samples were fixed, sectioned, and stained with mucicarmine (Abcam, UK) for histopathological analysis. <italic>C. neoformans</italic> colonization was analyzed using a Zeiss Axioscope (A1) equipped with an AxioCam MRm digital camera.</p>
<p>Cell survival within macrophages was analyzed by opsonizing <italic>C. neoformans</italic> cells with 10 mg/ml of 18B7 antibody at 37 °C for 1 h. The macrophage-like J774A.1 (10<sup>5</sup>) cells were seeded onto 96-well plates in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 18 h. The opsonized <italic>C. neoformans</italic> (10<sup>5</sup>) cells were co-incubated with activated macrophages at 37 °C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 1 h. The non-phagocytized yeast cells were removed by washing each well thrice with PBS. Then, DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS was added to each well, followed by culturing at 37 °C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 24 h. The macrophages were lysed in distilled water by vigorous pipetting, and the fungal cells were collected and serially diluted. Cryptococcal survival was assessed using two independent colony forming unit (CFU) assays.</p>

<title>Capsule transfer and shedding analysis</title>
<p>Capsule transfer assays were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Reese and Doering, 2003</xref>). Briefly, conditioned medium (CM) was prepared as a source of GXM by culturing the respective strains for 5 days in YPD medium, followed by filtering and storing the culture supernatant at 4 °C. The acceptor strains were cultured overnight at 30 °C in YPD medium. In total, 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> acceptor cells were incubated with 1 µl of CM for 1 h at room temperature under rotation (18 rpm) and washed twice with PBS. Capsule acquisition was visualized by incubating the cells with an anti-GXM (18B7) antibody conjugated with AlexaFluor 488 (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) for 1 h at 37 °C and observing under an Eclipse Ti-E fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Japan), equipped with a Nikon DS-Qi2 camera. The images were processed using the NIS-elements microscope imaging Software (Nikon, Japan). Capsule shedding analysis was performed by analyzing GXM shedding using a modified previously described protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yoneda and Doering, 2008</xref>). The respective strains were cultured in 10% Sabouraud media for 2 days, and the culture supernatant was sterile filtered. Enzyme denaturation was performed by subjecting the filtrate to heating at 70 °C for 15 min, followed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 3 min. Intracellular GXM analysis was performed by resuspending the pellets in TNE buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA) with the same volume of glass beads (425–600 µm in diameter, Sigma-Aldrich, USA). The cells were disrupted four times for 15 s at 5,000 rpm using a Precellys 24 Tissue Homogenizer (Bertin Technologies, France), followed by centrifugation at 16,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Next, 10 µl of the supernatant of either secreted or intracellular polysaccharide was mixed with 6X loading dye and run on a 0.6% certified Megabase agarose (Bio-rad, USA) gel in 0.5X TBE (44.5 mM Trisma base, 44.5 mM boric acid, 1 mM EDTA [pH 8.0]) at 25 V for 16 h. The polysaccharides were transferred onto a nylon membrane using the southern blotting technique. The membrane was air-dried, blocked using 5% skim milk, and treated overnight with 2 µg/ml 18B7 antibody.

<title>Detection of enzymatic activities in intracellular and secretary fractions</title>
<p>Biochemical enzymatic activities of acid phosphatase, urease, and laccase in the intracellular and secreted fractions were assayed spectrophotometrically, using previously described methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lev et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">de Sousa et al., 2022</xref>). Acid phosphatase activity was assayed by culturing cells in MM-KCL medium (0.5% KCl, 15 mM glucose, 10 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>.7H<sub>2</sub>0, 13 mM glycine, and 3 µM thiamine) for 3 h at 30 °C. The culture supernatant and soluble cell lysate were allowed to react with 2.5 mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) for 30 min at 37 °C. Urease activity was determined after culturing the cells in Rapid Urea broth (RUH) for 24 h at 30 °C and subjecting the culture supernatant and soluble cell lysate to incubation with phenol red. Laccase activity was assayed by culturing the cells in asparagine salts media (7.6 mM L-asparagine, 0.1% glucose, 22 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>.7H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.3 mM thiamine-HCl, and 20 nM biotin) for 48 h at 30 °C and allowing the supernatant and soluble cell lysate to react overnight with 10 mM L-DOPA. The reactions were quantified by measuring OD<sub>420</sub> (acid phosphatase), OD<sub>570</sub> (urease), or OD<sub>480</sub> (laccase). Cellulase activity was determined by culturing the cells in cellulose media (0.1% NaNO<sub>3</sub>, 0.1% K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 0.1% KCl, 0.5% MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.1% glucose, and 0.5% low viscosity carboxymethyl cellulose) for 24 h at 30 °C. The culture supernatants were concentrated using an Amicon tube (30 kDa cutoff, Sigma-Aldrich, USA). The concentrated supernatants and soluble cell lysates were allowed to react at 40 °C for 10 min with the substrate 4,6-O-(3-ketobutylidene)-4-nitrophenyl-β-D-cellopentaoside (BPNPG5), which was provided in the cellulase assay kit (CellG5 Method, Megazyme, Ireland). The reaction was terminated by adding 2% [w/v] Tris buffer (pH 10), and the absorbance of 4-nitrophenol was measured at 400 nm. Cellulase activity (CellG5 Units/ml) was calculated as indicated in the cellulase assay kit. α-amylase activity was measured using the α-Amylase Activity Colorimetric Assay Kit (Biovision Technologies, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Yeast cells were cultured overnight in YPD medium at 30 °C, and the culture supernatants were concentrated using an Amicon tube (30 kDa cutoff, Sigma-Aldrich, USA). The concentrated supernatants and soluble cell lysates were incubated for 1 h at 25 °C in assay buffer with the substrate ethylidene-pNP-G7, which was provided in the kit. OD<sub>405</sub> was measured. All the activity analysis results were normalized according to cell density (OD<sub>600</sub>).</p>

One loop of cells was inoculated into 10 ml of liquid YPD and incubated at 30 °C for 24 h with shaking (220 rpm). The cells were washed twice with 10 ml of PBS, counted, and diluted in PBS to a density of 3.5 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml. Aliquots of cell suspension (300 μl) were spread onto synthetic dextrose (SD) solid medium plates and incubated for 24 h at 30 °C. The cells were carefully recovered from each plate using an inoculation loop, gently resuspended in 30 ml PBS, and pelleted through centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged again at 15,000 ×<italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4 °C. Then, the supernatant was filtered through 0.45-μm syringe filters and ultracentrifuged at 100,000 ×<italic>g</italic> for 1 h at 4 °C (MLA-50 fixed angle rotor, Beckman Coulter, Germany). The supernatant was discarded, and the EV pellets were collected and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS for immediate use or stored at −80 °C for further experiments. The samples were diluted 100-fold, and EV sizes were measured using an NTA instrument (Nanosight Pro, Malvern Panalytical, Netherlands) coupled to a 532-nm laser (Malvern Panalytical, Netherlands), SCMOS camera (Hamamatsu Photonics. Japan), and syringe pump (Malvern Panalytical, Netherlands). The data were analyzed using the NS Xplorer software (v1.1.0.6, Malvern Panalytical, Netherlands).</p>
<p>Cryo-TEM imaging was performed by loading purified EVs (3 µl) onto a lacey carbon grid (Lacey Carbon, 300mesh Cu, Ted Pella Inc., USA), which was glow discharged at 15 mA for 60 s. The sample-loaded grid was blotted for 3 s at 15 °C and 100% humidity and immediately plunge-frozen in liquid ethane. The process was performed by Vitrobot Maek IV (Thermofisher Scientific, USA, SNU, CMCI). The frozen grids were imaged using TEM (JEM-2100F, JEOL, Japan); the temperature of the grid was maintained at approximately −180 °C at an acceleration voltage of 200 keV.

<title>EV proteome analysis</title>
<p>EVs proteins were solubilized in 8 M urea, 100 mM Tris (pH 7.5), and 5 mM tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) for 20 min at 23 °C. The protein concentration was quantified using the Protein Assay Dye (Bio-rad, USA). A Protifi S-TrapTM mini spin column (C02-mini-80, Protifi, USA) was used to process each sample. After digesting with trypsin gold (V5280, Promega, USA), the digested peptides were eluted using 50 mM tetraethylammonium bromide (TEAB; Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), 0.2% formic acid, and 50% acetonitrile. The pooled peptide solution was dried, dissolved in 100 mM TEAB, and labeled using TMTpro™ 16plex Label Reagent Set (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The labeled peptides (total, 100 µg proteins) were combined prior to offline basic reverse-phase liquid chromatographic (bRPLC) fractionation. Linear gradient was performed using buffer A (10 mM TEAB in water) and buffer B (10 mM TEAB in 90% acetonitrile), and 10 fractions were analyzed in total using am LC-MS/MS system. The samples were dissolved in 0.1% formic acid using an UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano system and analyzed using an Orbitrap Eclipse Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). All MS raw files were converted into mzML and ms2 file formats using the MSConvert (version 3.0.20033) software.</p>
<p>The <italic>C. neoformans</italic> proteome was determined by downloading a protein FASTA file from Uniprot (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://uniprot.org">http://uniprot.org</ext-link>), which included 30,647 reviewed (Swiss-Prot) and unreviewed (TrEMBL) proteins entries. A proteome search database with reversed sequence and contaminants in the Integrated Proteomics Pipeline (IP2, version 5.1.2, Integrated Proteomics Applications Inc., San Diego, CA) was generated. The proteome search from 20 ms2 files was performed with IP2 and its following parameters, followed by evaluation for a false discovery rate (FDR) using IP2 and Proteininferencer (version 1.0, Integrated Proteomics Applications Inc., USA). Protein quantification and statistical analysis for discovery of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) was performed using the ms2 files with tandem mass tag (TMT) reporter ions using an in-house program coded using Python 3.8, where t-test and Pearson’s correlation analysis between comparison samples was performed using the scikit-learn (version 0.23.2), Scipy (version 1.6.0), and statsmodels (0.12.1) Python libraries.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Using gene deletion analysis, the authors confirm the molecular function of putative components of an N-glycan-dependent endoplasmic reticulum protein quality control (ERQC) system (UGG1, MNS1, MNS101, MNL1, and MNL2), in the basidiomycetous fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans. Specifically, they confirm the essential role of these components in the ERQC system and their role in ER stress which contributes to cellular fitness and pathogenicity.</p>
<p>The second part of the study links the components to secretion, mainly EV biogenesis and composition. However, this part of the study is less convincing.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Although it is unclear why ER stress in the mutants would not manifest into a classical secretion defect, this is a rigorous, well-controlled study, with the use of complemented strains that demonstrate phenotypic restoration. The diagram in Figure 1 is very useful in orientating the reader to a complex subject matter, although the legend could be more descriptive.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A major weakness is the sheer volume of data presented (in the main text and supplement), which makes the results difficult to follow and retain: the work could essentially be two separate studies.</p>
<p>
Another major weakness is the lack of mechanistic insight into the role of the ERQC system in EV secretion and its disconnection to &quot;classical&quot; secretion, which is difficult to reconcile. Some insight into why EV secretion is decreased, and classical secretion is unaffected, would strengthen the significance of the findings. No mechanism is provided to explain why the ERQC mutants (Ugg1 mutant in particular) would have reduced and heterogeneously sized EVs. Furthermore, it is not convincing that the EV content changes would greatly impact fitness and virulence. The proteomics data showing reduced cargo in the Ugg1 mutant is not convincing and difficult to follow.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study investigates the molecular function of the N-glycan-dependent endoplasmic reticulum protein quality control system (ERQC) in Cryptococcus neoformans and correlates this pathway with key features of C. neoformans virulence, especially those mediated by extracellular vesicle transport. The findings provide valuable insights into the connection between this pathway and the biogenesis of C. neoformans extracellular vesicles.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strength of this study lies primarily in the careful selection of appropriate and current methodologies, which provide a solid foundation for the authors' results and conclusions across all presented data. All experiments are supported by well-designed and established controls in the study of C. neoformans, further strengthening the validity of the results and conclusions drawn from them. The study presents novel data on this important pathway in C. neoformans, establishing its connection with C. neoformans virulence. Interestingly, the findings led the authors to understand the relationship between this pathway and the transport of key fungal virulence factors via extracellular vesicles. This was demonstrated in the study, paving the way for a deeper understanding of extracellular vesicle biogenesis-a field still filled with gaps but one to which this study contributes solid data, helping to clarify aspects of this process.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I do not see significant weaknesses in this study. The experiments are well-grounded, and the results are clearly presented. I believe the only weakness is that the paper could be condensed. Sections like the discussion, for instance, are extremely lengthy, which may make reading and, consequently, understanding more challenging for many readers. Regarding the presentation of the results, while clear, the figures contain a lot of information, and I believe that some of this content could be moved to supplementary figures.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Cryptococcus neoformans is a global critical threat pathogen and the manuscript by Mota et al demonstrates that the pathogen's N-glycan-dependent protein quality control system regulates the capacity of the fungus to cause disease. The system makes sure that glycoproteins are folded correctly. The system is involved in the fitness and virulence of the fungus by regulating aspects of cellular robustness and the trafficking of virulence-associated compounds outside of the cell via transport in extracellular vesicles.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The investigators use multiple modalities to demonstrate that the system is involved in cryptococcal pathogenesis. The investigators generated mutant C. neoformans to explore the role of genes involved in the protein folding system. Basic microbiology, genetic analyses, proteomics, fluorescence and transmission microscopy, nanotracking analyses, and murine studies were performed. The validity of the findings are thus very high. Hypotheses are robustly demonstrated.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Aspects of the results should be better explained. Some results are extrapolated in their meaning beyond the extent of the data.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p>
<p>We thank the reviewer for recognizing the impact of our work on the pivotal roles of N-glycan-dependent ERQC in cellular fitness and pathogenicity and providing valuable comments to be considered to improve the manuscript. As suggested, we will rearrange data, reduce text volume, and discuss the possibility of how ERQC mutation decreases EV secretion without significant defect in conventional secretion. Regarding the proteomics data, we have already initiated a comparative analysis of total intracellular and EV-associated proteins to determine whether the reduced cargo loading in the Ugg1 mutant is specific to EV-associated proteins. Additionally, we may extend the analysis to include total secretion, enabling a clearer comparison between classical secretion and EV-mediated secretion to better evaluate the extent of classical secretion defects in the Ugg1 mutant.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p>
<p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for the positive evaluation of our work. As recommended, we will reduce the text and reorganize the data to enhance the manuscript's readability.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p>
<p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for the high appreciation of our work. As recommended, we will provide a more detailed explanation of the results with improved interpretation, strongly grounded on the obtained data.</p>
