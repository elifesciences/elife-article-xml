<title>Abstract</title><p>The imprinted <italic>ZDBF2</italic> gene is controlled by oocyte-derived DNA methylation, but its regulatory system is quite different from that of other canonically imprinted genes that are dependent on DNA methylation deposited in the gametes. At the <italic>ZDBF2</italic> locus, maternal DNA methylation in the imprinted differentially methylated region (DMR) does not persist after implantation. Instead, a transient transcript expressed in the early embryo exclusively from the unmethylated paternal allele of the DMR, known as <italic>GPR1-AS</italic>, contributes to establishing secondary DMRs that maintain paternal expression of <italic>ZDBF2</italic> in the somatic lineage. While the imprinting of <italic>ZDBF2</italic> and its unique regulatory system are evident in humans and mice, whether this process is conserved in other mammals has not been addressed. Here, we show that the first exon of human <italic>GPR1-AS</italic> overlaps with that of a long terminal repeat (LTR) belonging to the MER21C subfamily of retrotransposons. Although this LTR family appears and is amplified in eutherians, the MER21C insertion into the <italic>GPR1-AS</italic> orthologous region occurred specifically in the common ancestor of Euarchontoglires, a clade that includes primates, rodents, and rabbits. Directional RNA sequencing of placental tissues from various mammalian species revealed <italic>GPR1-AS</italic> orthologs in rabbits and nonhuman primates, with their first exon embedded within the same ancestral LTR. In contrast, allele-specific expression profiling showed that cow and tammar wallaby, mammals outside the Euarchontoglires group, expressed both alleles in all tissues analyzed. Our previous studies showed that LTRs reactivated in oocytes drive lineage-specific imprinting during mammalian evolution. The data presented here suggest that LTR-derived sequence activation after fertilization can also contribute to the lineage-specific establishment of imprinted genes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Genomic imprinting is a well-established biological phenomenon that refers to the differential expression of imprinted genes depending on their parental origin. Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modification, and noncoding RNA molecules, regulate this process, establishing and maintaining parent-of-origin-specific gene expression patterns. Imprinted genes play vital roles in various biological processes such as fetal growth and development, placental function, metabolism, and behavior. These imprinted genes are often clustered within imprinted domains and regulated by epigenetic marks in specific imprinting control regions (ICRs). The inheritance of parent-of-origin-specific DNA methylation marks from the oocyte or sperm occurs in germline differentially methylated regions (germline DMRs), which are propagated in all somatic tissues of the next generation and function as ICRs (therefore, referred to as canonical imprinting). Imprinting patterns can vary significantly among species. Although some genes are imprinted in only one or a few species, others are conserved in many mammals. For example, nearly 200 imprinted genes have been identified in mice and humans. However, less than half of these genes overlapped in both species, suggesting the existence of many species- or lineage-specific imprinted genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Tucci et al. 2019</xref>). The establishment of species-specific imprinting at specific loci can be driven by various evolutionary events, including mutations, differences in the function of DNA methyltransferases or the binding sites of proteins that control gene expression, the acquisition of new genes by retrotransposition, and the insertion of CpG-rich regions (CpG islands) that can serve as germline DMRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Takahashi et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kobayashi 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kaneko-Ishino and Ishino 2022</xref>). Our previous studies have also shown that oocyte-specific transcripts from upstream promoters, such as integrated LTR retrotransposons, play a critical and fundamental role in the mechanism underlying the establishment of lineage-specific maternal germline DMRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Brind’Amour et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bogutz et al. 2019</xref>). However, these genetic and genomic backgrounds alone do not explain the establishment of all mouse- or human-specific imprinted genes identified to date. Furthermore, in mammals other than humans and mice, the cataloging of imprinted genes has not been systematically addressed and species-specific imprinting events remain poorly understood.</p>
<p><italic>Zinc finger DBF-type containing 2</italic> (<italic>ZDBF2</italic>), a paternally expressed gene located on human chromosome 2q37.1, has been reported to regulate neonatal feeding behavior and growth in mice, although its molecular function remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kobayashi et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Glaser et al. 2022</xref>). There are at least three imprinted genes, <italic>ZDBF2</italic>, <italic>GPR1</italic> (alternatively named <italic>CMKLR1</italic>), and <italic>ADAM23</italic> around this locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hiura et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Morcos et al. 2011</xref>). Recently, the <italic>Zdbf2</italic> gene was also shown to be paternally expressed in rats, a member of the family Muridae, similar to mice (Richard Albert et al. 2023)(<bold>Supplemental Table S1</bold>). Studies have shown that <italic>ZDBF2</italic> imprinting is regulated by two types of imprinted DMRs: a germline DMR located in the intron of the <italic>GPR1</italic> gene and a somatic (secondary) imprinted DMR upstream of <italic>ZDBF2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kobayashi et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kobayashi et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Duffie et al. 2014</xref>). The germline DMR is methylated on the maternal allele, leading to silencing of <italic>GPR1</italic> antisense RNA (<italic>GPR1-AS</italic>, alternatively named <italic>CMKLR1-AS</italic>) expression on that allele, whereas the paternal allele is hypomethylated, allowing for the expression of <italic>GPR1-AS</italic>. <italic>GPR1-AS</italic> is transcribed in the reverse direction of <italic>GPR1</italic> (in the same direction as <italic>ZDBF2</italic>) from the germline DMR. Although it is not known whether <italic>GPR1-AS</italic> encodes a protein, a fusion transcript of <italic>Gpr1-as</italic> (<italic>Platr12</italic>) and <italic>Zdbf2</italic> (alternatively named <italic>Zdbf2linc</italic> or <italic>Liz</italic>; a long isoform of <italic>Zdbf2</italic>) has been identified in mice. This fusion transcript exhibited an imprinted expression pattern similar to that of human <italic>GPR1-AS</italic> (<bold>Supplemental Table S1</bold>). <italic>Liz</italic> directs DNA methylation at the somatic DMR, which competes with <italic>ZDBF2</italic> to repress the paternal allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Greenberg et al. 2017</xref>). Germline DMRs that function as ICRs generally maintain uniparental methylation throughout development; however, germline DMRs at this locus are no longer maintained because the paternally derived allele is also methylated after implantation. The secondary DMR, rather than germline DMR, is thought to maintain the imprinted status of this locus in somatic cell lineages. The unique regulatory mechanism responsible for imprinting at the <italic>ZDBF2</italic> locus appears to be conserved between humans and mice; however, whether this conservation extends to other mammals remains unknown.</p>
<p>Here, we focus on <italic>GPR1-AS</italic>, a critical factor in the imprinting of <italic>ZDBF2</italic>, and identified orthologous transcripts of <italic>GPR1-AS</italic> in primates and rabbits using RNA-seq-based transcript analysis. The first exon of these orthologs overlapped with a common LTR retrotransposon, suggesting that LTR insertion during a local evolutionary event in their common ancestor led to the establishment of <italic>ZDBF2</italic> imprinting. In support of this hypothesis, <italic>ZDBF2</italic> expression is not imprinted in other mammals such as cattle and tammar wallabies, which lack this LTR. Our findings demonstrate that the insertion of an LTR-derived sequence that becomes active after fertilization triggered the evolution of lineage-specific imprinting of <italic>ZDBF2</italic> in a specific branch of the mammalian lineage.</p>

<title>Detection of <italic>GPR1-AS</italic> orthologs using RNA-seq data sets</title>
<p><italic>GPR1-AS</italic> and <italic>Liz</italic> expression have been observed in placental tissues, blastocyst-to-gastrulation embryos, and/or ES cells in humans and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kobayashi et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kobayashi et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kobayashi et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Duffie et al. 2014</xref>). Public human tissue RNA-seq data sets show detectable <italic>GPR1-AS</italic> transcription in the placenta, albeit at a relatively low level (RPKM value of around 0.45–1.8), but significantly suppressed in other tissues (<bold>Supplemental Fig. S1</bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Fagerberg et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Duff et al. 2015</xref>). To identify <italic>GPR1-AS</italic> orthologs across different species, we performed transcript prediction analysis using short-read RNA-seq data from multiple mammalian placentas and extra-embryonic tissues.</p>
<p>First, we downloaded the placental RNA-seq data from 15 mammals: humans, bonobos, baboons, mice, golden hamsters, rabbits, pigs, cattle, sheep, horses, dogs, bats, elephants, armadillos, and opossums (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Armstrong et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Mika et al. 2022</xref>). These datasets were generated using conventional non-directional RNA-seq (also known as non-stranded RNA-seq), which does not retain information regarding the genomic element orientation of the sequenced transcripts. In addition, library preparation methods and the amount of data varied significantly among the datasets, ranging from millions to tens of millions (<bold>Supplemental Table S2</bold>). Although transcriptional analysis of these datasets identified transcripts such as <italic>GPR1-AS</italic> in human and baboon placentas, the structures of these predicted transcripts were so fragmented that their full-length forms could not be robustly determined (<bold>Supplemental Fig. S1</bold>). Furthermore, we did not observe such a transcript at the <italic>Gpr1</italic>-<italic>Zdbf2</italic> locus in the mouse placental data, where <italic>Liz</italic> is known to be expressed. This suggests that conventional RNA-seq datasets may not be sufficient to accurately detect <italic>GPR1-AS</italic> in different species.</p>
<p>Next, we downloaded directional RNA-seq data (also known as strand-specific or stranded RNA-seq, which can identify the direction of transcription) from the human placenta, rhesus macaque trophoblast stem cells, and mouse embryonic placenta (Nesculea et al., 2014; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Rosenkrantz et al. 2021</xref>). These RNA-seq datasets contain tens of millions of reads. In each of these deeply sequenced datasets, transcripts such as <italic>GPR1-AS</italic> (and <italic>Liz</italic> in mice) were detected, which were transcribed from the <italic>GPR1</italic> intron in the opposite direction to <italic>GPR1</italic> towards the <italic>ZDBF2</italic> gene (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref></bold>). Thus, <italic>GPR1-AS</italic> transcripts can be identified in placental tissues using deep directional RNA-seq data.</p>

<p>To identify <italic>GPR1-AS</italic>-like transcripts in other mammalian species, we generated deep directional RNA-seq datasets from the whole placenta of chimpanzees and the trophectoderm (TE) of rabbit, bovine, pig, and opossum post-gastrulation embryos, which yielded a total of 50–100 million reads (<bold>Supplemental Table S2</bold>). Among these datasets, <italic>GPR1-AS</italic> orthologs were identified in chimpanzees and rabbits but were not observed in cattle, pigs, or opossums (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref></bold>). Additionally, we performed directional RNA-seq of embryonic proper tissues (embryonic disc: ED) from individual animal embryos but did not identify any <italic>GPR1-AS</italic>-like transcripts in any of these samples (<bold>Supplemental Fig. S2</bold>). Thus, rabbit <italic>GPR1-AS</italic> is expressed only in placental lineages.

<p>Since <italic>GPR1-AS</italic>/<italic>Liz</italic> is essential for <italic>ZDBF2</italic> imprinting, it is assumed that <italic>ZDBF2</italic> imprinting system via <italic>GPR1-AS</italic> transcription is not established in other eutherians and marsupials in which <italic>GPR1-AS</italic> is absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Greenberg et al. 2017</xref>).

Therefore, we compared the LTR sequence location information of the synteny region of the <italic>GPR1</italic> and <italic>GPR1-AS</italic> loci to examine traces of MER21C insertion in several mammalian genomes, excluding marsupials.

<p>We also compared MER21C sequences that overlapped with the first exon of <italic>GPR1-AS</italic> in each primate (345 bp, 339 bp, and 506 bp from humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus macaques, respectively) and rabbits (218 bp), the first exon of <italic>Liz</italic> in mice (317 bp), and the common sequence of MER21C (938 bp). Pairwise alignment revealed high similarities between primate sequences (71–72%) and the consensus MER21C sequence compared to rabbit (60%) and mouse sequences (46%)(<bold>Supplemental Fig. S3</bold>). Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic tree reconstruction reveal that the rabbit and mouse sequences deviate to a greater extent from the consensus MER21C sequence than the cluster formed by the primate sequences, indicating that a greater number of mutations have accumulated in the non-primate lineage of Euarchontoglires since their divergence from Primates (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref></bold>).

<title><italic>GPR1-AS</italic> transcription and LTR reactivation in human</title>
<p><italic>GPR1-AS</italic> is reported to be expressed only briefly during embryogenesis, both before and after implantation, with the exception of the placental lineage. For instance, human <italic>GPR1-AS</italic> has been identified in ES cells, and mouse <italic>Liz</italic> expression has been observed in blastocyst-to-gastrulation embryos but not in gametes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kobayashi et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kobayashi et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Duffie et al. 2014</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that the expression of <italic>GPR1-AS</italic>/<italic>Liz</italic> is activated during preimplantation. To investigate the timing of <italic>GPR1-AS</italic> activation during embryonic development, we obtained public human RNA-seq data from the oocyte to blastocyst stages and performed expression analysis and transcript prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Kai et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Zou et al. 2022b</xref>). Among the datasets from oocytes; zygotes; 2-, 4-, and 8-cell embryos; inner cell mass (ICM); and TE from blastocysts, <italic>GPR1-AS</italic> was only detected at the 8-cell stage, ICM, and TE (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref></bold>). Hence, the expression of <italic>GPR1-AS</italic> initiates at the 8-cell stage in humans. However, at the <italic>GPR1</italic>-<italic>ZDBF2</italic> locus, both <italic>GPR1</italic> and <italic>ZDBF2</italic> were expressed in oocytes, but only <italic>GPR1</italic> was downregulated after fertilization and could not be detected after the 8-cell stage (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref></bold>)(<bold>Supplemental Fig. S4</bold>). We also examined the LTR expression at each stage and found that MER21C expression increased from the from 4-cell to 8-cell stage and peaked at the TE, which coincided with the appearance of <italic>GPR1-AS</italic> (<bold>Supplemental Fig. S4, S5</bold>). Thus, <italic>GPR1-AS</italic> was shown to begin expression from the preimplantation embryo stage, concurrently with the reactivation of the MER21C retrotransposon.</p>

<p>Next, we examined the epigenomic modifications of LTR-derived sequences located in the first exon of human <italic>GPR1-AS</italic> and mouse <italic>Liz</italic> using the ChIP-Atlas database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Zou et al. 2022a</xref>) (<bold>Supplemental Fig. S5</bold>). Both sequences that constitute the oocyte-derived germline DMR exhibit an enrichment of H3K4me3 in sperm or male germ cells, which is consistent with DNA hypomethylation in sperm. These sequences also show an enrichment of H3K27ac in pluripotent stem cells (such as ES and iPS cells). Although the first exon of mouse <italic>Liz</italic> has not been computationally determined as an LTR (according to the RepBase database), the mouse sequence is also enriched for H3K9me3, which regulates retrotransposons in multiple cell types and tissues. Additionally, human and mouse germline DMRs coincided with the TFAP2C peak (trophoblast stem cells) and ZSCAN4C peak (ES cells), respectively, and aligned with the binding motif predictions found in the JASPAR database. These data indicate that the first exons of human <italic>GPR1-AS</italic> and mouse <italic>Liz</italic> exhibit similar epigenomic modification variations from gamete to embryonic development, and their promoter activities are triggered after fertilization, although the underlying mechanisms may differ (<bold>Supplemental Fig. S7</bold>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The <italic>ZDBF2</italic> gene, the last canonical imprinting gene identified in mice and humans, was recently shown to regulate neonatal feeding behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Glaser et al. 2022</xref>). This discovery has garnered attention owing to its implications for behavioral phenotypes, aligning with the conflicting hypothesis of genomic imprinting mechanisms. The conflict hypothesis proposes that the evolutionary significance of genomic imprinting mechanisms lies in the functional conflicts between paternally and maternally expressed genes, resulting from the conflicting genomic survival strategies of the father, child, and mother (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Moore and Haig 1991</xref>). <italic>ZDBF2</italic> does not directly influence cell differentiation or ontogeny, such as embryogenesis, but rather affects individual growth through an indirect pathway involving feeding behavior. In humans, “imprinting diseases”, such as Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome, cause psychiatric disorders and growth retardation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Nicholls 2000</xref>). Considering that many imprinted genes show specialized expression patterns in the brain, <italic>ZDBF2</italic> is particularly interesting as a gene that can induce behavioral effects. However, the evolutionary origin of <italic>ZDBF2</italic> imprinting had remained unclear. In this study, we report that <italic>ZDBF2</italic> does not exhibit imprinted expression in cattle and tammar wallabies, mammalian species that do not belong to the Euarchontoglires. In contrast, we identified <italic>GPR1-AS</italic> orthologs in all the Euarchontoglires species examined, including humans, chimpanzees, baboons, rhesus macaques, and rabbits. We propose that the first exon of <italic>GPR1-AS</italic> is derived from the MER21C retrotransposon and that the insertion of this LTR at the <italic>GPR1</italic> intragenic region in the common ancestor of Euarchontoglires was crucial for establishing the imprinting status of the <italic>ZDBF2</italic> gene (<bold>Supplemental Fig. S7</bold>).</p>
<p>Two paternally expressed imprinted genes, <italic>PEG10</italic>/<italic>SIRH1</italic> and <italic>PEG11</italic>/<italic>RTL1</italic>/<italic>SIRH2</italic> have been identified in mammals. They encode GAG-POL proteins of <italic>sushi-ichi</italic> LTR retrotransposons and are essential for mammalian placenta formation and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Kaneko-Ishino and Ishino 2012</xref>). The presence of these genes provides evidence that LTR insertions have played a significant role in genomic imprinting and placentation throughout evolution. In contrast, while the <italic>ZDBF2</italic> gene is present in all vertebrate genomes, it is only imprinted in mammals belonging to the Euarchontoglires. This suggests that a nonimprinted gene acquired a new imprint through LTR insertion. Indeed, we previously demonstrated that transcriptional activity of specific LTRs in oocytes results in species-specific imprinting of numerous genes in rodents and primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bogutz et al. 2019</xref>). These LTRs act as alternative promoters and produce unique transcripts in the oocyte, which we referred to as LITs (LTR-initiated transcripts). Such transcription leads to a high level of methylation in the transcribed region, similar to gene body methylation, and is responsible for extensive interspecies differences in DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Brind’Amour et al. 2018</xref>). The major difference between these LTRs and the LTR retrotransposon focused on in this study is whether (re)activation occurs before or after fertilization. Some LITs become active in oocytes and establish oocyte-derived gDMRs of species-specific imprinted genes, such as <italic>Impact</italic> and <italic>Slc38a4</italic> genes in mice. Deletion of these LTRs causes loss of imprinting in mouse (rodent)-specific imprinted genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bogutz et al. 2019</xref>). <italic>GPR1-AS</italic> is a (likely noncoding) RNA whose transcription is initiated from an LTR-derived sequence, similar to the LITs found in oocytes; however, transcription starts after fertilization. In mice, <italic>Liz</italic>, a long isoform of <italic>Zdbf2</italic> and putative <italic>Gpr1-as</italic> ortholog, is essential for establishing a somatic secondary DMR upstream of <italic>Zdbf2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Greenberg et al. 2017</xref>). Although the first exon of <italic>Liz</italic> does not overlap with an annotated LTR, MER21C (or MER21B, a closely related LTR family) insertions are found in the homologous region in most rodents, with the exception of mice, rats, and hamsters. Our analyses suggest that the MER21C in these rodents has accumulated a number of mutations and in turn is no longer recognized as a MER21C element using optimal pairwise alignment algorithms such as RepeatMasker. Based on these observations, we propose that <italic>Liz</italic> and <italic>GPR1-AS</italic> are bona fide LITs with a MER21C-derived sequence serving as an alternative promoter.</p>
<p>Transposable elements are recognized by DNA-binding factors and their co-repressors and are suppressed through epigenetic and post-transcriptional regulation in both germline and somatic tissues to protect host genome stability. For example, LTR-retrotransposons are bound by KRAB-ZFPs, which recruit the KAP1/SETDB1 co-repressor complex, promoting deposition of the repressive histone modification H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Matsui et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Karimi et al. 2011</xref>). However, numerous retrotransposons are activated and robustly expressed during maternal to zygotic transition, where dynamic epigenetic reprogramming occurs. Indeed, a subset of transposable elements have been co-opted by the host during this window of development, including in support of embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Sakashita et al. 2023</xref>). In humans, retrotransposons are activated at the 8-cell stage and gradually downregulated in later developmental stages, coinciding with embryonic genome activation. In addition to the full-length endogenous retrovirus (ERV) sequences with partial coding potential, approximately 85% of human ERVs (HERVs) exist as solitary LTRs, known as “solo LTRs,” which provide a rich source of cis-regulatory elements for gene expression during human embryonic development. Retrotransposons located near host genes can act as alternative promoters or regulatory modules, such as enhancers, to activate embryonic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Grow et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Hashimoto et al. 2021</xref>). The discovery of the <italic>GPR1-AS</italic> as a transcript that initiates in an ancestral LTR reveals a new aspect of the functional role of these ectopic regulatory elements, with activation in this case occurring after fertilization.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study reveals that the origin of imprinting of <italic>ZDBF2</italic> can be traced back to the emergence of a common ancestor of Euarchontoglires, with insertion of an LTR promoter for <italic>GPR1-AS</italic> playing a critical role in establishing imprinting of this locus, including in mice and humans. Although the house mouse is used widely in the laboratory, and the <italic>Mus musculus</italic> genome has been extensively characterized, the retroviral origin of this promoter would not have been identified if this analysis had been performed solely on mice, as the annotated exon 1 of <italic>Liz</italic> (alternatively named <italic>Gpr1-as, Platr12</italic>, or <italic>Zdbf2linc</italic>) is highly degenerate and in turn not recognized as an LTR in this species. Thus, comparative analysis of multi-omics data, including genomes, transcriptomes, and epigenomes, across species was critical for the identification of the central role of a MER21C LTR in imprinting of <italic>ZDBF2</italic>. This study adds to a growing list of LTR elements that have been domesticated in mammals, with their transcriptional activity serving as a mechanism for the genesis of imprinting, including during gametogenesis and in this case following fertilization.</p>

The pairwise alignment, multiple sequence alignment, and physiological tree of MER21C sequences overlapping <italic>GPR1-AS</italic> were conducted with Genetyx software (Genetyx, Japan) using the MSA and MUSCLE programs. The common cis-motif was identified and compared with known transcription factor binding motifs from JASPAR CORE database using the XSTREAM and TOMTOM programs in the MEME suite. JASPAR motifs, logos, and <italic>p</italic>-values were obtained from the JASPAR hub tracks of the UCSC genome browser and JASPAR database. LTR positions of human (hg19) and mouse (mm10) were downloaded from UCSC genome browser and re-uploaded to Integrative Genomics Viewer with epigenetic patterns from ChIP-Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Zou et al. 2022a</xref>) and oocyte/sperm DNA methylomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Brind’Amour et al. 2018</xref>).</p>

<title>Allele-specific expression analysis</title>
<p>Tammar wallabies (<italic>Macropus eugenii</italic>) of Kangaroo Island origin were maintained in our breeding colony in grassy, outdoor enclosures. Lucerne cubes, grass and water were provided ad libitum and supplemented with fresh vegetables. Pouch young were dissected to obtain a range of tissues. DNA/RNA was extracted from multiple tissues of the Tammar wallaby using TRIzol Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and cDNA synthesis was performed using Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche, Switzerland). PCR was performed using TaKaRa Ex Taq Hot Start Version (TaKaRa) with primers designed at 3’UTR of wallaby <italic>ZDBF2</italic> according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Fetal tissues of pregnant healthy Holstein cattle were obtained from a local slaughterhouse. DNA/RNA was extracted from bovine fetus (liver), placentas, and <italic>in vitro</italic> cultured embryos using ISOGEN (Wako, Japan), and cDNA synthesis and PCR were performed using SuperScript IV One-Step RT-PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with primers designed at 3’UTR of bovine <italic>ZDBF2</italic> according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Target regions were also amplified using genomic DNA and Takara EX Taq Hot Start Version (Takara Bio). Sanger sequencing was performed using a conventional Sanger sequencing service (Fasmac, Japan) and ABI 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Sanger sequencing results were visualized using 4Peaks. Primers used in this analysis are listed in <bold>Supplemental Table S3</bold>.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The study tests the conservation of imprinting of the ZBDF2 locus across mammals. ZDBF2 is known to be imprinted in mice, humans, and rats. The locus has a unique mechanism of imprinting: although imprinting is conferred by a germline DMR methylated in oocytes, the DMR is upstream to ZDBF2 (at GPR1) and monoallelic methylation of the gDMR does not persist beyond early developmental stages. Instead, a lncRNA (GPR1-AS, also known as Liz in mouse) initiating at the gDMR is expressed transiently in embryos and sets up a secondary DMR (by mechanisms not fully elucidated) that then confers monoallelic expression of ZDBF2 in somatic tissues.</p>
<p>In this study, the authors first interrogate existing placental RNA-seq datasets from multiple mammalian species, and detect GPR1-AS1 candidate transcripts in humans, baboons, macaques and mice, but not in about a dozen other mammals. Because of the varying depth, quality, and nature of these RNA-seq libraries, the ability to definitely detect the GPR1-AS1 lncRNA is not guaranteed; therefore, they generate their own deep, directional RNA-seq data from tissues/embryos from five species, finding evidence of GPR1-AS in rabbits and chimpanzees, but not bovine animals, pigs or opossums. From these surveys, the authors conclude that the lncRNA is present only in Euarchontoglires mammals. To test the association between GPR1-AS and ZDBF2 imprinting, they perform RT-PCR and sequencing in tissue from wallabies and cattle, finding biallelic expression of ZDBF2 in these species that also lack a detected GPR1-AS transcript. From inspection of the genomic location of the GPR1-AS first exon, the authors identify an overlap with a solo LTR of the MER21C retrotransposon family in those species in which the lncRNA is observed, except for some rodents, including mice. However, they do detect a degree of homology (46%) to the MER21C consensus at the first exon on Liz in mouse. Finally, the authors explore public RNA-seq datasets to show that GPR1-AS is expression transiently during human preimplantation development, an expression dynamic that would be consistent with the induction of monoallelic methylation of a somatic DMR at ZDBF2 and consequent monoallelic expression.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
-The analysis uncovers a novel mechanism by which a retrotransposon-derived LTR may be involved in genomic imprinting.</p>
<p>
-The genomic analysis is very well executed.</p>
<p>
-New directional and deeply-sequenced RNA-seq datasets from the placenta or the trophectoderm of five mammalian species and marsupial embryos, that will be of value to the community.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Although the genomic analysis is very strong, the study remains entirely correlative. All of the data are descriptive, and much of the analysis is performed on RNA-seq and other datasets from the public domain; a small amount of primary data is generated by the authors.</p>
<p>
Evidence that the residual LTR in mouse is functionally relevant for Liz lncRNA expression is lacking.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This work concerns the evolution of ZDBF2 imprinting in mammalian species via initiation of GPR1 antisense (AS) transcription from a lineage-specific long-terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon. It extends previous work describing the mechanism of ZDBF2 imprinting in mice and humans by demonstrating conservation of GPR1-AS transcripts in rabbits and non-human primates. By identifying the origin of GPR1-AS transcription as the LTR MER21C, the authors claim to account for how imprinting evolved in these species but not in those lacking the MER21C insertion. This illustrates the principle of LTR co-option as a means of evolving new gene regulatory mechanisms, specifically to achieve parent-of-origin allele specific expression (i.e., imprinting). Examples of this phenomenon have been described previously, but usually involve initiation of transcription during gametogenesis rather than post-fertilization, as in this work. The findings of this paper are therefore relevant to biologists studying imprinted genes or interested more generally in the evolution of gene regulatory mechanisms.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
(1) The authors convincingly demonstrate the existence of GPR1-AS orthologs in specific mammalian lineages using deeply sequenced, stranded, and paired-end RNA-seq libraries collected from diverse mammalian species.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
(1) The authors do not directly demonstrate imprinting of the ZDBF2 locus in rabbits and non-human primates, which would greatly strengthen their model linking ZDBF2 imprinting to transcription from MER21C.</p>
<p>(2) Experimental evidence linking GPR1-AS transcription to ZDBF2 imprinting in rabbits and non-human primates is currently lacking. Consideration should be given to the challenges associated with studying non-model species and manipulating repeat sequences, which may explain the absence of experimental evidence in this case. Further, this mechanism is established in humans and mice, so the authors' model is arguably sufficiently supported merely by the existence of GPR1-AS orthologs in other mammalian lineages.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Kobayashi et al identify MER21C as a common promoter of GPR1-AS/Liz in Euarchontoglires, which establishes a somatic DMR that controls ZFDB2 imprinting. In mice, MER21C appears to have diverged significantly from its primate counterparts and is no longer annotated as such.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors used high-quality cross-species RNA-seq data to characterise GPR1-AS-like transcripts, which included generating new data in five different species. The association between MER21C/B elements and the promoter of GPR1-AS in most species is clear and convincing. The expression pattern of MER21C/B elements overall further supports their role in enabling correct temporal expression of GPR1-AS during embryonic development.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
A deeper comparison of syntenic regions to the GPR1-AS promoter could be performed to provide a clearer picture of how the MER21C/B element evolved. The use of alternative TE annotation software may also be helpful. These analyses would be particularly useful to drive home the conclusion that the mouse (Liz) promoter is derived from the same insertion.</p>
