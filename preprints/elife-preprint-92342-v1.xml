<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Radial neuronal migration is a key neurodevelopmental event for proper cortical laminar organization. The multipolar-to-bipolar transition, a critical step in establishing neuronal polarity during radial migration, occurs in the subplate/intermediate zone (SP/IZ), a distinct region of the embryonic cerebral cortex. It has been known that the extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules are enriched in the SP/IZ. However, the molecular constitution and functions of the ECM formed in this region remain poorly understood. Here, we identified neurocan (NCAN) as a major chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan in the SP/IZ. NCAN binds to both radial glial cell-derived tenascin-C (TNC) and hyaluronan (HA), a large linear polysaccharide, forming a ternary complex of NCAN, TNC, and HA in the SP/IZ. Developing cortical neurons make contact with the ternary complex during migration. The enzymatic or genetic disruption of the ternary complex impairs radial migration by suppressing the multipolar-to-bipolar transition. Furthermore, both TNC and NCAN promoted the morphological maturation of cortical neurons <italic>in vitro</italic>. The present results provide evidence for the cooperative role of neuron- and radial glial cell-derived ECM molecules in cortical development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The six-layered laminar structure of the mammalian cerebral cortex is achieved via the coordinated radial migration of neurons from their place of birth in the ventricular zone (VZ) to their final destination in the cortical plate (CP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barnes and Polleux, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Taverna et al., 2014</xref>). Radial glial cells residing in the VZ are embryonic neural stem cells and a major source of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kriegstein and Alvarez-Buylla, 2009</xref>). During the neurogenesis period (from embryonic day (E) 12 to E18 in mice), radial glial cells divide asymmetrically to give rise to one self-renewing radial glial cell and one intermediate progenitor cell. Intermediate progenitor cells detach from the apical surface, lose their polarity, and further divide symmetrically to produce a pair of neurons above the VZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Noctor et al., 2004</xref>). Newly born immature neurons transiently exhibit multipolar shapes with multiple neurites and move in random directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Noctor et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Tabata and Nakajima, 2003</xref>). Neurons then change their shape from multipolar to bipolar, extending leading and trailing processes in the subplate/intermediate zone (SP/IZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hatanaka and Yamauchi, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jossin and Cooper, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Namba et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Ohtaka-Maruyama et al., 2018</xref>). Bipolar neurons attach to the radial fibers elongated from radial glial cells and migrate radially along these fibers toward their final destination in the CP. The leading and trailing processes of bipolar neurons eventually become the apical dendrite and axon. Therefore, radial glial cells play important dual roles in both producing neurons and guiding them to their proper locations.</p>
<p>The multipolar-to-bipolar transition is a critical step in establishing neuronal polarity. The intrinsic mechanisms underlying neuronal polarity have been investigated for a long time using primary cultured neurons <italic>in vitro,</italic> and the importance of cytoskeletal molecules, signaling cascades, and transcription factors has been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jossin, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Namba et al., 2015</xref>). Polarity formation <italic>in vivo</italic> may differ from that <italic>in vitro</italic> because it occurs in a complex three-dimensional environment generated by the extracellular matrix (ECM), secreted factors, and neighboring cells. The ECM provides structural support to guarantee tissue integrity and regulates neuronal differentiation, maturation, and synaptic function in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barros et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Faissner and Reinhard, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Franco and Müller, 2011</xref>). The brain ECM is characterized by a predominance of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fawcett et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Maeda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Miyata and Kitagawa, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Reinhard et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zimmermann and Dours-Zimmermann, 2008</xref>). It has long been known that CSPGs are enriched in the SP/IZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fukuda et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hoerder-Suabedissen and Molnár, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Miller et al., 1995</xref>). Notably, the multipolar-to-bipolar transition occurs in the SP/IZ, a cell-sparse area rich in CSPGs. However, the molecular constitution and functions of the ECM formed in this region remain poorly understood.</p>
<p>CSPGs expressed in the brain, including neurocan (NCAN), aggrecan (ACAN), versican, and brevican, exhibit shared structural domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Yamaguchi, 2000</xref>). The N-terminal domain interacts with hyaluronan (HA), a large linear polysaccharide chain that reaches several million Da in size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Day and Prestwich, 2002</xref>). The central region shows an extended structure and contains covalently bound chondroitin sulfate chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zimmermann and Dours-Zimmermann, 2008</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated the critical roles of chondroitin sulfate chains in neural stem/progenitor cell proliferation and neuronal migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ishii and Maeda, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Sirko et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">von Holst et al., 2006</xref>). The C-terminal domain of CSPGs binds to tenascins, a group of multimeric glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aspberg et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Yamaguchi, 2000</xref>). Many studies have reported that tenascin-C (TNC) expressed by radial glial cells in the embryonic brain plays a crucial role in controlling cell proliferation and differentiation in the VZ (see reviews by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Faissner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Faissner and Reinhard, 2015</xref>). While the involvement of TNC in the stem cell niche is well-established, its role in neuronal migration remains relatively unexplored. For instance, a previous study has demonstrated that anti-TNC antibodies inhibit the migration of cerebellar granule cells in explant cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Husmann et al., 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>We previously reported that HA accumulated in the SP/IZ of the developing mouse cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Takechi et al., 2020</xref>). Pharmacological inhibition of HA synthesis suppressed neurite outgrowth in cultured neurons <italic>in vitro</italic>. Nevertheless, the interplay between HA, CSPGs, and tenascins within a common pathway to regulate embryonic cortical development remains uncertain. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether CSPGs, HA, and tenascins form a complex in the developing cerebral cortex and, if so, to determine the potential significance of this complex in neuronal migration and the multipolar-to-bipolar transition <italic>in vivo</italic>. We demonstrated that NCAN, a major CSPG produced by developing cortical neurons, is bound to HA in the SP/IZ <italic>in vivo</italic>. NCAN also interacted with radial glial cell-derived TNC, forming a ternary complex of HA, NCAN, and TNC. Developing cortical neurons made contact with the ternary complex during migration. The enzymatic or genetic disruption of the ternary complex retarded radial migration by suppressing the multipolar-to-bipolar transition. The present results provide evidence for the cooperative role of neuron- and radial glial cell-derived ECM molecules in cortical development.</p>

<title>NCAN is a major CSPG produced by developing cortical neurons</title>
<p>We attempted to identify the core proteins of CSPGs in the developing mouse brain using an antibody recognizing the neoepitope generated at the non-reducing terminus of chondroitin sulfate chains after digestion with chondroitinase ABC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Caterson, 2012</xref>). Immunoblot analysis of the mouse cerebral cortex at E18 indicated that a band at 130 kDa represented a major CSPG detected by the anti-neo epitope antibody (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). However, the developing mouse cerebral cortex contained other minor CSPGs. The lack of staining from the undigested cerebral cortex confirmed the specificity of the antibody. In-gel tryptic digestion followed by a MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis identified the 130-kDa CSPG as an N-terminal portion NCAN (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). Full-length &gt;250-kDa NCAN is reportedly cleaved to generate the N-terminal 130-kDa fragment and C-terminal 150-kDa fragment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Rauch et al., 1992</xref>). Using an antibody to the N-terminal portion of NCAN, we found that the full-length and the N-terminal fragment of NCAN were both detected in the developing cerebral cortex (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1e, f</xref>). In contrast, only the cleaved fragment was detected in the adult cerebral cortex, indicating the developmental stage-dependent proteolytic processing of NCAN (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1e, f</xref>). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed high expression levels of <italic>Ncan</italic> during the late embryonic and early postnatal stages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1g</xref>).</p>

<p>We examined whether developing cortical neurons produce NCAN by immunoblot analysis of primary cultured cortical neurons. The full-length and the N-terminal fragment of NCAN were gradually secreted into the culture medium (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1h</xref>). To investigate the expression of <italic>Ncan</italic> mRNA during radial migration <italic>in vivo</italic>, we labeled radial glial cells in the VZ with GFP through <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation at E14 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1i</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1a">Figure 1-figure supplement 1</xref>). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of GFP-positive cells isolated 0.6, 1, 2, and 4 days after labeling demonstrated that <italic>Ncan</italic> mRNA expression increased two days after labeling and was thereafter maintained (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1j</xref>). These results indicated that developing cortical neurons themselves express <italic>Ncan</italic> mRNA and are capable of secreting NCAN.</p>

<title>NCAN forms a pericellular matrix with HA around developing neurons</title>
<p>We investigated the distribution of <italic>Ncan</italic> mRNA in the developing cerebral cortex by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization analysis. The widespread distribution of <italic>Ncan</italic> mRNA throughout the cerebral cortex indicated that NCAN production involves developing neurons as well as other cell populations, including radial glial cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). In contrast to <italic>Ncan</italic> mRNA, NCAN protein densely accumulated in cell-sparse zones, such as the SP/IZ and marginal zone (MZ), but was less abundant in cell-dense regions, such as the CP and VZ (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). This discrepancy in the <italic>Ncan</italic> mRNA and NCAN protein distribution pattern suggested a mechanism through which secreted NCAN protein localizes to the SP/IZ and MZ.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="506497v2_fig2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>We noticed that the localization pattern of NCAN was similar to that of HA, which we previously reported (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Takechi et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, NCAN and HA co-localized in cortical neuronal cultures as punctate signals at adhesion sites between the neuron and culture substrate, indicating that NCAN formed a pericellular matrix with HA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>). To directly examine the binding between NCAN and HA, we pulled down endogenous HA and its interacting proteins using a biotinylated HA-binding protein (b-HABP), followed by immunoblotting with the antibody to the N-terminal portion of NCAN (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2e</xref>). This analysis confirmed the interaction between NCAN and endogenous HA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2f</xref>). NCAN did not precipitate without b-HABP. The precipitation of NCAN depended on intact HA because NCAN disappeared from precipitates by digestion with hyaluronidase from <italic>Streptomyces hyalurolyticus</italic>, which specifically degrades HA and does not act on other glycosaminoglycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Ohya and Kaneko, 1970</xref>). In addition, exogenously added biotinylated HA (b-HA) is also bound to the N-terminal portion of NCAN (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2g</xref>). To verify the association between NCAN and HA by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation, we recombinantly expressed the full-length, N- and C-terminal halves of NCAN fused with GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2a">Figure 2-figure supplement 1a</xref>). After incubating with HA, we pulled down GFP-fused NCAN with anti-GFP nanobody-conjugated resin. Quantification of HA by ELISA demonstrated that the full-length and N-terminal half of NCAN precipitated a larger amount of HA than the C-terminal half (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2a">Figure 2-figure supplement 1b</xref>), supporting the binding between the N-terminal portion of NCAN and HA.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Radial glial cell-derived TNC interacts with the C-terminal portion of NCAN</title>
<p>To further screen the interacting partners of NCAN, we pulled down proteins in the embryonic mouse brain lysate with GFP-fused full-length NCAN immobilized to resin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). LC-MS/MS analysis following trypsin digestion identified several proteins, including NCAN itself (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Among the identified proteins, only TNC exhibited specific binding to NCAN. In contrast, intracellular proteins such as tubulin and actin were found to be non-specific proteins detected even from the negative control resin. Co-immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblot analysis showed that the C-terminal half, but not the N-terminal half of NCAN, is bound to TNC (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>). Interactions between NCAN and TNC were dependent on a divalent cation but not on chondroitin sulfate chains on NCAN consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aspberg et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Rauch et al., 1997</xref>). The expression of TNC at mRNA and protein levels peaked during late embryonic brain development, similar to the expression pattern of NCAN (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c-e</xref>). <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization analysis indicated that in the developing cerebral cortex at E16, <italic>Tnc</italic> mRNA was confined to the VZ where the cell bodies of radial glia cells reside (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3f</xref>), consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Faissner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Garcion et al., 2004</xref>).

However, TNC protein was not restricted to the VZ but was also observed in the SP/IZ and MZ, similar to the localization of NCAN (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3g</xref>).</p>

<p>To predict the structure of the NCAN-TNC complex, we performed AlphaFold2 multimer analysis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a, b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4a">Figure 4-figure supplement 1a</xref>). In this modeled complex, a C-type lectin domain (CLD) of NCAN interacts with the 4th and 5th fibronectin type-III domains (FNIII) of TNC, which is consistent with a previously reported structure of aggrecan (ACAN) and tenascin-R (TNR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4a">Figure 4-figure supplement 1b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lundell et al., 2004</xref>). Amino acid residues in the interface of NCAN-TNC and ACAN-TNR complex were highly conserved (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c, d</xref>). An Asn residue (Asn1148 in mNCAN and Asn2022 in rACAN), which interacts with Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, was also conserved. Sequence alignments of fourteen FNIII of TNC indicated that the amino acid residues in FNIII-4 involved in the binding to NCAN are not well conserved among other FNIII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4a">Figure 4-figure supplement 1c</xref>). From these results, we proposed that NCAN, HA, and TNC cooperatively assemble a supramolecular complex as follows: (1) NCAN derived from developing neurons and radial glial cells binds to multiple sites on a long chain of HA via the N-terminal Link modules; (2) The hexamer of TNC secreted from radial glial cells cross-links NCAN through the interaction between the FNIII-4 domain of TNC and the CLD of NCAN (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4e</xref>).</p>

<title>Defects in NCAN and TNC retards neuronal migration</title>
<p>To elucidate the role of the ternary complex during cortical development, we generated double knockout (DKO) mice for NCAN and TNC. Neither TNC nor NCAN was detected in the DKO mice, and the brain weights were not different compared to wild-type (WT) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6a">Figure 6-figure supplement 1</xref>). Since the migratory patterns of neurons differ between the lateral and medial cortices, we took advantage of Flash Tag technology, in which an intraventricular injection of fluorescent dyes allows for the pulse labeling of progenitors in contact with the ventricle across the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Govindan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Telley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Yoshinaga et al., 2021</xref>). Radial glial cells in the M-phase were labeled at E14, and their progeny was analyzed two days later at E16. In the lateral cortex of WT mice, many labeled cells were migrating in the upper and lower SP/IZ, and a smaller population had already reached the CP (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a, b</xref>). In DKO mice, most cells resided beneath the lower SP/IZ, and very few reached the upper SP/IZ and CP. Bin analysis showed that DKO mice had a significantly lower percentage of labeled cells in the upper layers (Bin 1 and 2) and more cells in the lower layers (Bin 4 and 5) than WT mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6b</xref>). In the medial cortex of WT mice, neurons reached the CP more quickly than in the lateral cortex (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6c</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Yoshinaga et al., 2021</xref>).

<p>Delayed migration in DKO mice was mostly restored after three days of labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6a">Figure 6-figure supplement 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6b">b</xref>).

No significant abnormalities were observed in the laminar structure in 4-week-old DKO mice. These results suggest that while the ternary complex is necessary for proper neuronal migration, some compensatory mechanisms may mitigate its effects in the postnatal brain. To assess whether the loss of NCAN and TNC affects stem cells/progenitors in the VZ, we compared the number of Pax6-positive radial glial cells and Tbr2-positive intermediate progenitor cells. Immunohistochemical analysis showed no significant differences between WT and DKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6a">Figure 6-figure supplement 4a</xref>).

In NCAN KO mice, a significantly lower percentage of labeled cells resided in the upper layer (Bin2), and more cells remained in the lower layer (Bin5) than in WT mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7a</xref>).

<p>We analyzed the effect of single deletion of NCAN or TNC on the ternary complex formation. In WT mice, TNC was accumulated in the SP/IZ, whereas in NCAN KO mice, the localization of TNC shifted to the lower layers (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7b</xref>). Furthermore, TNC KO mice exhibited an attenuated accumulation of NCAN in the SP/IZ compared with WT mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7c</xref>). These results suggest that TNC and NCAN are mutually required for their localization in the SP/IZ. Then, we examined whether the reduction in TNC accumulation observed in NCAN KO mice can be rescued by forced expression of NCAN in migrating neurons. We expressed Turbo-RFP alone or with GFP-fused full-length NCAN in NCAN KO brains by <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation at E14 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7d</xref>). Immunostaining of TNC around the transfected Turbo-RFP-positive neurons after two days indicated that expression of GFP-fused NCAN increased the accumulation of TNC compared to controls (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7e, f</xref>). Higher magnification views showed that TNC was localized adjacent to GFP-fused NCAN (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7g</xref>). Additionally, in DKO mice, the accumulation of HA, another component of the ternary complex, was also decreased in the SP/IZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7a">Figure 7-figure supplement 1a</xref>). The reduction in HA accumulation was less pronounced in single KO mice compared to DKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7a">Figure 7-figure supplement 1b</xref>), indicating that HA could not localize in the SP/IZ only when both NCAN and TNC were absent.</p>

We noted that the staining intensity of NCAN and TNC significantly decreased at the SP/IZ following the hyaluronidase treatment, indicating the interaction of these molecules and the requirement of HA for the localization of NCAN and TNC. Immunoblot analysis showed that the digestion of HA reduced the amount of NCAN and TNC in the cerebral cortex by approximately half, confirming the essential role of HA in the retention of NCAN and TNC (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8b, c</xref>).

<title>DKO mice show delayed multipolar-to-bipolar transition during radial migration</title>
<p>To gain insights into the mechanisms underlying migration defects in DKO mice, we investigated whether the loss of NCAN and TNC influenced the multipolar-to-bipolar transition. Fifty-three hours after <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation with a cytosolic form of mCherry, we evaluated neuronal morphology based on the following criteria: (1) the ratio of the length-to-width of labeled neurons as an indicator of cell shape; (2) the angle between major neurites and the ventricle surface; (3) the percentage of neurons with a bipolar morphology, defined as cells with a length-to-width ratio greater than three and an orientation angle greater than 70° (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9a</xref>). <italic>In utero</italic> electroporation-mediated labeling also showed delayed neuronal migration in DKO mice, similar to Flask Tag labeling (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9b</xref>).

This result indicated that control neurons had an elongated shape, whereas neurons in DKO mice retained a rounded shape. Many neurons radially extended their major neurites towards the pia surface (between 70° and 90° relative to the ventricle surface) in WT mice, which is characteristic of bipolar neurons (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9e</xref>). Compared with control neurons, the major neurites of DKO neurons were not directed toward the pia surface. Consistent with these results, we observed a significantly smaller proportion of bipolar neurons in DKO mice than in WT mice (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9f</xref>).

After two days of plating, culturing neurons on the TNC-coated plates significantly accelerated neurite outgrowth (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10c</xref>).

Defects in the multipolar-to-bipolar transition lead to neuronal mispositioning, laminar structure disorganization, and cortical development malformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Castello and Gleeson, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fernández et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, the timing and location of the multipolar-to-bipolar transition need to be tightly controlled. The present results propose that the assembly of ECM molecules in the SP/IZ provides an extracellular positional cue for migrating neurons that specify the site of the multipolar-to-bipolar transition. Polarity formation <italic>in vivo</italic> occurs in a microenvironment or niche created in the SP/IZ. A previous study found that pre-existing efferent axon tracts in the SP/IZ interacted with migrating multipolar neurons to promote the formation of axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Namba et al., 2014</xref>). Secreted soluble factors also play significant roles in this process. A gradient of semaphorin 3A in the developing cerebral cortex regulates neuronal migration and polarity by attracting apical dendrites and repulsing axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Polleux et al., 2000</xref>). Transforming growth factor-β initiates signaling pathways that specify axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yi et al., 2010</xref>). Reelin, a glycoprotein secreted by Cajal-Retzius cells in the MZ, is essential for completing neuronal migration and cortical lamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">D’Arcangelo et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jossin and Cooper, 2011</xref>). Therefore, a combination of ECM molecules, secreted factors, and neighboring cells regulates neuronal polarity during cortical development.</p>
<p>Radial glial cells play a dual function during development: producing neurons and serving as scaffolds for neuronal migration. The present study discovered another role for radial glial cells: they secrete and deposit TNC to stimulate the morphological transition of migrating neurons in the SP/IZ. In gyrencephalic species, such as humans, basal/outer radial glial cells residing in the outer sub-VZ generate the majority of cortical neurons and are responsible for the expansion of the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kriegstein and Alvarez-Buylla, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Taverna et al., 2014</xref>). Basal/outer radial glial cells are characterized by the high gene expression of several ECM molecules, including TNC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fietz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Pollen et al., 2015</xref>), indicating that basal/outer radial glial cells create a microenvironment that promotes neuronal migration. In addition, HA-based ECM affects the cortical folding of the developing human neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Long et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that the evolutionarily conserved ECM structure contributes to neocortex expansion in gyrencephalic species. The tenascin gene family in vertebrates comprises four closely related members. They share structural motifs: a cysteine-rich region at the N-terminus followed by EGF-like repeats, FNIIIs, and a fibrinogen-like globe at the C-terminus. TNC monomers assemble into hexamers at the N-terminal region. Distinct domains of TNC are involved in cell adhesion, cell repulsion, and neurite outgrowth promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Andrews et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Faissner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Götz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lochter et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Tucker and Chiquet-Ehrismann, 2015</xref>). For example, alternatively spliced FNIIIs stimulate neurite outgrowth by binding to neuronal surface contactin-1 in primary cultured neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Rigato et al., 2002</xref>). Several integrins have been identified as receptors for TNC, and through this interaction, TNC influences cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Tucker and Chiquet-Ehrismann, 2015</xref>). However, the mechanisms by which TNC secreted from radial glial cells are presented to neurons <italic>in vivo</italic> remain unclear. Our analysis revealed that binding to HA via NCAN was required for the deposition of TNC in the SP/IZ. Further studies are needed to identify receptors for TNC on migrating neurons and its downstream signaling pathway that transmits information from the extracellular environment to the inside of the cell.</p>
<p>There is a transition from embryonic-to adult-type ECM during brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Miyata et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zimmermann and Dours-Zimmermann, 2008</xref>). The expression of NCAN and TNC is high in the embryonic brain, whereas ACAN, brevican, and TNR increase during late postnatal development. In the adult brain, ACAN cross-links HA and TNR and forms macromolecular aggregates around subpopulations of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fawcett et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Miyata and Kitagawa, 2017</xref>). This condensed ECM structure, called perineuronal nets, is formed at the late postnatal stages and plays pivotal roles in neural plasticity, memory consolidation, and circuit maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fawcett et al., 2022</xref>). The ternary complex of ACAN, HA, and TNR physically stabilizes existing synapses and inhibits new synapse formation. In perineuronal nets, high molecular weight HA serves as a structural scaffold, facilitating the accumulation of ECM around subpopulations of neurons in the adult brain. The present study showed that a structurally similar ternary complex of NCAN, HA, and TNC was formed in the SP/IZ of the embryonic cortex but exerted distinct functions in cortical development. The enzymatic digestion of HA impedes the accumulation of NCAN and TNC within the SP/IZ, supporting that HA functions as a scaffold for ECM in the developing brain. Alternatively, HA may transmit extracellular signals to developing neurons through cell surface HA receptors such as CD44 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Skupien et al., 2014</xref>). Although the interaction of NCAN with HA and TNC was previously reported <italic>in vitro</italic>, the present results revealed the formation of the ternary complex <italic>in vivo</italic> for the first time. Full-length NCAN is detected during early development but not in adulthood, indicating that the proteolytic cleavage of NCAN affects the assembly of the ternary complex. Screening using peptide library mixtures revealed that matrix metalloprotease-2 cleaved the central region of NCAN <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Turk et al., 2001</xref>). The temporal control of matrix metalloproteases may affect neuronal migration via the assembly and disassembly of the ECM.</p>
<p>We observed that single deletion of NCAN leads to mild abnormalities in neuronal migration. The loss of NCAN may interfere with TNC localization and thus delay neuronal migration. Alternatively, the binding of NCAN to cell adhesion molecules on the neuronal surfaces may affect neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Friedlander et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Rauch et al., 2001</xref>). Genome-wide association studies identified a genetic variation in NCAN as a risk factor for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. However, the relationship between the delayed neuronal migration observed in NCAN KO mice and the onset of neuropsychiatric disorders remains uncertain. In adult NCAN KO mice, there are no apparent deficits in brain anatomy, morphology, or ultrastructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Zhou et al., 2001</xref>), which is consistent with our results that the delay in neuronal migration in DKO mice is transient. A recent study reported that the C-terminal portion of NCAN promotes synapse formation during postnatal development, which may be more relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Irala et al., 2023</xref>). These findings suggest that NCAN has different functions in the embryonic and adult brain.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the present study revealed that the assembly of NCAN, HA, and TNC forms the microenvironment in the SP/IZ, in which the multipolar-to-bipolar transition occurs. We uncovered that enzymatic and genetic disruption of the ternary complex impairs radial migration by inhibiting the multipolar-to-bipolar transition. Our findings shed light on the collaborative role of ECM molecules derived from neurons and radial glial cells in cortical development.</p>

<title>Mice used in the present study</title>
<p>All animal experimental studies were conducted with the approval of the Committee on Animal Experiments of the Graduate School of Bioagricultural Sciences, Nagoya University, and Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology. Pregnant ICR (RRID: MGI:5462094) and C57BL/6NCrSlc (RRID: MGI:5295404) mice were purchased from Japan SLC (Shizuoka, Japan). TNC KO mice on a C57BL/6NJcl background were obtained from the RIKEN Bioresource Center (BRC No. RBRC00169)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Nakao et al., 1998</xref>). NCAN KO mice were generated using CRISPR-Cas9-based improved genome editing via oviductal nucleic acids delivery (i-GONAD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gurumurthy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Ohtsuka et al., 2018</xref>). A guide RNA targeting the mouse <italic>Ncan</italic> loci (Mm.Cas9.NCAN.1.AA: 5’-ACCTTAGTCCACTTGATCCGAGG-3’) was chosen from Predesigned Alt-R CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNA on the Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sg.idtdna.com">https://sg.idtdna.com</ext-link>). Synthetic crRNAs, tracrRNA, and Cas9 Nuclease V3 were purchased from IDT. Surgical procedures for i-GONAD were performed under deep anesthesia at approximately 3 pm on the day on which a vaginal plug was detected. A mixture of 30 μM crRNA/tracrRNA complex and 1 mg/mL Cas9 Nuclease V3 was prepared in PBS. Approximately 2.5 μL of the mixture was injected into the oviduct upstream of the ampulla using a glass micropipette. The oviduct was clasped with a paired electrode (CUY652P2.5X4, NEPA Gene). Square electric pulses (poring pulse: 50 V, 5-ms pulse, 50-ms pulse interval, 3 pulses, 10% decay, ± pulse orientation, and transfer pulse: 10 V, 50-ms pulse, 50-ms pulse interval, 3 pulses, 40% decay, ± pulse orientation) were passed using an electroporator (NEPA21, NEPA Gene). Offspring were genotyped by DNA sequencing to identify founder animals. After first mating with TNC KO mice, the F1 generation was sequenced and further crossed to TNC KO mice to obtain DKO mice.</p>

<title>Identification of the 130-kDa band by MALDI-TOF/TOF</title>
<p>Ten E18 mouse brains were homogenized in 10 mL of Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solution (Gibco) containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.6) (Gibco), and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) and incubated on ice for 1 h. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4°C for 30 min, the supernatant was applied to a DEAE-Toyopearl 650 M column (1 mL, Tosoh) equilibrated with buffer A (0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5). The column was washed with buffer A containing 0.25 M NaCl and then eluted with buffer A containing 0.5 M NaCl. The eluent was diluted with a four-fold volume of buffer A and digested with 50 milliunits of chondroitinase ABC (Sikagaku Corp) at 37°C for 4 h. The digest was again applied to a DEAE-Toyopearl 650 M column (0.4 mL) and eluted with buffer A containing 0.25 M NaCl. The eluent was applied to a heparin-agarose column (0.3 mL, Sigma), and the flow-through fraction was collected. After ultrafiltration with the YM-10 membrane (Amicon), the concentrate was separated using 6% SDS-PAGE. After staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, the 130-kDa band was cut out as a gel piece and digested with trypsin (Promega) at 37°C overnight.

The head was clasped with a paired electrode (CUY650P5, NEPA Gene), and square electric pulses (33 V for 50 ms, five times in 950-ms intervals) were passed using an electroporator (NEPA21, NEPA Gene). After electroporation, the uterine horns were placed back into the abdominal cavity to allow further embryonic growth.</p>

<title>Forced expression of GFP-fused NCAN in NCAN KO mice</title>
<p>NCAN KO embryos at E14 were electroporated <italic>in utero</italic> with pCAG-Turbo-RFP alone or with GFP-fused full-length NCAN. Coronal sections (thickness of 80 μm) were prepared 2 days after electroporation and analyzed histochemically to detect TNC and GFP-fused NCAN as described above. The staining intensity of TNC around Turbo-RFP-positive neurons (59 × 59 µm area) was measured using ImageJ FIJI.</p>

<title>Morphological analysis of cortical neurons</title>
<p>Neural progenitor cells in the VZ were transfected with pCAG-mCherry by <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation at E14. After 53 h, coronal sections (thickness of 80 μm) were prepared, and fluorescent images were captured as described above. Using ImageJ FIJI, neuronal morphology was evaluated by measuring the length-to-width ratio of labeled neurons and the angle between major neurites and the ventricle surface. Bipolar neurons were defined as cells with a length-to-width ratio greater than three and an orientation angle greater than 70°. In <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>, we analyzed embryos from different WT and DKO dams to compare neuronal morphology.</p>

<title>Isolation of migrating neurons from the cerebral cortex</title>
<p>GFP labeling followed by cell sorting was performed as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Takechi et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, neural progenitor cells in the VZ of the cerebral cortex at E14 were transfected with pCAG-GFP using <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation as described above. Embryonic brains were harvested 0.6–4 days later, and GFP-positive regions were dissected from the cerebral cortices under a fluorescence stereomicroscope (Leica). Cortical fragments were incubated in 0.25% trypsin and mechanically dispersed by gentle pipetting to dissociate single cells. GFP-positive cells were isolated from the single-cell suspension by sorting using a JSAN fluorescence-activated cell sorter (Bay Bioscience).</p>

<p>Cover glasses were pre-coated with 20 μg/mL poly-L-ornithine (PLO) (Wako) at 37°C overnight and then overlaid with 0.1–10 μg/mL of recombinant human TNC (R&amp;D), recombinant human NCAN (R&amp;D), and HA (600–1200 kDa, PG research) at 37°C for 3 h. WT and NCAN KO brains were harvested 24 h after <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation with pCAG-GFP at E14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mubuchi et al., 2022</xref>). GFP-positive regions were dissected from the cerebral cortices under a fluorescence stereomicroscope (Leica). Cortical fragments were incubated in 20 units/mL papain (Worthington Biochemical Corporation) and mechanically dispersed by gentle pipetting. Dissociated cells were plated on ECM-coated cover glasses at a density of 50,000 or 100,000 cells per well (1.9 mm<sup>2</sup>). Cells were maintained for 1 to 3 days in Neurobasal Plus Medium (Thermo) supplemented with 2% B-27 Plus (Thermo), 5% horse serum (Sigma), and antibiotics (Thermo). Cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with an Alexa 488-conjugated anti-GFP antibody (Thermo) and anti-Tuj-1 (mouse, 1:1000, Sigma), and imaged as described above. For GFP-labeled neurons, processes longer than 10 µm were measured as neurites and analyzed using NeuronJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Meijering et al., 2004</xref>). For neurons stained with anti-Tuj-1 antibody, neurites were analyzed using AutoNeuriteJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Boulan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mubuchi et al., 2022</xref>). Neurons without neurites were classified as stage 1, neurons with neurites shorter than 50 µm as stage 2, and neurons with neurites longer than 50 µm as stage 3. Regarding immunoblotting in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1h</xref> and immunostaining in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>, dissociated cells were plated on PLO-coated cover glasses at 200,000 and 50,000 cells per well, respectively.</p>

<title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title>
<p>All data are presented as the mean ± SD. Statistical analyses were performed using Python within the Jupyter Notebooks environment and Easy R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kanda, 2013</xref>). An unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t-test was used to compare results from two groups. Dunnett’s test was used to compare multiple experimental groups against the control group. A p-value &lt;0.05 was considered to be significant.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In the present study, authors found the ternary complex formed by NCAN, TNC, and HA as an important factor facilitating the multipolar to bipolar transition in the intermediate zone (IZ) of the developing cortex. NCAM binds HA via the N-terminal Link modules, meanwhile, TNC cross-links NCAN through the CDL domain at the C-terminal. The expression and right localization of these three factors facilitate the multipolar-bipolar transition necessary for immature neurons to migrate radially. TNC and NCAM are also involved in neuronal morphology. The authors used a wide range of techniques to study the interaction between these three molecules in the developing cortex. In addition, single and double KO mice for NCAN and TNC were analyzed to decipher the role of these molecules in neuronal migration and morphology.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The study of the formation of the cerebral cortex is crucial to understanding the pathophysiology of many neurodevelopmental disorders associated with malformation of the cerebral cortex. In this study, the authors showed, for the first time, that the ternary complex formed by NCAN, TNC, and HA promotes neuronal migration. The results regarding the interaction between the three factors forming the ternary complex are convincing.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
However, regarding the in vivo experiments, the authors should consider some points for the interpretation of the results:</p>
<p>
-The authors did not use the proper controls in their experiments. For embryonic analysis, such as cortical migration, neuronal morphology, and protein distribution (Fig. 6, 7, and 9), mutant mice should be compared with control littermates, since differences in the results could be due to differences in embryonic stages. For example, in Fig. 6 the dKO is more developed than the WT embryo.</p>
<p>
-The authors claim that NCAM and TNC are involved in neuronal migration from experiments using single KO embryos. This is a strong statement considering the mild results, with no significant difference in the case of TNC KO embryos, and once again, using embryos from different litters.</p>
<p>
-The measurement of immunofluorescence intensity is not the right method to compare the relative amount of protein between control and mutant embryos unless there is a right normalization.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
ECM components are prominent constituents of the pericellular environment of CNS cells and form complex and dynamic interactomes in the pericellular spaces. Based on bioinformatic analysis, more than 300 genes have been attributed to the so-called matrisome, many of which are detectable in the CNS. Yet, not much is known about their functions while increasing evidence suggests important contributions to developmental processes, neural plasticity, and inhibition of regeneration in the CNS. In this respect, the present work offers new insights and adds interesting aspects to the facets of ECM contributions to neural development. This is even more relevant in view of the fact that neurocan has recently been identified as a potential risk gene for neuropsychiatric diseases. Because ECM components occur in the interstitial space and are linked in interactomes their study is very difficult. A strength of the manuscript is that the authors used several approaches to shed light on ECM function, including proteome studies, the generation of knockout mouse lines, and the analysis of in vivo labeled neural progenitors. This multi-perspective approach permitted to reveal hitherto unknown properties of the ECM and highlighted its importance for the overall organization of the CNS.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Systematic analysis of the ternary complex between neurone, TNC, and hyaluronic acid; establishment of KO mouse lines to study the function of the complex, use of in utero electroporation to investigate the impact on neuronal migration;</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The analysis is focused on neuronal progenitors, however, the potential impact of the molecules of interest, in particular, their removal on differentiation and /or survival of neural stem/progenitor cells is not addressed. The potential receptors involved are not considered. It also seems that rather the passage to the outer areas of the forming cortex is compromised, which is not the same as the migration process. The movement of the cells is not included in the analysis.</p>
