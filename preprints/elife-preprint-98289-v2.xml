<title>Abstract</title><p>Most genetic loci associated with complex traits and diseases through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are noncoding, suggesting that the causal variants likely have gene regulatory effects. However, only a small number of loci have been linked to expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) detected currently. To better understand the potential reasons for many trait-associated loci lacking eQTL colocalization, we investigated whether chromatin accessibility QTLs (caQTLs) in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) explain immune-mediated disease associations that eQTLs in LCLs did not. The power to detect caQTLs was greater than that of eQTLs and was less affected by the distance from the transcription start site of the associated gene. Meta-analyzing LCL eQTL data to increase the sample size to over a thousand led to additional loci with eQTL colocalization, demonstrating that insufficient statistical power is still likely to be a factor. Moreover, further eQTL colocalization loci were uncovered by surveying eQTLs of other immune cell types. Altogether, insufficient power and context-specificity of eQTLs both contribute to the ’missing regulation.’</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>More than a decade of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has revealed several properties of the genetic architecture of complex traits and diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Most (∼93%) of the genetic associations are detected in the noncoding portion of the genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, and disease heritability is concentrated in putative regulatory regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), which are loci associated with gene expression levels, are enriched for trait associations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Complex traits are also characterized by their extreme polygenicity, where individual genetic association has only a small effect on the trait<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Altogether, these observations have led to a prevalent theory that causal genetic variants affect regulation of key genes across the genome, where each gene explains a modest proportion of trait variation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. There are experimental strategies aimed at nominating putative causal genes at noncoding GWAS loci<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. As an alternate approach, an eQTL signal colocalizing with the GWAS signal illustrates the effect of the causal variant on gene expression and suggests that the affected gene contributes to the trait. Detection of disease-associated eQTLs thus can identify putative disease genes, helping to elucidate disease mechanisms and develop therapeutics targeting them<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Although it has become expected that eQTLs will be discovered in most noncoding GWAS loci, only a minority of trait-associated loci have been explained by eQTLs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) eQTL study across 49 human tissues recognized that, for a typical complex trait, about 20% of GWAS loci contained a colocalized eQTL in the <italic>cis</italic> region (<italic>i.e.</italic>, 1 Mb) around the gene (<italic>i.e.</italic>, <italic>cis</italic>-eQTL)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Even when focusing just on putatively causal genes, the rate of colocalization was very low (8%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the proportion of trait heritability mediated by <italic>cis</italic>-eQTLs (<italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>med</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>SNP</sub>) of assayed gene expression was estimated to be only about 11% on average<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. We will call the missing link between genetic association to traits and regulatory function of the associated noncoding variants as ‘missing regulation’, as Connally and colleagues introduced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. To be able to detect eQTLs in the unexplained disease-associated loci, a better understanding of the possible reasons for why they have been missing is essential.</p>
<p>There are many possible explanations for why disease-associated loci are missing colocalized eQTLs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> and for why <italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>med</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>SNP</sub> estimates for eQTLs are relatively low<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. First, statistical power to detect disease-associated eQTLs may be insufficient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. For example, negative selection against gene expression variation may lead to challenges in detecting eQTLs for trait-relevant genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Since disease genes are likely to be dosage sensitive, there would be selection against their having large eQTL effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Consequently, the negative selection induces a “flattening” effect, in which weak eQTL variants, often in regions distal to the gene’s promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> may reach high enough frequency, whereas strong eQTL variants remain at low frequency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. In fact, eQTL-mediated heritability was enriched in genes showing mutational constraint and those with lower <italic>cis</italic>-heritability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. These weaker or low-allele-frequency eQTL effects would require larger sample sizes to be detected with statistical significance and to show colocalization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Second, causal eQTL effects may be specific to cell types that have not been assayed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. For example, immune cell eQTLs are highly cell-type specific, and eQTL effects specific to some immune cell types may mediate immune disease risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Specificity of eQTL effects can also be limited to specific cell states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Detecting cell-type or cell-state specific eQTL effects requires the necessary gene expression data sets from the relevant cell types and states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, which has been a limiting resource for such analyses.</p>
<p>To investigate why disease-associated eQTL signals have been missing, we focused on immune-mediate diseases (IMDs) as a model set of complex traits. We aimed to collect IMD-associated loci that are expected to show eQTL signals in some cell type. Since active regulatory elements coordinate target gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, we reasoned that variants that affect chromatin phenotypes at regulatory elements, such as transcription factor (TF) binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> and chromatin accessibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, have the potential to impact gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. These chromatin phenotypes may show detectable genetic effects even when an eQTL effect in the same cell type was not identified in the locus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. For example, only about 20% of lymphoblastoid cell lines’ (LCLs’) PU.1 binding QTLs (bQTLs) that colocalized with blood cell traits’ association showed an eQTL effect for a nearby gene in LCLs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Here, we analyzed genetic and functional genomic (<italic>i.e.</italic>, ATAC-seq and RNA-seq) data in LCLs. LCLs are derived from B lymphocytes, and their <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements were enriched for variants associated with some IMDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. We evaluated whether chromatin accessibility QTLs (caQTLs) in LCLs potentially explain IMD associations using mediated heritability analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> and colocalization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Then, we searched for disease-associated loci that were significant caQTLs, but not eQTLs.</p>
<p>We examined whether the various potential reasons for missing eQTLs can account for IMD-associated loci that are explained by caQTLs but not eQTLs. First, we explored the extent to which eQTLs may have been missed because of limited statistical power. We compared <italic>cis</italic>-heritability of colocalized caQTLs and eQTLs stratified by distance between the accessible region and the transcription start site of the associated gene. We also investigated whether meta-analysis of published LCL eQTL summary statistics, in order to effectively increase the sample size, can uncover previously missed eQTLs. Second, we surveyed whether cell-type specificity of regulatory variant effect may account for the missing regulation. We surveyed various immune cell eQTL data to identify loci with which they colocalize even if LCL eQTLs did not colocalize with those loci.</p>
<p>Through this study, we present how regulatory QTLs beyond eQTLs, such as caQTLs, can be effective in detecting the potential molecular consequences of disease-associated variants. Moreover, results from inspecting disease-associated loci where genetic effects are detected on chromatin accessibility but not on expression suggest reasons why the effects on gene expression may have been missed. These results provide insights on which strategies may be effective in uncovering more genes that underlie diseases.</p>

<title>Accessible chromatin in LCLs explains a significant proportion of immune-mediated disease heritability</title>
<p>We aimed to evaluate whether variants that alter chromatin accessibility in LCLs may explain genetic associations to IMD. First, we verified whether accessible regions in LCLs are enriched for IMD heritability. We reanalyzed 100 LCL ATAC-seq samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> to define accessible regions in this cell type. With stratified LD score regression (S-LDSC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, we estimated their heritability enrichment across 13 IMDs, including 11 autoimmune diseases — autoimmune thyroid disease (ATD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, celiac disease (CEL)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, Crohn’s disease (CD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, multiple sclerosis (MS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, primary biliary cholangitis (PBC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, rheumatoid arthritis (RA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, ulcerative colitis (UC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, and vitiligo (VIT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> — and 2 allergic diseases — allergy (ALL)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> and asthma (AST)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. We also analyzed GWAS data for 3 non-immune diseases — type 2 diabetes (T2D)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>, coronary artery disease (CAD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> and schizophrenia (SCZ)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> — for comparison. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in accessible regions in LCLs were significantly enriched for IMD heritability (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.003125 (Bonferroni-corrected), S-LDSC; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) and there was no significant enrichment for non-immune diseases (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05, S-LDSC). These results indicate that accessible regions in LCLs harbor many variants specifically associated with IMDs, and therefore that LCLs share IMD-associated accessible regions with those of the causal cell type(s).</p>

<p>Next, we applied mediated expression score regression (MESC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> to investigate the causal relationship between caQTLs in LCLs and IMD associations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>). Compared to S-LDSC analysis that tests for heritability enrichment of SNPs with some functional annotation (<italic>e.g.</italic>, accessible regions), MESC analysis specifically estimates the heritability that is mediated (<italic>i.e.</italic>, <italic>h<sup>2</sup><sub>med</sub></italic>) by the SNPs’ <italic>cis</italic>-effects on a molecular phenotype (<italic>e.g.</italic>, caQTLs). We estimated that caQTLs in LCLs mediate 16.3–42.7 % of autoimmune disease heritability and 8.5–9.4 % of allergic disease heritability (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). For non-immune diseases, the estimates were lower and not significant (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.003125 (Bonferroni-corrected), MESC). Interestingly, schizophrenia showed a nominally significant proportion of caQTL-mediated heritability in LCLs (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, MESC), consistent with the hypothesis that B cells may play some role in schizophrenia pathogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Our results indicate that LCLs are a valid cell type in which to search for caQTLs that mediate genetic risk for 7 IMDs — CD, IBD, MS, PBC, RA, SLE, and UC — but not for allergic diseases. In subsequent analyses, we focused on 7 IMDs – CD, IBD, MS, PBC, RA, SLE, and UC – that showed significant caQTL-mediated heritability (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.003125 (Bonferroni- corrected), MESC).</p>

<title>Regions with higher levels of accessibility and active histone marks explain most of caQTL-mediated heritability</title>
<p>To understand which features characterize accessible regions that mediate IMD heritability, we estimated <italic>h<sup>2</sup><sub>med</sub></italic> enrichment (proportion of <italic>h<sup>2</sup><sub>med</sub></italic> / proportion of peaks)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> in specific sets of accessible regions. We found that peaks with a larger number of nonredundant sequencing reads (<italic>i.e.</italic>, “stronger” peaks) in LCLs showed stronger <italic>h<sup>2</sup><sub>med</sub></italic> enrichment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) and thus likely affect IMD-relevant gene expression more than “weaker” peaks do. This observation is consistent with the “Activity-by-Contact” model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, in which peaks with greater chromatin accessibility and H3K27ac ChIP-seq signal are predicted to have proportional effects on target gene expression.</p>
<p>Next, we considered peaks with the active histone marks H3K27ac, H3K4me1, or H3K4me3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Consistent with prior observations that putative cell-type-specific regulatory elements marked with H3K27ac and H3K4me1 are enriched for relevant disease associations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, we found that caQTLs with H3K27ac and H3K4me1 marks in LCLs were significantly enriched for mediated IMD heritability (q-value &lt; 0.05, MESC; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Strikingly, both peak sets explained almost all of caQTL-mediated IMD heritability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>).

These ‘ATAC only’ peaks were shorter, weaker, and further away from the TSS compared to peaks with active histone marks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). Altogether, these results indicate that peaks characterized as putatively active regulatory elements explain nearly all of caQTL-mediated IMD heritability.</p>

<title>caQTLs share IMD heritability with eQTLs and explain more of IMD heritability than do eQTLs</title>

A possible explanation is that some IMD-associated regulatory variants may show detectable effects on chromatin accessibility, but not on gene expression, in LCLs at the current sample size (<italic>n</italic> = 373); such loci may account for the missing regulation.</p>

<p>We anticipated that IMD-associated variants that affect gene expression in <italic>cis</italic> do so by modulating regulatory element’s activity. Therefore, we investigated whether eQTL-mediated IMD heritability is shared by caQTL-mediated signals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>).

<title>Many IMD-associated loci show colocalization with caQTLs but not with eQTLs</title>
<p>We applied colocalization analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> to identify IMD-associated loci that share genetic signals with caQTLs or eQTLs in LCLs. We selected candidate loci of 200-kb windows for each IMD with the following conditions: (1) lead IMD association at <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>-6</sup>, (2) lead caQTL or eQTL association at <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>-4</sup>, and (3) at least one variant simultaneously showed caQTL or eQTL χ<sup>2</sup> statistics greater than 0.8 × lead χ<sup>2</sup> statistics for the caQTL or eQTL, respectively, and IMD association χ<sup>2</sup> statistics greater than 0.8 × χ<sup>2</sup> statistics for the IMD lead variant in the locus. We applied gwas-pw<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> and considered loci with posterior probability of colocalization (PPA3) &gt; 0.98 to be colocalized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Some loci colocalized with only either a caQTL or an eQTL, while others colocalized with both (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary Tables 1-2</xref>).</p>
<p>We investigated which proteins might be interacting with the colocalized caQTL peaks using Cistrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. We tested for overlap of the colocalized caQTL peak regions with ChIP-seq peaks detecting diverse proteins in immune-related cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Consistent with the enriched mediated heritability in accessible regions with active histone marks (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>), proteins that are most often detected at the colocalized accessible regions are those related to RNA transcription (POL2RA and MED1), chromatin remodeling (EP300, BRD4, SMARCA4, and MTA2) or immune cell transcription factors (IKZF1, RUNX3, SPI1, RELA, RUNX1, and EBF1) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). Interestingly, TRIM28, which functions as a repressor, was one of the most overlapping protein factors.</p>
<p>To confirm that the colocalized genes are relevant to IMD, we tested for their enrichment of Gene Ontology (GO) annotation terms for specific biological processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Considering all genes within 500 kb of the IMD GWAS lead variants at colocalized loci as background, the genes that showed eQTL colocalization for any IMD were enriched for various immune responses and signaling processes, such as “positive regulation of immune system process” and “regulation of lymphocyte activation” (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>), indicating that the colocalized genes in LCLs are involved in immune function. For example, <italic>IL6R</italic> and <italic>IL12A</italic> encode direct or indirect targets of approved drugs – Tocilizumab and Ustekinumab – for autoimmune diseases like RA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> and CD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. These two genes showed colocalization with both caQTLs and eQTLs in CD and PBC GWAS, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 7A-B</xref>). Increased <italic>IL6R</italic> expression was associated with higher risk for CD, and increased <italic>IL12A</italic> expression was associated with lower risk for PBC and SLE. The former observation is in line with Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody to IL-6 receptor, showing efficacy in CD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>, although it is not pursued for approval because of potential side effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Interestingly, <italic>IL6R</italic> and <italic>IL12A</italic> eQTLs did not colocalize with the association signals of RA and CD, respectively, which are the diseases for which these drugs are approved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 7C-D</xref>). Moreover, <italic>ELMO1</italic>, which previously had not been associated with autoimmune diseases, showed eQTL colocalization with RA, PBC, and MS association signals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). In all three, decreased <italic>ELMO1</italic> expression was associated with increased disease risk. In mice, <italic>Elmo1</italic> was required for polarization and migration of B and T lymphocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Across the IMDs, there were many loci that colocalized with a caQTL but not with an eQTL (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).

<title>Distance to transcription start sites affect eQTLs but not caQTLs</title>
<p>Why might there be loci with caQTL colocalization only, despite the caQTL data having fewer samples than the eQTL data (100 vs. 373)? Limited statistical power can prevent some eQTLs from being detected and showing significant colocalization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. As hypothesized by Mostafavi and colleagues, disease-relevant eQTLs may be weaker and more distal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. To understand the extent to which this effect may result in many loci showing colocalization only with caQTLs, we compared the <italic>cis</italic>-heritability (<italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>cis</sub>) of caQTLs and eQTLs depending on the distance from the ATAC peak to the transcription start site (TSS) of the gene (<italic>i.e.</italic>, peak-to-TSS distance). We considered all caQTLs and eQTLs regardless of disease association.</p>
<p>We identified pairs of caQTLs and eQTLs that colocalized with each other<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, which implies that the regulatory variant modulating chromatin accessibility also affects gene expression. Then, the distance between the ATAC peak and the TSS of the eQTL gene (<italic>i.e.</italic>, eGene) is the distance between a regulatory element and its target gene’s TSS. We stratified the pairs into peak-to-TSS distance quintiles and compared the eQTL <italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>cis</sub> distribution of the first quintile (<italic>i.e.</italic>, closest pairs) with that of the later quintiles. We observed that eQTL <italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>cis</sub> distribution decreased with increasing distance of the paired ATAC peaks from the TSS (<italic>p</italic> = 1.0×10<sup>-4</sup>, 2.1×10<sup>-10</sup>, 1.6×10<sup>-15</sup>, and 1.7×10<sup>-20</sup>, respectively, one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), consistent with the negative relationship between promoter-enhancer genomic distance and impact on gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. This result also explains why discovered eQTLs are concentrated near the promoter, where the variants are more likely to show stronger effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. In contrast, caQTL <italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>cis</sub> distribution was similar across peak-to-TSS distances (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05, one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). For all distance quintiles, caQTL <italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>cis</sub> was significantly higher than that of the paired eQTLs (p = 4.0×10<sup>-23</sup>, 1.3×10<sup>-24</sup>, 1.5×10<sup>-19</sup>, 1.1×10<sup>-28</sup>, and 2.4×10<sup>-49</sup>, respectively, one-sided paired Wilcoxon rank-sum test; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), and the contrast between them was greater at more distant quintiles, suggesting that the statistical power to detect and colocalize eQTLs is increasingly lower than that for caQTLs for regulatory effects far from the TSS.</p>

</fig>
<p>Overall, caQTL <italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>cis</sub> had a significant positive effect (<italic>p</italic> = 6.6×10<sup>-11</sup>, linear regression) and peak-to-TSS distance had a negative effect (<italic>p</italic> = 2.4×10<sup>-23</sup>, linear regression) on eQTL <italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>cis</sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Thus, for regulatory variants that showed both caQTL and eQTL signals, those with larger effects on chromatin accessibility tended to exhibit larger effects on gene expression, but their eQTL effects diminished with increasing distance from TSSs.</p>
<p>Next, we investigated how caQTL-mediated IMD heritability is distributed with respect to TSS. If caQTLs beyond the typical <italic>cis</italic>-eQTL window of 1 megabase (Mb) around the genes’ TSS explain some proportion of IMD heritability, then <italic>cis</italic>-eQTL analyses might require a wider window to detect disease-associated eQTLs. Across the 7 diseases, caQTLs within 500 kb of the TSS of expressed genes explained almost all of the caQTL-mediated IMD heritability (92–100%; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating that regulatory variants are most likely within 500 kb of the target gene’s TSS and supporting the use of a 1 Mb window for <italic>cis</italic>-eQTL analyses. Depending on the disease, 41–66% of the caQTL-mediated IMD heritability was detected in distal peaks further than 10 kb from the TSS of expressed genes, further supporting the analysis of regulatory variants beyond promoter regions.</p>
<p>In sum, the power to detect eQTLs diminishes with increasing distance of the variant from the TSS, but the power to detect caQTLs is largely invariant regardless of peak-to-TSS distance (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Since <italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>med; caQTL</sub> are distributed mostly within 500 kb of genes’ TSS, the IMD loci colocalizing only with caQTLs could still be weak, undetected eQTLs. Under this model, we predicted that increasing the power to detect eQTLs in LCLs, such as increasing sample size, may lead to further eQTL colocalizations in loci in which we observed only caQTL colocalization.</p>

<title>Increasing the sample size reveals some eQTL colocalization</title>
<p>For genetic association studies, increasing the sample size is a way to increase statistical power.

We performed colocalization analysis using the meta-analyzed summary statistics to evaluate whether effectively increasing the sample sizes would uncover more disease-associated eQTLs in LCLs, especially in loci where a caQTL already showed IMD colocalization.

<p>We hypothesized that increased sample size would improve the power to detect weaker and distal eQTL colocalization.

However, compared to the distribution of the peak-to-TSS distance for all caQTL-eQTL pairs showing colocalization, IMD-associated loci that showed caQTL and eQTL colocalization had greater peak-to-TSS distance on average (<italic>p</italic> = 0.002 for Geuvadis and <italic>p</italic> = 5.9×10<sup>-6</sup> for the meta-analyzed data; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>).

<title>IMD loci that colocalized with caQTLs but not eQTLs showed lower levels of active histone marks</title>

We investigated whether these “caQTL only” peaks might be inactive regulatory elements. We quantified the active histone mark levels for H3K27ac, H3K4me1, and H3K4me3 at colocalized caQTL peaks in LCLs and then compared their levels between the “caQTL and eQTL” and “caQTL only” loci. On average, H3K27ac marks were stronger at “caQTL and eQTL” peaks, supporting that the corresponding regulatory elements might be more active (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>). H3K4me3 marks were detected more often at “caQTL and eQTL” peaks, leading to stronger average signal. In contrast, H3K4me1 levels were highly similar between the two sets of peaks. Although “caQTL only” peaks generally showed lower levels of active histone marks, several individual “caQTL only” peaks showed comparable levels. These peaks could be inactive <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements in LCLs that affect gene expression in a different cellular context.

<p>We investigated the potential reasons why IMD loci that colocalized with caQTLs in LCLs showed eQTLs not in LCLs but in other immune cells. First, LCL caQTLs may correspond to gene regulatory elements that exert their effects on gene expression in a different cellular context. For instance, monocyte H3K27ac levels in the “caQTL only” loci where monocyte eQTLs colocalized were higher than those with no monocyte eQTLs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>). Second, some examples, such as for <italic>TNFSF15</italic>, were due to cell-type specific gene expression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>): despite a significant colocalization of IBD with a caQTL in LCLs in the <italic>TNFSF15</italic> locus, disease-associated eQTL signal was detected only in monocytes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Tumor necrosis factor-like cytokine 1A (TL1A), the protein encoded by <italic>TNFSF15</italic>, is secreted by monocytes and many other cells to activate helper T cells, regulatory T cells, and B cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>. <italic>TNFSF15</italic> expression was low in LCLs (mean transcript per million [TPM] = 0.30), but higher in monocytes (mean TPM = 2.23). Of the genes that showed exclusively monocyte eQTL colocalization, those with low expression (mean TPM &lt; 1) in LCLs generally showed higher expression in monocytes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B-C</xref>). However, low expression in LCLs was likely not the explanation for most cases of “monocyte only” eQTLs (blue points in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>) because most “monocyte only” eQTL genes were expressed at level higher than 1 TPM in LCLs.</p>

<p>Overall, expanding the eQTL search to various immune cell types increased the number of eQTL-colocalized loci among those that previously colocalized only with caQTLs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). On average, approximately 75% of the caQTL-colocalized loci ultimately showed eQTL colocalization. These results highlight the utility of eQTL data across a range of immune cell types for discovery of IMD-associated eQTLs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A lack of the link between many noncoding GWAS loci to the associated variants’ gene regulatory effects have posed challenges in understanding their genetic mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Various hypotheses have been presented, including disease genes showing more complex gene regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>, context specificity of gene regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, and a combination of both, due to selective constraints against damaging eQTLs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. A better evaluation of the potential reasons for the missing regulation will guide future data generation projects to elucidate disease-associated loci. To determine why some loci might lack colocalized eQTLs, we focused on chromatin accessibility, which is a molecular phenotype affected by regulatory variants more directly than are eQTLs. We approached this question with mediated heritability analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> and colocalization analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We found that caQTLs in LCLs mediate a significant proportion of heritability for many autoimmune diseases. In contrast, LCLs did not appear to be an effective cell type to model gene regulatory effects in allergic diseases. The <italic>h<sup>2</sup><sub>med</sub></italic> / <italic>h<sup>2</sup><sub>SNP</sub></italic> estimates for caQTLs were higher than those of eQTLs in most autoimmune diseases, even though the smaller sample size of caQTL data (<italic>i.e.</italic>, 100 vs. 373) could bias caQTLs’ estimates toward zero<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. We also showed that disease-associated chromatin accessibility effects often share the genetic signal with gene expression effects but that there are also many loci without an eQTL detected in LCLs.</p>
<p>By focusing on disease-associated caQTL that lacked significant eQTLs, we explored how additional colocalized eQTL effects could be uncovered. First, increasing the sample sizes for the eQTL statistics via meta-analysis demonstrated that more eQTL colocalizations can be detected with increased statistical power and robustness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that disease-associated eQTLs are typically weaker and distal due to negative selection against large expression changes for causal genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Second, many caQTLs in LCLs without eQTLs in LCLs showed eQTL colocalization in other immune cell types. Context specificity of eQTLs has been widely considered to be the primary explanation for the difficulty of pinpointing disease-associated eQTLs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. Our observation that many IMD-colocalized caQTLs in LCLs show eQTLs in other immune cell types suggests that caQTL effects may be shared across cell types whereas eQTL effects are more context-specific<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. If a shared set of transcription factors are expressed in similar yet distinct cell types, like the immune cells, genetic variants affecting their DNA binding would affect chromatin accessibility similarly. On the other hand, regulation of gene expression is a result of multiple regulatory elements, each binding multiple transcription factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>, so the measured effect of a regulatory variant on gene expression likely depends much more on the cellular context. In such cases, eQTL data for the specific cellular contexts need to be generated in future studies to uncover genetic signal shared with a complex trait or disease. All in all, our results suggest that both increasing the sample size and generating gene expression data from more relevant cellular contexts would be useful strategies for discovering more disease-associated eQTLs.</p>
<p>Finally, we demonstrated that caQTLs can reveal the regulatory variant effect of disease-associated variants that may have been difficult to detect with eQTLs, particularly in TSS-distal regions. Although caQTLs cannot directly identify the target gene or the causal cellular context, we anticipate that integrated analyses can improve the power to detect weaker eQTL signals, as multi-trait GWAS analyses have shown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup>. Moreover, integrating multiple molecular QTL data, like transcription factor binding QTLs and histone mark QTLs, may highlight the regulatory elements associated with the GWAS phenotype, which may ultimately contribute to identifying the causal gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Therefore, we anticipate that generation of data across the various molecular phenotypes upstream of gene expression for QTL analyses will be informative.</p>
<sec id="s4">
<title>Limitations of the study</title>
<p>The <italic>h<sup>2</sup><sub>med</sub></italic> / <italic>h<sup>2</sup><sub>SNP</sub></italic> estimates can be biased because of insufficient sample size of the QTL data. Thus, the proportion of mediated IMD heritability could change based on the specific caQTL and eQTL data. Colocalization analysis tests whether the QTL and GWAS data likely share genetic signal, and such shared signal could arise from either causal mediation or pleiotropy. Therefore, further experiments are needed to establish causality of colocalized eQTL genes. Lastly, we hypothesized that caQTL effects are often shared across cell types, but we did not have access to relevant data to test this hypothesis.</p>

<title>ATAC-seq data processing and peak calling</title>
<p>We downloaded LCL ATAC-seq data of British (GBR) samples (n = 100) from European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under accession ERP110508<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. The available files were cram alignment files mapped to the b37 reference genome, so we extracted unique read pairs using SAMtools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup> and bamtofastq command from bedtools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup>. The reads were paired-end and each 75 base pairs (bp) long. The data contained reads with Nextera transposase adapters, so we removed the adapter sequences and bases of poor quality at the 3’ end using cutadapt. Trimmed reads with both pairs shorter than 20 bp were discarded. The command was “cutadapt -a file:${forward} -A file:${reverse} -e 0.25 -j 2 -q 15 --pair-filter=both -m 20”. (${forward} and ${reverse} files contain the forward and reverse Nextera transposase adapters). We mapped the reads to the GRCh38 reference genome using Bowtie 2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup> with the “GRCh38_noalt_decoy_as” index provided on the tool’s website. The command was “bowtie2 --very-sensitive --no-mixed --no-discordant -I 20 -X 2000”. We kept only read alignments with mapping quality greater than 1. We also removed reads aligning to the mitochondrial genome, those overlapping ENCODE exclusion regions (file ID: ENCFF356LFX)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup> and potential PCR duplicates using scripts from WASP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To represent peaks across the samples, we subsampled 3 million read pairs from each and pooled them. Then, we used MACS2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup> with the BAMPE option for peak calling. The command was “macs2 callpeak -f BAMPE -g hs -q 0.05”. We further used the ‘bdgcmp’ and ‘bdgpeakcall’ subcommand to find peaks that are at least 100 bp long (-l) and merge those that are less than 100 bp apart (-g). We also merged peaks similarly derived from individual samples using the ‘merge’ command in bedtools.</p>
<p>Furthermore, for the sake of comprehensiveness, we repeated these steps with LCL ATAC-seq data of Yoruban (YRI) samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup> and merged the peaks with the earlier peak set derived from GBR samples. In total, there were 443,403 peaks genome-wide.</p>

To visualize the distribution of <italic>cis</italic>-heritability estimates, we grouped pairs of colocalized caQTLs and eQTLs based on peak-to-TSS distance quintiles.</p>

<title>LCL eQTL meta-analysis</title>
<p>We downloaded LCL eQTL data from 3 studies through eQTL Catalogue release 6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref></sup>. The sample sizes were 190, 147, and 418 for GENCORD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>, GTEx<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>, and TwinsUK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>, respectively. We meta-analyzed the summary statistics using the inverse variance weighted fixed effects model. If a variant was missing in a subset of the studies, then only the available statistics were meta-analyzed. We used these meta-analyzed statistics to perform colocalization the same way as earlier colocalization analyses.</p>

<title>Colocalization analysis with immune cell eQTL data</title>
<p>We downloaded eQTL data for various immune cell types from the eQTL Catalogue release 6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref></sup>. The source studies from the eQTL Catalogue include BLUEPRINT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>, DICE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, Alasoo <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> and Bossini-Castillo <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. The represented immune cell types include T cell subtypes, B cells, neutrophils, and monocytes. We also separately downloaded data for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with and without stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. The selection of candidate loci and colocalization analysis on them followed the same procedure as that for other QTLs.</p>
<p>We also evaluated whether meta-analysis of eQTL data can increase the number of loci with eQTL colocalization. We meta-analyzed eQTL data for 3 immune cell types with multiple sources – naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell, monocyte, and memory regulatory T cell (Treg) – using the inverse variance weighted fixed effects model. Specifically, we meta-analyzed naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell eQTL summary statistics from Soskic <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>, BLUEPRINT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>, and DICE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. We meta-analyzed monocyte eQTL summary statistics from BLUEPRINT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup> and DICE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. We meta-analyzed memory Treg eQTL summary statistics from Bossini-Castillo <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup> and DICE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>.

<p>Most human traits and common diseases are polygenic, influenced by numerous genetic variants across the genome. These variants are typically non-coding and likely function through gene regulatory mechanisms. To identify their target genes, one strategy is to examine if these variants are also found among genetic variants with detectable effects on gene expression levels, known as eQTLs. Surprisingly, this strategy has had limited success, and most disease variants are not identified as eQTLs, a puzzling observation recently referred to as &quot;missing regulation&quot;.</p>
<p>In this work, Jeong and Bulyk aimed to better understand the reasons behind the gap between disease-associated variants and eQTLs. They focused on immune-related diseases and used lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) as a surrogate for the cell types mediating the genetic effects. Their main hypothesis is that some variants without eQTL evidence might be identifiable by studying other molecular intermediates along the path from genotype to phenotype. They specifically focused on variants that affect chromatin accessibility, known as caQTLs, as a potential marker of regulatory activity.</p>
<p>The authors present data analyses supporting this hypothesis: several disease-associated variants are explained by caQTLs but not eQTLs. They further show that although caQTLs and eQTLs likely have largely overlapping underlying genetic variants, some variants are discovered only through one of these mapping strategies. Notably, they demonstrate that eQTL mapping is underpowered for gene-distal variants with small effects on gene expression, whereas caQTL mapping is not dependent on the distance to genes. Additionally, for some disease variants with caQTLs but no corresponding eQTLs in LCLs, they identify eQTLs in other cell types.</p>
<p>Altogether, Jeong and Bulyk convincingly demonstrate that for immune-related diseases, discovering the missing disease-eQTLs requires both larger eQTL studies and a broader range of cell types in expression assays. It remains to be seen what fractions of the missing disease-eQTLs will be discovered with either strategy and whether these results can be extended to other diseases or traits.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the problem of &quot;missing regulation&quot; has been investigated and discussed in several recent papers, notably Umans et al., Trends in Genetics 2021; Connally et al., eLife 2022; Mostafavi et al., Nat. Genet. 2023. The results reported by Jeong and Bulyk are not unexpected in light of this previous work (all of which they cite), but they add valuable empirical evidence that mostly aligns with the model and discussions presented in Mostafavi et al.</p>

<p>eQTLs have emerged as a method for interpreting GWAS signals. However, some GWAS signals are difficult to explain with eQTLs. In this paper, the authors demonstrated that caQTLs can explain these signals. This suggests that for GWAS signals to actually lead to disease phenotypes, they must be accessible in the chromatin. This implies that for GWAS signals to translate into disease phenotypes, they need to be accessible within the chromatin.</p>
<p>However, fundamentally, caQTLs, like GWAS, have the limitation of not being able to determine which genes mediate the influence on disease phenotypes. This limitation is consistent with the constraints observed in this study.</p>
<p>(1) Reproducibility / Methods. The concrete numbers provided in the authors' response (e.g., 20 YRI LCL ATAC‑seq samples used only for peak discovery; caQTL mapping restricted to 100 GBR LCLs; 99,320 ATAC peaks tested vs 14,872 genes for eQTL; 373 European RNA‑seq samples, with clarification of overlap) do not appear to be reflected in the Methods. These specifics should be incorporated directly into the Methods sections.</p>
<p>(2) Experimental evidence demonstrating transcription factor binding at representative caQTL peaks would strengthen causal interpretation of these loci.</p>
<p>(3) Tissue/cell‑type specificity of caQTLs: Prior work supports that chromatin‑level effects are broadly shared across cellular states, whereas expression effects are more context‑specific; thus, caQTLs are generally less &quot;state‑specific&quot; than eQTLs. However, this does not imply equivalence across distinct cell types: caQTLs derived from different cell types may yield different results, particularly where accessibility is cell‑type restricted.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for their positive review of our results and manuscript. As Reviewer #1 noted, whether our and others' observation extends to other diseases or traits is an open question. For instance, Figure 2b in Mostafavi et al., Nat. Genet. (2023) demonstrated that there was a spectrum of depletion of eQTLs and enrichment of GWAS signals in constrained genes across various tissues and traits, respectively. Therefore, gene expression constraint may play a larger or smaller role in different diseases or traits. That immune cell types and cell states are extremely diverse (Schmiedel et al., Cell (2018) and Calderon et al., Nat. Genet. (2019), just to name a few) likely adds to the complexity of gene regulation that contributes to immune-mediated disease.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) For reproducibility, details are necessary in the method section.</p>
<p>Details about adding YRI samples in ATAC-seq: For example, how many samples are there, and what is used among public data? There is LCL-derived iPSC and differentiated iPSC (cardiomyocytes) data, not LCL itself. How does this differ from LCL, and what is the rationale for including this data despite the differences?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Banovich et al., Genome Research (2018) (PMID: 29208628), who generated data using LCLderived iPSCs and differentiated iPSCs (cardiomyocytes), also generated ATAC-seq data from 20 YRI LCL samples. We analyzed those data to identify open chromatin regions (i.e., ATACseq peaks) in LCLs and merged the regions with open chromatin regions identified with 100 GBR LCL samples from two studies by Kumasaka et al. (Nature Genetics (2016)</p>
<p>PMID: 26656845 and Nature Genetics (2019) PMID: 30478436). However, we restricted the caQTL analysis to only the 100 GBR samples because of possible ancestry effects and batch effects. We attempted caQTL analysis with the 20 YRI samples as well, but the result was noisy, likely due to smaller sample size and lower read depth of the ATAC-seq data.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>caQTL is described as having better power than eQTL despite having fewer samples. How does the number of ATAC peaks used in caQTL compare to the number of gene expressions used in eQTL?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The number of ATAC peaks used in caQTL (99,320) is ~6.7 times greater than the number of genes (14,872) used in the eQTL analysis. Therefore, there is a higher chance of detecting a significant caQTL signal and a significant colocalization signal than there is for eQTLs. However, we reasoned that since distal eQTLs are more easily detected as caQTLs and since increasing the sample size of eQTLs through meta-analysis uncovered additional eQTL colocalization at loci with caQTL colocalization only, colocalized caQTLs are likely capturing disease-relevant regulatory effects.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Details about RNA expression data: In the method section, it states that raw data (ERP001942) was accessed, and in data availability, processed data (E-GEUV-1) was used. These need to be consistent.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. We used the processed data from Expression Atlas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-GEUV-1/Results">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-GEUV-1/Results</ext-link>), and that's what we meant by &quot;We downloaded RNA expression level data of the LCL samples from the Expression Atlas.&quot; We have revised the “RNA expression data preparation” section in our manuscript to make the text clearer.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>How many samples were used (the text states 373, but how was it reduced from the original 465, and the total genotype is said to be 493 samples while ATAC has n=100; what are the 20 others?), and it mentions European samples, but does this exclude YRI?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out these points of confusion. Our reported count of 493 samples included YRI samples with RNA-seq data or ATAC-seq data that we ultimately did not use for QTL analyses. There were 373 European samples with RNA-seq data that we used for eQTL analysis, and 100 GBR samples (including some that overlap with the 373 European samples) that we used for caQTL analysis. We have revised the text to clarify these points.</p>

<p>(2) Experimental results determining which TFs might bind to the representative signals of caQTL are required.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that caQTL colocalization is just the start of elucidating the regulatory mechanism of a GWAS locus. Determining which TFs are bound and which TFs' binding is altered would be necessary to describe the causal regulatory mechanism. For this, we utilized the Cistrome database to search for TFs whose binding overlaps the colocalized caQTL peaks. We present the results of this analysis in Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Figure 4, both of which we have added in our revised manuscript. Overall, protein factors associated with active transcription, such as POL2RA, and several immune cell TFs, including RUNX3, SPI1, and RELA, were frequently detected in those peaks. Detecting these factors in most peaks supports the likelihood that the colocalized caQTL peaks are active cis-regulatory elements. These results are consistent with our observation of enriched caQTL-mediated heritability in regions with active histone marks (Figure 1).</p>

<p>(3) It is stated that caQTL is less tissue-specific compared to eQTL; would caQTL performed with ATAC-seq results from different cell types, yield similar results?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the question. Calderon et al. (PMID: 31570894) observed that &quot;most effects on allelic imbalance (of ATAC-seq) were shared regardless of lineage or condition&quot;. Yet, there were regions where a different cell type or state would show inaccessibility (Figure 4d in Calderon et al.). Thus, we expect that ATAC-seq results from different cell types (e.g., T cells, B cells, monocytes, etc.) would lead to additional caQTLs showing colocalization at cell-typespecific open chromatin. However, if a region is accessible in both cell types, caQTL may be detected in both. Moreover, Alasoo et al., Nature Genetics (2018) (PMID: 29379200) observed that “many disease-risk variants affect chromatin structure in a broad range of cellular states, but their effects on expression are highly context specific.” In both studies, the authors investigated immune cell types, and there could be different observations in non-immune cell types and other diseases and traits.</p>

<p>I think it would strengthen the paper to explore gene-level differences in the discovery of caQTLs and eQTLs. For example, complex disease-relevant genes, on average, have more/longer regulatory domains (as shown by Wang and Goldstein, AJHG 2020; Mostafavi et al., Nat. Genet. 2023). Therefore, it is plausible that for such genes, caQTLs are much more easily discoverable than eQTLs due to (i) a larger mutational target size for caQTLs, and (ii) dispersion of expression heritability across multiple domains, which hampers the discovery of eQTLs but not caQTLs, which are studied independently of other domains in the region. In other words, discovered caQTLs and eQTLs likely vary in terms of their distance to genes (as the authors report), as well as their target genes.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion to explore gene-level differences. We expect that the effects of complex disease-relevant genes having more / longer regulatory domains, on average, to explain our observations. We agree on both of your points that there are many more regulatory elements that are captured as accessible regions than expressed genes and that genes often have multiple independent eQTLs leading to dispersion of heritability. The genelevel trend that we described was the distance of the regulatory element from the genes. Additional analyses would be a relevant future direction.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Also considering gene-level analysis, Mostafavi et al. show that the types of biases they report for eQTLs also apply to other molecular QTLs. It would be valuable to compare GWAS hits with versus without caQTL colocalization. Similarly, it would be insightful to compare GWAS hits with both colocalized caQTLs and eQTLs to GWAS hits with colocalized caQTLs but no eQTLs in any of the cell types.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. Investigating for potential biases in the colocalized caQTL would be useful, but we considered it beyond the scope of this work. In terms of biological factors, we demonstrated through mediated heritability analyses that more accessible chromatin (based on ATAC-seq read coverage) and regions with active histone marks were enriched for autoimmune disease associations (Figure 1). Furthermore, as greater distance of the regulatory variant from the transcription start site significantly reduced the cis-heritability, we would expect that distance would play a major role, similar to Mostafavi et al.’s conclusions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I don't think the argument for the role of natural selection contributing to the &quot;missing regulation&quot; is presented accurately. Specifically, large eQTLs acting on top trait-relevant genes are under stronger selection and thus, on average, segregate at lower frequencies. This makes them difficult to discover in eQTL assays. However, if not lost, they contribute as much, if not more, to trait heritability than weaker eQTLs at the same gene because their larger effects compensate for their lower frequency. At the most extreme, selection should have a &quot;flattening&quot; effect (e.g., see Simons et al., PLOS Biol 2018; O'Connor et al., AJHG 2019): weak and strong eQTLs at the same gene are expected to contribute equally to heritability. Therefore, the statement &quot;Consequently, only weak eQTL variants, often in regions distal to the gene's promoter, may remain and affect traits&quot; is not correct. If this turns out to be empirically true, other models, such as pleiotropic selection, need to explain it.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for the correction. We agree with the comment and have revised the sentences in the introduction accordingly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It is worth speculating why caQTLs may be more consistent across cell types than cis-eQTLs. Additionally, readers may infer from the paper that the focus should shift from eQTLs to caQTLs, which may not be the authors' intention. Perhaps these approaches are complementary: caQTLs can help with TSS-distal disease variants, while finding the target gene and regulatory context is more straightforward with eQTL colocalization. Addressing these points in the discussion will be helpful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's suggestion to clarify the advantages of incorporating cis-eQTLs and caQTLs. Our argument is exactly as you put it, and we added a paragraph on this in the Discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I believe the authors could do more to contextualize their findings within the existing literature on the subject, particularly Umans et al., Trends in Genetics 2021; Connally et al., eLife 2022; and Mostafavi et al., Nat. Genet. 2023. For instance, Umans et al. suggest that &quot;if most standard eQTLs are generally benign, increasing sample size and adding more tissue types in an effort to identify even more standard eQTLs may not help us to explain many more disease risk mutations&quot;. Conversely, Mostafavi et al. argue for a multipronged approach, which appears more aligned with the authors' conclusions.</p>
