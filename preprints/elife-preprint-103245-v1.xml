<title>Abstract</title><sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) antagonists may improve both acute stroke outcome and long-term recovery. Despite their evaluation in ongoing clinical trials, gaps remain in the evidence supporting their use.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>With a panel of patients with lived experiences of stroke, we performed a systematic review of animal models of stroke that administered a CCR5 antagonist and assessed infarct size or behavioral outcomes. MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Embase were searched. Article screening and data extraction were completed in duplicate. We pooled outcomes using random effects meta-analyses. We assessed risk of bias using the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) tool and alignment with the Stroke Treatment Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) and Stroke Recovery and Rehabilitation Roundtable (SRRR) recommendations.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>Five studies representing 10 experiments were included. CCR5 antagonists reduced infarct volume (standard mean difference â1.02; 95% confidence interval â1.58 to â0.46) when compared to stroke-only controls. Varied timing of CCR5 administration (pre- or post-stroke induction) produced similar benefit. CCR5 antagonists significantly improved 11 of 16 behavioral outcomes reported. High risk of bias was present in all studies and critical knowledge gaps in the preclinical evidence were identified using STAIR/SRRR.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>CCR5 antagonists demonstrate promise; however, rigorously designed preclinical studies that better align with STAIR/SRRR recommendations and downstream clinical trials are warranted.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) is expressed across a variety of leukocyte subtypes, endothelial cells, and cell types in the brain (e.g., neurons, microglia, astrocytes), and is thought to play crucial roles in post-stroke neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier repair, and neuronal survival / repair processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> CCR5 antagonists have emerged as potential therapeutic candidates for stroke, demonstrating both neuroprotection and improved neural repair/recovery in preclinical animal models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> However, no CCR5 antagonist drug has an approved indication in the stroke context, necessitating studies to establish safety and efficacy this population. This has led to an ongoing clinical trial to investigate efficacy of CCR5 antagonists in combination with post-stroke rehabilitation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> Assessment of the preclinical evidence supporting CCR5âs role in stroke is needed to identify areas of potential benefit, and knowledge gaps, that should be addressed by future preclinical research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The stroke neuroprotection and recovery communities have advocated for alignment of preclinical and clinical study parameters through publication of consensus recommendations for preclinical research, in an effort to enhance the translation of new stroke therapies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> Examples include identification of more sensitive and clinically relevant preclinical outcome measures and incorporation of potentially important effect modifiers of treatment efficacy, such as age, sex, and stroke-related comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, etc.).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> These recommendations aim to improve the translation of novel stroke therapeutics from preclinical to clinical populations, but the degree to which preclinical evidence for CCR5 antagonists satisfy these recommendations is unknown.</p>
<p>We sought to comprehensively evaluate the preclinical evidence for CCR5 antagonist drugs as both neuroprotective and stroke recovery-promoting agents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> Both perspectives are necessary to fully understand the therapeutic potential of stroke-related treatments, as distinct biological principles, time windows for treatment, and outcomes of interest underpin each of these treatment domains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the CCR5 literature in conjunction with a panel of individuals with lived experiences of stroke. This review sought to explore how the preclinical evidence for CCR5 antagonist drugs aligned with guidance for preclinical stroke research provided by previous expert committees and the parameters of an ongoing clinical trial (The Canadian Maraviroc Randomized Controlled Trial To Augment Rehabilitation Outcomes After Stroke, CAMAROS, NCT04789616).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup></p>

<title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>We registered the review protocol on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42023393438).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> The findings are reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (Table S1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> and Guidance for Reporting the Involvement of Patients and the Public (Table S2).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> A panel of eight patients and caregivers with lived and living experience of stroke informed project development and were actively involved throughout research conduct (see Table S2 for more information).</p>

<title>Information sources and search strategy</title>
<p>An information specialist with experience in systematic searches of the preclinical literature developed a comprehensive search strategy on October 25, 2022, based on a previously published strategy for identifying animal experimentation studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> The search strategy underwent peer-review using the Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies (PRESS) checklist.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> We searched MEDLINE (OVID interface, including In-Process and Epub Ahead of Print), Web of Science, and Embase (OVID interface). See the Supplemental Methods for the full search strategy and exact search dates for each database.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Selection process and data collection</title>
<p>We deduplicated citations and uploaded them into DistillerSRÂ® (Evidence Partners, Ottawa, Canada). Two reviewers independently screened citations by title and abstract using an accelerated method (one reviewer required to include, two reviewers required to exclude). We then screened and extracted data from full-text articles in duplicate. Graphical data was extracted using Engauge Digitizer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> A third reviewer with content expertise in preclinical stroke studies audited all data extraction. Conflicts between reviewers were resolved by consensus discussion. See Supplemental Methods for the complete list of data extraction elements.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Effect measures and data synthesis</title>
<p>We performed quantitative analyses using the R (version 4.1.2) âmetaforâ package (version 4.0.0)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> with inverse variance random effects modelling. We expressed continuous outcome measures as standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and assessed statistical heterogeneity of effect sizes using the Cochrane IÂ² statistic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> This was necessary due to the variety of outcome measures and measurement scales used across studies, which is a common feature of preclinical systematic reviews. Sensitivity analyses were performed using original measurement scales where possible. From patient partner input, subgroups were analyzed based on timing / dose / route of intervention, stroke model, stroke type, species, type of behavioral outcome (i.e., motor, cognitive), and comorbidities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> Our planned subgroup analyses on study quality, specific regions/areas of the brain, and post-stroke rehabilitation paradigms were not performed due to insufficient number of studies. We did not assess publication bias using Egger plots due to fewer than 10 studies being included in the analysis, as per Cochrane recommendations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Risk of bias assessment</title>
<p>Two independent reviewers used the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) risk of bias tool to assess each study as having a âLow Riskâ, âUnclear Riskâ, âSome Concerns of Riskâ, or âHigh Riskâ across domains such as randomization, blinding and outcome reporting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> âSome Concerns of Riskâ indicated reporting of a domain (i.e., randomization), but lacking methodological details. This differed from âUnclear Riskâ where there was no mention of the domain in the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Comprehensiveness of preclinical evidence and alignment with clinical trials</title>
<p>We assessed comprehensiveness of the <italic>overall body</italic> of preclinical evidence for CCR5 antagonists as a neuroprotective treatment using The Stroke Treatment Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) I, VI, and XI Consolidated Recommendations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> These recommendations encompass âcandidate treatment qualificationâ (e.g., dose, timing of dose, outcomes) and âpreclinical assessment and validationâ (e.g., age, sex, sample size, animal type).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> We excluded domains that were redundant with risk of bias (e.g., randomization, blinding, etc.) and included additional items relevant to stroke recovery studies from the Stroke Recovery and Rehabilitation Roundtable (SRRR) Translational Working Group consensus recommendations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> Two reviewers extracted data to determine if the overall evidence across studies satisfied each of the STAIR and SRRR recommendations. A third reviewer audited this analysis. We then assessed alignment of existing preclinical evidence with an ongoing clinical trial of CCR5 antagonists for stroke (CAMAROS, NCT04789616).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2g">
<title>Protocol deviations</title>
<p>We incorporated an additional assessment using the PRIMED<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> tool for assessing the readiness of stroke neuroprotection therapies to be translated to clinical trials based on the body of preclinical evidence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> Additionally, a list of outcomes used to determine CCR5âs potential mechanisms of action were extracted (Figure S1, Table S3) based on feedback from individuals that reviewed the initial manuscript drafts.</p>

<title>Intervention characteristics</title>
<p>Maraviroc was used in six of the experiments (n=6/10), TAK-779 in three of the experiments (n=3), and D-Ala-Peptide T-Amide (DAPTA) in one (n=1; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). These CCR5 antagonists were delivered intraperitoneally (n=4), intranasally (n=2), intracerebroventricularly (n=2), subcutaneously (n=1), and intravenously (n=1) at a dose range from 0.01 to 100 mg/kg. Most studies delivered a single dose of the drug (n=6); experiments with multiple administrations (n=4) ranged from 3â63 doses. Time of initial treatment administration varied widely.

<title>Meta-analysis of infarct volume</title>
<p>Infarct volume was reported in six experiments (n=6/10) from four different studies with an overall pooled analysis demonstrating marked neuroprotection with CCR5 antagonists (SMD - 1.02, 95% CI â1.58 to â0.46, p &lt; 0.0001, I<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>=34%; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Five of these experiments measured infarct volume at 1-3 days post-stroke, and one experiment measured infarct volume at a delayed time point of 63 days post-stroke.

Post-hoc sensitivity analysis removing one experiment with extreme values<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> demonstrated that neuroprotection in the remaining two experiments remained statistically significant while reducing heterogeneity (SMD â0.81, 95% CI â1.25 to â0.37, p &lt; 0.001, I<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>=0%).

<p>Behavioral outcomes are presented by time of CCR5 antagonist administration, as discussed in the Intervention Characteristics section above, as administration time directly relates to the treatment context and patient population to which the results apply (i.e., acute neuroprotection vs. late sub-acute/early chronic neural repair). Li et al. reported that pre-stroke administration (relevant to surgical contexts with high risk of thrombosis) of DAPTA did not result in significantly greater performance on the neurological deficit score.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Regarding acute post-stroke administration times with the potential for <italic>neuroprotective</italic> effects (up to 24 hours post-stroke based on observed infarct reductions in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), Yan et al. observed that CCR5 antagonist (maraviroc) administration one-hour following stroke resulted in greater motor performance on the corner test, limb placement, modified Garcia, foot fault, and rotarod tasks compared to vehicle-treated controls. Cognitive outcomes in the Morris Water Maze task (proportion of time spent in the probe quadrant) were also improved by this one-hour post-stroke administration. Significantly improved motor performance was not observed if CCR5 antagonist was administered 24 hours post-stroke, using this model of <italic>intracerebral hemorrhage</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> In contrast, using a <italic>focal ischemia</italic> model, Joy et al. observed that CCR5 antagonist (maraviroc) administration initiated 24 hours post-stroke and continued daily for 3 weeks (which could potentially represent a mix of neuroprotective and recovery-induced effects) resulted in greater performance on the cylinder and grid walk tasks compared to vehicle-treated controls.</p>
<p>Joy et al., also performed one experiment with <italic>late sub-acute/early chronic</italic> administration (a potentially critical time for neural repair) initiated at three to four weeks post-stroke and continued daily for 11 weeks, that demonstrated significantly improved performance for the grid walk, but not cylinder, task.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> This experiment was initiated outside the plausible range for a neuroprotective effect, implying behavioral improvement involved <italic>recovery-promoting mechanisms</italic>.

<p>For CCR5 antagonists as a post-stroke neuroprotectant, the overall body of evidence satisfied all five STAIR XI domains assessing âcandidate treatment qualificationâ (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Overall, a range of doses and clinically relevant administration times for neuroprotection were evaluated across a variety of motor and cognitive behavioral domains. All studies tested both behavioral and histological outcomes and demonstrated neuroprotective effects, but most studies failed to measure and control post-stroke temperature, which could potentially confound the observed neuroprotection (Table S4).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> Most histological measurements were also assessed at &lt;72 hours, which could confound the observed neuroprotective effects if cell death was merely delayed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> For CCR5 antagonists as a post-stroke recovery-inducing treatment, one experiment assessed the effects of initiating CCR5 administration in a similar post-stroke phase as the CAMAROS trial. This experiment (Joy et al.)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> did not demonstrate that each treatment group had equivalent baseline stroke volumes, which may potentially confound observed behavioral effects. Furthermore, the maximum dose used in mice (100 mg/kg) was not sufficient to attain cerebrospinal fluid levels of maraviroc observed in humans using the CAMAROS dosing regime (mice: 13.8Â±5.4 ng/mL; humans 33.6â60 ng/mL).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Areas of concern were identified in all STAIR XI domains assessing âpreclinical assessment and validationâ (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Although adult animals were used in most of the preclinical studies, the reported weights and ages of these animals corresponded to young adults, rather than the aged adults that better represent the stroke population. All experiments used only male rodents that were free of common stroke comorbidities. It was also unclear if behavioral testing was performed during the inactive circadian phase or active (dark) phase, which could result in confounding if CCR5 antagonists affect arousal of animals during their inactive period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> Furthermore, none of the studies had their protocols or results directly replicated by an independent laboratory, or across multiple sites in a multilaboratory study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> Regarding stroke recovery, no studies assessed behavioral effects on upper extremity skilled reaching / grasping or potential interactions of CCR5 antagonists with rehabilitative therapies (Table S4).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> Both elements are highly relevant to the CAMAROS trial, as one of the primary outcomes of this trial is upper extremity performance on the Fugl-Meyer and maraviroc administration will be paired with an 8-week exercise program. These findings were supported by the PRIMED<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> tool, which resulted in a Readiness for Translation Score of âmediumâ (on a scale of âlowâ, âmediumâ, âhighâ). This tool highlighted similar promising elements, as well as weaknesses, as our analysis above (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, Table S4), identifying the limited preclinical evidence for the effects of CCR5 antagonists in clinically relevant sexes, ages, species, and disease comorbidities, without sufficient dose-response information to inform trials (Table S5). Overall, our assessments highlight a variety of knowledge gaps and areas of misalignment between the preclinical evidence and clinical trial parameters that could be improved with further preclinical experimentation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The overall body of preclinical evidence for CCR5 antagonists in stroke demonstrates potential acute neuroprotection with corresponding impairment reduction, as well as improved functional recovery in the sub-acute/early chronic phase. Our systematic review also highlights evidence gaps that could impact successful clinical translation of CCR5 antagonists. Our analysis of 10 independent experiments, identified that acute administration of CCR5 antagonists within the first 24 hours post-stroke was associated with a marked reduction in infarct volume. This neuroprotective reduction of infarct volume did not significantly vary based on treatment dose or any other experimental characteristics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> Overall, the majority of behavioral effects appeared to be in a positive direction, but the low number of included studies precluded meta-analysis of these results. Indeed, no individual behavioral experiment included more than ten CCR5-treated animals, and given the wide range of dosages, timings, routes, stroke models, and rodent strains involved, the certainty of these findings is limited and should be interpreted cautiously. Further investigation is warranted to determine the optimal timing of administration and behavioral domains under which CCR5 antagonists exhibit the strongest post-stroke neuroprotective and recovery-inducing effects.</p>
<p>Despite the positive direction of treatment effects across all studies of CCR5 antagonists, we found a substantial risk of bias in the underlying studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> As is commonly observed in the preclinical literature, all studies either did not adequately report their randomization / blinding methods and exhibited evidence of selective / incomplete reporting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> Such features are associated with biased overestimations of preclinical treatment efficacy, which raises further concerns about the reliability and validity of the present findings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>Comprehensiveness of the preclinical evidence for CCR5 antagonists was assessed in relation to STAIR and SRRR consensus recommendations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> These recommendations aim to provide investigators and regulators with âassurance that the candidate treatment shows signals of efficacy and safety, before embarking on an expensive clinical development programâ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> The included studies provide good initial evidence for acute neuroprotection, as well as mechanistic and behavioral evidence for enhanced recovery in the late sub-acute/early chronic post-stroke phase. However, demonstration of efficacy under a wider range of conditions, such as in aged animals, females, animals with stroke-related comorbidities, more relevant timing of dose administrations, or in conjunction with rehabilitative therapies are necessary to provide further confidence in these findings. In addition, all studies used unique doses, timings, and outcomes, so independent replication of the most promising study parameters would further increase certainty in the evidence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>In relation to the ongoing CAMAROS trial assessing maraviroc in the subacute post-stroke phase,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> the most relevant preclinical evidence comes from one experiment within the Joy et al. study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> where maraviroc was initially administered at three to four weeks post-stroke and continued daily for 11 weeks. This experiment demonstrated that administration of maraviroc in the late sub-acute/early chronic post-stroke phase improved functional recovery on the grid walk, but not cylinder, task. These experimental conditions could potentially align with the putative therapeutic window and outcomes of interest being assessed in CAMAROS (e.g. 10-minute walk test co-primary outcome).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> However, caution is warranted as this pivotal supporting preclinical evidence is based on a low sample size (n=9). Moreover, potential differences in dosing, severity of infarct, concomitant rehabilitative therapy, and other factors discussed above could influence the degree to which these results successfully translate to the clinical environment. Nevertheless, this study provides a plausible biological mechanism and âproof of conceptâ for how CCR5 antagonism might enhance neuroplasticity that improves functional recovery after stroke.</p>
<p>Our present synthesis of the preclinical evidence for CCR5 antagonists used novel approaches to increase its utility for assessing certainty of the findings and identification of knowledge gaps.</p>
<p>First, we engaged patients with lived experiences of stroke throughout the review process to ensure that our research questions, outcomes, and interpretations aligned with the priorities of the ultimate end-user of stroke research. Second, we incorporated consensus recommendations for both preclinical neuroprotection and recovery research as an evidence evaluation tool, which we found often aligned with the priorities of our patient panel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> This guided assessment of the alignment of preclinical evidence with parameters of ongoing clinical trials, as well as appraisal of comprehensiveness of the preclinical evidence with a focus on translational validity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> rather than only internal validity and risk of bias.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> We also used this method to provide concrete avenues for future preclinical studies to close knowledge gaps and improve certainty in the effects of CCR5 antagonists under clinically relevant experimental conditions. Similar approaches should be considered by future preclinical systematic reviews to improve interpretation of the preclinical evidence from a translational perspective.</p>
<p>In conclusion, CCR5 antagonists show promise in preclinical studies for stroke neuroprotection, corresponding reduction in impairment, as well as improved functional recovery related to neural repair in the late sub-acute/early chronic phase. However, high risk of bias and the limited (or no) evidence in clinically relevant domains underscore the need for more rigorous and transparent preclinical research to further strengthen the overall evidence base. Addressing these concerns will not only enhance the reliability of preclinical evidence but also better inform the design and execution of clinical trials of CCR5 antagonists, such as the ongoing CAMAROS trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> The integration of expert recommendations, such as STAIR and SRRR, should guide future preclinical investigations and synthesis of the body of preclinical evidence in stroke recovery research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> Our present approach serves as a template by which the preclinical evidence supporting translation to clinical trials can be weighed when justifying early clinical trials of novel interventions for stroke neuroprotection and recovery.</p>

<p>This systematic review presents <bold>valuable</bold> insights into CCR5 antagonist drugs for neuroprotection and stroke management. The strength of the evidence is <bold>convincing</bold>, and the review methods and reporting adhere to the expected standards. A sensitivity analysis based on the risk of bias assessment of the included studies would be beneficial, and a more focused/detailed acknowledgment of key limitations of the review would add value to the quality of the reporting and interpretations of the findings.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The paper is well-organized, with clearly defined sections. The systematic review methodology is thorough, with clear eligibility criteria, search strategy, and data collection methods. The risk of bias assessment is also detailed and useful for evaluating the strength of evidence. The involvement of a patient panel is noticeable and positive, ensuring the research addresses real-world concerns and aligning scientific inquiry with patient perspectives. The statistical approach used for analyzing seems appropriate.</p>
<p>The authors are encouraged to take into account the following points:</p>
<p>As the authors have acknowledged, there is a high risk of bias across all included studies, particularly in randomization, selective outcome reporting, and incomplete data, which could be highlighted more explicitly in the paper's discussion section, particularly the potential implications for the generalizability of the results. The authors can also suggest mitigation strategies for future studies (e.g., better randomization, blinding, reporting standards, etc.). None of the studies include female animals, and the use of young adult animals (instead of aged models) limits the applicability of the findings to the human stroke population, where stroke incidence is higher in older adults and perhaps the gender issue must be included to reflect the translational aspects. The authors can add to the paper's discussion section that perhaps future preclinical studies should include both sexes and aged animals to align better with the clinical population and improve the translation of findings. Another point is the comorbidity. Comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension are prevalent in stroke patients. How can these be considered in preclinical designs? The authors should emphasize the importance of future research incorporating such comorbid models to enhance clinical relevance.</p>
<p>None of the studies had independent replication of their findings, which is a key limitation, especially for a field with high translational expectations. This should be highlighted as a critical next step for validating the efficacy of CCR5 antagonists.</p>
<p>The studies accessed limited cognitive outcomes (only one reported a cognitive outcome). Given the importance of cognitive recovery post-stroke, this is a gap to highlight in the discussion. Future studies should include more diverse and comprehensive behavioral assessments, including cognitive and emotional domains, to fully evaluate the therapeutic potential.</p>
<p>The timing of CCR5 administration across studies varies widely (from pre-stroke to several days post-stroke) complicating the interpretation and comparison of results. The authors are encouraged to add that future preclinical studies could focus on narrowing the therapeutic window to more clinically relevant time points.</p>
<p>
The paper identifies some alignment with clinical trials, but there are several gaps, too, particularly in the types of behavioral tests used in preclinical studies versus those in clinical trials. If this systematic review and meta-analysis aim to formulate a set of recommendations for future studies, it is important that the authors also propose specific preclinical behavioral tasks that could better align with clinical measures used in trials, like functional assessments related to human stroke outcomes.</p>
<p>The discussion needs some revisions. It could benefit from an expanded explanation of CCR5's mechanistic role in neuroplasticity and stroke recovery. For instance, linking CCR5 antagonism more closely with molecular pathways related to synaptic repair and remyelination would enhance the quality of the discussion and understanding of the drugs' potential.</p>
<p>While the tool is used to assess the risk of bias, it might be helpful to integrate a broader framework for evaluating the quality of included studies. This could include sample size justifications, statistical power analysis, or the use of pre-registration in animal studies. These elements can also introduce bias or minimize those if in place.</p>
<p>Please also highlight confounding factors that might have influenced the results in the included studies, such as variation in stroke models, dosing regimens, or behavioral assessment methods.</p>
<p>There is some discussion of the meta-analysis' limitations due to the few studies, but this point could be more thoroughly addressed. Please consider including a more critical discussion of the limitations of pooling data from heterogeneous study designs, stroke models, and outcome measures. What can this lead to? Is it reliable to do so, or does it lack scientific rigor? The authors are encouraged to formulate a balanced discussion adding, positive and negative aspects.</p>
<p>
The conclusion should more explicitly acknowledge that while CCR5 antagonists show potential, the findings are still preliminary due to the limitations in the preclinical studies (high bias risk, lack of diverse animal models). Overall, the conclusion can end with a call for rigorous, well-controlled, and replicated studies with improved alignment to clinical populations and trials to show that the conclusion remains inconclusive, considering what has been analyzed here.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This is an interesting, timely, and high-quality study on the potential neuroprotective capabilities of C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) antagonists in ischemic stroke. The focus is on preclinical investigations.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The results are timely and interesting. An outstanding feature is that stroke patient representatives have directly participated in the work. Although this is often called for, it is hardly realized in research practice, so the work goes beyond established standards.</p>
<p>The included studies were assessed regarding the therapeutic impact and their adherence to current quality assurance guidelines such as STAIR and SRRR, another important feature of this work. While overall results were promising, there were some shortcomings regarding guideline adherence.</p>
<p>The paper is very well written and concise yet provides much highly useful information. It also has very good illustrations and extremely detailed and transparent supplements.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although the paper is of very high quality, a couple of items that may require the authors' attention to increase the impact of this exciting work further. Specifically:</p>
<p>Major aspects:</p>
<p>(1) I hope I did not miss that (apologies if I did), but when exactly was the search conducted? Is it possible to screen the recent literature (maybe up to 12/2024) to see whether any additional studies were published?</p>
<p>(2) Please clearly define the difference between &quot;study&quot; and &quot;experiment,&quot; as this is not entirely clear. Is an &quot;experiment&quot; a distinct investigation within a particular publication (=study) that can describe more than one such &quot;experiment&quot;? Thanks for clarifying.</p>
<p>(3) Is there an opportunity to conduct a correlation analysis between the quality of a study (for instance, after transforming the ROB assessment into a kind of score) and reported effect sizes for particular experiments or studies? This might be highly interesting.</p>
