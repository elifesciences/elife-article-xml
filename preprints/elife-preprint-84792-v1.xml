<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Loss-of-function genetic tools are widely applied for validating therapeutic targets, but their utility remains limited by incomplete on- and uncontrolled off-target effects. We describe artificial RNA interference (ARTi) based on synthetic, ultra-potent, off-target-free shRNAs that enable efficient, inducible, and reversible suppression of any gene upon introduction of a synthetic target sequence into non-coding transcript regions. ARTi establishes a scalable loss-of-function tool with full control over on- and off-target effects.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>Drug development is guided by genetic loss-of-function (LOF) experiments that validate a therapeutic target, study its general and disease-specific functions, and thereby model and benchmark expected activities of inhibitory molecules. Applied genetic tools include RNAi, CRISPR/Cas9, and site-specific recombination technologies such as the Cre-Lox or Flp-FRT systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. While these technologies have undoubtedly revolutionized genetic screening, target identification and validation, each method is associated with drawbacks that limit the usability for certain aspects of target validation. Specifically, RNAi is prone to off-target effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> and insufficient knock-down levels, while CRISPR/Cas9-based methods are associated with off-target effects and incomplete LOF across cell populations. These limitations are particularly problematic for candidate targets in oncology, which should ideally be validated genetically in cancer cell lines and tumor models <italic>in vivo</italic>. In both cases, insufficient LOF or off-target effects can lead to far-reaching misconceptions about target suppression effects. Outgrowth of wild-type clones that retain gene function upon CRISPR- and recombination-based gene editing can result in transient phenotypes that complicate data interpretation. Similarly, insufficient knock-down or uncontrolled off-target effects induced by RNAi can lead to an unjustified de-prioritization or pursuit of candidate targets, respectively. Prior to initiating the time- and resource-intense process of drug development, more informative target validation assays would be highly desirable.</p>
<p>To develop such an assay system, we reasoned that instead of using gene-specific loss-of-function triggers for every new candidate gene, the expression of any gene could be efficiently suppressed by engineering the target site of a pre-validated, highly potent, synthetic short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) into its exonic sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Besides ensuring efficient target knockdown in a highly standardized manner, such an approach would also provide full control over off-target activities through expressing the shRNA side-by-side in target-site engineered and wildtype cells. As suitable RNAi system, we chose optimized micro-RNA embedded shRNAs (shRNAmirs) in the miR-E backbone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, which do not interfere with endogenous miRNA processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> and can be expressed from tet-responsive elements and other Pol-II promoters in the 3’-UTR of fluorescent reporter genes, thus providing a versatile system for inducible RNAi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. To identify potent artificial RNAi (ARTi) triggers with minimal off-target activity, we analyzed the nucleotide composition of shRNAs that reach exceptionally high performance scores in common shRNA design algorithms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> and of miRNA seed sequences with exceptionally low off-target scores according to siSPOTR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. By merging nucleotide biases identified in both analyses, we derived a 22-nt base composition matrix for the design of ARTi shRNAmirs (TTCGWWWNNAHHWWCATCCGGN; W = A/T, H = A/T/C; N = A/T/G/C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1b</xref>; Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). To further reduce possible off-target effects, we eliminated all shRNAs whose extended seed sequence (guide positions 2-14) had a perfect match in the human or mouse transcriptome and, finally, selected six top-scoring ARTi predictions for experimental validation.</p>

<p>We tested these ARTi-shRNAmirs using an established knockdown reporter assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> for their ability to suppress expression of a GFP transgene that harbors the respective target sites in its 3’-UTR. In all six cases, ARTi-shRNAmir matched or outperformed previously validated highly potent shRNAmirs targeting Renilla luciferase or PTEN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> (Extended Data Fig. 1c). We compared these results to a panel of 592 genespecific shRNAs that were tested using the same assay and found that ARTi-shRNAmirs ranked among topperforming shRNAmirs overall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Next, we selected the three top-performing ARTi-shRNAmirs and evaluated possible off-target activities using competitive proliferation assays and transcriptome profiling. ARTi-shRNAmir expression had no effects on proliferation or survival in four human and three mouse cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1d</xref>, Extended Data Fig. 1d), with the exception ARTi.6634 which induced a mild fitness defect in the murine leukemia cell line RN2. In contrast to effects of a MEK inhibitor trametinib, which we included as a positive control, stable expression of ARTi-shRNAmirs had only marginal effects in RNA-sequencing in two commonly used human cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1e, f</xref>, Extended Data Fig. 1e,f) and no effect in proliferation assays (Extended Data Fig. 1g), indicating that they do not trigger major off-target effects, even in the absence of their respective target site. Together, these studies established a set of highly potent, off-target-free ARTi-shRNAmirs, among which we selected ARTi.6570 (ARTi-shRNAmir) for further investigations.</p>
<p>To establish ARTi as a method for target validation, we performed ARTi-based LOF experiments in cancer cell lines and xenograft models for three prominent oncology targets: EGFR and KRAS, which act as driving oncogenes in various cancer types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, and STAG1, which has been identified as a synthetic lethal interaction with recurrent loss-of-function mutations of STAG2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. To establish an ARTi-repressible version of oncogenic EGFR<sup>del19</sup>, we cloned ARTi-shRNAmir target sequences into an expression construct encoding EGFR<sup>del19</sup> fused to dsRed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a</xref>), which rendered Ba/F3 cells cytokine-independent and sensitive to EGFR inhibition (Extended Data Fig. 2a). We introduced this construct into human EGFR<sup>del19</sup>-dependent PC-9 lung adenocarcinoma cells and subsequently knocked out the endogenous <italic>EGFR</italic> gene. The EGFR<sup>del19</sup>::dsRed::ARTi transgene fully rescued the loss of endogenous EGFR<sup>del19</sup>, while doxycycline (Dox)-induced expression of the ARTi-shRNAmir (ARTi.6570) strongly inhibited proliferation of PC-9 cells and triggered a near-complete suppression of the EGFR<sup>del19</sup>::dsRed protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2b,c</xref>; Extended Data Fig. 2b). Consistently, in RNA-sequencing we observed an almost complete drop of reads mapping to the codon-optimized <italic>EGFR<sup>del19</sup>::dsRed::ARTi</italic> transgene upon dox-inducible expression of the ARTi-shRNAmir, as well as a downregulation of <italic>DUSP6</italic> and other canonical targets of RAF-MEK-ERK signaling, which acts as key effector pathway of EGFR<sup>del19</sup> (Extended Data Fig. 2c-e).</p>

<p>To evaluate whether ARTi can recapitulate drug activities <italic>in vivo</italic>, we xenotransplanted <italic>EGFR<sup>del19</sup>::dsRed::ARTi</italic> engineered PC-9 cells harboring the Dox-inducible ARTi-shRNAmir and treated recipient mice upon tumor formation with either Dox or the clinically approved EGFR inhibitor Osimertinib. Dox-induced expression of the ARTi-shRNAmir led to rapid and durable tumor regression that was indistinguishable from the effects of Osimertibib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2d</xref>) and not observed in parental PC-9 cells that lack the ARTi target site (Extended Data Fig. 2f). Thus, ARTi-induced phenotypes can be unambiguously attributed to on-target effects that predict the activity of advanced small-molecule inhibitors <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>In a second study, we used ARTi to investigate KRAS<sup>G12R</sup>, an oncogenic variant of KRAS for which <italic>in-vivo</italic> compatible inhibitors do not yet exist. To establish a suitable KRAS<sup>G12R</sup>-driven model, we engineered a <italic>dsRed::KRAS<sup>G12R</sup>::ARTi</italic> transgene and the dox-inducible ARTi-shRNAmir into KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-dependent MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells and subsequently knocked out endogenous KRAS alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2e</xref>, Extended Data Fig. 3a). As expected, switching the driving oncogene from KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> to KRAS<sup>G12R</sup> rendered MIA PaCa-2 cells resistant to the KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibitor AMG-510<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> (Extended Data Fig. 3b). ARTi-shRNAmir induction led to strong suppression of dsRed::KRAS<sup>G12R</sup> expression at the mRNA and protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2f</xref>, Extended Data Fig. 3c,d) and marked anti-proliferative effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2g</xref>). In xenograft experiments, ARTi-mediated suppression of KRAS<sup>G12R</sup> led to full tumor regression in the absence of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2h</xref>), while tumors harboring both oncogenic KRAS alleles only displayed a delay in tumor progression, suggesting that both oncogenes contribute to tumorigenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>To evaluate STAG1 as synthetic-lethal dependency that is relevant in wide range of STAG2-deficient cancers (Extended Data Fig. 4a)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, we engineered an isogeneic pair of STAG2-wildtype and -deficient HCT-116 colon carcinoma cells and homozygously inserted ARTi target sites into the 3’-UTR of endogenous <italic>STAG1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2i</xref>). Western blotting confirmed the knockout of <italic>STAG2</italic>, the homozygous insertion of the targeting cassette into the <italic>STAG1</italic> locus, and potent suppression of STAG1 following Dox-induced ARTi-shRNAmir expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2j,k</xref>; Extended Data Fig. 4b). Suppression of STAG1 in STAG2-deficient HCT-116 cells impaired their proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic> (Extended Data Fig. 4c) and the progression of xenografted tumors <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2l</xref>), while Dox-induced expression of the ARTi-shRNAmir had no anti-proliferative effects in the presence of STAG2.</p>
<p>Together, these studies establish ARTi as a versatile and precise LOF method for target validation in oncology and beyond. Instead of designing gene-specific LOF reagents that remain prone to off-target effects, ARTi involves a simple, highly standardized experimental procedure that provides full control over on- and off-target effects and can be applied to any coding and non-coding gene. In cells that are preengineered to express the Dox-inducible ARTi-shRNAmir-candidate genes can be converted into ARTi target genes and subsequently evaluated head-to-head in a highly standardized manner, either through knocking in ARTi target sites into endogenous loci or through knock-out rescue approaches. Placement of ARTi target sites in non-coding transcript regions leaves the endogenous target protein unaltered, which is a key advantage over chemical-genetic LOF methods relying on the introduction of degron tags<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Through engineering multiple target sites in the same cell, in principle ARTi enables combinatorial LOF perturbations, e.g. for modeling synergistic target interactions, without multiplying the risk for off-target effects. Beyond providing a scalable method for early target validation, we foresee that ARTi can be used to establish on-target benchmark phenotypes for guiding the development and optimization of inhibitory molecules.</p>

<title>Design and cloning of ARTi shRNAs</title>
<p>To design pairs of artificial shRNAs and matching target sites that trigger effective and selective target suppression with minimal off-target effects, nucleotide composition of shRNAs that reach exceptionally high performance scores in a well-established siRNA prediction tool (DSIR=Designer of Small Interfering RNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>) and contain no A or T in guide position 20 to eliminate shRNAmirs that produce RISC-loadable small RNAs from the passenger strand were analyzed. To establish criteria for ARTi design, siRNA predictions for the human and mouse genome were retrieved from DSIR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> using default parameters. Top scoring predictions (DSIR score &gt; 105) harboring G or C in position 20 were analyzed for nucleotide biases, which were used to define basic design criteria at the 5’-end the 3’-half. Next, possible off-targets were minimized using siSPOTR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, an siRNA-based prediction tool that assesses off-target potential of different siRNA seed sequences (guide positions 2-8) in the human and mouse genome. Seed sequences with the lowest predicted off-target activity (top 1%) showed biases for C and/or G in guide positions 2-6, but 23% contained a T at the 5’ end of the seed sequence that is required in our design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Among these, we observed particularly strong biases for CG in the following two positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1b</xref>), which were found in 73% of all seed sequences harboring a 5’ T. Overall, 17% of all top-scoring seed sequences harbored TCG at their 5’ end, making it the second most common triplet (after CGC, which was found in 20%). Based on these analyses, we fixed the first 4 nucleotides of the guide to TTCG. For the following positions we reasoned that introducing additional GC biases would destroy 5’-3’ asymmetry of small RNA duplexes that is critically required for efficient RISC loading. To maintain sufficient asymmetry, we therefore decided to bias the next 3 positions towards A or T, which in most positions is in alignment with nucleotide biases associated with knockdown efficacy.</p>
<p>For the remaining sequence 3’ of the seed region, we adhered to nucleotide features associated with knockdown efficacy based on our DSIR analysis, which are remarkably prominent and cannot all be explained through established processing requirements. Altogether, this established a 22-nt matrix for the design of ARTi shRNAmirs (TTCGWWWNNAHHWWCATCCGGN; W = A/T, H = A/T/C; N = A/T/G/C). In a last step, we further reduced possible off-target effects by eliminating all guides whose extended seed sequence (guide positions 2-14) had a perfect match in the human or mouse transcriptome and, finally, selected the following six top-scoring ARTi predictions for experimental validation:</p>

<title>Bioinformatic analyses of 3’ mRNA-Seq</title>
<p>For 3’ mRNA-Seq reads derived from the human cell lines HT-1080 and RKO, the six nucleotide long 5’ UMIs were attached to each read name with umi-tools (v1.0.0)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Subsequently, the UMIs plus the next four nucleotides (UMI spacer), as well as 3’ adapters (stringency of 3) and bases with low quality (threshold of 25) were trimmed away using cutadapt (v1.18)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> and its wrapper tool trimgalore (v0.6.2). Read quality control was performed with FastQC (v0.11.8). The remaining reads were sample-wise aligned to the human (GRCh38.p13; GCA_000001405.28) reference genome. Mapping and subsequent filtering of 3’ UTR mapped reads was performed with slamdunk (v0.4.3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> in QuantSeq mode (slamdunk map −5 12 -n 100 - q). 3’ UTR regions were assembled based on the description in Muhar et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>.

For this purpose, 10 mM stock solutions in DMSO of afatinib<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, Osimertinib<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> and poziotinib<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> were used. 5’000 cells per well were seeded in 150μL of the medium in technical triplicates in 96-well plates and incubated at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 5 hours, followed by the compound addition. Cells were treated with seven different concentrations of inhibitors in a serial eight-fold dilutions starting with the highest concentration of 3 μM. For comparability, DMSO normalization to the highest added volume was performed. Subsequently, cells were cultivated for 96 hours at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. 50 μL of Cell Titer Glo reagent was added to each well, incubated for 10 minutes in the dark and luminescence was measured using the multilabel Plate Reader VICTOR X4. The measurement time was set to 0.2 seconds. Luminescence values relative to DMSO-treated cells were plotted in GraphPad Prism and fitted using nonlinear regression with a variable slope to calculate IC50 values at 50% inhibition. MIA PaCa-2 KRAS G12C inhibitor (AMG-510)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> treatments were performed as described for EGFR with the following modifications: 2’000 cells per well, and 0.5nM-3μM concentration range of AMG-510.</p>

<title><italic>In vivo</italic> experiments</title>
<p>The PC-9 EGFR k.o., EGFR<sup>del19</sup>::ARTi study was performed at the AAALAC accredited animal facility of CrownBio Leicestershire, UK. Female NSG<sup>®</sup> (NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidII2rgtm1wjl/SzJ) Crl mice were obtained from Charles River. Age of animals at study initiation was 7-8 weeks and hat an acclimatization period of ≥14 days. Mice were groups housed in IVCs. The study complies with the UK Animals Scientific Procedures Act 1986 (ASPA) in line with Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament and the Council of 22 September 2010 on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes.</p>
<p>All other in vivo experiments were performed at the AAALAC accredited animal facility of Boehringer Ingelheim RCV GmbH &amp; CoKG. Female BomTac:NMRI-<italic>Foxn1<sup>nu</sup></italic> mice were obtained from Taconic Denmark at 6-8 weeks of age. After the arrival, mice were allowed to adjust to the housing conditions at least for 5 days before the start of the experiment. Mice were housed in pathogen-free and controlled environmental conditions (open cage housing), and handled according to the institutional, governmental and European Union guidelines (Austrian Animal Protection Laws, GV-SOLAS and FELASA guidelines).</p>
<p>Studies were approved by the internal ethics committee (called “ethics committee”) of Boehringer Ingelheim RCV GmbH &amp; Co KG in the department of Cancer Pharmacology and Disease Positioning. Furthermore, all protocols were approved by the Austrian governmental committee (MA 60 Veterinary office; approval numbers GZ: 903122/2017/21 and GZ: 416181-2020-29).</p>
<p>To establish subcutaneous tumors, mice were injected with 2 x 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> HCT-116 in PBS, 5 x 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> MIA PaCa-2 in 1:2 Matrigel: PBS with 5% FBS or with 1 x 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> PC-9 cells in PBS with 5% FBS.</p>
<p>Tumor diameters were measured with a caliper three times a week. The volume of each tumor [in mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>] was calculated according to the formula “tumor volume = length * diameter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> * π/6.” Mice were randomized into the treatment groups when tumor size reached between ~130 and 190 mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Group sizes were calculated for each tumor model based on tumor growth during model establishment experiments. A power analysis was performed using a sample size calculator (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~rollin/stats/ssize/n2.html">https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~rollin/stats/ssize/n2.html</ext-link>). For all models used in the studies, 10 mice per group were used. 2mg/ml Doxycycline hyclate (Sigma) and 5mg/ml sucrose were added to the drinking water of the treatment groups, the control group received water with 5mg/ml sucrose only. Osimertinib (Tagrisso, AstraZeneca, 40 mg tablet) was dosed per os daily at a dose of 25mg/kg in Natrosol and control mice were dosed per os daily with Natrosol. To monitor side effects of treatment, mice were inspected daily for abnormalities and body weight was determined three times per week. Animals were sacrificed when the tumors reached a size of 1’500 mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Food and water were provided ad libitum. <italic>In vivo</italic> experiments were not repeated.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Xenograft samples were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 24 h and embedded in paraffin. Two-micrometer-thick sections were cut using a microtome. STAG1 was stained with Polink 2 Plus HRP rat NM detection system (GBI Labs #D46-6) according to manufacturer’s instructions using a recombinant rat monoclonal STAG1 antibody (Abcam ab241544, Lot:GR3334172-1; 1:200) after cooking 10 minutes at 110°C in antigen unmasking solution (Vector #H3301). After staining the slides were digitalized (scanner: Leica Aperio AT2). All slides were reviewed and evaluated for quality by a board-certified MD Pathologist. Imaging analysis was performed using the digital pathology platform HALO (Indica Labs). A tissue-classifying algorithm was trained to selectively recognize viable tumor tissue against stroma, necrosis, and skin. The tissue classification output for each scan was reviewed and manually edited as necessary. A cell detection and scoring algorithm was trained to measure DAB optical density (OD) in the nuclei of tumor cells. A positivity threshold for DAB OD was determined by normalization with respect to the DAB OD as calculated from <italic>bona fide</italic> negative tissue (e.g., murine stroma as background). The object data for background-normalized nuclear ODs for each tumor cell were exported from three control and three doxycycline-treated cases (207945 and 33331 pooled objects, respectively). The cumulative distribution of the background-normalized DAB OD for each tumor cell nucleus was then plotted for control and doxycycline-treated cases, separately (supplemental figure 4, panel K).</p>

<p>In this manuscript the authors proposed a novel system by which they can suppress the expression of any gene of interest precisely and efficiently with a pre-validated, highly specific and efficient synthetic short-hairpin RNA. The idea of identifying potent artificial RNAi (ARTi) triggers is intriguing, and the authors successfully identify six ARTi with robust knockdown efficiency and limited to no off-target effects. As a proof-of-concept, the authors examined three oncology targets for validation, including EGFRdel19 (which already has a clinically approved drug for validation), KRASG12R (for which there are no in vivo compatible inhibitors yet) and STAG1 (which has a synthetic lethal interaction with recurrent loss-of-function mutations of STAG2). The authors demonstrated significant suppression of colony formation and in vivo tumor growth for all three oncology targets.</p>
<p>This novel system could serve as a powerful tool for loss-of-function experiments that are often used to validate a drug target. Not only this tool can be applied in exogenous systems (like EGFRdel19 and KRASG12R in this paper), the authors successfully demonstrated that ARTi can also be used in endogenous systems by CRISPR knocking in the ARTi target sites to the 3'UTR of the gene of interest (like STAG2 in this paper).</p>
<p>ARTi enables specific, efficient, and inducible suppression of these genes of interest, and can potentially improve therapeutic target validations. However, the system cannot be easily generalized as there are some limitations in this system:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The authors claimed in the introduction sections that CRISPR/Cas9-based methods are associated with off-target effects, however, the author's system requires the use CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out a given endogenous genes or to knock-in ARTi target sites to the 3' UTR of the gene of interest. Though the authors used a transient CRISPR/Cas9 system to minimize the potential off-target effects, the advantages of ARTi over CRISPR are likely less than claimed.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item><p>Instead of generating gene-specific loss-of-function triggers for every new candidate gene, the authors identified a universal and potent ARTi to ensure standardized and controllable knockdown efficiency. It seems this would save time and effort in validating each lost-of-function siRNAs/sgRNAs for each gene. However, users will still have to design and validate the best sgRNA to knock out endogenous genes or to knock in ARTi target sites by CRISPR/Cas9. The latter is by no-means trivial. Users will need to design and clone an expression construct for their cDNA replacement construct of interest, which will still be challenging for big proteins.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item><p>The approach of knocking-out an endogenous gene followed by replacement of a regulatable gene can also be achieved using regulated degrons, and by tet-regulated promoters included in the gene replacement cassette. The authors should include a discussion of the merits of these approaches compared with ARTi.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Hoffmann et al. introduce a novel and innovative method to validate and study the mechanism of action of essential genes and novel putative drug targets. In the wake of many functional genomics approaches geared towards identifying novel drug targets or synthetic lethal interactions, there is a dire need for methods that allow scientists to ablate a gene of interest and study its immediate effect in culture or in xenograft models. In general, these genes are lethal, rendering conventional genetic tools such as CRISPR or RNAi inept.</p>
<p>The ARTi system is based on expression of a transgene with an artificial RNAi target site in the 3'-UTR as well as a TET-inducible miR-E-based shRNAi. Using this system, the authors convincingly show that they can target strong oncogenes such as EGFRdel19 or KRasG12 as well as synthetic lethal interactions (STAG1/2) in various human cancer cell lines in vivo and in vitro.</p>
<p>The system is very innovative, likely easy to be established and used by the scientific community and thus very meaningful.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for raising these very valid concerns about potential off-target effects related to the CRISPR/Cas9-based gene knockout or engineering of endogenous ARTi target sites. In contrast to conventional RNAi- and CRISPR-based approaches, such off-target effects can be investigated prior to loss-of-function experiments through comparison between parental and engineered cells, which in the absence of CRISPR-induced off-target events are expected to be identical. Subsequent ARTi experiments provide full control over RNAi-induced off-target activities through comparison of target-site engineered and parental cells. However, we agree that undetected CRISPR/Cas9-induced off-target events cannot be ruled out in a definitive way, which we will point out in our revised manuscript.</p>

<p>We fully agree that the required design of gene-specific sgRNAs and subsequent CRISPR-engineering steps are by no means trivial. However, we believe that decisive advantages of the method, in particular the robustness of LOF perturbations and additional means for controlling off-target activities, can make ARTi an investment that pays off. In our experience, much time can be lost in the search for effective LOF reagents, and even when these are found, questions about off-target activity remain. While ARTi overcomes many of these challenges by providing a standardized experimental workflow, we do not propose to replace all other LOF approaches by this method. Instead, we would position ARTi as a unique orthogonal approach for the stringent validation and in-depth characterization of candidate target genes, as we will highlight in our revised discussion.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out these alternative LOF methods. We had already included a brief discussion of chemical-genetic LOF methods based on degron tags. While we certainly share the current excitement about degron technologies, they inevitably require changes to the coding sequence of target proteins, which can alter their regulation and function in ways that are hard to control for. In our revised discussion, we will add a brief comparison to conventional tet-regulatable expression systems, which unlike ARTi require the use of ectopic tet-responsive promoters. Overall, we would position ARTi as an orthogonal tool that enables inducible and reversible LOF perturbations without changing the coding sequence and the endogenous transcriptional control of candidate target genes.</p>
