<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The use of siblings to infer the factors influencing complex traits has been a cornerstone of quantitative genetics. Here we utilise siblings for a novel application: the identification of genetic architecture, specifically that in individuals with extreme trait values (e.g. in the top 1%). Establishing genetic architecture in these individuals is important because they are at greatest risk of disease and are most likely to harbour rare variants of large effect due to natural selection. We develop a theoretical framework that derives expected trait distributions of siblings based on an index sibling’s trait value and trait heritability. This framework is used to develop statistical tests that can infer complex genetic architecture in trait tails, distinguishing between polygenic, <italic>de novo</italic> and Mendelian tail architecture. We apply our tests to UK Biobank data here, while they can be used to infer genetic architecture in any cohort or health registry that includes siblings, without requiring genetic data. We describe how our approach has the potential to help disentangle the genetic and environmental causes of extreme trait values, to identify individuals likely to carry pathogenic variants for follow-up clinical genetic testing, and to improve the design and power of future sequencing studies to detect rare variants.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The fields of quantitative genetics and genetic epidemiology have exploited the shared genetics and environment of siblings in a range of applications, notably to estimate heritability, using theory first developed a century ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>), and more recently to infer a so-called ‘household effect’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>), which contributes to genetic risk indirectly via a correlation between genetics and the household environment. Here we leverage trait information on siblings to infer the genetic architecture of those traits, not only at the population-level, but also in relation to whether the genetic liability of each individual - specifically those with extreme trait values - is a result of a few large effect alleles or many small effect alleles.</p>
<p>The genetic architecture of a complex trait is typically inferred from the findings of multiple studies: with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identifying common variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>), whole exome or whole genome sequencing studies detecting rare variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>), and family sequencing studies designed to identify <italic>de novo</italic> and rare Mendelian mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). The relative contribution of each type of variant to trait heritability is a function of historical selection pressures on the trait in the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). If selection has recently acted to increase the average value of a trait, then the lower tail of the trait distribution will be subject to negative selection and may be enriched for large effect rare variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), while if the trait is subject to stabilising selection, then both tails of the trait distribution may be enriched for rare variant aetiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). This can result in less accurate polygenic scores in the tails of the trait distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>), but can also produce dissimilarity between siblings beyond what is expected under polygenecity. For example, studies on the intellectual ability of sibling pairs have demonstrated similarity for average intellectual ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>), regression-to-the-mean for siblings at the upper tail of the distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>), and complete discordance when one sibling is at the lower extreme tail of the distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Findings from such studies such as <italic>Reichenberg et al. 2016</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>) are are consistent with the presence of <italic>de novo</italic> alleles of large effect in the trait tails, alongside alternative explanations such as specific environmental exposures. However, no theoretical framework has been developed to formally infer genetic architecture from sibling trait data.</p>
<p>We introduce a theoretical framework that allows widely available sibling trait data in population cohorts and health registries to be leveraged to perform statistical tests that estimate complex genetic architecture in the tails of the trait distribution. These tests can differentiate between polygenic, <italic>de novo</italic> alleles and rare variants of large effect (hereafter ‘Mendelian variants’ for shorthand). This framework establishes expectations about the trait distributions of siblings of index individuals with extreme trait values (e.g. the top 1% of the trait) according to polygenic and non-polygenic tail trait architecture (see <bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></italic></bold>).</p>

<p>From left to right: When individuals have extreme (top 1%) tail values as a result of many common alleles of small effect (polygenicity), then their siblings’ trait values are expected to show regression-to-the-mean (grey). When individuals have extreme trait values as a result of <italic>de novo</italic> mutations of large effect, then their siblings are expected to have trait values that correspond to the background distribution. When individuals have extreme trail values as a result of a rare variant of large effect inherited from one of their parents (Mendelian), then their siblings are expected to have either similarly extreme trait values or trait values that are drawn from the background distribution, depending on whether or not they inherited the same large effect allele.</p></caption>

<p>Critical to our framework is our derivation of the “conditional-sibling trait distribution”, which describes the trait distribution for one individual given the quantile value of one or more “index” siblings. Our statistical framework, derivation of the conditional-sibling trait distribution, and simulation study, allow us to develop statistical tests to infer genetic architecture from sibling registries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) without the need for genetic data (see <bold><italic>Model &amp; Methods</italic></bold>). We validate the statistical power of our tests using simulated data and real data from the UK Biobank. Our novel framework can be extended to applications such as estimating heritability, inferring assortative mating, and characterising historical selection pressures.</p>

<title>Model &amp; Methods</title>
<p>Here we outline a framework that models the <italic>conditional-sibling trait distribution</italic> which describes an individual’s trait distribution conditioned on one or more <italic>index</italic> sibling(s). In this section we describe our derivation of the distribution for a completely polygenic trait, outline development of statistical tests that detect complex genetic architecture via departure polygenicity, and describe the simulation scheme used to validate and benchmark our results. Full derivations that complement this high-level summary of our methodology are included in the <bold><italic>Appendices</italic></bold>.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Conditional-Sibling Inference Framework</title>
<p>Assuming completely polygenic architecture, siblings of individuals with extreme trait values are expected to be much less extreme. This regression-to-the-mean can be understood through the two factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>) that determine inherited genetic liability: <bold>(i)</bold> average genetic liability of the parents, known as “<italic>midparent</italic>” liability, and, <bold>(ii)</bold> random genetic reassortment occurring during meiosis. Assuming that an individual presenting an upper-tail trait value does so due to <italic>both</italic> high midparent liability <italic>and</italic> genetic reassortment favouring a higher value, then a sibling sharing common midparent liability - but subject to independent reassortment - is likely less extreme. How much less extreme can be derived by first considering the conditional distribution that relates midparents and their offspring. In the simplest case, for a completely heritable continuous polygenic trait in a large randomly mating population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), the offspring trait value, <italic>s</italic>, is normally distributed around the midparent trait value, <italic>m</italic>, as follows:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="529159v1_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>σ</italic><sup>2</sup> is the population trait variance. Note that the trait variance within families is half that of the population trait variance under neutrality and random mating, which is a key property in quantitative genetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). For a trait with heritability <italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup>, trait variance can be partitioned into genetic, <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="529159v1_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, and environmental, <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="529159v1_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, contributions, such that <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="529159v1_inline3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="529159v1_inline4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. Assuming meancentred genetic and environmental trait contributions, and a trait variance of 1 (a standard normalised trait), the distribution for offspring conditioned on the midparent genetic liability, <italic>m</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub>, is:
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="529159v1_eqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Since <italic>p</italic>(<italic>m</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub>) ∼ 𝒩(0, <italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup><italic>/</italic>2), from Bayes’ Theorem it can be shown that the midparent liability conditional on offspring trait value, <italic>s</italic>, is distributed as follows:
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="529159v1_eqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>From <bold><italic><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Equations 2</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3">3</xref></italic></bold>, the sibling trait distribution conditional on an index sibling can be calculated:
<disp-formula id="eqn4">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="529159v1_eqn4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Here we note the relative simplicity of this distribution, which means, for example, that under complete heritability, the siblings of an individual with a standard normal trait value of <italic>z</italic>, will have a mean trait value of <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="529159v1_inline5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, with variance equal to three quarters of the population variance. In <bold><italic>Results</italic></bold> (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></italic></bold>) we illustrate how trait heritability and index quantile determine the conditional-sibling distribution in standard trait space and in population percentile space. In <bold><italic><xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix 1</xref></italic></bold> we provide a full derivation of this distribution (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">Equation 4</xref></italic></bold>) and generalize our analytical results across a range of scenarios, including binary phenotypes and multiple index siblings, increasing the utility of this framework for further applications and theoretical development.</p>

<title>Statistical Tests for Complex Tail Architecture</title>
<p>In <bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref></italic></bold>, the strategy employed to develop statistical tests for complex tail architecture is depicted. Our approach corresponds to testing for deviations from the expected conditional-sibling trait distribution under the null hypothesis of polygenicity in the trait tails: excess discordance is indicative of an enrichment of <italic>de novo</italic> mutations, while excess concordance indicates an enrichment of Mendelian variants, i.e. large effect variants segregating in the population. The heritability, <italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup>, required to define the null distribution, is estimated by maximising the log-likelihood of the conditional-sibling trait distribution (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">Equation 4</xref></italic></bold>) with respect to <italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup>:
<disp-formula id="eqn5">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="529159v1_eqn5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>s</italic><sub>2</sub> represent index and conditional-sibling trait values, respectively, and <italic>n</italic> is the number of sibling pairs. This estimation method allows <italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup> to be estimated for given quantiles of the trait distribution by restricting sibling pair observations to those index siblings in the quantile of interest. To maximise power to detect non-polygenic architecture in the tails of the trait distribution, we estimate “polygenic heritability” <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="529159v1_inline6.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> from sibling pairs for which the index sibling trait value is between the 5<sup><italic>th</italic></sup> and 95<sup><italic>th</italic></sup> percentile (labeled “Distribution Body” in <bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref></italic></bold>). Tests for complex architecture are then performed in relation to index siblings whose trait values are in the tails of the distribution (e.g. the lower and upper 1%). Below, <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>q</italic></sub> denotes the set of sibling pairs for which the index sibling is in quantile <italic>q</italic> such that <italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub> &gt; Φ(<italic>q</italic>) and <italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub> &lt; Φ(<italic>q</italic>) for the upper and lower tails, respectively, where Φ<sup>−1</sup> is the inverse normal cumulative distribution function.</p>

<title>Simulation of Conditional Sibling Data</title>
<p>We perform simulations using publicly available GWAS data on multiple traits to validate our analytical model and to benchmark our tests for complex architecture. <bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref></italic></bold> depicts the different stages of our simulation procedure. We start by simulating a “parent population” (<bold>step A</bold>), assigning genotypes based on the allele frequencies of the first 100k SNPs from a trait GWAS. Additive parent liability can then be calculated based on the genotype effect size distribution of the GWAS. Next, parents are randomly paired, their liabilities averaged to produce midparent trait values (<bold>step B</bold>), and genotypes of two offspring (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Equation 1</xref></italic></bold>) and corresponding genetic liabilities, <italic>G</italic>, are calculated (<bold>step C</bold>) assuming independent reassortment of parental alleles and unlinked SNPs.</p>
<fig id="fig3" position="float" fig-type="figure">
<label>Fig. 3:</label>
<caption><title>Simulation Schematic.</title>
<p>Publicly available GWAS allele frequency and effect size data is used to simulate parent liability (<bold>A</bold>). Midparent liability (<bold>B</bold>) is simulated assuming random mating. Offspring genotype and liability (<bold>C</bold>) is simulated assuming complete recombination. Environmental variation (<bold>D</bold>) is added to compare with theoretical polygenic conditional sibling distribution. <italic>De novo</italic> and Mendelian rare-variant effects are simulated (<bold>E</bold>) to benchmark tests for complex architecture (<bold>F</bold>).</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="529159v1_fig3.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>In <bold>step D</bold>, we generate offspring trait values for different degrees of heritability by adding an environmental random effect. For heritability, <italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup>, offspring trait values are given by <italic>T</italic> = <italic>hG</italic> + <italic>E</italic>, where the environmental effect <italic>E</italic> is drawn from a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance (1− <italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup>). The simulated trait has a 𝒩(0, 1) distribution and the correlation between the genetic liability and trait is equal to the heritability.</p>
<p>In <bold>step E</bold>, we simulate the effect of complex tail architecture on the conditional-sibling trait distribution. We assume that rare variants are sufficiently penetrant to move individuals into the tails of the distribution independent of polygenic liability. We modify sibling trait values for individuals already in the tails (from Step D) to minimise perturbation of the trait distribution. We simulate <italic>de novo</italic> tail architecture by resampling the less extreme sibling from the background distribution, and simulate Mendelian tail architecture by resampling the less extreme sibling from the background distribution with probability 0.5 and from the same tail as the extreme sibling with probability 0.5.</p>

<title>Application to UK Biobank Data</title>

The sub-sample corresponding to the sibling pairs was then re-normalised, and for each sibling pair one was randomly assigned as the index sibling and the other the conditional-sibling. Sibling pairs were then sorted by their index trait value and each sibling binned according to trait percentile rank among all siblings.</p>

<title>Power of Statistical Tests to Identify Complex Tail Architecture</title>
<p>Building on the theoretical framework introduced in the <bold><italic>Model &amp; Methods</italic></bold> and illustrated in the previous section, we develop statistical tests to identify complex architecture in the tails of the trait distribution. These tests leverage the fact that the similarity (or dissimilarity) in trait values among siblings provides information about the genetic architecture underlying the trait (see <bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></italic></bold>). For example, high-impact <italic>de novo</italic> mutations generate large dissimilarity between siblings when only one carries the unique mutant allele, while Mendelian variants can create excess similarity in the tails of the distribution when siblings share both inherit the same mutant allele.</p>
<p>In <bold><italic><xref ref-type="app" rid="app2">Appendix 2</xref></italic></bold>, we provide detailed derivations for the statistical tests described at a high level in <bold><italic>Model &amp; Methods</italic></bold> and explain how they identify tail signatures in contrast to a polygenic background where conditional siblings regress-to-the-mean at a rate proportional to <italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup><italic>/</italic>2 (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">Equation 4</xref></italic></bold>). The performance of the two tests evaluated using simulated sibling data is shown in <bold><italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref></italic></bold>. These tests demonstrate that power to identify <italic>de novo</italic> architecture is greatest when heritability is high, while power to identify Mendelian architecture is greatest when heritability is low. These patterns can be explained by the fact that high heritability should lead to relatively high similarity among siblings, and low heritability to low similarity, under polygenicity. When heritability is estimated near 50% and at least 0.1% of the population has high-impact rare aetiology, both tests are well-powered to identify each class of complex tail architecture.</p>

<title>Identifying Complex Tail Architecture in UK Biobank Data</title>
<p>We applied our two statistical tests of complex tail architecture to sibling-pair data on six traits from the UK Biobank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>) to illustrate the performance of our tests on real data.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this paper, we present a novel approach to infer the genetic architecture of continuous traits, specifically in the tails of their distributions, from sibling trait data alone. Our approach is based on a theoretical framework that we develop, which derives the expected trait distributions of siblings conditional on the trait value of an index-sibling and the trait heritability, assuming polygenicity. The key intuition underlying the approach is that departures from the expected <italic>conditional-sibling trait distribution</italic> in relation to index-siblings selected from the trait tails may be due to non-polygenic architecture in the tails.</p>
<p>We demonstrate the validity of our conditional-sibling analytical derivations through simulations and show that our tests for identifying <italic>de novo</italic> and Mendelian architecture in the tails of trait distributions are well-powered when high-impact alleles are present in the population on the order of 1 out of 1000 individuals. We apply our tests to six traits using UK Biobank data and find evidence for <italic>de novo</italic> architecture in the distribution tails of heel bone mineral density, monocyte count, mean corpuscular hemoglobin and sitting height, as well as Mendelian architecture in the upper tail of body fat.</p>
<p>There are several areas in which our work could have short-term utility. Firstly, those individuals inferred as having rare variants of high-impact could be followed up in multiple ways to gain individual-level insights. For example, they could undergo clinical genetic testing to identify potential pathogenic variants with effects beyond the examined trait, either in the form of diseases or disorders that the individual has already been diagnosed with or else that they have yet to present with but may be at high future risk for. Furthermore, investigation of their environmental risk profile may indicate an alternative - environmental - explanation for their extreme trait value (see below), rather than the rare genetic architecture inferred by our tests.</p>
<p>Our framework could also help to refine the design of sequencing studies for identifying rare variants of large effect. Such studies either sequence entire cohorts at relatively high cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>) or else perform more targeted sequencing of individuals in the trait tails with the goal of optimising power per cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). However, even the latter approach is usually performed blind to evidence of enrichment of rare variant aetiology in the tails. Since our approach enables identification of individuals most likely to harbour rare variants, then these individuals could be prioritised for (deep) sequencing. Moreover, our ability to distinguish between <italic>de novo</italic> and Mendelian architecture could influence the broad study design, with the former suggesting that a family trio design may be more effective than population sequencing, which may be favoured if Mendelian architecture is inferred. Furthermore, our approach could be applied as a screening step to prioritise those traits, and corresponding tails, most likely to harbour rare variant architecture. Finally, if sequence data have already been collected, either cohort-wide or using a more targeted design, then our approach could be utilised to increase the power of statistical methods for detecting rare variants by upweighting individuals most likely to harbour rare variants.</p>
<p>This study has several limitations. First and foremost, departures from the expected conditional-sibling trait distributions could be due to environmental risk factors, such as medication-use or work related exposures, rather than rare genetic architecture. For this reason, rejections of the null hypothesis from our tests should be considered only as indicating effects <italic>consistent with</italic> non-polygenic genetic architecture, alongside alternative explanations such as tail-specific environmental risks. We suggest that further investigation of individuals’ clinical, environmental and genetic profiles are required to achieve greater certainty about the causes of their extreme trait values. Nevertheless, given knowledge that rare variants of high-impact contribute to complex trait architecture, then we expect that traits for which we infer non-polygenic architecture, will, on average, be more enriched for rare architecture in the tail(s) than other traits. Secondly, our modelling assumes that environmental risk factors of siblings are independent of each other. If in fact shared environmental risk factors contribute significantly to trait similarity among siblings, then our heritability estimates will be upwardly biased. However, this would only impact our tests if the degree of shared environmental risk differed in the trail tails relative to the rest of the trait distribution. Moreover, a large meta-analysis of heritability estimates from twin studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>) concluded that the contribution of shared environment among siblings (even twins) is insubstantial, and so we might expect this to have limited impact on results from our tests. Thirdly, our modelling assumes random mating and so the results from our tests in relation to traits that may be the subject of assortative mating should be considered with caution. Likewise, our modelling assumes additivity of genetic effects and so, while additivity is well-supported by much statistical genetics research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>), results from our tests should be reconsidered for any traits with evidence for significant non-additive genetic effects.</p>
<p>Our approach not only provides a novel way of inferring genetic architecture (without genetic data) but can do so specifically in the tails of trait distributions, which are most likely to harbour complex genetic architecture, due to selection, and are a key focus in biomedical research given their enrichment for disease. This work could also have broader implications in quantitative genetics since we derive fundamental results about the relationship among family members’ complex trait values. The conditional-sibling trait distribution provides a simple way of understanding the expected trait values of individuals according to their sibling’s trait value, which could be used to answer questions of societal importance and inform future research. For example, it can be used to answer questions such as: as a consequence of genetics alone, how much overlap should there be in the traits of offspring of midparents at the 5<sup><italic>th</italic></sup> and 95<sup><italic>th</italic></sup> percentile and how does that contrast with what we observe in highly structured societies? Moreover, further development of the theory described here could lead to a range of other applications, for example, estimating levels of assortative mating, inferring historical selection pressures, and quantifying heritability in specific strata of the population.</p>

<title>Derivation of Conditional Sibling Distributions</title>
<p>Here we derive the distribution that describes the probability density of the “conditional” sibling (<italic>S</italic><sub>2</sub>) given the genetic liability, z-value, case-status, or rank of one or more index siblings relative to the population. In each case we assume a population of unrelated parents and rely on the results from the <italic>infinitesimal polygenic model</italic> that show that within family variance is normally distributed around midparent genetic liability (average of parents) with half the ancestral trait variance even when selection, drift, population structure or dominance effects alter the between family trait distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>).</p>
<sec id="s5">
<title>Case 1) Index Liability Known, Continuous Trait (<italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup> = 1): <italic>P</italic>(<italic>S</italic><sub>2</sub> | <italic>S</italic><sub>1</sub> = <italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub>)</title>
<p>We begin with the simplest case, a polygenic normally distributed trait which is fully heritable (<italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup> = 1) where the genetic liability of an index sibling in a population is known. Throughout we denote the midparent, index sibling and conditional sibling by <italic>M, S</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>S</italic><sub>2</sub>. We begin by calculating the midparent distribution conditional on index liability using Bayes theorem:
<disp-formula id="eqn10">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="529159v1_eqn10.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Then using the following identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>):
<disp-formula id="eqn11">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="529159v1_eqn11.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>

<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="529159v1_eqn12.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Thus, as predicted by the <italic>infinitesimal polygenic model</italic> the conditional sibling liability is normally distributed around the midparent liability distribution with additional variance equal to half the population liability variance.</p>

<p>In this case, the primary result considered in this manuscript, a trait z-value, or equivalently, the percentile rank of an index sibling in genome wide association where the rank-based inverse transformation has been applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>) is known.

<p>The previous case can also be derived using the joint trait distribution for related individuals:

While the authors' derivations of the method are correct, the scenarios considered are <bold>incomplete</bold>, making it difficult to have confidence in the interpretation of the results as demonstrating the influence of de-novo or Mendelian (rare, penetrant-variant) architectures.

<p>The authors sought to craft a method, applicable to biobank-scale data but without necessarily using genotyping or sequencing, to detect the presence of de novo mutations and rare variants that stand out from the polygenic background of a given trait. Their method depends essentially on sibling pairs where one sibling is in an extreme tail of the phenotypic distribution and whether the other sibling's regression to the mean shows a systematic deviation from what is expected under a simple polygenic architecture.</p>
<p>Their method is successful in that it builds on a compelling intuition, rests on a rigorous derivation, and seems to show reasonable statistical power in the UK Biobank. (More biobanks of this size will probably become available in the near future.) It is somewhat unsuccessful in that rejection of the null hypothesis does not necessarily point to the favored hypothesis of de novo or rare variants. The authors discuss the alternative possibility of rare environmental events of large effect. Maybe attention should be drawn to this in the abstract or the introduction of the paper. Nevertheless, since either of these possibilities is interesting, the method remains valuable.</p>

<p>Souaiaia et al. attempt to use sibling phenotype data to infer aspects of genetic architecture affecting the extremes of the trait distribution. They do this by considering deviations from the expected joint distribution of siblings' phenotypes under the standard additive genetic model, which forms their null model. They ascribe excess similarity compared to the null as due to rare variants shared between siblings (which they term 'Mendelian') and excess dissimilarity as due to de-novo variants. While this is a nice idea, there can be many explanations for rejection of their null model, which clouds interpretation of Souaiaia et al.'s empirical results.</p>
<p>The authors present their method as detecting aspects of genetic architecture affecting the extremes of the trait distribution. However, I think it would be better to characterize the method as detecting whether siblings are more or less likely to be aggregated in the extremes of the phenotype distribution than would be predicted under a common variant, additive genetic model.</p>
<p>Exactly how the rareness and penetrance of a genetic variant influence the conditional sibling phenotype distribution at the extremes is not made clear. The contrast between de-novo and 'Mendelian' architectures is somewhat odd since these are highly related phenomena: a 'Mendelian' architecture could be due to a de-novo variant of the previous generation. The fact that these two phenomena are surmised to give opposing signatures in the authors' statistical tests seems suboptimal to me: would it not be better to specify a parameter that characterizes the degree or sharing between siblings of rare factors of large effect? This could be related to the mixture components in the bimodal distribution displayed in Fig 1. In fact, won't the extremes of all phenotypes be influenced by all three types of variants (common, rare, de-novo) to greater or lesser degree? By framing the problem as a hypothesis testing problem, I think the authors are obscuring the fact that the extremes of real phenotypes likely reflect a mixture of causes: common, de-novo, and rare variants (and shared and non-shared environmental factors).</p>
<p>To better enable interpretation of the results of this method, a more comprehensive set of simulations is needed. Factors that may influence the conditional distribution of siblings' phenotypes beyond those considered include: non-normal distribution, assortative mating, shared environment, interactions between genetic and shared environmental factors, and genetic interactions.</p>
<p>In summary, I think this is a promising method that is revealing something interesting about extreme values of phenotypes. Determining exactly what is being revealed is going to take a lot more work, however.</p>

<p>The major criticism from the reviewers is that factors other than high-impact rare variants – such as environmental factors or epistasis – could have produced the complex tail architecture that we test for and detect.
While we did explain this point in the Discussion, we agree with the reviewers that this should have been emphasized more and earlier in the manuscript.</p>
<p>Regarding suggestions for more complex simulations and methods, we absolutely agree that much more work is needed here to produce optimised inference of all the causes of complex tail architecture. We are performing multiple projects at various stages of completion that we hope will contribute to this, but we felt that this was a good stopping-point in this project to publish what we had completed so far, in order to: (1) introduce the idea of inferring complex genetic architecture from siblings without requiring genetic data, (2) outline an initial theoretical framework for inferring complex tail architecture from sibling data, (3) provide simple tests powered to identify enrichments of de novo or ‘Mendelian’ variants in the tails (albeit tests that make several strong simplifying assumptions), (4) enable others interested in the topic to build upon this work now. However, we plan to expand our simulations and analyses in a revised manuscript based on reviewer feedback.</p>
<p>We thank the reviewers for their comments about the value of our work, its mathematical robustness and the promise of our method.</p>
