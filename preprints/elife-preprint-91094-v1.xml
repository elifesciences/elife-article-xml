<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Structural and functional studies of the ATP-binding cassette transporter MsbA have revealed two distinct lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding sites: one located in the central cavity and the other at a membrane-facing, exterior site. Although these binding sites are known to be important for MsbA function, the thermodynamic basis for these specific MsbA-LPS interactions is not well understood. Here, we use native mass spectrometry to determine the thermodynamics of MsbA interacting with the LPS-precursor 3-deoxy-D-<italic>manno</italic>-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo)<sub>2</sub>-lipid A (KDL). The binding of KDL is solely driven by entropy, despite the transporter adopting an inward-facing conformation or trapped in an outward-facing conformation with adenosine 5’-diphosphate and vanadate. Double and single mutant cycles reveal that pairwise residues engage KDL with a positive coupling energy, which stems from positive coupling entropy (as large as -100 kJ/mol at 298K) outweighing unfavorable coupling enthalpy. Our results provide new insight into how pairwise interactions can thermodynamically contribute to specific, high-affinity lipid binding in membrane proteins, which may have implications in the design of small molecules targeting specific lipid-protein interactions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Most Gram-negative bacteria contain outer membrane lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that is crucial for maintaining structural integrity and protection from toxins and antibiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. The <bold>A</bold>TP-<bold>B</bold>inding <bold>C</bold>assette (ABC) transporter MsbA flips an LPS-precursor, lipooligosaccharide (LOS), from the cytosolic leaflet to the periplasmic leaflet of inner membrane, a process powered by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). MsbA functions as a homodimer and each subunit consists of a soluble nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and a transmembrane domain containing six transmembrane helices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. The proposed mechanism of MsbA-mediated LOS transportation involves the binding of LOS to the interior binding site and a conformational change from an inward-facing conformation (IF) to an outward-facing conformation (OF).</p>
<p>Like other ABC transporters, the ATPase activity of MsbA can be stimulated in the presence of different substrates, particularly hexaacylated lipid A species.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> Recent studies show that the locations and importance of several LOS binding sites on MsbA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. The interior binding site is located in the inner cavity, and mutations (R78A, R148A and K299A) engineered to disrupt binding at this site abolish lipid-induced ATPase activity and adversely affect cell growth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> More recently, the LPS-precursor 3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic (Kdo)2-lipid A (KDL) was found to bind to an exterior site on MsbA trapped in an OF conformation with adenosine 5’-diphosphate and vanadate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Similarly, introducing mutations to disrupt binding at the exterior site also abolishes lipid-induced stimulation of ATPase activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 1984, Fersht and colleagues introduced the biochemistry community to the application of double mutant cycles as means to quantify the strength of intramolecular and intermolecular interactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> The method has proven to be highly effective in examining pairwise interactions, as demonstrated by its notable application in determining the spatial orientation of potassium channel residues in relation to high-affinity toxin binding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> More generally, the technique has been used to measure the strength and coupling for residues in protein-protein complexes, protein-ligand complexes, and electrostatic interactions of residues in alpha helices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> In general, mutant cycles analysis involves measuring the change Gibbs free energy for some process, such as ligand binding to the wild-type protein (P), two single point mutations (PX and PY) and the double mutant protein (PXY) (for review see <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>). If residue X and Y are independent of each other, then the Gibbs free energy associated with the double mutant protein will be equal to the sum of changes in Gibbs free energy due to the single mutations relative to the wild-type protein. However, if the Gibbs free energy associated with the structural and functional properties of the double mutant protein differs from the sum of single mutant proteins, then the two residues are energetically coupled. The coupling free energy (ΔΔG<sub>int</sub>) is the energy difference between double mutant and two single mutant proteins (see methods). The ΔΔG<sub>int</sub> values for pairwise interactions in proteins has revealed the contributions of salt bridges (4-20 kJ/mol), aromatic-aromatic interactions (4 kJ/mol), and charge-aromatic interactions (4 kJ/mol) to protein stability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Native mass spectrometry (MS) is well suited to characterize the interactions between protein and other molecules, especially for membrane proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> The technique is capable of maintaining non-covalent interactions and native-like structure in the gas phase,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> essential for studying biochemical interactions with small molecules, such as the binding of drugs, lipids, and nucleotides.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> In combination with a variable temperature nano electrospray ionization device, native MS has determined the thermodynamics for protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> For example, the molecular interaction between the signaling lipid 4,5-bisphosphate phosphatidylinositol and Kir3.2 is dominated by a large, favorable change in entropy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> Recently, native MS has been combined with mutant cycles analysis to determine the energetic contribution of pairwise inter-protein interactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> Notably, the coupling energies determined by native MS and isothermal calorimetry are in agreement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recently, we reported results using native MS that reveal conformation-dependent lipid binding affinities to MsbA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> As these measurements were performed at a single temperature, we set out to perform a more detailed thermodynamic analysis to better understand the molecular driving forces that underpin specific MsbA-lipid interactions. Here, we report binding thermodynamics (ΔH, ΔS, and ΔG) for KDL binding to MsbA in IF and OF conformations. We also carried out mutant cycles analysis to interrogate KDL binding to the exterior and interior sites on MsbA. These results reveal the unique thermodynamic contributions of MsbA residues that engage KDL. We also report coupling energetics (ΔΔG<sub>int</sub>) for pairwise interactions, including the contributions from coupling enthalpy (ΔΔH<sub>int</sub>) and coupling entropy (Δ(-TΔS<sub>int</sub>)), providing rich molecular insight specific protein-lipid interactions.</p>

<title>MsbA residues selected for mutant cycles analyses</title>
<p>MsbA is known to bind LOS either in the inner cavity or at the two exterior sites (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref></bold>). For both sites, a series of conserved arginine and lysine residues form specific interactions with the headgroup of LOS. To perform mutant cycles analysis, we introduced single mutations into MsbA to target LOS binding to the interior (MsbA<sup>R78A</sup> and MsbA<sup>R299A</sup>) and exterior (MsbA<sup>R188A</sup>, MsbA<sup>R238A</sup>, and MsbA<sup>K243A</sup>) sites. More specifically, R78 coordinates one of the characteristic phosphoglucosamine (P-GlcN) substituents of LOS whereas K299 interacts with a carboxylic acid group in the headgroup of LOS. The two P-GlcN constituents of LOS are coordinated by R238 and R188 + K243, respectively. R188 also forms an additional hydrogen bond with the headgroup of LOS. In addition, we prepared double and triple mutants of MsbA for the various residues that were selected for mutagenesis.</p>

<title>Thermodynamics of MsbA-KDL interactions</title>
<p>We performed titrations to determine the equilibrium binding affinity for MsbA-KDL interactions at four different temperatures (288, 293, 298 and 303 K) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref></bold>). The transporter was stable at the selected temperatures. For example, binding of KDL to MsbA was enhanced at higher temperatures (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref></bold>), indicating a favorable entropy for the interaction. For a given temperature, the mass spectra from the titration series were deconvoluted and equilibrium dissociation constants (K<sub>D</sub>) were determined for MsbA binding up to three KDL molecules (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1</bold>). Interestingly, van’ t Hoff analysis showed a non-linear trend for three KDL binding reactions (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref></bold>), indicating that over the selected temperature range, heat capacity is not constant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> The nonlinear form of the van’t Hoff equation enabled us to determine the ΔH and change in heat capacity (ΔC<sub>p</sub>) at a reference temperature of 2981K (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2c-d</xref></bold>). In this case, ΔG was calculated directly from K<sub>D</sub> values, and entropy (ΔS) was back calculated using both ΔH and ΔG. ΔG values for binding KDL<sub>1-2</sub> range from -32.0 ± 0.1 to -35.2 ± 0.1 kJ/mol. The binding reaction has a positive ΔC<sub>p</sub> that alters the thermodynamic parameters at different temperatures. At the lowest temperature, KDL binding is driven by favorable enthalpy (-36 ± 12 to -43 ± 7 kJ/mol) with a small entropically penalty (-TΔS, 2 ± 11 to 12 ± 7 kJ/mol at 288 K).</p>

<p>In contrast, KDL binding at higher temperatures displays a large, favorable entropy (-TΔS, -123 ± 12 to -146 ± 7 kJ/mol at 303 K) that compensates a large enthalpic barrier (86 ± 12 to 112 ± 7 kJ/mol). These results highlight the role of entropy in LOS binding to MsbA that may stem from solvent reorganization.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>KDL binding to the interior binding site of MsbA</title>
<p>We next determined the thermodynamics of KDL binding to MsbA containing single and double mutations at the interior binding site (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2d</xref></bold>). MsbA<sup>R78A</sup> showed a reduction in binding KDL with ΔG ranging from -30.2 ± 0.2 to -32.5 ± 0.2 kJ/mol. At 298K, KDL binding is enthalpically and entropically favorable whereas binding of the second KDL is similar to the wild-type protein (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref></bold>). The binding thermodynamics for MsbA<sup>K299A</sup> is reminiscent of the wild-type protein with a large, favorable change in entropy (-TΔS, -75 ± 2 to -86 ± 1 kJ/mol at 298 K) and unfavorable enthalpy (43 ± 2 to 53 ± 1 kJ/mol) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref></bold>). The double mutant MsbA<sup>R78A,K299A</sup> protein shows a reduction in opposing entropic and enthalpic terms leading to an increase in ΔG by ∼4 kJ/mol (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref></bold>). Mutant cycle analysis indicates a coupling energy (ΔΔG<sub>int</sub>) of 1.7 ± 0.4 kJ/mol that contributes to the stability of KDL-MsbA complex (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary Table 3</bold>). Interestingly, the coupling enthalpy (ΔΔH<sub>int</sub> of -26 ± 15 kJ/mol) and coupling entropy (Δ(-TΔS)<sub>int</sub> of 28 ± 15 kJ/mol at 298K) indicating that these residues contribute to KDL binding through an entropy driven process that overcomes an enthalpic barrier(<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary Table 3</bold>).</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>KDL binding to the exterior binding site of MsbA</title>
<p>The recently discovered exterior KDL binding site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> located on the cytosolic leaflet of inner membrane has not been thoroughly investigated, prompting us to characterize this site by a triple mutant cycle (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref></bold>). We first investigated R188 and K243, residues that both interact with one of the P-GlcN moieties of LOS. Both MsbA<sup>R188A</sup> and MsbA<sup>K243A</sup>single mutants marginally weakened the interaction by about 2 kJ/mol (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a</xref></bold>). Enthalpy and entropy for KDL binding MsbA<sup>R188A</sup> was largely similar to the wild-type protein (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a</xref></bold>). However, the R243A mutation resulted in an increase in entropy, compensated for by an increase in positive enthalpy (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a</xref></bold>). ΔG for MsbA<sup>R188A,K243A</sup> was comparable to the K243A single mutant form of the protein (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a</xref></bold>). The positive coupling energy of 3.2 ± 0.4 kJ/mol with contributions from a coupling enthalpy of 19 ± 11 kJ/mol and a coupling entropy of -16 ± 12 kJ/mol at 298K (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3b</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary Table 3</bold>). MsbA containing the R238A mutation significantly weakened the interaction with KDL, increasing ΔG by nearly 5 kJ/mol (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3b</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary Table 3</bold>). Combining this mutation with R188A, decreased ΔH by 57 kJ/mol at the cost of increasing-TΔS by 64 kJ/mol at 298K (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3b</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary Table 3</bold>). The coupling energy for R188A and R238A is approximately zero as a result of equal coupling enthalpy and entropy of different signs. Compared to the wild-type protein, MsbA<sup>R238A,K243A</sup> results in an inversion of the thermodynamic signature with binding now being driven by enthalpy. More specifically, this inversion is accompanied by ΔΔH and Δ(-TΔS) of -93 ± 7 kJ/mol and 99 ± 7 kJ/mol at 298K (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3b</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary Table 3</bold>). Again, the coupling enthalpy and entropy (at 298K) of equal magnitude but opposite signs give rise to a coupling energy of zero for R238A and R243A (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3b</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary Table 3</bold>). Introduction of the R188A mutation into MsbA<sup>R238A,K243A</sup>, results in reversal of the thermodynamic signature to mirror that of MsbA<sup>R188A,K243A</sup> (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a</xref>)</bold>. The coupling energy, coupling enthalpy, and coupling entropy for R188A, R238A and R243A are 3.4 ± 0.5 kJ/mol, 100 ± 16 kJ/mol, and -97 ± 16 kJ/mol at 298K (<bold>Supplementary Table 4</bold>), respectively. Taken together, these results demonstrate KDL binding to MsbA is sensitive to mutations at both the interior and exterior sites.</p>

<title>Dissecting KDL binding to the interior and exterior site(s) of MsbA</title>
<p>An open question is if the interior and exterior LOS binding sites of MsbA are allosterically coupled?

MsbA containing the R188A and K299A mutations drastically reduced the binding of KDL (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4a</xref></bold>). The ΔG for MsbA<sup>R188A,K299A</sup> increased by more than 6 kJ/mol compared to the wild-type protein (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4b</xref></bold>). This approximately doubles compared to MsbA containing either of the single point mutations. Mutant cycle analysis revealed a negative coupling energy of -1.1 ± 0.4 kJ/mol that partitioned into a coupling enthalpy of -36 ± 13 kJ/mol and coupling entropy of 34 ± 13 kJ/mol at 298K (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary Table 3</bold>). In short, mutations at either LOS binding site have a negative impact on binding that is accompanied by a gain in both favorable entropy and unfavorable enthalpy.</p>

<title>Mutant cycle analysis of KDL binding to vanadate-trapped MsbA</title>
<p>The structure of KDL bound to MsbA was determined with the transporter trapped in an open, OF conformation with ADP and vanadate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> After trapping the transporter in a similar fashion, we characterized the binding of KDL to MsbA and proteins containing single R188A, R238A, and K243A mutations. Here, we focused on the binding of the first and second lipid, since MsbA has two, symmetrically related KDL binding sites in the open, OF conformation. Thermodynamics of MsbA(KDL)<sub>1-2</sub> binding is like the non-trapped transporter, wherein entropy (-TΔS ranging from -58 ± 1 to -69 ± 1 kJ/mol at 298K) is more favorable than a positive enthalpic term (ΔH ranging from 22 ± 1 to 35 ± 1 kJ/mol) (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref></bold>). The single mutant proteins (MsbA<sup>R188A</sup>, MsbA<sup>R238A</sup>, and MsbA<sup>K243A</sup>) showed a slight increase in ΔG (at most 5 kJ/mol) (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref></bold>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Thermodynamics provide unique insight into the molecular forces that drive specific MsbA-KDL interactions. A recurring thermodynamic strategy for specific KDL-MsbA interactions is a large, favorable entropic term that opposes a positive enthalpic value. The human G-protein-gated inward rectifier potassium channel (Kir3.2) also used a similar thermodynamic strategy to engage phosphoinositides (PIPs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> The large, positive entropy could stem from solvent reorganization of lipid headgroup containing carbohydrate groups, and desolvation of hydrated binding pockets on the membrane protein. The release of these ordered water molecules to bulk solvent contributes favorably to entropy. These experiments are performed in detergent and reorganization of detergent may also play a role. Previous work has shown soluble protein-ligand interactions can be driven by a large, positive entropy term that outweighs a large, positive enthalpic penalty.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> In these cases, the reaction is mainly driven by conformational entropy originating in enhanced protein motions. However, it is unclear if the conformational dynamics of MsbA are enhanced when bound to KDL.</p>
<p>Most of the van’ t Hoff plots followed non-linear trends. This results indicate that C<sub>p</sub> is not constant over the selected temperature range.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> In nearly all cases, a positive ΔC was observed that ranged from 4 to 12 kJ/mol·K (<bold>Supplementary Table 2, 6</bold>). Solvation of polar groups in aqueous solvent has been ascribed to positive heat capacities whereas negative for apolar solvation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> Reorganization of the hydrated, polar headgroups of KD is consistent with the positive heat capacity observed here. However, change in heat capacity could also be ascribed to temperature-dependent conformational changes in MsbA and/or KDL. Notably, vanadate-trapped MsbA locked in an open, OF conformation should be less conformationally dynamic than the apo protein, which is known to adopt a number of open, IF conformations where the NBDs are separated at different distances. Similar positive heat capacities were observed for the different conformations, suggesting the dynamics of MsbA marginally contribute to the observed non-linear trends. Notably, the headgroup of KDL is nestled in a hydrophilic, basic patch of MsbA in the open, OF conformation. Similarly, the headgroup of PIP binds a hydrophilic, basic pocket in Kir3.2. These hydrophilic patches will be highly solvated, which will be desolvated upon binding lipids contributing to entropy. In the case of MsbA, the selected lysine and arginine residues separation (based alpha carbon position) that ranges about 9 to 18 Å (PDB 8DMM). This distance could result in overlap of solvation shells that collectively contribute to the positive coupling enthalpy observed for MsbA-KDL interactions.</p>
<p>Thermodynamics of MsbA-lipid interactions contrast those observed for a different membrane protein. Phospholipid binding to the bacterial ammonia channel (AmtB) were largely driven by enthalpy and, in most cases, entropy was unfavorable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> Another interesting observation for AmtB-lipid interactions was significant enthalpy-entropy compensation for each sequential lipid binding event. Here, enthalpy-entropy compensation is not as pronounced. This result may reflect the much higher-affinity and specific MsbA-KDL interactions compared to the weaker AmtB-lipid interactions.</p>
<p>Results of this study begin to draw a connection between LOS binding at the interior and exterior sites of MsbA. It is presently thought that flipping of LOS occurs at interior MsbA site, and the exterior LOS binding site enables feedforward activation, wherein binding of LOS and precursors thereof stimulates ATPase activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> It is also thought that binding of LOS and ATP promotes dimerization of the NBDs. Here, we find mutations at either the interior or exterior sites have a direct impact of KDL binding MsbA, which under these conditions is presumably adopting an open, IF conformation. Of the mutant proteins, MsbA containing single mutations (MsbA<sup>R188A,K299A</sup>) at both LOS binding sites resulted in the greatest change in ΔG. This result implies that these sites are allosterically coupled and further investigation is warranted to better understand how the exterior LOS binding sites influence MsbA dynamics.</p>
<p>A defining feature of this work is the use of mutant cycles to not only characterize specific membrane protein-lipid interactions but define the coupling energies of pairwise interactions in terms of enthalpic and entropic contributions. Traditionally, mutant cycles have been used to understand pairwise interactions of residues, such as in protein-protein complexes. Here, we extend mutant cycles to understand how pairs of residues contribute to specific MsbA-KDL interactions. Double mutants targeting the interior site reveal a positive coupling energy of nearly 2 kJ/mol for R78 and K299. These stabilize the MsbA-KDL complex largely through nearly 17 kJ/mol of favorable coupling entropy, which outweighs a negative coupling enthalpy. This phenomenon extends to nearly all mutant cycles investigated in this work, even when the transporter is trapped with vanadate. The largest coupling energy is observed from the triple mutant cycle of R188A, R238A and R243A, which again stabilization of the complex was achieved via favorable coupling entropy. While we focused on results at 298K, the coupling energetics among these three residues show 3.4 ± 0.5 kJ/mol. Taken together, mutant cycle analysis reveals that entropy drives high-affinity KDL binding to MsbA where solvent reorganization plays a central role (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>The lipid headgroup and binding pocket (basic patch illustrated in blue) on the membrane protein are solvated. The ordered solvent (shown in light blue) is then displaced upon lipid binding the membrane protein leading to solvent reorganization. The displacement of ordered solvent (show in light green) contributes to favorable entropy. This process enables the formation of a high affinity, stable membrane protein-lipid complex.</p></caption>

<p>In summary, we demonstrate the utility of native MS to determine the thermodynamic origins of specific KDL-MsbA interactions. Combined with the classical mutant cycle approach,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> the thermodynamic contribution of specific interactions with lipids is illuminated. More specifically, MsbA binding KDL is solely driven by entropy, which overcomes an enthalpic penalty. This thermodynamic strategy was also observed for Kir3.2-PIP interactions. It is tempting to speculate that favorable entropy is a common theme enabling membrane proteins to specifically engage carbohydrate containing lipids. We envision thermodynamics and mutant cycles will be invaluable in not only better understanding high-affinity lipid binding sites but also in the development of inhibitors, such as those that may target specific protein-lipid binding site(s). In closing, these studies provide deeper insight into the thermodynamic strategies membrane proteins adopt to achieve high-affinity lipid binding site(s).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The preprint by Laganowsky and co-workers describes the use of mutant cycles to dissect the thermodynamic profile of specific lipid recognition by the ABC transporter MsbA. The authors use native mass spectrometry with a variable temperature source to monitor lipid binding to the native protein dimer solubilized in detergent. Analysis of the peak intensities (that is, relative abundance) of 1-3 bound lipids as a function of solution temperature and lipid concentration yields temperature-dependent Kds. The authors use these to then generate van't Hoff plots, from which they calculate the enthalpy and entropy contributions to binding of one, two, and in some cases, three lipids to MsbA.</p>
<p>
The authors then employ mutant cycles, in which basic residues involved in headgroup binding are mutated to alanine. By comparing the thermodynamic signatures of single and double (and in one instance triple) mutants, they aim to identify cooperativity between the different positions. They furthermore use inward and outward locking conditions which should control access to the different binding sites determined previously.</p>
<p>
The main conclusion is that lipid binding to MsbA is driven mainly by energetically favorable entropy increase upon binding, which stems from the release of ordered water molecules that normally coordinate the basic residues, which helps to overcome the enthalpic barrier of lipid binding. The authors also report an increase in lipid binding at higher temperatures which they attribute to a non-uniform heat capacity of the protein. Although they find that most residue pairs display some degree of cooperativity, particularly between the inner and outer lipid binding sites, they do not provide a structural interpretation of these results.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The use of double mutant cycles and mass spectrometry to dissect lipid binding is novel and interesting. For example, the observation that mutating a basic residue in the inner and one in the outer binding site abolishes lipid binding to a greater extent than the individual mutations is highly informative even without having to break it down into thermodynamic terms (see &quot;weaknesses&quot; section). In this sense, the method and data reported here opens new avenues for the structure/activity relationship of MsbA. The &quot;mutant cycle&quot; approach is in principle widely applicable to other membrane proteins with complex lipid interactions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The use of double mutant cycles to dissect binding energies is well-established, and has, as the authors point out, been employed in combination with mass spectrometry to study protein-protein interactions. Its application to extract thermodynamic parameters is robust in cases where a single binding event is monitored, e.g. the formation of a complex with well-defined stoichiometry, where dissociation constants can be determined with high confidence. It is, however, complicated significantly by the fact that for MsbA-lipid interactions, we are not looking at a single binding event, but a stochastic distribution of lipids across different sites. Even if the protein is locked in a specific conformation, the observation of a single lipid adduct does not guarantee that the one lipid is always bound to a specific site. In some of the complexes detected by MS, the lipid is likely bound somewhere else. Lipid binding Kds from mass spectrometry, although helpful in some instances as a proxy for global binding affinities, should therefore be taken with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>The authors analyze the difference in binding upon mutating binding sites (ddG etc). Here, another complicating factor comes into play, the fact that mutation of a binding site (which the authors show reduces lipid binding) may instead allow the lipid to bind to a lower-affinity site elsewhere. Unfortunately, the authors do not specify the protein concentration, but assuming it is in the single-digit micromolar range, as common for native MS experiments, lipid and protein concentrations are almost equal for most of the data points, resulting in competition between binding sites for free lipids. As a rule of thumb, for Kd measurements, the concentration of the constant component, the protein, should be far below the Kd, to avoid working in the &quot;titration&quot; regime rather than the &quot;binding&quot; regime (see Jarmoskaite et al, eLife 2020). I cannot determine whether this is the case here. The way I understand the double mutant cycle approach, reliable Kd measurements are required to accurately determine dH and TdS, so I would encourage the authors to confirm their Kd values using complementary methods before in-depth interpretations of the thermodynamic components.</p>
<p>It is somewhat counterintuitive that for many double mutants, and the triple mutant, the entropic component becomes more favorable compared to the WT protein. If the increase in entropy upon lipid binding comes from the release of ordered water molecules around the basic residues (a reasonable assumption) why does this apply even more in proteins where several basic residues have been changed to alanine, which coordinate far fewer water molecules?</p>
<p>The authors could devote more attention to the fact that they use detergent micelles as a vehicle for lipid binding studies. To a limited extent, detergents compete with lipids for binding, and are present in extreme excess over the lipid. The micelle likely changes its behavior in response to temperature changes. For example, the packing around the protein loosens up upon heating, which may increase the chance for lipids to bind. In this case, the increase in binding at higher temperatures may not be related to a change in heat capacity. This question could be addressed by MD simulations, if it's not already in the literature.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This is a solid study that dissects the thermodynamics of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) transporter MsbA and LPS. Native ESI-MS and the novel strategies developed by the authors were employed to quantify the affinities of LPS-MsbA interactions and its temperature dependence. Here, the equilibrium of lipid-protein interactions occurs in the micellar phase. The double-/triple-mutant cycle analysis and van't Hoff analysis allowed a full thermodynamic description of the lipid-protein interactions and the analysis of thermodynamic coupling between LPS binding sites. The most notable result would be that LPS-MsbA interaction is largely driven by entropy involving the negative heat capacity, a signature of the solvent reorganization effect (here authors attribute the solvent effect to &quot;water&quot; reorganization). The entropy driven lipid binding has been previously reported by the same authors for Kir1,2-PIP2 interactions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>1. This is overall a very thorough and rigorous study providing the detailed thermodynamic principles of LPS-MsbA interaction.</p>
<p>2. The double and triple-mutant cycle approaches are newly applied to lipid-protein interactions, enabling detailed thermodynamics between LPS binding sites.</p>
<p>3. The entropy-driven protein-lipid interaction is surprising. The binding seems to be mainly mediated by the electrostatic interaction between the positively charged residues on the protein and the negatively charged or polar headgroup of LPS, which could be thought of as &quot;enthalpic&quot; (making of a strong bond relative to that with solvent).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. This study is a good contribution to the field, but it was difficult to find novel biological insights or methodological novelty from this study.</p>
<p>1a) Thermodynamic analysis of lipid-protein interactions, an example of entropy-driven lipid-protein interactions, and the cooperativity between lipid binding sites have been reported by the author's group. Also, the cooperativity between binding sites in general have been reported from numerous studies of biomolecular interactions.</p>
<p>1b) It is not clear how this study provides new insights into the understanding of LPS transport mechanisms. Probably, authors could strengthen the Discussion by providing biological insights-how the residue coupling.</p>
<p>1. One to three LPS molecules bind to MsbA, but it is unclear whether bound KDL occupies inner or outer cavities, or both and how a specific mutation affects the affinity of specific LPS (i.e., to inner or to outer cavities). Based on the known structures, the maximal number of LPS is three. It is possible that the inner and outer cavities have different LPS affinities. Also, there can be multiple one-LPS-bound states, two-LPS-bound states if LPS strictly binds to the binding sites indicated by the structures. This aspect is beyond the scope of this study and difficult to address, but without this information, it seems hard to tell what is going on in the system.</p>
<p>2. If a single mutation is introduced to the inner cavity, its effect will be &quot;doubled&quot; because the inner cavity is shared by two identical subunits. This effect needs to be clarified in the result section.</p>
<p>3. In the result section, &quot;Mutant cycle analysis of KDL binding to vanadate-trapped MsbA.&quot;:</p>
<p>4a) It seems necessary to show the mass spectra for Msb-ADP-vanadate complex as well as its lipid bound forms.</p>
<p>4b) The rationale of this section (i.e., what mechanistic insights can be obtained from this study) is unclear. For example, it is not sure what meaningful information can be obtained from a single type (ADP/vanadate) of the bound state regarding the ATP-driven function of MsbA.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this paper presented by Liu et al, native MS on the lipid A transporter MsbA was used to obtain thermodynamic insight into protein-lipid interactions. By performing the analyses at different lipid A concentrations and temperatures, dissociation constants for 2-3 lipid A binding sites were determined, as well as enthalpies were calculated using non-linear van't Hoff fitting. Changes in free Gibb's energies were then calculated based on the determined dissociation constants, and together with the enthalpy values obtained via van' t Hoff analysis, the entropic contribution to lipid binding (DeltaS*T) was indirectly determined.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This is an extensive high quality native MS dataset that provides unique opportunities to gain insights into the thermodynamic parameters underlying lipid A binding. In addition, it provides coupling energies between mutations introduced into MsbA, that are implicated in lipid A binding.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The data all rely on the accuracy of determining KD values for lipid binding to MsbA. For the weaker binding sites, the range of lipid concentrations probed were in fact too low to generate highly accurate data. Another weakness is a lack of clear evidence, which KD values belong to which of the possible lipid A binding sites.</p>
