<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Breakdown of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) is an early pathological hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) that blocks neuromuscular transmission, leading to muscle weakness, paralysis and, ultimately, premature death. Currently, no therapies exist that can prevent progressive motor neuron degeneration, muscle denervation or paralysis in ALS. Here, we report important advances in the development of an optogenetic, neural replacement strategy that can effectively restore innervation of severely affected skeletal muscles in the aggressive SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mouse model of ALS, thus providing an interface to selectively control the function of targeted muscles using optical stimulation. We also identify a specific approach to confer complete survival of allogeneic replacement motor neurons. Furthermore, we demonstrate that an optical stimulation training paradigm can prevent atrophy of reinnervated muscle fibers and results in a 10-fold increase in optically-evoked contractile force. Together, these advances pave the way for an assistive therapy that could benefit all ALS patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The progressive degeneration of motor neurons that occurs in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the most common adult motor neuron disease (MND), affects almost all cellular components of the neuromuscular system, including cortical and spinal motor neurons, interneurons <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Crabé et al. (2020)</xref></bold></italic>, glial cells <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Van Harten et al. (2021)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Vahsen et al. (2021)</xref></bold></italic>, as well as muscle <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Loeffer et al. (2016)</xref></bold></italic>. Motor axons, contained within peripheral nerves, serve as the final common relay for transmission of motor signals that control all voluntary muscle contraction and movement. However, one of the earliest characteristic pathological features of ALS involves “die-back” of motor axon terminals <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fischer et al. (2004)</xref></bold></italic> and breakdown of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), the specialized synapses between motor axon terminals and muscle fibres. Effectively, this represents a single point of failure that permanently blocks motor signal transmission, irrespective of the condition of central motor circuits involved in coordination of movement signals. This results in an inexorable progression of muscle weakness, atrophy and, ultimately, complete paralysis, eventually leading to premature death. The median survival time in ALS, from initial onset of symptoms to death, typically as a result of respiratory complications, is only 20-48 months <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chiò et al. (2009)</xref></bold></italic> and ALS has an estimated global mortality of 30,000 patients per year <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Mathis et al. (2019)</xref></bold></italic>.</p>
<p>ALS is typically classified into either familial (fALS) or sporadic (sALS) forms of the disease, based on whether or not patients have an identified family history of the disease; between 5-10% of total ALS cases fall into the former category, fALS, with the remaining 90-95% consisting of sALS cases <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Mathis et al. (2019)</xref></bold></italic>. To date, over 20 monogenic mutations that cause ALS have been identified, however these still only account for 45% of fALS cases and only 7% of sALS cases <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mejzini et al. (2019)</xref></bold></italic>. The downstream cellular and molecular pathomechanisms underlying neurodegeneration in ALS are extremely complex and include dysregulation of proteostasis, autophagy, RNA metabolism and axon transport, as well as excitotoxicity, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mejzini et al. (2019)</xref></bold></italic>. Given the disparate causes and complex disease mechanisms, development of an effective therapy has proven extremely challenging and there are currently no effective treatments capable of arresting the progressive paralysis that occurs in ALS <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brown and Al-Chalabi (2017)</xref></bold></italic>. Even emergent gene therapy approaches, such as antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that have shown early promise in clinical trials <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Miller et al. (2013)</xref></bold></italic>, are unlikely to benefit the majority of patients with sporadic ALS and will not replace degenerated motor neurons or restore motor function once it has been lost.</p>
<p>Similarly, efforts to develop cell therapy approaches for ALS have, so far, primarily been aimed at slowing the degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord by providing neurotrophic factor (NTF) support through intraspinal engraftment of foetally-derived neural stem cells (NSCs) <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Feldman et al. (2014)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Goutman et al. (2018)</xref></bold></italic> or intrathecal delivery of autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that are modified to overexpress NTFs <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cudkowicz et al. (2022)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Berry et al. (2019)</xref></bold></italic>. Whilst these approaches were shown to significantly slow disease progression in transgenic animal models of ALS <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Xu et al. (2006)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Yan et al. (2006)</xref></bold></italic>, clinical trials in ALS patients have shown only a modest therapeutic effect in the case of intraspinal NSC grafts <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Glass et al. (2012)</xref></bold></italic> and no overall benefit of intrathecal MSC delivery <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cudkowicz et al. (2022)</xref></bold></italic> Given the highly invasive surgical laminectomy required to engraft NSCs into the ventral horn of the spinal cord, only localized populations of motor neurons in the lumbar and/or cervical region were targeted, however, the surgical procedure was generally well tolerated and the approach was proven to be safe in clinical trials <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Feldman et al. (2014)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Glass et al. (2016)</xref></bold></italic>. Moreover, these clinical trials have provided evidence that specific muscle functions can be preserved for longer in some ALS patients <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mazzini et al. (2019)</xref></bold></italic>. Importantly, this pioneering approach provides a precedent for implementation of an allogeneic stem cell-based therapy and also shows that ALS patients can tolerate a 6 month period of immunosuppression <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mazzini et al. (2015)</xref></bold></italic>, which appears to be sufficient to confer long term survival of engrafted cells <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tadesse et al. (2014)</xref></bold></italic>. Nonetheless, it appears unlikely that this approach will be able to restore motor function once it has been lost, since the NSCs do not replace lost motor neurons, and any therapeutic effect has so far been shown to be transient <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Goutman et al. (2018)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mazzini et al. (2019)</xref></bold></italic>. Therefore, there remains an urgent unmet need to develop novel therapies that can rescue muscle innervation and maintain muscle function in ALS patients.</p>
<p>We have previously demonstrated a novel proof-of-concept strategy to overcome muscle denervation and restore control of muscle contraction in a nerve injury model of muscle paralysis that could have major therapeutic value for restoring function of any targeted muscle or group of muscles in ALS patients <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bryson et al. (2014)</xref></bold></italic>. Briefly, optogenetically-modified replacement motor neurons, derived from murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs), were engrafted into distal branches of peripheral nerves supplying specific lower hindlimb flexor and extensor target muscles in wild-type mice that had undergone a nerve ligation injury. Our results showed that the engrafted motor neurons were able to project axons from the graft site to the target muscles where they formed de novo NMJs. Due to the ectopic location of the engrafted motor neurons, outside the central nervous system (CNS), they do not receive endogenous motor signals, and must therefore be exogenously activated. Expression of the blue-light sensitive channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) protein <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Nagel et al. (2003)</xref></bold></italic> in the engrafted motor neurons conferred the ability to selectively activate these engrafted neurons and thereby control the contractile function of the target muscle using acute optical stimulation <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bryson et al. (2014)</xref></bold></italic>. The aim of this neural replacement strategy is therefore to provide a biological interface capable of rendering any target muscle receptive to control signals transmitted by optical stimulation to engrafted motor neurons <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bryson et al. (2016)</xref></bold></italic>. Importantly, we have recently developed a prototype 64-channel stimulation and recording device capable of controlling multiple independent intraneural graft sites that could be used to elicit coordinated function of large numbers of muscles, in order to restore useful motor functions <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Liu et al. (2022)</xref></bold></italic>.</p>
<p>This novel approach to restore control of paralyzed muscles in ALS patients, using a combination of cell replacement and optical stimulation, has several key advantages over existing cell replacement and electrical stimulation strategies, including: i) the ability to engraft motor neurons peripherally, in close proximity to targeted muscles, which greatly accelerates the rate of reinnervation and reduces the period of denervation, consequently ameliorating denervation-induced muscle atrophy; ii) avoidance of engrafting replacement cells into the neurotoxic environment that exists within the CNS of ALS patients and the necessity for reinnervating axons of CNS-engrafted motor neurons to overcome the inhibitory CNS:PNS barrier in order to exit the CNS and grow the often long distances to target muscles; iii) specificity of optical stimulation to the engrafted ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons avoids painful off-target activation of sensory afferents or aberrant activation of endogenous motor axons associated with electrical nerve stimulation (ENS); and critically, iv) the ability to recruit motor units in correct physiological order using optical nerve stimulation (ONS) <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Llewellyn et al. (2010)</xref></bold></italic>, avoids the problem of rapid muscle fatigue associated with ENS and incorrect, non-physiological motor unit recruitment. Furthermore, ENS-mediated control of muscle function depends on the presence of surviving motor axons and, since these are progressively lost during the course of disease progression in ALS, the ability of ENS to induce muscle contraction is steadily eroded. More importantly, it has recently been shown that ENS, applied to the phrenic nerve to assist respiratory function in two separate clinical trials in ALS patients <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">McDermott et al. (2016)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gonzalez-Bermejo et al. (2016)</xref></bold></italic> accelerated diaphragm muscle denervation, which likely contributed to a significant reduction in patient life-span <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Guimarães-Costa et al. (2019)</xref></bold></italic>. Therefore, it is unlikely that ENS will ever be suitable for artificial control of critical muscle function in ALS patients. In contrast, optogenetic stimulation <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Henderson et al. (2009)</xref></bold></italic>, in combination with neural replacement, represents a safe alternative approach to artificially restore innervation and function of paralyzed muscles in ALS.</p>
<p>In the current study, we sought to optimize critical elements of this novel therapeutic strategy and to determine whether ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons can be used to successfully restore innervation, induce muscle contraction and prevent atrophy of targeted muscles in a model of ALS using the highly aggressive SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mouse model of ALS.</p>

<title>Host-vs-graft rejection causes loss of most intraneural ESC-MNs allografts</title>
<p>ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons were derived from our previously characterized mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) line <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bryson et al. (2014)</xref></bold></italic> and differentiated using a well-established protocol <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wichterle et al. (2002)</xref></bold></italic>. Since these donor ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons were generated from an mESC line originating from the 129S1/SvImJ mouse strain (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) and recipient mice SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice were on a congenic C57BL/6J genetic background, they constitute an allogeneic source of donor cells. Importantly, allogeneic cells are likely to provide a more cost-effective, off-the-shelf cell therapy platform, compared to generating individual, patient-specific batches of cells suitable for autologous engraftment. Therefore, an important initial objective of this study was to identify an immunosuppression regimen capable of preventing host-vs-graft rejection of allogeneic ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons to enable their innervation of target muscles in recipient SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice.</p>
<p>In the absence of any immunosuppression, the survival rate of ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neuron grafts at 35 d post engraftment, was extremely low (<italic>&lt;</italic>5%) in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice. However, in the rare cases where the engrafted ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons did survive, we observed robust intramuscular axon growth and partial reinnervation of NMJs, even at very late-stage disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="vid1">Video 1</xref>). Furthermore, acute optical stimulation of the engrafted ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons was able to induce tetanic contraction of the target muscle in these SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), although these were weak in magnitude. Interestingly, assessment of shorter timepoints revealed that engrafted ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons were capable of surviving for up to 14 days (data not shown). It is therefore likely that the poor long-term survival was due to host-vs-graft rejection of the engrafted cells, rather than disease-related toxicity. These findings suggest that if the engrafted motor neurons can evade the host immune response, they can functionally reinnervate target muscles for a therapeutically relevant timescale in this highly aggressive model of ALS.</p>

<title>Tacrolimus (FK506) overcomes ESC-MN allograft rejection but inhibits muscle innervation</title>
<p>In an effort to enhance graft survival, we first tested the calcineurin inhibitor (CNI), tacrolimus (FK506), which is not only routinely used to facilitate solid organ allograft survival in humans but has also been reported to promote axon regeneration after nerve injury in rats <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gold et al. (1995)</xref></bold></italic>. Cohorts of wild-type and SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="tbl2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>) were treated with FK506 (5mg, kg<sup>-1</sup>, d<sup>-1</sup>; dose selected based on evidence of axon regeneration studies) from the time of intraneural ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neuron engraftment; graft survival and muscle reinnervation were then assessed 30-35d post-engraftment. Although FK506 did enable robust ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neuron allograft survival, at the graft site, in all animals examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="tbl2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), we identified three major problems with this immunosuppressant agent. Firstly, although the engrafted motor neurons were able to survive and project axons along peripheral nerve branches and within the targeted lower hindlimb muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), FK506 completely prevented muscle fibre reinnervation, evidenced by lack of response to acute ONS (data not shown) and complete absence of ChR2<sup>+</sup>/YFP<sup>+</sup> NMJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) in both SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> (n = 8) and nerve-ligated wild-type mice (n = 4). Secondly, exuberant growth of carry-over pluripotent stem cells led to intraneural tumour formation in most mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="tbl2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), which resulted in overt hindlimb motor deficits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="vid2">Video 2</xref>). Thirdly, in partial agreement with previous reports in rats <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aydin et al. (2004)</xref></bold></italic>, FK506 prevented body mass increase and/or induced body mass decline in a subset (44.4%; n = 8/18) of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data1">Figure 2-figure supplement 1A</xref>); this effect was less evident in wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data1">Figure 2-figure supplement 1B</xref>). Onset of body mass decline in B6.SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice is highly consistent and typically occurs at 115 days in <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hayworth and Gonzalez-Lima (2009)</xref></bold></italic>, indicating that, at this relatively high dose, FK506 may be preferentially toxic or may exacerbate disease phenotype in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice.</p>

<p>Since peripheral neuropathy is a known adverse event associated with calcineurin inhibitors <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arnold et al. (2013)</xref></bold></italic>, it is possible that FK506 treatment alone may adversely affect endogenous or engrafted motor axons. Indeed, examination of the cross-sectional area distribution of total (ie. sensory and motor) and motor neuron axons in branches of the sciatic nerve in FK506-treated SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> and WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) revealed a significant loss of axons that affected most axonal calibres in the tibial nerve in wild-type and SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">C</xref>). A more pronounced loss of total and motor axons, spanning medium to large sized axonal calibres, was observed in the common peroneal nerve branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">E</xref>), which indicates that FK506 can not only exacerbate ongoing motor axon loss in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice but can also induce motor axon loss even in wild-type mice. Importantly, these neuropathy-like effects appear to be specific to FK-506, since an alternative immunosuppressant, H57-597 mAb (discussed in detail below), did not significantly alter total or motor axon size distribution or total axon counts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data2">Figure 3-figure supplement 1</xref>), compared to untreated SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice.</p>

In any case, these findings clearly show that FK506 is unsuitable as an immunosuppressant to support ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neuron allograft survival and, indeed, suggest that long-term administration at this relatively high dose should be avoided in ALS patients. Importantly, however, the complete protection of engrafted ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons by FK506 did confirm that host-vs-graft rejection was responsible for the poor long-term graft survival observed in the absence of immunosuppression, rather than disease related neurotoxicity.</p>

<title>T-cell modulatory immunosuppression confers graft survival and target muscle innervation</title>
<p>In light of the deleterious effects of FK506, and given our aim of conferring compatibility of allogeneic ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons as a universal cell therapy for ALS, we sought to identify a more specific form of immunosuppression that avoids the negative effects of FK506 yet supports long term graft survival. Therefore, we investigated the T-cell receptor-beta (TC-beta) targeting monoclonal antibody, mAb H57-597, which has previously been shown to effectively promote long-term heart allograft survival in mice <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Miyahara et al. (2012)</xref></bold></italic> In addition, since our findings indicated that immunosuppression results in a greater risk of tumour formation from carry-over pluripotent stem cells, differentiated ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons were also pre-treated with mitomycin-C (MMC; 2 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml for 2 hrs) prior to engraftment, to eliminate tumorigenic cells <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Magown et al. (2016)</xref></bold></italic>, to further enhance the translational potential. MMC-treated ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons were unilaterally engrafted into the tibial nerve of symptomatic SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice (aged 95.7 ±4.6 days) in conjunction with transient H57-597 mAb delivery (1mg, kg-1; i.p. injection at 0, 1-, 3-, 7- and 14-days post-engraftment). The extent of reinnervation and the ability to optically control the function of the triceps surae (TS) muscle group in the lower hindlimb of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice was then assessed at late-stage disease (133 ±6.9 d; n = 12) by determining the physiological response of the reinnervated muscles to acute ONS of the engrafted motor neurons followed by histological analysis of muscle and nerve. Histological analysis confirmed that in mAb H57-597 treated animals, engrafted ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons were present in all recipient SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice (n &gt; 84 to date). Importantly, there was significant axonal projection within intramuscular nerve branches and robust reinnervation of muscle fibres in the targeted TS muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="vid3">Video 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="vid4">4</xref>).

Since the peripherally-engrafted reinnervating motor neurons are inactive during the post-engraftment period and progressive muscle atrophy is ongoing, only 10.5% of endplates are innervated by engrafted ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Importantly, these reinnervated endplates are functional, since acute in vivo ONS of the engrafted ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons in the exposed sciatic nerve of late-stage disease SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice at 133 ±7.2 days of age (37.7 ±5.1 days post-engraftment; n = 12), induced positive contractile responses in all animals, although the amplitude of the maximal contractile force was still weak (0.8 ± 0.2 g; n = 11).</p>

<title>Motor neuron subtype identity does not affect response to optical stimulation</title>
<p>In an effort to increase the amplitude of the contractile response of the target muscle to optical stimulation we next tested whether engraftment of motor neurons with a fast-firing subtype identity may be more suitable than engraftment of predominantly slow-firing motor neurons by using alternative differentiation protocols.32 The stronger, predominantly fast-twitch, gastrocnemius component of the TS muscle group is usually innervated by fast-firing/fast-fatigable (FF) motor neurons, which are known to have the capacity to innervate many more individual muscle fibres per motor unit than slow-firing motor neurons, which normally innervate a much smaller number of weaker, slow-twitch muscle fibres, predominantly within the soleus and plantaris regions of the triceps surae. MMC-treated ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons, differentiated to yield FF subtype identity motor neurons, were engrafted into the tibial nerve of (106 ±7.2 days) SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice, in combination with transient H57-597 mAb treatment. Maximum isometric muscle contraction of the TS muscle in response to acute optical stimuli was then determined at the same age (133.9 ±7.2 days, n = as previous grafts of predominantly slow-firing motor neurons (133 ±6.9 days, n = 11). This physiological analysis revealed that the motor neuron subtype identity did not significantly affect amplitude of the muscle response to acute optical stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data3">Figure 4-figure supplement 1A</xref>) and that the maximum contractile force elicited by ONS remained extremely weak compared to supra-maximal ENS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data3">Figure 4-figure supplement 1B</xref>). This result implies that, unlike during normal neuromuscular development, motor neuron subtype identity is not an important determinant of muscle fibre innervation in the mixed fibre type triceps surae muscle. This finding has significance for future clinical translation, since only a single subtype of motor neuron may be required to innervate a variety of different muscles. Only MMC-treated motor neurons with a slow-firing medial motor column identity were used in the subsequent experiments reported here. Since modification of motor neuron subtype identity did not enhance contractile response, our next challenge was to identify an effective method to enhance reinnervation and force generating capacity of the targeted muscle in response to optical stimulation.</p>

<title>Optical stimulation training significantly enhances target muscle force generation</title>
<p>Spinal motor circuit development <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Milner and Landmesser (1999)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Li et al. (2005)</xref></bold></italic> and NMJ formation/maintenance <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sanes and Lichtman (1999)</xref></bold></italic> are known to be activity-dependent processes, thus, without regular stimulation, although peripherally engrafted ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons may survive, they are unlikely to form mature NMJs and will therefore have little effect on declining muscle function and atrophy in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice. Moreover, paralysis and atrophy of affected muscles proceed unchecked in the SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mouse model of ALS. We therefore investigated whether regular activation of the engrafted ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons, in conjunction with H57-597 mAb treatment, could enhance NMJ maturation and maximize the ability of target muscles to generate contractile force in response to acute optical stimulation in late-stage SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice. To do this, we adapted a wireless, fully implantable optical stimulation system <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Montgomery et al. (2015)</xref></bold></italic>, in order to implement a daily optical stimulation training regimen for engrafted mice. First, we modified the printed circuit board (PCB) design to simplify assembly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data4">Figure 5-figure supplement 1A</xref>, implemented a new encapsulation method to ensure long term survival of the devices after implantation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data4">Figure 5-figure supplement 1B</xref>) and incorporated an RF signal switch and pulse controller to deliver precisely timed RF pulses to power a 470nm light emitting diode (LED) connected to the implantable device (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data4">Figure 5-figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>The modified optical stimulation devices were then surgically implanted in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice concomitantly with intraneural engraftment of ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons, with the trailing LED positioned in close apposition to the graft site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Commencing at 14 d post-engraftment, to allow growing ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor axons sufficient time to reach the target muscle, the mice were transferred to a custom built chamber located above a resonance-frequency induction cavity for 1 hr per day, in order to undertake optical stimulation training (OST; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="vid5">Video 5</xref>), using a bespoke pulse pattern that was empirically determined to elicit maximum contraction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data5">Figure 5-figure supplements 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data6">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data7">4</xref>), followed by a 2 s rest interval. Following daily OST in engrafted SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice for 21 days, isometric muscle tension physiology was performed at late-stage disease to determine the maximal contractile force of the TS muscle elicited by acute ONS of the exposed sciatic nerve graft site. In confirmation of our hypothesis, there was a highly significant, 9.4-fold, increase in the maximal tetanic force (7.5 ±0.94 g versus 0.8 ±0.2 g; p = ≤0.000001) elicited by ONS in the engrafted OST group of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice at late-stage disease, compared to age-matched untrained SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice (132.4 ±6.8 days versus 133 ±6.9 days; n = 7 and 11, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C-G</xref>), although OST did not alter contractile rate characteristics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data8">Figure 5-figure supplement 5A-C</xref>). Moreover, quantitative comparison of the maximum force elicited by ONS compared to ENS of TS muscles in late-stage SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>), showed that in mice that underwent OST, acute ONS elicits up to 22.7% (± 4.5) of total residual muscle force produced by supra-maximal ENS, which activates both endogenous and engrafted motor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>), in contrast to only 1.46% (± 0.18) in untrained SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data9">Figure 5-figure supplement 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data9">6B</xref>). This represents a remarkable &gt;13-fold improvement in force generation. In engrafted SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice that did not undergo OST, the extremely weak twitch contractions in response to ONS precluded interrogation of individual motor unit force values and determination of motor units number estimates (MUNE) in most mice. In contrast, in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice that underwent OST, the significantly increased contractile response to ONS enabled clear separation of individual motor unit values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>), enabling MUNE values to be determined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data8">Figure 5-figure supplement 5D</xref>). Furthermore, as we previously reported in nerve-ligated WT mice,22 delivery of repetitive ONS pulses (250 ms bursts of 20 Hz illumination, every 1 s, for 180 s duration) to induce rhythmic, submaximal contraction of the TS muscle did not induce rapid muscle fatigue, whereas equivalent pulses of ENS stimulation of the contralateral TS muscle did result in rapid muscle fatigue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). This observation has significant implications for the ability to control repetitive motor functions in ALS patients.</p>

<title>Optical stimulation training prevents atrophy of reinnervated muscle fibres</title>
<p>Finally, having established that optical stimulation training significantly enhances the maximal force elicited by optical stimulation of engrafted ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons in late-stage SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice, we examined whether long-term optical stimulation training could also prevent atrophy of reinnervated muscle fibres. Since NMJs comprise an extremely small volume of the entire muscle, high-resolution 3D imaging of the entire muscle to determine muscle fibre innervation status and fibre diameter information is not feasible. Therefore, we developed a novel technique, termed digital Cross-sectional area Analysis from Longitudinal Muscle Sections (dCALMS), in order to assess these properties. This involved 3D reconstruction and analysis of regions of interest, obtained from 30<italic>μ</italic>m thick longitudinal TS muscle sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) from ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neuron engrafted, late-stage SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice that had undergone OST.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study shows for the first time that replacement stem cell-derived motor neurons can robustly and reliably reinnervate target muscles in the highly aggressive SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mouse model of ALS, even when engrafted after onset of overt symptoms; moreover, the restored innervation can be maintained even until extremely late-stage disease. Furthermore, our findings suggest that engrafted ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons can not only provide an interface to safely and selectively control the function of targeted muscle but, also, that regular optical stimulation training (OST) can be used to: i) reinforce connectivity between engrafted motor neurons and muscle fibres; ii) significantly enhance the maximal force elicited by optical stimulation of the targeted muscle; and iii) prevent atrophy of muscle fibres that are reinnervated by engrafted motor neurons. The highly significant improvements in muscle innervation, atrophy prevention and maximum contractile force, as a result of the daily OST regimen, confirms that stimulation-induced activity is necessary to maximize connectivity between engrafted motor neurons and their target muscles.</p>
<p>The prevailing view in the ALS field is that spinal motor neuron pathology first manifests at the nerve terminal and that muscle fibres are likely to actively contribute to degeneration of endogenous motor neurons in ALS <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Scaricamazza et al. (2021)</xref></bold></italic>. Our findings clearly demonstrate that affected muscles, even in the highly aggressive SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> ALS model, remain receptive to reinnervation by healthy engrafted motor neurons, even until late-stage disease. Moreover, once target muscles have been reinnervated, this approach enables implementation of a safe muscle training/exercise regimen that can be used to preserve muscle integrity and prevent irreversible muscle wasting that otherwise occurs as a result of progressive neurodegeneration in ALS <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Mora (1989)</xref></bold></italic>. Since skeletal muscles are not simply biomechanical actuators, but have complex functions in overall metabolic homeostasis, thermoregulation, venous return and maintenance of blood volume, the ability to prevent muscle atrophy using OST, is likely, by itself, to have major health benefits for ALS patients. In contrast, the use of electrical nerve stimulation (ENS) to control muscle function or, indeed, ENS-based exercise programs is likely to accelerate degeneration of remaining motor axon terminals <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Guimarães-Costa et al. (2019)</xref></bold></italic>, and is therefore unlikely to be safe. Unlike ENS, the highly selective nature of ONS does not activate or interfere with endogenous motor neuron function and due to its ability to recruit motor units in physiological order, ONS has the added significant benefit of avoiding rapid muscle fatigue <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Llewellyn et al. (2010)</xref></bold></italic>. The ability to combat muscle atrophy, using OST, could extend the ability of targeted to execute functionally useful movements, potentially indefinitely in ALS patients.</p>
<p>Since differentiation methods that yield either fast-firing or slow-firing motor neurons did not appear to affect the ability of engrafted motor neurons to innervate the mixed fibre type TS muscle group in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice, motor neuron subtype identity appears to be redundant in this case. Therefore, a single type of motor neuron, produced at scale, could potentially be used to target a large number of different muscles in each patient. This has advantages in terms of simplifying the regulatory approval process, since the donor motor neurons would be produced in exactly the same way, irrespective of the graft site or recipient.</p>
<p>Indeed, another key finding of this study that could streamline future translation of this therapeutic strategy, is the identification of a TCR-<italic>β</italic> targeting antibody, H57-597 mAb, as an effective mediator of allograft survival. Existing T-cell targeting monoclonal antibodies, such as OKT-3, have been clinically approved <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Page et al. (2013)</xref></bold></italic> and, importantly, this form of immunosuppression overcomes severe adverse effects that we observed with the commonly used CNI-based immunosuppressant, tacrolimus (FK506). Our data shows that H57-597 mAb treatment was well tolerated during transient administration from symptom-onset up until late-stage disease in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice, however, the aggressive disease progression in this model precludes investigation of longer-term effects and it remains to be seen how long-term TCR-<italic>β</italic>-based immunosuppression may be tolerated in ALS patients. A similar immunosuppression regimen involving a CD25 (IL2) targeting monoclonal antibody, Basiliximab, along with glucocorticoid and tacrolimus maintenance therapy, has been shown to be safe but poorly tolerated in ALS patients, as an independent investigative approach <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fournier et al. (2018)</xref></bold></italic>, as well as part of a separate clinical trial assessing intraspinal grafts of neural precursor cells in ALS patients <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mazzini et al. (2019)</xref></bold></italic>. Therefore, immunosuppression per se, is not an impediment to this strategy.</p>
<p>The use of allogeneic donor cells, with a safe and effective immunosuppression regimen, means that a future cell therapy could potentially be universally compatible with all ALS patients, which would significantly reduce costs and simplify the regulatory approval process, compared to individually tailored autologous cell grafts. Of course, further studies will be required to ensure that human-compatible, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived donor motor neurons are able to function in the same manner as allogeneic mouse ESC-derived motor neurons. The generation of HLA-matched super donor hiPSC lines may further mitigate the need for immunosuppression <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Turner et al. (2013)</xref></bold></italic>, however, immunogenicity of the ChR2 protein could mean that some form of immunosuppression may be necessary for any optogenetic therapy in the peripheral nervous system, including viral delivery <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Maimon et al. (2018)</xref></bold></italic>.</p>
<p>The anatomical separation of specific nerve branches in humans means that this approach could be used to target and independently control large numbers of muscles in each individual ALS patient. However, it will be first necessary to demonstrate safety and efficacy in a relatively low risk muscle to restore a simple motor function. For example, the common peroneal nerve is highly accessible from a neurosurgical perspective and existing ENS devices, developed to correct foot drop for other neurological disorders <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hausmann et al. (2015)</xref></bold></italic>, could be readily adapted to assist ambulatory function in early-stage ALS patients. In the longer term, existing multichannel ENS devices, which have been developed to control more complex ADLs in high-level spinal cord injury (SCI) patients <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Memberg et al. (2014)</xref></bold></italic>, could also be adapted into a minimally invasive, transcutaneous optical stimulation device <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Maimon et al. (2017)</xref></bold></italic>. This combinatorial therapeutic strategy, comprising allogeneic donor cells, an effective immunosuppression regimen and optical stimulation device, is highly compatible with the rapidly evolving field of brain computer interface (BCI) technology. BCI could be used to decode a paralyzed patient’s intention to perform a given movement in order to control the activity of the engrafted motor neurons, which provide the necessary interface to execute the intended movement via a wearable optical stimulation device. This novel approach would entirely bypass the severe damage that occurs throughout the entire CNS in ALS patients and enable autologous control of movement. Moreover, this strategy also has broad utility for a wide range of other neurogenic causes of paralysis, such as spinal cord injury and stroke.</p>
<p>Although the findings of this study clearly demonstrate that our combinatorial cell therapy approach is effective in a highly aggressive mouse model of ALS, further investigation is required in order to confirm that the strategy can be applied to alternate model of ALS, with a longer lifespan, in order to fully explore the long-term efficacy of the approach, particularly in terms of chronic allograft survival using a transient immunosuppression approach. It is possible that some form of maintenance therapy may also be required to confer long term graft survival. Of course, the biggest challenge will be to demonstrate that human optogenetically-modified motor neurons, derived from either induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) or human ESCs, are capable of reinnervating target muscles in the same manner as we have demonstrated for mESC-derived motor neurons. It will also be necessary to scale this cell therapy strategy up, using larger animal models that more accurately recapitulate human-scale anatomy.</p>
<p>Despite these remaining challenges, the findings of this study provide strong support for this novel cell therapy, which, if successful, could finally begin to deliver major health benefits for ALS patients.</p>

<title>Cell culture</title>
<p>The mESCs used in this study were generated as previously described <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bryson et al. (2014)</xref></bold></italic>. Briefly, mESC underwent successive rounds of gene-targeting to insert a Hb9::GFP-IRES-CD14 reporter construct to enable motor neuron purification, insertion of a CAG::Channelrhodopsin2-YFP (ChR2-YFP) construct using Tol2 transposition to enable optogenetic control of neural activity <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Nagel et al. (2003)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Boyden et al. (2005)</xref></bold></italic> and insertion of a CAG::Glial derived neurotrophic factor (Gdnf) construct using PiggyBac targeting to promote motor neuron survival; this resulted in generation of clone C9G. Undifferentiated mESCs, from clone C9G, were expanded on irradiated C57BL/6 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (iMEFs) (Gibco) according to standard cell culture protocols. For maintenance, briefly, freshly thawed mESC aliquots were plated on iMEF feeder layers, grown on gelatinized 24-well or 6-well plastic tissue culture treated dishes (approx. 2.5 x 105 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>), in mESC media, consisting of Knockout-DMEM (Gibco), supplemented with 15% ES-qualified FBS, 1x nucleosides, 1x non-essential amino acids, 1x L-glutamine + penicillin/streptomycin, 0.1mM 2-mercaptoethanol (all supplied by Gibco) and 100U/ml ESGRO® Recombinant Mouse LIF Protein (Merck Millipore); cells were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2, cells were fed daily and passaged or differentiated prior to colonies reaching 70% confluence.</p>

<title>Motor neuron differentiation</title>
<p>Motor neuron differentiation was carried out as previously described <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wichterle et al. (2002)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Peljto et al. (2010)</xref></bold></italic>. Briefly, mESC colonies were dissociated using TryplE solution (Gibco), 7 mins at 37°C, and transferred to non-tissue culture treated 10cm plates in differentiation medium, consisting of a 1:1 mix of advanced-DMEM/F12 and neurobasal media, 10% knockout serum replacement (KO-SR), 1x L-glutamine/Penicillin/Streptomycin and 0.1mM 2-mercaptoethanol (hereafter, termed ADNFK media; all components source from Gibco). For generation of medial motor column (MMC) identity motor neurons, mESCs (20,000 cell/ml) were incubated for 2 days at 37°C, 5% CO2 as floating embryoid bodies (EBs) in ADFNK, before being split 1:2 in ADFNK media supplemented with 1<italic>μ</italic>M retinoic acid (RA; Sigma) and 0.5<italic>μ</italic>M smoothened agonist (Sag; Sigma) between day 3-5 of differentiation. For generation of lateral motor column (LMC) identity motor neurons the modified “caudalized-ventralized” (C-V) protocol was used <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Peljto et al.

On differentiation day 5 or 7, differentiated EBs were pre-treated with 1<italic>μ</italic>g/ml of mitomycin-C for 2hrs (where indicated), washed in L15 media and dissociated in Accumax (Thermo Fisher Scientific), washed in L15 media, passed through a 20<italic>μ</italic>m cell strainer and collected in PBS at a final concentration of 50,000 cells/<italic>μ</italic>l; differentiated motor neurons were kept on ice prior to in vivo engraftment.</p>

<title>Production of implantable optical stimulation devices</title>
<p>Optical stimulation devices were largely produced as described by <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Montgomery et al. (2015)</xref></bold></italic>, with the following modifications: the design of individual printed circuit boards (PCBs) was modified to enlarge the central pads and the PCB was then fabricated on 0.2-mm thick FR4 board, which greatly facilitated assembly and mounting of individual components (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data4">Figure 5-figure supplement 1</xref>) and Supplementary CAD files); an alternative 470nm (145mcd) LED (Wurth Elektronik, Manufacturer Part No: 150120BS75000) was attached to 1.5cm paired trailing wire connected to the power-receiving rectifier circuit, again to facilitate assembly; a 3-turn power-receiving coil with an internal diameter of 1.7mm was used. Following positioning of Schottky diodes and capacitors on the PCB, and after coating with lead-free solder paste (Chip Quick), brief exposure to a flame from a gas soldering iron was used in lieu of reflow soldering. Fully assembled devices were cleaned in an ultrasonic water bath, rinsed in 100% ethanol, dried and then encapsulated by insertion into a silicone-grease coated 0.2ml PCR tube that was then partially filled with optically clear epoxy (Opti-tec 5001) to cover the device. The epoxy was cured for 1hr at 65°C and remaining uncured epoxy was then applied to the inverted trailing LED to form a droplet, before additional curing at 65°C. After encapsulation, devices were removed from 0.2ml PCR tubes, cleaned again in an ultrasonic water bath (to remove residual silicone grease), before being immersed in 100% ethanol for sterilization. Modification of the encapsulation method was necessary to ensure longevity of the device following in vivo implantation. Prior to implantation, devices were transferred to sterile PBS and tested in the RF-resonance chamber (see below) to ensure they were fully functional.</p>

<title>Radio Frequency (RF) resonance cavity power transmission system</title>
<p>As above, the power transmission system used to activate the implanted LED devices was largely as described by <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Montgomery et al. (2015)</xref></bold></italic>, with the following modifications: a SynthNV RF Signal Generator (WindFreak) was used to generate a constant 1497MHz RF output (1-2bBm), that was fed into an absorptive SPDT, Solid State Switch (MiniCircuits; ZX80-DR230S+), powered by a 1.5V CR2032 coin battery, which was controlled by a USB-TTL Interface (Prizmatix), to generate specific optical stimulation patterns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data5">Figure 5-figure supplement 2</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data7">4</xref>).</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>B6.Cg-Tg(SOD1*G93A)1Gur/J mice (JAX) were bred specifically for this study by mating presymptomatic male transgene carriers with congenic C57BL/6J females (Charles River Laboratories); progeny were genotyped by standard PCR analysis and heterozygous transgenic mice were housed under a 12 hr dark/light cycle in IVC cages with behavioural enrichment and ad libitum access to food and water, until they reached the appropriate age. A total of 73 SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice and 17 non-transgenic wild-type littermates were directly used in this study; an additional 129 SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice were used to develop the methodology.</p>
<p>All procedures and experiments involving animals were carried out under License from the UK Home Office in accordance with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (Amended Regulations 2012) and following ethical approval from the UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology Animal Welfare Ethical Review Body (AWERB). We used the ARRIVE checklist when writing our report <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Percie du Sert et al. (2020)</xref></bold></italic>; see below:</p>

<title>Study design parameters</title>
<sec id="s5.7.1">
<title>Group size calculation</title>
<p>As this was a success/failure study, sample sizes were not predetermined for in vivo engraftment studies, rather we aimed for a repeated success rate (ie. target muscle innervation by engrafted motor neurons). However, in order to enable us to undertake robust statistical analysis of our findings, we therefore aimed minimum group size of 6-8, and we performed retrospective power calculations to confirm that this was an appropriate sample size.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5.7.2">
<title>Inclusion/exclusion criteria</title>
<p>No data were excluded from the analyses. In rare cases, failure of the implantable LED device (used to deliver optical stimulation training; OST) before the start of the training period resulted in some mice being reassigned from the OST group to the “untrained” group; a detailed record of visual confirmation of LED device functionality was maintained for all stimulated mice to ensure the device was fully functional throughout the training period.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5.7.3">
<title>Replication</title>
<p>In vivo engraftment studies, physiological analysis and histological analysis were replicated in n = 32 SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice for the major findings of this study, over a 2-year period, using multiple batches of ESC-derived motor neurons that were specifically prepared for each cohort (typically 4-8 mice per cohort); experimental outcomes were highly consistent and reproducible. Antibody-based immunosuppression conferred 100 percent graft survival in over 84 SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice to date, with positive responses to optical stimulation (determined by physiological analysis).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5.7.4">
<title>Randomization</title>
<p>At the start of the study, animals in each litter (of appropriate genotype) were randomly assigned to each experimental cohort. All mice received grafts of the same ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons that were differentiated to coincide with each cohort of mice reaching the appropriate age for enrollment in the study. Rather SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice were custom bred for each phase of the project, which naturally evolved as specific experimental obstacles arose and were overcome (eg. toxicity of first choice immunosuppressant); these mice were assigned to specific groups following genotype confirmation (to reduce the number of experimental mice, since wild-type littermates were not the primary focus of this study) and upon reaching the appropriate age; isometric muscle tension physiological analysis in response to optical (and electrical) stimulation was used as the primary outcome measure, in order to determine the absolute maximum stimulus-evoked muscle force; this outcome measure was selected for its accuracy, reproducibility and reliability based on our past experience in pre-clinical therapeutic development.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5.7.5">
<title>Blinding</title>
<p>In vivo engraftment and physiological analysis were blinded where possible. Since all mice were the same genotype and received the same cell grafts the experimenter was therefore aware of this, however, the experimenter was blinded to stimulation conditions (ie. untrained versus OST groups) for physiological analysis. Importantly, physiological recordings of maximal muscle force provides a highly reliable functional readout, moreover, automated software was used to extract muscle contractile characteristics data to eliminate bias. Histological analysis was performed blind for nerve and muscle analyses, with the exception of dCALMS analysis, since only SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice that had undergone optical stimulation training were used for this analysis. As reported in the methods, automated or semi-automated analysis was used for all histological analysis to eliminate bias.</p>

<title>In vivo intraneural engraftment of mESC-derived ChR2+ motor neurons</title>
<p>Mice received prophylactic analgesia (buprenorphine, 0.1mg/kg), during induction of anaesthesia and preparation of the surgical site. The immunosuppressant monoclonal antibody (H57-597 mAb) was also administered at the start of the surgical procedure (day 0) by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection (1mg/kg, diluted in 100<italic>μ</italic>l of sterile saline), which was repeated on days 1, 3, 7 and 14 post-engraftment. Alternatively, in a subset of mice (n = 15), immunosuppression was achieved by daily i.p. administration of FK506 (tacrolimus; 5mg/kg/d, note: due to insolubility in aqueous solution, FK506 (16.67mg/ml) was dissolved in DMSO and stored as frozen 100<italic>μ</italic>l aliquots that were freshly thawed and prepared immediately prior to injection by dilution in 30<italic>μ</italic>l of 100% ethanol (15% final concentration) and 70<italic>μ</italic>l sterile PBS containing 2% Tween-20 (8.33mg/ml final concentration of FK506; 0.6<italic>μ</italic>l/g of body mass, mixed with saline to a final volume of 125<italic>μ</italic>l immediately prior to i.p. injection). Mice were closely monitored and weighed at the time of immunosuppressant administration. As previously reported, H57-597 induced acute loss of body mass, which fully recovered in all cases within 7days from the initial dose; this adverse effect can be blocked by pre-treatment with cyclosporin A <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Murakami et al. (1995)</xref></bold></italic>.</p>
<p>Intraneural engraftment of ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons was performed under deep anaesthesia, using aseptic surgical techniques and body temperature was maintained throughout the surgical procedure using a 37°C heat mat, as previously described <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bryson et al. (2014)</xref></bold></italic>. Briefly, under a stereoscopic operating microscope (Zeiss), a 3mm skin incision was made in the lower posterior thigh and superficial muscles were separated and retracted to expose the sciatic nerve, immediately proximal to the trifurcation point in the popliteal fossa. The sciatic nerve was elevated from underlying muscles using a curved non-cutting suture needle, placing it under slight tension, and a 27G needle was used to make a small incision in the epineurium of the tibial and common peroneal nerve branches. Immediately prior to intraneural engraftment ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons (50,000 cells/<italic>μ</italic>l in PBS containing 0.0004% Nile Blue dye, maintained on ice) were carefully resuspended by pipetting and loaded into a 5<italic>μ</italic>l Hamilton syringe, equipped with a customized 33G needle. The needle was then carefully inserted through the incision made in the epineurium and guided along the length of the nerve (approximately 3-4mm), to the trifurcation point of the sciatic nerve, in order to prevent back-pressure induced leakage of cells; 1<italic>μ</italic>l of cell suspension was slowly injected into the tibial nerve and 0.5<italic>μ</italic>l into the common peroneal nerve. Visualization of Nile Blue labelled cells was used to verify intraneural cell delivery. In procedures during later stages of this study, a fine-tipped (approximately 100<italic>μ</italic>m outer diameter) pulled glass microinjection needle, with a beveled tip and customized positive displacement plunger (Alpha laboratories) was used for intraneural injection of cells, to minimize damage to the nerve. After injection, the needle was carefully withdrawn and the sciatic nerve was returned to its normal position. A subset of mice (n = 7; excluding animals in which the device failed during the stimulation period) underwent implantation of an optical stimulation device (described above). Briefly, fine round-tipped tissue forceps were inserted through the same skin incision, along the length of the thigh bone and rostrally along the back, to create a subcutaneous cavity. The main body of the sterilized device was inserted into the cavity and positioned close to, and parallel with, the lower thoracic spine (to assist alignment of the power receiving coils with the RF-resonance frequency power transmitter). The trailing wire and encapsulated LED was secured in place immediately superficial to the graft site in the sciatic nerve by 8-0 non-absorbable sutures that were also used to return the overlying muscles to their normal position. Finally, the skin incision was closed using 8-0 absorbable sutures and post-operative mice were transferred to a heated chamber and allowed to fully recover before being returned to their home-cage. Mice were closely observed for 10 days following surgery.</p>

<sec id="s5.9">
<title>Daily optical stimulation training</title>
<p>After 14d post-engraftment (to allow sufficient time for engrafted motor neurons to extend axons far enough to reach target muscles), mice with implanted stimulation devices were transferred to a round acrylic chamber, containing clean bedding and nesting material, positioned on top of the RF-resonance cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data4">Figure 5-figure supplement 1C</xref>). Where possible, multiply-housed littermates were transferred to the chamber at the same time. A red acrylic dome was placed in the centre of the chamber to encourage mice to spend time in that location, since resonance power transmission is less efficient at the periphery of the chamber. Engrafted SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice underwent daily optical stimulation (pulse pattern described below; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data5">Figure 5-figure supplement 2</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data7">4</xref>) for 1hr/d from post-engraftment day 14 until termination of the experiment at late-stage disease (132.4 ±6.8 days).</p>

<sec id="s5.10">
<title>Isometric muscle tension physiological analysis</title>
<p>At the experimental end-point, engrafted SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice underwent isometric muscle tension physiology, in order to accurately determine the contractile properties of target muscles in response to acute optical stimulation, largely as previously described <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bryson et al. (2014)</xref></bold></italic>, with the following modifications: a PowerLab 4/30 stimulation and recording system (AD Instruments) was used to deliver bespoke electrical stimulation signals, either as direct constant voltage pulses applied to the nerve via bipolar electrodes for electrical nerve stimulation, or used as a 5V TTL signal to activate a 470nm LED light-source (CoolLED; pe100), delivered to the exposed sciatic nerve via a liquid lightguide for optical stimulation; stimulation program available on request. As previously reported, percentage light power intensity can be controlled over a range of 0-80 mW/mm2; 50% (40 mW/mm2) supramaximal stimulation was used for most optically-evoked muscle force recordings, however, maximum motor unit activation was achieved using light intensities ≤2.5 mW/mm2. For electrical stimulation, 0.2ms supramaximal constant-voltage (5V) pulses were directly applied to the exposed sciatic nerve via a bipolar stimulating electrode, as individual pulses (for twitch contractions) or at 20, 40, 80 and 100 Hz burst (0.5s duration) with a 5 second rest interval to interrogate the full range of maximal tetanic contractile force values.</p>
<p>Distal tendons of individual target muscles were attached to 25g or 55g UF-1 force transducers coupled to a bridge amp (AD Instruments). LabChart software (AD Instruments) was used for automated data analysis of parameters including maximum twitch and tetanic contractile force, time-to-rise, time-to-peak and ½ relaxation time (during twitch contractions). Motor unit number estimation (MUNE) was performed using a bespoke pattern of rising and falling amplitude electrical stimuli (0-5V, 0.2ms pulse width), repeated every 1s (LabChart programme available upon request), or by 1 s interval 5V TTL trigger pulses in combination with manual cycling of the percentage power output from the pe-100 (470nm) light source (Cool LED) between 1-10%.</p>

<title>Nerve and muscle histology</title>
<p>Immediately after physiological analysis, animals were euthanized and the ipsilateral (engrafted) sciatic nerve (SN), attached to the triceps surae (TS) muscle group, along with the contralateral SN and tibialis anterior (TA) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles, were dissected, rinsed in TBS and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in TBS for a minimum of 2hrs, followed by cryoprotection in TBS containing 20% sucrose for &gt;12 hrs. Tissue was mounted in aluminium-foil moulds containing OCT (Tissue-Tek) and rapidly frozen on dryice, then stored at -20°C prior to cryosectioning. Serial longitudinal sections from the ipsilateral SN and TS muscle, and TA/EDL muscles were cut at 30<italic>μ</italic>m thickness, encompassing the entire tissue block to enable 3D reconstruction of the extent of reinnervation throughout the whole muscle (only performed in selected cases due to time- and resource-intensive nature of imaging data acquisition and processing). Transverse 10<italic>μ</italic>m-thick sections were cut from the contralateral SN for axonal analysis. For immunostaining, muscle/nerve sections were washed 3 x 5 mins with TBS, blocked for 1hr in TBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 5% donkey serum and sections were double-labelled with the following primary antibodies, raised in either rabbit or goat, applied in combination overnight in TBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 2% donkey serum: goat anti-choline acetyltransferase, 1:100 (Chemicon); goat anti-green fluorescent protein, 1:500 (Abcam); rabbit anti-green fluorescent protein, 1:500 (Invitrogen); rabbit anti-choline acetyltransferase, 1:200 (Abcam); rabbit anti-<italic>β</italic>III tubulin; 1:500 (Biolegend). Secondary antibodies, raised in donkey were diluted 1:500, along with <italic>α</italic>-bungarotoxin-Alexa568/647 (1:500; Invitrogen) and DAPI (1:1000; Sigma) in TBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 2% donkey serum and applied for 2hrs, before washing 3 x 5 mins with TBS and coverslips were then mounted using fluorescent mounting medium (Invitrogen).</p>

<title>Image processing</title>
<p>Image acquisition was performed using a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope, to acquire tile-scan images of entire SN/TS sections using a 20x objective (pinhole set to 30<italic>μ</italic>m to obtain fluorescent signal from entire thickness of the section); high-resolution z-stacks from specific regions of interest were acquired using either 40x or 63x oil-immersion objectives. Images reported here were either prepared directly, using Zeiss Zen Blue/Black image processing software or processed and analysed using Fiji (ImageJ) and MetaMorph (Molecular Devices) software for 3D reconstruction, as follows: serial tile-scan images encompassing the whole SN/TS tissue block were converted into compressed tiff-format files, assembled into an image stack and individual planes were aligned using the StackReg plugin <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Thévenaz et al. (1998)</xref></bold></italic>, aligned stacks were then converted into rendered 3D reconstructions using MetaMorph software and saved as compressed AVI video files for visualization purposes (note: automated NMJ analysis, described below, was performed on individual image planes from each stack). Tile-scans were also acquired from contralateral SN sections, using a 40x or 63x oil-immersion objective, for automated axon cross-sectional area analysis.</p>

<title>Automated endplate and innervation analysis</title>
<p>Serial tile-scan images, in RGB Color format, from the whole TS muscle from SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice at the experimental end-point, 135 days, were analysed as follows, using Fiji (ImageJ) software: endplates, labelled with <italic>α</italic>-bungartoxin conjugated to Alexa-568 or Alexa-647 were assigned to the red color channel and color thresholding, using consistent parameters (Hue = 0-17 [pass], Saturation = 0-255 [pass], Brightness = 75-255 [pass]) was performed to specifically identify endplates; the number of endplates in each plane was then quantified using the “Analyze Particles” feature of ImageJ (key parameters include: Area = 50-500<italic>μ</italic>m, Circularity 0-1, Show “Overlay masks”). Quantification of innervated endplates was performed in a similar manner, using colour thresholding parameters to identify double-labelled endplates that stained positive for both <italic>α</italic>-bungarotoxin (assigned to red channel) and GFP/YFP+ motor axons (assigned to the green channel), using the following parameters: Hue = 23-44; Saturation = 0-255; Brightness = 90-255. This automated analysis method is intended to quantify the total number of endplates and provide an indication of their innervation status; determination of full versus partial innervation would require much higher resolution imaging which is not feasible for the whole TS muscle. Additionally, severe muscle atrophy at late-stage disease decreases the TS muscle volume, thus the number and size of tile-scan images would be approximately 3-fold greater for wild-type mice.</p>

<title>Motor and sensory axon nerve analysis</title>
<p>Individual channels, representing total axons (stained for <italic>β</italic>-III tubulin) and motor axons (stained for choline-acetyltransferase), from tile-scans of contralateral SNs were used to determine number and cross-sectional area (CSA) of each axonal type, to determine the effect of different immunosuppression regimens. Briefly, images were thresholded in ImageJ, using identical settings to delineate individual axons, individual branches were then manually circled, using the freehand selection tool, and axonal counts and CSA were automatically quantified using the “Analyze Particles” tool.</p>

<title>Digital CSA analysis of longitudinal muscle sections (dCALMS)</title>
<p>Briefly, z-stacks from regions of interest incorporating at least 1 GFP/YFP+ motor axon terminal were acquired from the whole 30<italic>μ</italic>m thickness of individual TS muscle sections; the “reslice” feature of ImageJ was then used to obtain digital transverse orientation images from each ROI to interrogate muscle fibre CSA throughout the y-plane of the image stack and correlation with the innervation status; triple labelling with GFP/YFP, <italic>α</italic>-bungarotoxin and choline-acetyltransferase labelling enabled the innervation status of adjacent fibres within the ROI to be assigned to the following categories: denervated (<italic>α</italic>-bungarotoxin only), innervated by endogenous motor neurons (<italic>α</italic>-bungarotoxin and choline-acetyltransferase), innervated by engrafted ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons (<italic>α</italic>-bungarotoxin, choline-acetyltransferase and GFP/YFP) or unknown (when no endplate was visible within the ROI. Overexposure of the channel used to acquire choline-acetyltransferase staining enabled visualization of the muscle CSA, which underwent gaussian blurring to aid definition of the sarcolemma (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, colorized images versus non-blurred images shown in black and white). The edge of each muscle fibre at the level of the endplate (where present) in the y-plane (or the maximum diameter, where no endplate was evident), was manually circled using the freehand selection tool and analysed using the “measure” function of ImageJ. ROIs were analysed from n = 3 mice that underwent ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neuron engraftment and optical stimulation training. Only fibres that were entirely within the z-plane were measured at their widest point along the y-plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="vid6">Video 6</xref>); partial fibres, were excluded.</p>

<body>
<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder leading to the loss of innervation of skeletal muscles, caused by the dysfunction and eventual death of lower motor neurons. A variety of approaches have been taken to treat this disease. With the exception of three drugs that modestly slow progression, most therapeutics have failed to provide benefit. Replacing lost motor neurons in the spinal cord with healthy cells is plagued by a number of challenges, including the toxic environment, inhibitory cues that prevent axon outgrowth to the periphery, and proper targeting of the axons to the correct muscle groups. These challenges seem to be well beyond our current technological approaches. Avoiding these challenges altogether, Bryson et al. seek to transplant the replacement motor neurons into the peripheral nerves, closer to their targets. The current manuscript addresses some of the challenges that will need to be overcome, such as immune rejection of the allograft and optimizing maturation of the neuromuscular junction.</p>

<p>The authors provide convincing evidence that optogenetic stimulation of ChR2-expressing motor neurons implanted in muscles effectively restore innervation of severely affected skeletal muscles in the aggressive SOD1 mouse model of ALS, and concluded that this method can be applied to selectively control the function of implicated muscles, which was supported by convincing data presented in the paper.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Major concerns:</p>
<p>1. In lines 41-43, there seems to be some confusion about the terminology regarding &quot;sporadic ALS&quot;. ALS is subdivided into familial and sporadic forms. Familial ALS simply indicates that the patient has a family history of ALS and presumably has a genetic predisposition for developing this disease. In many families, the identity of the mutation remains unknown. Sporadic ALS patients do not have a family history of this disease. However, this does not imply that they lack mutations that caused disease. In fact, 5-10% of these patients have the hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9orf72. This mutation is also found in about 40% of familial ALS cases.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now amended the manuscript to be more accurate in our description of underlying genetics of ALS. This changes to this section are as follows:</p>
<p>Lines 39-47:</p>
<p>&quot;...The median survival time in ALS, from initial onset of symptoms to death, typically as a result of respiratory complications, is only 20-48 months Chiò et al. (2009) and ALS has an estimated global mortality of 30,000 patients per year Mathis et al. (2019).</p>
<p>ALS is typically classified into either familial (fALS) or sporadic (sALS) forms of the disease, based on whether or not patients have an identified family history of the disease; between 5-10% of total ALS cases fall into the former category, fALS, with the remaining 90-95% consisting of sALS cases Mathis et al. (2019). To date, over 20 monogenic mutations that cause ALS have been identified, however these still only account for 45% of fALS cases and only 7% of sALS cases Mejzini et al. (2019)...&quot;</p>

<p>1. In Fig. 4-supplement 1, 7DD and 5DD are not defined. I assume one is the fast-firing and one is the slow-firing motor neurons. I am also a bit confused as to why the 5DD neurons produce greater muscle force than the 7DD neurons when electrically stimulated. It seems to suggest that there is some difference between the two types of neurons or the groups of mice used to test them.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now defined these terms and the amended figure legend now reads as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;(A) Fast-firing motor neurons (produced using a 7-day differentiation protocol thus labelled as “7DD”) or slow-firing ChR2+ motor neurons (produced using a 5-day differentiation protocol thus labelled as “5DD”) were engrafted in age matched SOD1G93A mice… Our expectation was that fast-firing motor neurons, which normally innervate larger numbers (&gt;100) of stronger fast-twitch muscle fibres per motor unit would elicit significantly greater contractile force when optically stimulated, compared to slow-firing motor neurons that innervate small numbers (&lt;10) of weaker, slow-twitch muscle fibres per motor unit. Surprisingly, our data did not show any difference when using grafts consisting of fast-firing motor neurons, versus slow-firing motor neurons, at least in response to optical stimulation. The factors underlying this surprising result, and the apparent discrepancy between electrically-evoked muscle contractions in nerves that had bene engrafted with either fast or slow firing motor neurons, are likely to be highly complex; we hope to further explore this as part of a separate follow up study.&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Along those lines, do these two subpopulations of motor neurons innervate the same set of muscle fibers? More generally, are certain types of muscle fibers preferentially innervated by this approach? Answering these questions could point to additional ways to enhance the effectiveness of this treatment approach. This should be discussed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This point is partially addressed in our response to Point 2 above, but to further extrapolate: certainly, the phenotype of individual muscle fibres is largely dictated by the firing properties of the motor neuron that innervates it. Slow-twitch muscle fibres tend to produce less contractile force but are more fatigue resistant, whereas fast-twitch muscle fibres produce more force but fatigue rapidly. There is evidence that expression of the chemorepellent molecule ephrin-A3 prevents the inappropriate innervation of slow-twitch muscle fibres by fast-firing motor neurons, which express the cognate receptor EphA8 [PMID: 26644518]. Importantly, fast-firing motor neurons are preferentially susceptible to disease mechanisms in ALS and the fast-twitch muscle fibres that they innervate are therefore more likely to undergo denervation and atrophy. Surprisingly, in this study we clearly show that grafts consisting of slow-firing motor neurons are able to innervate all regions of the triceps surae muscle group, including the normally exclusively fast-twitch superficial regions of the gastrocnemius and the exclusively slow-twitch soleus muscle. This finding strongly suggests that the normal developmental pairing of motor neuron and muscle fibre properties is not essential in this therapeutic context. Indeed, the use of more disease-resistant slow-firing motor neurons may provide some advantages. Again, we hope to be able to further explore this relationship in forthcoming follow-up studies.</p>

<p>1. The authors state that exercise programs are likely to accelerate disease progression. This is not supported by the current body of clinical data. In fact, current guidelines are for moderate (not strenuous) exercise, and mouse studies have demonstrated a protective effect of moderate exercise on disease progression.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologise for the lack of clarity on this point, as it was not our intention to imply that voluntary exercise accelerates disease progression. We have now amended the manuscript to specify “ENS-based exercise programs” to avoid any confusion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. It is unclear what the experimental endpoint is. Page 25 defines it as 135 days of age, but ranges are given the figure legends, suggesting that some other criteria were used. It also seems unclear at what determined the age at which each animal was treated since they were also not treated at the same age.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We hope that our response in the Public Reviews section above has fully addressed this point.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. I am a little confused by Figure 5 - figure supplement 5, panel D. Why do the authors give specific p-values here but not in the other panels? The sample sizes in D are very low, in some cases with only 1 animal in a group, and performing statistical tests under these conditions seems futile. The statistical power is nearly zero.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>For the purposes of consistency, we have now replaced the specific p-values in panel D with “ns”. The low n-values for the MUNE analysis data is due to the extremely difficult nature of identifying the contribution of individual motor units to the total muscle contractile response, when the maximal muscle force is extremely weak. In the absence of optical stimulation training, the extremely weak force elicited by acute optical stimulation precluded our ability to separate out the contribution of individual motor units and, often, in animals where this was not possible, we did not always perform electrically-evoked MUNE analysis. Unfortunately, we are not currently in a position to increase the n-values for this component of the study. Our ongoing research to enhance the amplitude of the muscle response to optical stimulation will hopefully help to more clearly address this in the future.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. One concern about this approach is that the procedure could accelerate the denervation of the target muscle. Figure 5 - figure supplement 6, panel B, indicates a significant reduction in force on the ipsilateral side relative to the contralateral side, at least under electrical stimulation of the nerve. This would be consistent with the hypothesis that the procedure does enhance disease progression in the treated limb. Is there a reduction in voluntary motor activity in these animals, such as in grip strength or the position of the foot while walking?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We hope that this important point has been satisfactorily addressed in the Public Reviews section. Unfortunately, we did not undertake any behavioural analysis relating to voluntary motor function of the engrafted (or contralateral) hindlimbs, which may have provided useful data to address this point. As described above, the most likely explanation for this finding is due to physical nerve damage caused by the intraneural injection procedure; in our efforts to refine our strategy and move it towards clinical translation, we will take this into consideration in our future research.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Based on Fig. 6D, it seems that the vast majority of innervated NMJs at endpoint are innervated by cells from the graft. And yet, electrical stimulation evokes substantially greater muscle force. This may suggest that optical control of engrafted motor neurons will not yield enough force for routine tasks or that the few remaining endogenous motor neurons are much more effective at generating force. These potential limitations and ways to overcome them should be discussed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>There appears to be a slight misunderstanding, since our aim here was to sample a sufficiently powered number of motor end-plates innervated by YFP+ for statistical analysis. To do this we specifically chose regions of interest containing at least 1 YFP+ NMJ and the adjacent muscle fibres were included at random, whatever their innervation status. Had we sampled regions of interest at random, we would have been likely to capture only a very few YFP+ terminal as they occupy a very small volume of the total muscle section and the maximum scanning area for each high-resolution z-confocal stack is relatively small, so we feel that this selection was warranted.</p>

<p>Minor comments:</p>
<p>1. The donor mouse strain should be described as 129S1/SvImJ.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now corrected this.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The first time the supplementary figures show up in the manuscript, they seem to have two titles each, such as &quot;Figure 1-figure supplement 1. (Figure 4 - figure supplement 1)&quot;. The second seems to be the correct one.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This was caused by an issue with the Latex template, which has now been resolved.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. PCB is not defined the first time it is used (page 8, line 332).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now defined this term on first use: printed circuit board (PCB)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. CNI is not defined in the text (page 12, line 432).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now defined this abbreviation at the first usage on Page 4, Line 158</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Some of the fonts on the graphs are very small, such as Fig. 5J.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have increased the font size as much as possible for Fig. 5.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Figure 6 - figure supplement 1 does not include a key to indicate which antigens are stains and which color refers to which antigen. This is also needed for the videos.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now included a key on this figure supplement to indicate the relevant antigens and stain and we have also done the same for the videos.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Video 5 seems to indicate that there is a dead zone in the back of the chamber. Does this raise any concerns about the consistency of training from animal to animal?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an extremely astute observation. However, the intermittent activation of the implantable LED devices is not due to a dead zone; rather, it is due to the orientation of the power receiving coil within the device and it’s alignment with the resonance frequency chamber that transmits the power to the device. As the animals move around, and particularly when they rear up, the power receiving coil occasionally becomes misaligned and fails to receive sufficient power to activate the LED. Since the pulses are delivered every 2 seconds, for 1 hour per day, we feel that the animals, on average, receive sufficient numbers of pulses to implement the training regimen. Indeed, we feel that the results speak for themselves.</p>
