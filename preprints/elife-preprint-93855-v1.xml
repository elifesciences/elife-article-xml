<title>Abstract</title><p>Most of Earth’s biomass is composed of polysaccharides. During biomass decomposition, polysaccharides are degraded by heterotrophic bacteria as a nutrient and energy source and are thereby partly remineralized into CO<sub>2</sub>. As polysaccharides are heterogeneously distributed in nature, following the colonization and degradation of a polysaccharide hotspot the cells need to reach new polysaccharide hotspots. Even though these degradation-dispersal cycles are an integral part in the global carbon cycle, we know little about how cells alternate between degradation and motility, and which environmental factors trigger this behavioral switch. Here, we studied the growth of the marine bacterium <italic>Vibrio cyclitrophicus</italic> ZF270 on the abundant marine polysaccharide alginate. We used microfluidics-coupled time-lapse microscopy to analyze motility and growth of individual cells, and RNA sequencing to study associated changes in gene expression. Single cells grow at reduced rate on alginate until they form large groups that cooperatively break down the polymer. Exposing cell groups to digested alginate accelerates cell growth and changes the expression of genes involved in alginate degradation and catabolism, central metabolism, ribosomal biosynthesis, and transport. However, exposure to digested alginate also triggers cells to become motile and disperse from cell groups, proportionally increasing with the group size before the nutrient switch, accompanied by high expression of genes involved in flagellar assembly, chemotaxis, and quorum sensing. The motile cells chemotax toward alginate hotspots, likely enabling cells to find new polysaccharide hotspots. Overall, our findings reveal the cellular mechanisms underlying bacterial degradation-dispersal cycles that drive remineralization in natural environments.</p>

<title>Importance</title>
<p>Polysaccharides, also known as glycans, are the most abundant form of biomass on Earth and understanding how they are degraded by microorganisms is essential for our understanding of the global carbon cycle and the storage and release of CO<sub>2</sub> by natural systems. Although group formation is a common strategy used by bacterial cells to degrade ubiquitous polymeric growth substrates in nature, where nutrient hotspots are heterogeneously distributed, little is known about how cells prepare for dispersal from an exhausted nutrient source and re-initiate degradation of new nutrient patches. By quantifying growth, motility and chemotaxis of individual cells and comparing gene expression changes when populations were exposed to either polysaccharides or their degradation products in the form of digested polysaccharides, we show that bacterial cells alter their behavior when they experience a shift from polymeric to digested polysaccharides: After cells form groups during growth on polymers, the exposure to degradation products made cells motile, enabling dispersal from sessile cell groups and - guided by chemotaxis - movement towards new polysaccharide hotspots. Our study sheds light on the cellular processes that drive bacterial growth and behavior during carbon remineralization, an important driver of CO<sub>2</sub> release from biomass in natural systems.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Polysaccharides represent the largest fraction of biomass on Earth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> and are constantly degraded and remineralized by microorganisms. Polysaccharides, also known as glycans, are long chains of monosaccharide units produced by cells for structural support (e.g., cellulose, chitin, and alginate) or energy storage (e.g., starch or glycogen)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Heterotrophic microbes obtain nutrients and energy from the polysaccharide breakdown products. They often use exoenzymes, either secreted or anchored in the cell membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, to cleave these large polymers into smaller units that can be taken up by cells. The formation of dense cell groups is observed during growth on polysaccharides by diverse bacteria, including the soil- and gut-dwelling <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, the oligotrophic fresh-water <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, and several representatives of the copiotrophic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> marine <italic>Vibrio spp.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. It has been suggested that “cooperative” growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, where dense cell groups reduce diffusional loss of valuable degradation products and secreted exoenzymes, represents a general principle in polysaccharide degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Yet, how bacteria subsequently disperse from exhausted polysaccharide sources and navigate towards new polysaccharide hotspots remains poorly understood.</p>
<p>To study the cellular mechanisms that govern the switch between polysaccharide degradation and dispersal toward new polysaccharide hotspots, we worked with the ubiquitous marine Gammaproteobacterium <italic>Vibrio cyclitrophicus</italic> ZF270, a degrader of the prevalent marine polysaccharide alginate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Alginate is a linear polysaccharide that is produced by brown algae as a cell wall component, as well as by certain bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. It can be cleaved into oligomers by endo-acting alginate lyases or into monomers by exo-acting alginate lyases (alginate lyases reviewed here<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>), namely β-D-mannuronic acid and α-L-guluronic acid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. <italic>V. cyclitrophicus</italic> ZF270 is found predominantly in the large-particle fractions of coastal water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, can attach and form biofilms on the surfaces of multiple polysaccharides including alginate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, and was shown to secrete alginate lyases during alginate degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. In this study, we used microfluidics coupled to automated time-lapse imaging to quantify the growth dynamics, group formation, and motility of <italic>V. cyclitrophicus</italic> ZF270 at the single-cell level under constant supply of either polymeric alginate or alginate degradation product in the form of digested alginate, as well as upon a transition from alginate to digested alginate. Furthermore, we used RNA-sequencing to compare the gene expression of <italic>V. cyclitrophicus</italic> ZF270 grown on alginate and digested alginate. We found striking responses to the form of alginate in growth rate, group formation, motility and chemotaxis, as well as in the expression of corresponding genes. Overall, our work provides insights into the metabolic and cellular regulation that allows cells to forage in heterogeneous nutrient-scapes through degradation-dispersal cycles.</p>

<title>Extracellular break down of alginate delays population growth</title>
<p>To probe the phenotypic and metabolic regulation of bacterial cells during the progressive degradation of a polysaccharide source, we developed an experimental system consisting of the marine bacterium <italic>V. cyclitrophicus</italic> ZF270 growing on alginate, a highly abundant polysaccharide in the ocean. To mimic the local nutrient environment during the colonization of a new polysaccharide source, we used 0.1% weight per volume (w/v) algae-derived alginate in its soluble form (in the following also simply referred to as “alginate”). Since commercially available alginate breakdown products of specific sizes are limited and expensive, with only one monomeric component available at a considerable cost, we simulate an advanced stage of polysaccharide degradation by supplying cells with digested alginate (0.1% (w/v)). This digested alginate is prepared by treating alginate with a readily available endo-acting alginate lyase (see Materials and Methods). This mimics an environment where degradation products like monomers and oligomers become abundant through the action of extracellular alginate lyases. The commercially available alginate lyase has been shown to produce alginate oligomers of progressively smaller size over extended digestion periods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. We used Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) to analyze the composition of the digested alginate, which had been subject to 48 hours of digestion. We found that digested alginate contained more monosaccharides than untreated alginate, which contained more alginate molecules of higher molecular weight (Fig. S1).</p>
<p>Using this system, we first set out to investigate the growth dynamics of <italic>V. cyclitrophicus</italic> ZF270 in well-mixed batch cultures containing either alginate or digested alginate as a sole carbon source (Fig. S2A). We found that similar yields were reached in the alginate and digested alginate cultures as indicated by optical density (Fig. S2B and C) and confirmed by colony counts (Fig. S3), suggesting that the same amount of alginate supports a similar yield irrespective of its degree of depolymerization. However, the onset of growth on alginate was delayed by about 7.5 hours compared to growth on digested alginate (Fig. S2D and E). This is consistent with previous observations that in well-mixed environments the lag time of bacteria growing on alginate can be reduced by the external supplementation of alginate lyases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Together, these findings indicate that growth on polysaccharides such as alginate in well-mixed cultures is initially limited by the extracellular breakdown of the polysaccharide.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Large cell groups form on alginate but not on digested alginate</title>
<p>To better understand how cells react to the changing degree of depolymerization of a polysaccharide source during degradation, we investigated the growth of <italic>V. cyclitrophicus</italic> ZF270 at the level of single cells on alginate and digested alginate. For this purpose, we grew the cells in microfluidic growth chambers, described in detail by Dal Co et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, where cells were provided with a continuous flow of culture media containing either alginate or digested alginate as carbon source. We found that over 24 hours dense groups of more than 1000 cells formed on alginate, filling the entire microfluidic chamber (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). In contrast, cells supplied with digested alginate grew in smaller groups that never exceeded 100 cells per chamber (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B and C</xref>). Reconstructed cell lineages revealed that the large cell groups on alginate formed because cells often did not disperse after division and thereby formed dense cell groups originating from a single cell lineage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The lower cell density on digested alginate could be caused by slower growth or by more cells leaving the chambers. As the maximum growth rate both in bulk and on single cell level is similar in alginate and digested alginate (Fig. S2E and F), it is most likely that the lower cell density in digested alginate is caused by cell dispersal. These observations suggest that cells can modulate their propensity to form groups depending on the state of polysaccharide degradation in their local environment. Similar observations were made with a different model system (<italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> growing on the polysaccharide xylan)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, indicating that group formation on polymeric nutrient sources may be a general mechanism of bacteria that degrade polysaccharides extracellularly.</p>

<title>Transition from alginate to digested alginate triggers density-dependent dispersal of cells</title>
<p>To investigate the transition from the large cell groups formed on alginate to the small groups formed on digested alginate, we subjected <italic>V. cyclitrophicus</italic> ZF270 cells grown on alginate to a switch to digested alginate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Following the limited cell motility on alginate, this switch led to a rapid decrease in cell density within the growth chambers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), presumably caused by cell dispersal. As we previously reported for other <italic>Vibrionaceae</italic> isolates, the growth rate of the cells on alginate was dependent on the local cell density: Initially the growth rate increased with cell density but then decreased at high cell densities, indicating that cell groups can benefit from the sharing of breakdown products generated by each other’s exoenzymes, but also increasingly compete for nutrients<sup>8</sup>. This led us to investigate whether cell in larger groups, potentially experiencing stronger nutrient competition, might have a higher propensity to disperse after a switch to digested alginate than cells in smaller groups. We indeed found an inverse relationship between the number of cells at the time of the nutrient switch and the following change in cell number, meaning that cells in chambers with many cells were more likely to disperse than cells in chambers with less cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Thus, during the transition from polysaccharides to degradation products, we found that the dispersal rate of cells depends on the size of the cell groups, likely through increased motility of cells in large groups.</p>

<title>Cells growing on digested alginate are more motile and chemotax towards new polysaccharide sources</title>
<p>To investigate whether increased cell motility of <italic>V. cyclitrophicus</italic> ZF270 underlies the dispersal of cells observed after a shift to digested alginate, as also previously observed for <italic>C. crescentus</italic> cells on the monosaccharide xylose<sup>4,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, we quantified the motility of single cells supplied with either alginate or digested alginate. We found that the single-cell swimming speed as well as the swimming distance were significantly larger for cells supplied with digested alginate compared to cells supplied with alginate, and that a larger fraction of cells was motile (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). This confirmed increased motility as a cellular response to the exposure to degradation products in the form of digested alginate.</p>

<p>To understand if the motile cells are directed by chemotaxis, we measured the chemotactic strength towards alginate and digested alginate using the In Situ Chemotaxis Assay (ISCA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. We found <italic>V. cyclitrophicus</italic> ZF270 to significantly chemotax toward alginate (chemotactic index <italic>I</italic>c &gt; 1) but not toward digested alginate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). This suggested that the increase in motility is accompanied by chemotaxis toward alginate. Overall, these findings suggest that once the breakdown of a polysaccharide source makes breakdown products available in the local environment, a fraction of cells becomes motile and disperses. These motile cells are guided by chemotaxis towards new polysaccharide sources, allowing them to start a new degradation-dispersal cycle.</p>

<p>Next, we sought to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed phenomenological disparities between cells cultivated on alginate and digested alginate. Due to the challenge of generating knock-out mutants in natural isolates, we used transcriptomics to investigate the differentially expressed genes of <italic>V. cyclitrophicus</italic> ZF270 under these respective conditions. To obtain a high-quality reference genome of <italic>V. cyclitrophicus</italic> ZF270, we sequenced and assembled a new reference genome using combined short and long read sequencing (BioProject PRJNA991487). We then grew cultures on either alginate or digested alginate until mid-exponential phase. To understand which cellular functions were affected by the expression changes, we first performed differential gene expression analysis using the software DESeq2. Here, genes exhibiting a log2 fold expression change greater than 0.5 or smaller than −0.5 between the two conditions, with a Benjamini-Hochberg(BH)-adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value below 0.01, were considered to be differentially expressed (Table S1). Next, we investigated which KEGG categories were enriched in either genes with increased or decreased expression via Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> (Table S2) and found nine categories significantly enriched in genes with increased gene expression on digested alginate, and three categories significantly enriched in genes with decreased gene expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>).</p>

<p>Cells growing on digested alginate showed expression changes in parts of the central metabolism and translation, compared to cells growing on alginate. Specifically, two pathways of the central metabolism were significantly enriched in genes with lower expression on digested alginate (“Valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis” and “Propanoate metabolism” with a negative normalized enrichment score (NES), <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, S4A and B, Table S3 and S4). We also found the gene set that encodes ribosomal proteins significantly enriched with genes highly expressed on digested alginate (positive NES, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> and S4C, Table S5). This implies that cells invest proportionally more of their transcriptome into the production of new proteins, a sign of faster growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Both observations likely relate to the different growth dynamics of <italic>V. cyclitrophicus</italic> ZF270 on digested alginate compared to alginate.</p>
<p>The expression of transporters and secretion systems was generally increased in cells growing on digested alginate, compared to cells growing on alginate. This includes genes with a function in “Bacterial secretion systems”, namely secretion systems I to VI, which mediate protein export through the inner and outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> and S4D, Table S6). Notably, eleven of the thirteen General Secretion Pathway (GSP) genes (part of the type II secretion system) showed 1.1 to 3.4-fold increased expression levels on digested alginate (<italic>p</italic>-values &lt; 0.01, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, Table S8).</p>
<p>The GSP is known to facilitate secretion of various extracellular enzymes like chitinases, proteases, and lipases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, therefore, the positive enrichment on digested alginate may be linked to the export of extracellular alginate lyases. The KEGG BRITE category “Secretion system” was also enriched on digested alginate (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> and S4D, Table S7). It contains additional genes involved in protein export, of which especially genes of type IV pilus assembly, conjugal transfer pilus assembly, and MSHA pilus biogenesis were highly expressed on digested alginate, implicating them as interesting subjects to further research in their role in protein secretion and cell attachment and detachment during degradation-dispersal cycles of polysaccharide-degrading bacteria. Also, the gene set of transporters and in particular ABC transporters were positively enriched (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, Table S10 and S11). The latter showed enrichment especially in genes related to saccharide, iron, zinc, and phosphate transport (Fig. S4E), which suggests that cells growing on digested alginate invest proportionally more of their transcriptome into uptake of not only saccharides but also essential nutrients like iron, zinc, and phosphate, which may become growth-limiting when degradation products are abundantly available.</p>
<p>Both motility and quorum sensing genes increased in expression in cells growing on digested alginate. The positive enrichment of the gene set containing bacterial motility proteins matched the increase in motile cells that we observed in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, Table S12). The set of quorum sensing genes was also positively enriched in cells growing on digested alginate (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> and S4F, Table S13). Quorum sensing is known to control biofilm formation in <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> and may orchestrate the density-dependent dispersal in the presence of degradation products, though the particular signaling cues remain to be uncovered. The strong cellular response to the degree of alginate depolymerization was also emphasized by the finding that transcription factor genes were enriched among genes with decreased expression on digested alginate (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4</xref>, Table S14). The set of genes associated to KEGG’s beta-lactam resistance category was enriched in genes with increased expression on digested alginate. However, most genes in this gene set are also associated to the KEGG pathways “Transporters”, “Quorum sensing”, “Chromosome and associated genes”, and “Peptidoglycan biosynthesis” and thus the enrichment likely reflects expression changes in these categories and may relate to the difference in growth dynamics (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> and S4G, Table S15). Overall, the observed gene expression changes provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the substantial adaptations of <italic>V. cyclitrophicus</italic> ZF270 cells to the polymeric and digested form of alginate.</p>

<title>Growth on digested alginate is associated with increased expression of alginate catabolism, flagellar motility and chemotaxis genes</title>
<p>For a more fine-grained understanding of the impact of the form of alginate on the alginate catabolism, we investigated specifically the expression of genes involved in alginate degradation, uptake, and catabolism. In the closed genome of <italic>V. cyclitrophicus</italic> ZF270, we identified genes that encode CAZymes responsible for alginate degradation, namely alginate lyase genes from the PL6, PL7, PL15, and PL17 family. We identified homologs of alginate transporters (porin <italic>kdgM</italic>, symporter <italic>toaA</italic>, <italic>toaB</italic>, and <italic>toaC</italic>) and metabolic enzymes that shunt into the Entner-Doudoroff pathway (DEHU reductase genes <italic>dehR</italic>, <italic>kdgK</italic>, and <italic>eda</italic>), based on the known genes in the alginate degradation pathway of <italic>Vibrionaceae</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.

Surprisingly, also the expression of most alginate lyase genes increased on digested alginate, especially the expression of secreted alginate lyase genes.

<p>The increased motility of cells observed upon exposure to digested alginate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) led us to evaluate the expression of motility- and chemotaxis-associated genes across digested alginate and alginate treatments. As flagella are the main mode of motility in the genus <italic>Vibrio</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, we focused on the expression of flagella-related genes. In the genome of <italic>V. cyclitrophicus</italic> ZF270 we found a gene cluster that encodes most genes involved in flagellar assembly and that was flanked by chemotaxis genes (hereon called flagellar locus, Fig. S8B, and Table S17). Overall, 21/34 flagellar locus genes were differentially expressed (log2 fold change &gt; 0.5, BH-adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.01) and the majority (90%) of these differentially expressed genes showed increased expression on digested alginate (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). The flagellar genes <italic>flgA</italic>, <italic>fliC</italic>, and <italic>fliH</italic> and the chemotaxis gene <italic>cheW</italic> showed the strongest overexpression (5.4, 3.8, 2.0, and 2.6-fold, respectively). The expression of flagellar biosynthesis genes in <italic>Vibrionacaea</italic> occurs by a cascade of gene expression of four classes of genes (Class I - IV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. We found the expression of the master regulator of the flagellar biosynthesis regulon, the Class I gene <italic>flrA</italic>, to be 1.6-fold increased on digested alginate (BH-adj. <italic>p</italic>-value 3e-19)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. The Class II regulatory genes <italic>flrBC</italic>, controlling Class III genes, and <italic>fliA</italic>, controlling Class IV genes, showed 1.5-fold and 1.3-fold increased expression on digested alginate (BH-adj. <italic>p</italic>-value 1e-12 for <italic>flrB</italic>, 2e-39 for <italic>flrC</italic>, 6e-15 for <italic>fliA</italic>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. These findings suggest that the increased phenotypic motility observed on digested alginate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) is related to the upregulation of flagellar biosynthesis genes. Additionally, the expression of the flagellum filament, encoded by <italic>fliC</italic> genes of the flagellar locus, was partially increased: <italic>flaD</italic> and <italic>flaC</italic> expression were increased by 3.8 and 1.6-fold, whereas the <italic>flaA</italic> gene was not significantly differentially expressed (BH-adj. <italic>p</italic>-value 7e-37, 2e-19, and 1e-02, respectively) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>, Table S6). This suggests that cells grown on digested alginate have a <italic>flaD</italic>-rich filament composition, which has been shown to alter the swimming and adhesion characteristics of bacterial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Lastly, we found that most genes involved in chemotaxis and located in the flagellar locus are highly expressed in cells grown on digested alginate (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>) and likely drive the chemotactic activity of <italic>V. cyclitrophicus</italic> ZF270 during dispersal. Overall, our findings elucidate that cellular responses upon exposure to degradation products manifest in increased expression of genes involved in extracellular alginate breakdown and alginate catabolism as well as flagellar assembly and chemotaxis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>On Earth organic carbon is mostly present in the form of polysaccharides<sup>1,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, which are often in a particulate state and form a heterogeneous resource landscape. Over the last years, the study of extracellular bacterial degradation of polysaccharides has revealed that bacterial growth on polysaccharides increases with increased cell density, enabling cells to benefit from the exoenzymes and extracellular degradation products of surrounding cells otherwise lost to diffusion (“cooperative growth”)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. However, cells have been observed not only to aggregate on polysaccharide sources, but also to leave them before the source is depleted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. This has thus far been interpreted with optimal foraging theory, which weighs the diminishing returns of harvesting resources from a nutrient hotspot against the predation and opportunity costs which ensue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, but the cellular mechanisms that drive the cell dispersal remain unclear.</p>
<p>Our work links these observations and connects them to the cellular mechanisms that underlie the degradation-dispersal cycles of bacterial degraders, which we see as basal drivers of the biogeochemical processing of polysaccharides in heterogeneous nutrient-scapes. When bacteria encounter a new source of biomass, their local environment likely contains few mono- or oligosaccharides but is rich in polysaccharides which usually require extracellular breakdown (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, “Finding a new nutrient source”). General concepts of how bacteria recognize the presence of large biopolymers remain elusive, but it was proposed that “sentry” enzymes are constitutively expressed at a basal level to cleave mono- or oligosaccharides from polysaccharides, which cells can take up and which prime their metabolism for the degradation of the respective polysaccharide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. It is not known yet how widespread the concept of sentry enzymes may be, but the observation of a constitutively expressed PL7 and PL15 family alginate lyase gene in <italic>Z. galactanivorans</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> is mirrored in our work by the constant expression of an extracellular PL7 family alginate lyase gene, which may act as sentry enzyme that helps to initiate alginate degradation when cells encounter alginate.</p>

<caption><title>Bacterial growth and regulation on patches of polysaccharides.</title>
<p>Based on our findings we propose a conceptual model where degradation of polysaccharides proceeds after the encounter of a polymer source by bacterial cells that have a basal exoenzyme production of “sentry” enzymes (“Encounter of a new carbon source”). This phase is succeeded by group formation, which enables cells to benefit from exoenzymes of neighboring cells and diffusing degradation products (“Early-stage polysaccharide breakdown”). The following phase includes cooperative extracellular degradation of the polysaccharide source, further increasing the concentration of available degradation products. These degradation products trigger the overexpression of alginate degrading, importing, and catabolizing enzymes, ensuring swift polysaccharide degradation (“Late-stage polysaccharide breakdown”). The increased pool of breakdown products also cues flagellar swimming and chemotaxis in a subpopulation of cells towards new polysaccharide sources, thus restarting the cycle of degradation of polymeric carbohydrates by heterotrophic bacteria.

<p>It has been previously found that cells grow slowly until a critical cell density for efficient cooperative polymer breakdown is reached<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, observed here as the formation of large cell groups. In this stage, cells start to benefit from the diffusing degradation products and exoenzymes of cells in their local environment and reach their maximal growth rate (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, “Early-stage polysaccharide breakdown”). We found that cells grown on degradation products reached their maximal growth earlier and showed increased expression of ribosomal biosynthesis, enzyme secretion, especially of secreted alginate lyases, transporters, quorum sensing and expression changes in the central carbon metabolism. The secretion of secreted alginate lyases might seem surprising and wasteful in a monomer-rich environment. We speculate that enhanced enzyme secretion supports the continued growth of detached bacteria’s offspring that remain on the particle, as observed in the case of <italic>V. splendus</italic> 1AO1 during chitin particle degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Another reason may be that cells primarily rely on intracellular monosaccharide levels to trigger the upregulation of genes associated with polysaccharide degradation and catabolism, as seen in <italic>E. coli</italic> across various carbon sources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, unable to modulate the expression of degrading enzymes based on the extracellular presence of monomers.</p>
<p>We show that cells respond to the exposure to degradation products with dispersal from dense cell groups by means of increased flagellum-driven swimming (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, “Late-stage polysaccharide breakdown”), decreasing their local cell number. This finding matches with previous observations of cells leaving biopolymer particles before they are depleted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. A plausible explanation for this density-dependent dispersal is that cells in larger groups compete with each other for nutrients and space, while not profiting from cooperative degradation anymore due to the abundance of degradation products. Motility has also been shown to increase the encounter rate of cells with sources of nutrients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, suggesting motility as a strategy that allows cells to escape from the ensuing competition. Previous work in <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> demonstrated that a flagellum knock-out mutant formed larger cell groups, resulting in reduced growth rates due to intercellular competition<sup>4,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. While it would be interesting to study non-motile mutants of <italic>V. cyclitrophicus</italic> ZF270, the non-tractability of natural isolates makes direct tests of molecular mechanisms difficult. Additionally, subjecting cells separately to the two monomeric units of alginate or oligomers of defined size could improve our understanding of the specific molecules that trigger motility, but this was experimentally not feasible. We also found that the presence of degradation products increased the expression of chemotaxis genes and detected that cells chemotaxis toward polymeric alginate, but not digested alginate, analogous to previous findings on chitin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Even though this may first seem counterintuitive, it makes sense in the light of the dispersal process: chemotaxis towards degradation products would prevent cells from leaving a nutrient source, whereas chemotaxis towards polymers may increase encounters with a fresh nutrient source<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, “Finding a new nutrient source”), on which cells can re-initiate degradation. This strategy allows cells to alternate between degradation and dispersal to acquire carbon and energy in a heterogeneous world with nutrient hotspots<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The heterogeneous landscape of polysaccharide hotspots in natural systems requires bacteria to effectively break down polymeric carbohydrates as well as readily ensure dispersal to new nutrient hotspots. Our findings show that the degree of depolymerization of the polysaccharide influences this decision, altering the growth dynamics, metabolic activity, and motility of cells. Our study also contextualizes the surprising finding that foraging bacteria majorly leave polysaccharide particles before the last third of the particle is consumed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Dispersal from a partially degraded carbon source may serve several purposes: (i) escaping competition that ensues within large cell groups, (ii) ensuring the spread of a part of the clonal population to new environments as bet hedging strategy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>, here guided by chemotaxis towards new nutrient hotspots, (iii) preventing whole populations degrading a sinking marine particle or a deposited sediment particle to be buried in depth where nutrient hotspots become sparse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>, and/or (iv) increase the genetic variation in bacterial populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. However, dispersal may also occur when a nutrient source offers a surplus of carbon while other essential nutrients become limiting, as the increased expression of iron, zinc, and phosphate transporters in cells grown on digested alginate suggested. These findings emphasize that metabolic molecules can also act as triggers of dispersal, expanding upon the current perspective of dispersal in biofilms as a reaction to dispersal cues like NO, signalling molecules, nutrient starvation, and oxygen starvation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. The study of bacterial motility on increasingly complex biomass particles will reveal the role of the nutrient composition of the present nutrient hotspot on the bacterial decision-making. Overall, these new insights into the cellular mechanisms and regulation that drive degradation-dispersal cycles contribute to our understanding of the microbially driven remineralization of biomass, and factors that modulate this process. The open questions of how bacteria sense polysaccharides in their environment, which cell signaling pathways integrate the presence of degradation products in the cellular decision-making of degradation and dispersal, and to what extent cell populations coordinate this decision, present an exciting avenue of further research.</p>

Carbon sources were prepared in nanopure water and filter sterilized using 0.40 µm Surfactant-Free Cellulose Acetate filters (Corning, USA). Well-mixed batch experiments in alginate or digested alginate medium were performed in 96-well plates (Greiner Bio) and growth dynamics were measured using a microwell plate reader (Biotek, USA). Assays were initiated as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Briefly, 1 ml from a culture grown for 18 h on Marine broth was centrifuged at 5000 g in 1.5 ml microfuge tubes for 5 minutes. The supernatant was discarded and the cell pellet was subjected to two rounds of washing with the basal TR salts medium. The cell-pellet was then resuspended in 1 ml of TR salts medium and 5 µl of this suspension inoculated into 195 µl TR medium with either carbon source (∼10<sup>5</sup> colony forming units (CFUs ml<sup>−1</sup>) in a 96-well plate (Greiner Bio). The optical density (600 nm) was then measured every 15 minutes for 40 hours. All measurements had six biological replicates.</p>

<title>Alginate oligosaccharide measurements</title>
<p>Oligosaccharide measurements were performed using liquid chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS). Samples were prepared by diluting 1:20 in milliQ water and 5 µL of sample was injected per measurement. Chromatographic separation was performed using an Agilent 1290 stack, using an Agilent HILIC-Z column (2.7 µm particles, 2.1 x 50 mm). Mobile phase A contained 10% acetonitrile (Fisher Scientific) and 0.1% medronic acid (Agilent), and Mobile phase B contained 90% acetonitrile and 0.1% medronic acid. The separation was performed as follows: Mobile phase B 100% for 1 minute, gradient to 30% phase B over 3 minutes, 30% phase B for 30 seconds, and equilibration of 100% phase B for 5 minutes. The flow rate was 400 µL min<sup>−1</sup> at 30 °C. Samples were measured using an Agilent 6520 mass spectrometer in negative mode, in 4 GHz high-resolution mode.

<p>To assess whether polymeric alginate and digested alginate attract <italic>Vibrio cyclitrophicus</italic> ZF270, we used the <italic>In Situ</italic> Chemotaxis Assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> (ISCA), a microfluidic device consisting of a 5 × 5 array of microwells that can be individually loaded with solutions of different chemicals (110 µl each). Once the ISCA is deployed in an aqueous environment, the chemicals diffuse out of the wells through a small port, creating chemical gradients which will guide chemotactic bacteria inside the wells of the device<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. <italic>Vibrio cyclitrophicus</italic> ZF210 was plated on Marine Agar (BD Difco) from a glycerol stock and grown for 16 h at 27 °C. A single colony was then incubated in 10% Marine Broth (BD Difco) in 0.22-μm filtered artificial seawater (Instant Ocean, Spectrum Brands) and grown overnight at 27 °C and 180 rpm. The culture was diluted down to 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells ml<sup>-1</sup> in 0.22 μm filtered artificial seawater (Instant Ocean, Spectrum Brands) to perform the chemotaxis experiment. Both chemoattractants (alginate and digested alginate) were diluted in sterile seawater (35 g l<sup>-1</sup>; Instant Ocean, Spectrum Brands) at a final concentration of 0.1% and then filtered with a 0.2 μm filter (Millipore) to remove particles and potential contaminants. Within the ISCA, one full row of five wells was used per chemoattractant as technical replicates. The chemoattractants were injected in triplicate ISCA with a sterile 1 ml syringe (Codau) and needle (27 G, Henke Sass Wolf). A last row containing 0.2 μm-filtered seawater acted as negative control accounting for cells swimming in the device by random motility only. Experiments were conducted by incubating the ISCAs for 1 h in the diluted <italic>Vibrio cyclitrophicus</italic> ZF270 culture. Upon time completion, a sterile syringe and needle were used to retrieve the content of the wells and transferred to 1 ml microfuge tubes resulting in a pooling of a row of 5 wells containing the same sample. Sample staining was performed with SYBR Green I (Thermo Fisher) and the chemotactic response was quantified by counting cells using flow cytometry. The strength of the chemotactic response was determined by the mean chemotactic index (<italic>I</italic>C), defined as the ratio of the number of cells found in each chemoattractant to the number of cells in control wells containing filtered seawater (so that attraction corresponds to <italic>I</italic>C &gt; 1).</p>

This was done in parallel for six flasks. Once cultures in the flasks reached mid-exponential phase (10 hours and 15 hours after inoculation for digested alginate and alginate, respectively) and had approximately the same OD (0.39 for digested alginate and 0.41 for alginate), 2 ml of cultures were harvested for RNA extraction.

<title>Transcriptomic analysis: Sequencing, pre-processing, differential expression analysis, and functional analysis</title>
<p>Sequencing (12 M reads, 2 x 50 bp) of the isolated RNA was performed by MiGS after rRNA depletion using RiboZero Plus (Ilumina). cDNA libraries were prepared using an Illumina DNA Prep kit and IDT 10 bp UDI indices, and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 2000. Preprocessing of the raw reads was carried out as follows: Quality control was performed with FastQC (v0.11.9)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup> and reads were trimmed with Trimmomatic (v0.38)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>; the high-quality reads were mapped to the reference genome (described above) with Bowtie2 (v2.3.5.1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>; binarization, sorting, and indexing were done with Samtools (v1.10)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>; gene counts were computed with the featureCount function of Subread (v2.0.1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Differential expression analysis was performed with DESeq2 (v1.30.1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. In brief, DESeq2 normalizes the raw read counts with normalization factors (“size factors”) to account for differences in sequencing depth between samples. Subsequently, gene-wise dispersion estimates are computed for each gene separately using maximum likelihood, and then shrunk toward the values predicted by the dispersion-mean dependence curve to obtain final dispersion values. Finally, DESeq2 fits a negative binomial model to the read counts and performs significance testing using the Wald test. Here reported <italic>p</italic>-values result from the Wald test of read counts from the digested alginate condition compared to the alginate condition and were adjusted for multiple testing by Benjamini-Hochberg correction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup> as implemented in the p.adjust function of base R (v4.1.2).

<title>Visualization of gene maps was performed in R with the ggplot2 package (v3.4.0) and the extension gggenes (v0.4.1) by David Wilkins</title>
<p>For systematic functional analysis we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> using the fgsea function of the fgsea package (v1.20.0) with minimal number of unique genes per gene set “minSize” = 5 and number of permutations “nPermSimple” = 1000000. In brief, GSEA takes the full gene list ranked by log2 fold change and annotated with K numbers as input and determines whether the member genes of any KEGG pathway are randomly distributed throughout the ranked gene list or whether they are primarily found at the top or bottom<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. This is quantified by the enrichment score (ES), which corresponds to a weighted Kolmogorov-Smirnov-like statistic. The ES of each gene set is normalized to the mean enrichment of random samples of the same size to account for the size of the set, yielding the normalized enrichment score (NES). To estimate the significance level of the enrichment score, the <italic>p</italic>-value of the observed enrichment score is calculated relative to a null distribution that was computed from permuted data.

<title>Image analysis</title>
<p>Cells within microscopy images were segmented and tracked using ilastik (v1.3) (“pixel classification workflow” and “tracking with probabilities workflow”). Phase contrast images were used for alignment, segmentation, tracking and linking. Images were cropped at the boundaries of each microfluidic chamber. The lineage identity of each single cell was assigned by ilastik’s tracking plugin and visualized by coloring the segmented cells, respectively. The growth rate of each cell was computed as the change of cell area over time, i.e., via a linear regression of the single-cell area over the time between consecutive cell divisions, based on ilastik’s segmentation and tracking output. Cells that were tracked over less than three frames were excluded. Measurement of swimming speeds and displacement of cells was performed using ilastik (v1.4), ImageJ (v2.3) and Trackmate (v7.5.2). Briefly, cell-segmentation (“pixel classification workflow” in ilastik) and tracking (“animal tracking workflow” in ilastik) were performed using the high frame rate phase contrast images in ilastik (v1.4). Cell trajectories and properties were then computed using the output of the ilastik workflow in Trackmate.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors attempt to understand how cells forage for spatially heterogeneous complex polysaccharides. They aimed to quantify the foraging behavior and interrogate its genetic basis. The results show that cells aggregate near complex polysaccharides, and disperse when simpler byproducts are added. Dispersing cells tend to move towards the polysaccharide. The authors also use transcriptomics to attempt to understand which genes support each of these behaviors - with motility and transporter-related genes being highly expressed during dispersal, as expected.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The paper is well written and builds on previous studies by some of the authors showing similar behavior by a different species of bacteria (Caulobacter) on another polysaccharide (xylan). The conceptual model presented at the end encapsulates the findings and provides an interesting hypothesis. I also find the observation of chemotaxis towards the polysaccharide in the experimental conditions interesting.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Much of the genetic analysis, as it stands, is quite speculative and descriptive. I found myself confused about many of the genes (e.g., quorum sensing) that pop up enriched during dispersal quite in contrast to my expectations. While the authors do mention some of this in the text as worth following up on, I think the analysis as it stands adds little insight into the behaviors studied. However, I acknowledge that it might have the potential to generate hypotheses and thus aid future studies. Further, I found the connections to the carbon cycle and marine environments in the abstract weak --- the microfluidics setup by the authors is nice, but it provides limited insight into naturalistic environments where the spatial distribution and dimensionality of resources are expected to be qualitatively different.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The paper sets out to understand the mechanisms underlying the colonization and degradation of marine particles using a natural Vibrio isolate as a model. The data are measurements of motility and gene expression using microfluidic devices and RNA sequencing. The results reveal that degradation products of alginate do stimulate motility but not chemotaxis. The evidence for these claims is strong. The story of how particle degradation occurs through colonization and dispersal has modest support in the data. A quantitative description of these dynamics awaits future studies.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The microfluidic and transcriptional measurements are the central strengths of the paper as they allow the delineation of phenotypes at the cellular and molecular levels in the presence of polymer and byproducts of polymer degradation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The explanation of the microfluidics measurements is somewhat confusing but I think this could be easily remedied. The quantitative interpretation of the dispersal data could also be improved and I'm not clear if the data support the claim made.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this manuscript, Stubbusch and coauthors examine the foraging behavior of a marine species consuming an abundant marine polysaccharide. Laboratory experiments in a microfluidic setup are complemented with transcriptomic analyses aiming at assessing the genetic bases of the observed behavior. Bacterial cells consuming the polysaccharide form cohesive aggregates, while they start dispersing away when the byproduct of the digestion of the polysaccharide starts accumulating. Dispersing cells, tend to be attracted by the polysaccharide. Expression data show that motility genes are enriched during the dispersal phase, as expected. Counterintuitively, in the same phase, genes for transporters and digestions of polysaccharides are also highly expressed.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The manuscript is very well written and easy to follow. The topic is interesting and timely. The genetic analyses provide a new, albeit complex, angle to the study of foraging behaviors in bacteria, adding to previous studies conducted on other species.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
I find this paper very descriptive and speculative. The results of the genetic analyses are quite counterintuitive; therefore, I understand the difficulty of connecting them to the observations coming from experiments in the microfluidic device. However, they could be better placed in the literature of foraging - dispersal cycles, beyond bacteria. In addition, the interpretation of the results is sometimes confusing.</p>
