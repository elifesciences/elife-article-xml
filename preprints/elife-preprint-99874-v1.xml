<title>Abstract</title><p>G-protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30) is a bicarbonate receptor that plays a vital role in cellular responses to extracellular pH and ion homeostasis. Despite its significance, the mechanisms by which GPR30 interacts with bicarbonate ions remain elusive. There is no consensus on a drug that targets GPR30, and the difficulty in the pharmacological analysis has limited biological and drug discovery researches on GPR30. Here, we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of human GPR30 in the presence of bicarbonate ions at 3.2 Å resolution. Our structure reveals unique extracellular pockets and critical residues for bicarbonate binding and activation. Functional assays demonstrate that mutations in these residues impair bicarbonate-induced GPR30 activation, underscoring their importance in receptor function. This study also provides insights into the G-protein coupling, highlighting the structural divergence between GPR30 and other GPCRs. Our findings not only advance the understanding of the role of GPR30 in pH homeostasis but also pave the way for the development of high-affinity drugs targeting GPR30 for therapeutic interventions in diseases associated with acid-base imbalance.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The extracellular environment regulates cellular responses, as exemplified by pH and ion homeostasis. The acid-base balance, largely based on the bicarbonate buffer system <italic>in vivo</italic>, serves as a vital mechanism that maintains the optimal pH for cellular function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> Changes in the extracellular pH and ion homeostasis are monitored by membrane channels and receptors, such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). However, it remains unknown whether and how the acid–base balance-related ions, protons and bicarbonate ions, bind to the receptors and cause conformational changes that lead to intracellular signal transduction.</p>
<p>Previous studies established four acid–base balance-related GPCRs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> that respond to an increase in proton concentration. None of the structures of these proton-sensing GPCRs in a proton-bound form has been determined, although the cryo-EM structures of apo-GPR134 (G2A) and its oxidized fatty acid- and N-acyl amino acid-bound forms have been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> While these proton-sensing GPCRs are likely to be involved in pH homeostasis, particularly in the acidic tumor microenvironment, at inflamed sites, and in ischemia-reperfusion injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, it remains unknown how protons cooperate with these receptors working as acid–base balance-related GPCRs.</p>
<p>We recently reported that the physiological concentration of bicarbonate ions, a counterpart of protons in the bicarbonate buffer system, activates G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30), which leads to G<sub>q</sub>-coupled calcium responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Our study also demonstrated that GPR30 in brain mural cells regulates blood flow and ischemia– reperfusion injury. GPR30 was identified as a G protein-coupled estrogen receptor that mediates the rapid non-genomic action of estradiol (E2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. However, despite numerous reports on the pleiotropic functions of GPR30 <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, there is controversy surrounding the responses of GPR30 to E2 <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, <italic>ex vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, and <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. The broad expression of Gpr30<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, including blood vessels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, stomach, and lung, has also raised the possibility of its non-estrogenic functions. We demonstrated that three amino acids, E115, Q138, and H307, are essential for the bicarbonate-induced activation of GPR30, according to the public homology model (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gpcrdb.org/">https://gpcrdb.org/</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. However, we did not examine whether bicarbonate ions interact with GPR30 and cause conformational changes. Moreover, to date, there is no consensus on a high-affinity drug that targets GPR30, and the difficulty in the pharmacological analysis has limited biological and drug discovery research on GPR30. To elucidate the bicarbonate–GPR30 interaction and to clarify the first structural identification of an acid-base balance-related GPCR, we report the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of human GPR30 in the presence of bicarbonate ions.</p>

<title>Overall structure</title>
<p>For the structural study, we used the full-length human GPR30 sequence. To efficiently purify the stable GPCR-G-protein complex, the receptor and mini-G<sub>sqi</sub> were incorporated in a ‘Fusion-G system’ by combining two complex stabilization techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>—figure supplement 1A, B). The modified receptor and G-protein were co-expressed in HEK293 cells and purified by Flag affinity chromatography in the presence of 200 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>. After an incubation with nanobody 35 (Nb35) and single chain scFv16, which binds to mini-G<sub>sqi</sub>, the complex was purified by size exclusion chromatography (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>—figure supplement 1C, D). The structure of the purified complex was determined by single-particle cryo-EM analysis, with an overall resolution of 3.21 Å (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>—figure supplement 2, and “Methods”). As the extracellular portion of the receptor was poorly resolved, we performed receptor focused refinement, yielding a density map with a nominal resolution of 3.30 Å, which was combined with the overall refined map. The resulting composite map allowed us to precisely build the atomic model of the components, including the receptor (residues 51 to 196, 207 to 288, and 296 to 340, G-proteins, and scFv16 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, B). Nb35 was not visible in the cryo-EM map, probably because of the effect of the mini-G<sub>s</sub> modification, although the interactive residues with Nb35 were not changed.</p>

<p>The receptor consists of the canonical 7 transmembrane helices (TM) connected by three intracellular loops (ICL1–3) and three extracellular loops (ECL1–3), and the amphipathic helix 8 at the C-terminus (H8) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Most of the TMs are kinked as in typical GPCRs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, but TM1 is also kinked at P71<sup>1.44</sup> (superscripts indicate Ballesteros-Weinstein numbers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>), whereas TM1 adopts a straight α-helix in most class A GPCRs. ICL1 and ECL1 contain short α helices (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, C). The short ICL3 was completely visible in the cryo-EM map (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>—figure supplement 3), while residues 197 to 206 in ECL2 and 289 to 295 in ECL3 were disordered (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). ECL2 is attached to ECL1 by the disulfide bond between C130<sup>ECL1</sup> and C207<sup>ECL2</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), which is highly conserved in class A GPCRs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. The cryo-EM structure did not superimpose well on the AlphaFold-predicted structure (Q99527 in the AlphaFold <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>database) with a root mean square deviation (R.M.S.D.) of Cα atoms of 2.33 Å (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>—figure supplement 1A). The conserved D<sup>3.49</sup>R<sup>3.50</sup>Y<sup>3.51</sup> motif<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> in the predicted structure represents an inactive state (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>—figure supplement 1B). Moreover, ECLs 2 and 3 are rich in cysteine residues, which form incorrect disulfide bonds in the predicted structure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>—figure supplement 1C). These comparisons support the usefulness of experimental structural determination.</p>

<title>Extracellular pockets</title>
<p>The interaction network between ECL1–3 covers the extracellular side of the receptor: ECL2 is anchored to ECL1 via the disulfide bond and ECL3 extends between ECL1 and ECL2, with Q296<sup>7.25</sup> and F298<sup>7.27</sup> located within the receptor cavity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). R299<sup>ECL3</sup> and the backbone carbonyl oxygen of S297<sup>ECL3</sup> interact with D210<sup>ECL2</sup>, and N296<sup>7.25</sup> forms polar interactions with E115<sup>2.60</sup>, Q121<sup>2.66</sup>, and N310<sup>7.39</sup>. These interactions among the ECLs create four extracellular pockets (Pockets A–D) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). While Pockets A–C are positively-charged, Pocket D is negatively, and the size of each pocket is varied. Pocket A consists of ECL1, TM1, and TM7 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), while pocket B is formed by TM6, TM7, and ECL1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). These two pockets are separated by R122<sup>ECL1</sup> and H307<sup>7.36</sup>. Pocket A is hydrophobic and appears unsuitable for bicarbonate binding (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Pocket B has hydrophilic residues (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>), but given the invisible region of ECL3 (residues 289 to 295), we cannot rule out the possibility that the pocket is buried. Pocket C consists of ECL2, ECL3, TM5, and TM6, and is positively charged due to the presence of arginine and histidine residues (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, E). However, pocket C is relatively superficial compared to the other pockets. No density corresponding to bicarbonate is observed in these pockets (A–C), indicating that they are not ligand binding sites. Nonetheless, they may serve as potential binding sites for allosteric modulators or agonist drugs targeting GPR30.</p>

<p>Pocket D consists of ECL1–3 and TM2–7, and is the largest among the four pockets. Although the surface of pocket D is partitioned by the C130<sup>3.25</sup>-C207<sup>45.52</sup> disulfide bond and F208<sup>ECL2</sup>, it is connected inside the receptor, deep enough to reach W272<sup>6.48</sup>. Pocket D contains numerous hydrophilic residues such as aspartate, glutamate, asparagine, and glutamine, which favor bicarbonate binding, suggesting that pocket D is a good candidate for the bicarbonate binding site.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Insights into bicarbonate binding</title>
<p>To predict the bicarbonate binding site, we performed an exhaustive mutant analysis of hydrophilic residues in pockets A–D, which was not done in the previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. We confirmed the similar expression levels of the HA-tagged hGPR30 mutants by western blotting (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>—figure supplement 1A, B). To evaluate the bicarbonate-induced activation of GPR30, we used the TGFα shedding assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. The HA-tagged GPR30 wild-type showed a bicarbonate-dependent response, while the H307<sup>7.36</sup>A mutant completely abolished the response, consistent with previous findings <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, B). These results indicate that the present experimental procedure is useful to evaluate the bicarbonate-induced activation of GPR30. Furthermore, the C207<sup>ECL2</sup>A mutation that disrupts the disulfide bond between ECL2 and ECL1, and the P71<sup>1.44</sup> mutant that disrupts the characteristic kink in TM1, also abolished the bicarbonate response. These findings underscore the critical role of the structural integrity of the receptor, and provide compelling evidence that the bicarbonate response is mediated through GPR30.</p>

<p>Among the hydrophilic residue mutants, the alanine mutants of D125<sup>ECL1</sup>, S134<sup>3.29</sup>, D210<sup>ECL2</sup>, and Q215<sup>5.39</sup> reduced the bicarbonate response (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, B). Combining these data with previous studies, we mapped the residues essential for the bicarbonate response on the current structure (P71<sup>1.44</sup>, E115<sup>2.60</sup>, D125<sup>ECL1</sup>. S134<sup>3.29</sup>, Q138<sup>3.33</sup>, C207<sup>ECL2</sup>, D210<sup>ECL2</sup>, Q215<sup>5.39</sup>, and H307<sup>7.36</sup>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Except for the structure-contributing residues (C207<sup>ECL2</sup>and P71<sup>1.44</sup>) and H307<sup>7.36</sup>, the essential residues face pocket D, further supporting its role as the bicarbonate binding site. H307<sup>7.36</sup> separates pockets A and B (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), and the nearby mutants Q296<sup>7.25</sup> and N310<sup>7.39</sup> had no effect on the bicarbonate response, suggesting the indirect importance of stabilizing the active conformation of the receptor, rather than directly binding to bicarbonate.</p>
<p>Given the low affinity of GPR30 for bicarbonate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> and the challenges posed by carboxylic acid decarboxylation in cryo-EM analysis, visualizing bicarbonate at this resolution could be difficult. Nevertheless, we observed a weak density in pocket D, allowing us to assign bicarbonate (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). The bicarbonate is surrounded by Q138<sup>3.33</sup>, Q215<sup>5.39</sup>, and E218<sup>5.42</sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Q138<sup>3.33</sup> and Q215<sup>5.39</sup> are residues with reduced bicarbonate responses due to mutations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Most bicarbonate binding modes in other structures require recognition by asparagine and glutamine residues, in agreement with our model. Moreover, Q138<sup>3.33</sup>, Q215<sup>5.39</sup>, and E218<sup>5.42</sup> are evolutionarily conserved in fish to human GPR30s (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>—figure supplement 2). Below the bicarbonate binding site, M141<sup>3.36</sup> forms a hydrophobic interaction with W272<sup>6.48</sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>), a toggle switch motif essential for receptor activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. These observations allowed us to speculate that bicarbonate binding induces conformational changes in TM3 and TM5, facilitating receptor activation.</p>

<p>The C-terminal helix of Gα<sub>q</sub> (α5-helix) is deeply enters the intracellular cavity of GPR30, resulting in the formation of an active signaling complex. On the C-terminal side of the α5-helix, the backbone carbonyl of Y243<sup>G.H5.23</sup> (superscript indicates the common Gα numbering [CGN] system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>) hydrogen bonds with R155<sup>3.50</sup> in the conserved D<sup>3.49</sup>R<sup>3.50</sup>Y<sup>3.51</sup> motif<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). In addition, N244<sup>G.H5.24</sup> forms hydrogen bonds with the peptide backbones of Y324<sup>7.53</sup> and F331<sup>8.50</sup>. ICL3 faces the middle part of the α5-helix, with three characteristic arginine residues (R248<sup>6.24</sup>, R251<sup>6.27</sup>, and R254<sup>6.30</sup>) surrounding D233<sup>G.H5.13</sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). R248<sup>6.24</sup> and R254<sup>6.27</sup> form hydrogen bonds with D233<sup>G.H.13</sup> and Q237<sup>G.H5.17</sup>, respectively. Moreover, R251<sup>6.30</sup> extends toward the G-protein and hydrogen bonds with the peptide backbones of G207<sup>G.h4s6.11</sup> and H209<sup>G.h4s6.13</sup>. At ICL2, M163<sup>34.51</sup> fits into a hydrophobic pocket composed of the α5-helix, the αN-β2 loop, and the β2-β3 loop of the Gα subunit, as in other GPCR-G<sub>q</sub> complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C–H</xref>). Above it, L159<sup>3.54</sup> and A162<sup>34.50</sup> form extensive hydrophobic interactions with L235<sup>G.H5.15</sup>, L236<sup>G.H5.16</sup>, and L240<sup>G.H5.20</sup> in the α5-helix. These tight interactions with the α5-helix would enable the coupling of GPR30 with G<sub>q</sub>.</p>

<p>The position of the α5-helix aligns with those in other GPCR-G<sub>q</sub> complexes, but the position of the αN-helix is rotated away from the receptor (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>). The superimposition of the Gα subunits indicates that the rotation is not due to the movement of the entire G protein, but rather a 33° bend in the αN-helix (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref>). This is attributed to variations in the interactions of the αN-helix with its receptors. The αN-helix interacts with the intracellular ends of ICL2 and TM4 in receptor-specific modes. In most G<sub>q</sub>-coupled structures, ICL2 adopts an α-helix and R<sup>34.55</sup> interacts with R38<sup>G.hns1.03</sup> at the end of the αN-helix. A typical example is the head-to-toe interaction between R185<sup>34.55</sup> and R32<sup>G.hns1.03</sup> in the serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). However, in GPR30, ICL2 does not adopt an α-helix and R<sup>34.55</sup> is replaced by L167<sup>34.55</sup>, which displaces R32<sup>G.hns1.03</sup> downward through their interaction. Moreover, T170<sup>34.58</sup> and R169<sup>34.57</sup> form direct hydrogen bonds with R31<sup>G.hns1.02</sup> and Y243<sup>G.H5.23</sup>, respectively, which are not observed in other GPCR-G<sub>q</sub> complexes. We hypothesize that these interactions may underpin the distinct αN rotation: A similar interaction between R38<sup>G.hns1.03</sup> and L136<sup>34.54</sup> is also observed in histamine H1 receptor (H<sub>1</sub>R)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>), in which translational rather than rotational motion of αN is observed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study has elucidated the distinctive structure of GPR30, characterized by the kink of TM1 and the presence of multiple extracellular pockets formed by ECLs. Structural analysis and unbiased mutagenesis experiments on hydrophilic residues highlighted the largest pocket, designated as pocket D, as pivotal for bicarbonate recognition. Through putative bicarbonate modeling, we have proposed the binding mode of bicarbonate ions and the receptor activation mechanism. Overall, the elucidated structure of the extracellular domain of GPR30 and the insights into bicarbonate binding could facilitate the development of high-affinity drugs targeting GPR30.</p>
<p>It should be noted that our current model cannot fully explain all the mutagenesis results, such as those involving E115<sup>2.60</sup>, D125<sup>ECL1</sup>. and D210<sup>ECL2</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Although negatively charged residues generally repel bicarbonate, some structures have indicated their involvement in bicarbonate recognition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Thus, it is conceivable that these residues are transiently involved in bicarbonate binding, or two bicarbonate molecules might be accommodated within pocket D of GPR30. Future studies should focus on higher-resolution structures and approaches such as using bicarbonate derivatives to further evaluate bicarbonate binding.</p>
<p>GPR30 exhibits low homology to other GPCRs, with even closely related receptors sharing less than 30% sequence identity. A BLAST analysis revealed that GPR30 shares the highest sequence identity of 28% with the type 2 angiotensin II receptor (AT<sub>2</sub>R) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>—figure supplement 1). Consequently, we compared the current structure of GPR30 with the ligand-bound AT<sub>2</sub>R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. The superimposition of GPR30 and AT<sub>2</sub>R, with a Cα R.M.S.D. of 2.17 Å, suggests significant structural divergence between the two (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Notably, there is no structural commonality between GPR30 and AT2R in terms of the orientations of their respective TMs. Specifically, the extracellular half of TM1 in GPR30 extends outward, and is kinked at P71<sup>1.44</sup> in the center of TM1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Near P71<sup>1.44</sup>, Y65<sup>1.38</sup> and F70<sup>1.43</sup> are oriented towards the interior of the receptor, forming hydrophobic interactions with L113<sup>2.58</sup> and L331<sup>7.40</sup> to stabilize the kink. In the examination of the loops, ECL2 of AT<sub>2</sub>R features a short β-sheet commonly found in peptide-activated class A GPCRs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, whereas that of GPR30 adopts an elongated conformation that covers the extracellular pocket essential for the bicarbonate response (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, B). These comparisons underscore the unique structural characteristics of GPR30.</p>

<p>In most GPCRs, TM1 forms a straight α-helix and is positioned away from the orthosteric pocket formed by TM2–7. However, TM1 undergoes an inward movement due to allosteric conformational changes during agonist binding. The cannabinoid receptor CB<sub>1</sub> exemplifies this, with TM1 kinked at G127<sup>1.43</sup> and folding inward upon ligand binding <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Similarly, the β<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptor (β<sub>2</sub>AR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> and adenosine A2A receptor (A<sub>2A</sub>R)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> exhibit inward movements of TM1, with TM1 bending at the glycine residues rather than kinking (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>, E). By contrast, TM1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>moves 4 Å outward in the endothelin ET<sub>B</sub> receptor (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). In GPR30, TM1 is kinked at P71<sup>1.44</sup> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>), indicating that this kink occurs regardless of the receptor activation state. Indeed, the P71<sup>1.44</sup>A mutation, which eliminates the kink in TM1, completely abolished the bicarbonate response (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, B). Moreover, P71<sup>1.44</sup> is evolutionarily preserved (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>—figure supplement 2). These findings suggest the critical role of the TM1 kink in both the putative conformational changes associated with ligand binding and the functional integrity of GPR30.</p>

The percentage of shed AP-TGF was calculated using the following equations:</p>
<p>AP activity = ΔOD405 (1 – 0 h)</p>
<p>% CM (conditioned media) = AP<sub>CM</sub> / (AP<sub>CM</sub> + AP<sub>Cell</sub>)</p>

<title>15Analysis of cell surface expression of GPR30</title>
<p>The cell surface expression of wild-type and mutant hGPR30-HA was analysed via cell surface protein isolation using a Cell Surface Protein Isolation Kit (#89881, Thermo Scientific™) followed by western blotting. Briefly, HEK293 cells transiently expressing wild-type or mutant hGPR30-HA were biotinylated for 30 min at 4 °C. Then, the cells were harvested, and biotinylated proteins were isolated with avidin binding.</p>

<title>Western blotting</title>
<p>Cell lysates were separated using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon P, IPVH00010, Millipore). Primary antibodies used were anti-HA High Affinity, 1:1000 dilution, 11867423001, Roche; Na-K-ATPase, 1:1000 dilution, #3010, Cell Signaling Technology; β-Actin (AC-15), 1:1000 dilution, sc-69879, Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Secondary antibodies used were anti-rabbit IgG, HRP-linked Antibody, 1:5000 dilution, #7074, Cell Signaling Technology; anti-mouse IgG, HRP-linked Antibody, 1:5000 dilution, #7076, Cell Signaling Technology; anti-rat IgG, HRP-Linked Whole Ab Goat, 1:5000 dilution, NA935, Cytiva. The membranes were probed at 4 °C overnight with the primary antibodies. The membranes were subsequently incubated with the corresponding secondary antibodies. The signals were detected with ECL Prime (RPN2236, Cytiva) or ImmunoStar LD (296-69901, FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation) using a chemiluminescence imaging system (CFusion FX7, Vilber).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study resolves a cryo-EM structure of the GPCR, GPR30, which was recently identified as a bicarbonate receptor by the authors' lab. Understanding the ligand and the mechanism of activation is of fundamental importance to the field of receptor signaling. However, the main claim of the paper, the identification of the bicarbonate binding site, is only partly supported by the structural and functional data, leaving the study incomplete.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The overall structure, and proposed mechanism of G-protein coupling seem solid. The authors perform fairly extensive unbiased mutagenesis to identify a host of positions that are important to G-protein signaling. To my knowledge, bicarbonate is the only physiological ligand that has been identified for GPR30, making this study a particularly important contribution to the field.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Without higher resolution structures and/or additional experimental assessment of the binding pocket, the assignment of the bicarbonate remains highly speculative. The local resolution is especially poor in the ECL loop region where the ligand is proposed to bind (4.3 - 4 .8 Å range). Of course, sometimes it is difficult to achieve high structural resolution, but in these cases, the assignment of ligands should be backed up by even more rigorous experimental validation.</p>
<p>The functional assay monitors activation of GPR30, and thus reports on not only bicarbonate binding, but also the integrity of the allosteric network that transduces the binding signal across the membrane. Thus, disruption of bicarbonate signaling by mutagenesis of the putative coordinating residues does not necessarily mean that bicarbonate binding has been disrupted. Moreover, the mutagenesis was apparently done prior to structure determination, meaning that residues proposed to directly surround bicarbonate binding, such as E218, were not experimentally validated. Targeted mutagenesis based on the structure would strengthen the story.</p>
<p>Moreover, the proposed bicarbonate binding site is surprising in a chemical sense, as it is located within an acidic pocket. The authors cite several other structural studies to support the surprising observation of anionic bicarbonate surrounded by glutamate residues in an acidic pocket (references 31-34). However, it should be noted that in general, these other structures also possess a metal ion (sodium or calcium) and/or a basic sidechain (arginine or lysine) in the coordination sphere, forming a tight ion pair. Thus, the assigned bicarbonate binding site in GPR30 remains an anomaly in terms of the chemical properties of the proposed binding site.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, &quot;Cryo-EM structure of the bicarbonate receptor GPR30,&quot; the authors aimed to enrich our understanding of the role of GPR30 in pH homeostasis by combining structural analysis with a receptor function assay. This work is a natural development and extension of their previous work (PMID: 38413581). In the current body of work, they solved the first cryo-EM structure of the human GPR30-G-protein (mini-Gsqi) complex in the presence of bicarbonate ions at 3.21 Å resolution. From the atomic model built based on this map, they observed the overall canonical architecture of class A GPCR and also identified 4 extracellular pockets created by extracellular loops (ECLs) (Pockets A-D). Based on the polarity, location, and charge of each pocket, the authors hypothesized that pocket D is a good candidate for the bicarbonate binding site. To verify their structural observation, on top of the 10 mutations they generated in the previous work, the authors introduced another 11 mutations to map out the essential residues for the bicarbonate response on hGPR30. In addition, the human GPR30-G-protein complex model also allowed the authors to untangle the G-protein coupling mechanism of this special class A GPCR that plays an important role in pH homeostasis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>As a continuation of their recent Nature Communication publication (PMID: 38413581), this study was carefully designed, and the authors used mutagenesis and functional studies to confirm their structural observations. This work provided high-resolution structural observations for the receptor in complex with G-protein, allowing us to explore its mechanism of action, and will further facilitate drug development targeting GPR30. There were 4 extracellular pockets created by ECLs (Pockets A-D). The authors were able to filter out 3 of them and identified that pocket D was a good candidate for the bicarbonate binding site based on the polarity, location, and charge of each pocket. From there, the authors identified the key residues on GPR30 for its interaction with the substrate, bicarbonate. Together with their previous work, they carefully mapped out nine amino acids that are critical for receptor reactivity.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>It is unclear how novel the aspects presented in the new paper are compared to the most recent Nature Communications publication (PMID: 38413581). Some areas of the manuscript appear to be mixed with the previous publication. The work is still impactful to the field. The new and novel aspects of this manuscript could be better highlighted.</p>
<p>I also have some concerns about the TGFα shedding assay the authors used to verify their structural observation. I understand that this assay was also used in the authors' previous work published in Nature Communications. However, there are still several things in the current data that raised concerns:</p>
<p>(1) The authors confirmed the &quot;similar expression levels of HA-tagged hGPR30&quot; mutants by WB in Supplemental Figure 1A and B. However, compared to the hGPR30-HA (~6.5 when normalized to the housekeeping gene, Na-K-ATPase), several mutants of the key amino acids had much lower surface expression: S134A, D210A, C207A had ~50% reduction, D125A had ~30% reduction, and Q215A and P71A had ~20% reduction. This weakens the receptor reactivity measured by the TGFα shedding assay.</p>
<p>(2) In the previous work, the authors demonstrated that hGPR30 signals through the Gq signaling pathway and can trigger calcium mobilization. Given that calcium mobilization is a more direct measurement for the downstream signaling of hGPR30 than the TGFα shedding assay, pairing the mutagenesis study with the calcium assay will be a better functional validation to confirm the disruption of bicarbonate signaling.</p>
<p>(3) It was quite confusing for Figure 4B that all statistical analyses were done by comparing to the mock group. It would be clearer to compare the activity of the mutants to the wild-type cell line.</p>
<p>Additional concerns about the structural data include:</p>
<p>(1) E218 was in close contact with bicarbonate in Figure 4D. However, there is no functional validation for this observation. Including the mutagenesis study of this site in the cell-based functional assay will strengthen this structural observation.</p>
<p>(2) For the flow chart of the cryo-EM data processing in Supplemental data 2, the authors started with 10,148,422 particles after template picking, then had 441,348 Particles left after 2D classification/heterogenous refinement, and finally ended with 148,600 particles for the local refinement for the final map. There seems to be a lot of heterogeneity in this purified sample. GPCRs usually have flexible and dynamic loop regions, which explains the poor resolution of the ECLs in this case. Thus, a solid cell-based functional validation is a must to assign the bicarbonate binding pocket to support their hypothesis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>GPR30 responds to bicarbonate and regulates cellular responses to pH and ion homeostasis. However, it remains unclear how GPR30 recognizes bicarbonate ions. This paper presents the cryo-EM structure of GPR30 bound to a chimeric mini-Gq in the presence of bicarbonate. The structure together with functional studies aims to provide mechanistic insights into bicarbonate recognition and G protein coupling.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors performed comprehensive mutagenesis studies to map the possible binding site of bicarbonate.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Owing to the poor resolution of the structure, some structural findings may be overclaimed.</p>
<p>Based on EM maps shown in Figure 1a and Figure Supplement 2, densities for side chains in the receptor particularly in ECLs (around 4 Å) are poorly defined. At this resolution, it is unlikely to observe a disulfide bond (C130ECL1-C207ECl2) and bicarbonate ions. Moreover, the disulfide between ECL1 and ECL2 has not been observed in other GPCRs and the published structure of GPR30 (PMID: 38744981). The density of this disulfide bond could be noise.</p>
<p>The authors observed a weak density in pocket D, which is accounted for by the bicarbonate ions. This ion is mainly coordinated by Q215 and Q138. However, the Q215A mutation only reduced but not completely abolished bicarbonate response, and the author did not present the data of Q138A mutation. Therefore, Q215 and Q138 could not be bicarbonate binding sites. While H307A completely abolished bicarbonate response, the authors proposed that this residue plays a structural role. Nevertheless, based on the structure, H307 is exposed and may be involved in binding bicarbonate. The assignment of bicarbonate in the structure is not supported by the data.</p>
