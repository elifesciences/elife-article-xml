<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Pest-resistant plants usually utilize secondary metabolites to cope with insect infestation. Betulin, a key bioactive compound in aphid-resistant wild peach, possesses promising applications in crop protection. Here, betulin, in both greenhouse and field experiments, displayed excellent control efficacy against <italic>Myzus persicae</italic>. RNA-seq, qRT‒PCR, and western blotting revealed that betulin significantly inhibited the expression of <italic>MpGABR</italic> (encoding a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor). Besides, RNAi-mediated silencing of <italic>MpGABR</italic> markedly increased aphid sensitivity to betulin. Furthermore, MST (microscale thermophoresis) and voltage-clamp assays indicated that betulin bound to MpGABR (<italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> = 2.24 µM) and acted as an inhibitor of MpGABR. Molecular docking, mutagenesis and genome editing suggested that THR228 is a critical and highly conserved site in MpGABR that betulin binds to specifically, causing aphid death. Overall, the activity of betulin depends on specific targeting and inhibition of MpGABR. Elucidating the mechanism of action of this peach-derived insecticide may offer a sustainable green strategy for aphid control.</p>

<label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over more than 400 million years of coevolution with herbivores, plants have developed a variety of morphological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Soujanya et al. 2023</xref>), biochemical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Zhou et al. 2024b</xref>), and molecular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wang et al. 2024</xref>) defense strategies against insect herbivore attack. Plant secondary metabolites are highly valuable natural compounds, offering abundant and potent biochemical defense driven by plant-insect coevolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jahan et al. 2025a</xref>). Interestingly, wild relatives of crops with insect resistance usually accumulate large amounts of biologically active compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alonso-Salces et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wang et al. 2022a</xref>). Accordingly, investigating the bioactivities and potential mechanisms of action of compounds derived from wild resistant germplasms may provide effective and sustainable strategies for pest control in crop protection.</p>
<p><italic>Myzus persicae</italic> (Sülzer) is one of the most destructive sap-feeding pests worldwide. It is able to settle on more than 400 plant species globally, displaying extraordinary polyphagia and a wide range of hazards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bass et al. 2014</xref>). In addition to ingesting phloem saps and secreting honeydew, <italic>M. persicae</italic> can transmit various plant viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Guo et al. 2022</xref>), resulting in severe losses in crop yields. To date, the principal control strategy for <italic>M. persicae</italic> has relied on synthetic insecticides, including pyrethroids, organophosphorus compounds, carbamates and neonicotinoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jiménez-Jiménez et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Martins et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zhang et al. 2023</xref>). However, long-term irrational application of these chemical insecticides has led to environmental pollution and promoted the resistance of aphids to insecticides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Troczka et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zhang et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stará et al. 2024</xref>). Therefore, it is necessary to develop novel green insecticides as potential alternatives to synthetic insecticides. Fortunately, plant secondary metabolites are a “treasure trove of active compounds” that serve as a rich resource for the development of promising green insecticides.</p>
<p>Our previous study revealed that <italic>Prunus davidiana</italic>, a close wild relative of cultivated peach, displays strong resistance to <italic>M. persicae</italic> through the accumulation of high levels of betulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wang et al. 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wang et al. 2024</xref>). In addition, betulin, a lupane-type triterpene, possesses strong insecticidal activity and is a promising substance for the development of novel aphid-control insecticides. A number of studies have reported that betulin and its derivatives exhibit a wide range of pharmacological activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Amiri et al. 2020</xref>). An immune stimulant, Ir-Bet, was prepared using iridium complex and betulin, which evoked ferritinophagy-enhanced ferroptosis, thereby activating anti-tumor immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lv 2023</xref>). The anti-inflammatory effect of betulin has been reported in macrophages at lymphoma site in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Szlasa et al. 2023</xref>). Betulin has been found to improve hyperlipidemia and insulin resistance and decrease atherosclerotic plaques by inhibiting the maturation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tang et al. 2011</xref>). Additionally, betulin and its derivatives have been found to exhibit insecticidal activity against <italic>Plutella xylostella</italic> L. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Huang et al. 2025</xref>), <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">de Almeida Teles et al. 2024</xref>), and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lee and Min 2024</xref>). However, the insecticidal mechanism of betulin against aphids remains unclear.</p>
<p>Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors have been confirmed to be targets of terpenoids that impair neuronal function in insect herbivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Guo et al. 2023</xref>). There are two types of GABA receptors: ionotropic (GABA<sub>A</sub>) and metabotropic (GABA<sub>B</sub>) receptors. The first GABA receptor subunit identified in insects is encoded by <italic>Rdl</italic>, which confers resistance to dieldrin in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Ffrench-Constant et al. 1991</xref>). Although a variety of terpenoids play roles as positive allosteric modulators or noncompetitive antagonists of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (GABRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Guo et al. 2023</xref>), whether betulin targets the GABR in <italic>M. persicae</italic> needs to be further investigated. GABRs are heteropentameric ligand-gated ion channels in the central nervous system that conduct chloride and bicarbonate ions and are the target of numerous drugs for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Thompson 2024</xref>). GABRs are composed of 5 different types of subunits, each with 4 helical transmembrane domains (TM1-TM4), of which TM2 is located at the center of the pentamer and forms an ion channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fan et al. 2024</xref>). Previous study has proposed that vertebrate and human GABR genes maintain a broad and conservative gene clustering pattern, while in invertebrates, this pattern is missing, indicating that these gene clusters were formed early in vertebrate evolution and were established after invertebrates diverged. Notably, invertebrates each possess a unique GABR gene pair, which are homologous with human GABR α and β subunits, suggesting that the existing GABR gene cluster evolved from an ancestral α-β subunit gene pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Tsang et al. 2006</xref>). During the coevolution of plants and insects, the duplications and amino acid substitutions in GABR may have been beneficial for adaptation to insecticides and terpenoid compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Guo et al. 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, betulin was confirmed to have excellent control efficacy against <italic>M. persicae</italic> in both greenhouse and field experiments. RNA-seq, qRT‒PCR, and western blotting assays revealed that betulin significantly inhibited the expression of <italic>MpGABR</italic> in aphids. In addition, RNAi-mediated silencing of <italic>MpGABR</italic> markedly increased aphid sensitivity to betulin. Furthermore, microscale thermophoresis (MST) and voltage-clamp assays indicated that betulin can bind to MpGABR (<italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> = 2.24 µM) and act as an inhibitor (EC<sub>50</sub> = 20.66 µM) of MpGABR. Molecular docking analysis suggested that betulin bound to MpGABR via the THR228 amino acid residue. This site is highly conserved across 11 species in the Aphididae family of Hemiptera and may be a critical specific binding site for betulin in MpGABR in aphids. Mutagenesis and genome editing experiments revealed that betulin bound specifically to this amino acid residue in aphids but not in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, resulting in aphid death. This study elucidated the insecticidal mechanism of betulin involving the targeting of MpGABR, providing a sustainable green strategy for aphid control. However, given that betulin may affect a wider range of organisms, it should be used with caution.</p>

<label>2.1</label><title>Test insects</title>
<p><italic>M. persicae</italic> populations were collected from tobacco (<italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic> L.) leaves. Wild-type (WT) flies (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>) were purchased from Fungene Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Jiangsu, China. The test insects were cultured in a greenhouse (25 °C, 70% relative humidity and 14 h light/10 h dark cycle) in Beibei, Chongqing, China.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<label>2.2</label><title>Leaf bioassay</title>
<p>The toxicity of betulin against <italic>M. persicae</italic> was measured using a slip-dip bioassay as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wang et al. 2022a</xref>). Thirty apterous adult <italic>M. persicae</italic> individuals were gently transferred on tobacco (<italic>N. tabacum</italic>) leaves using a fine brush. The tobacco leaves were subsequently immersed in 0.1% (v/v) Tween-80 and 3% (v/v) acetone solution containing betulin or pymetrozine (as a positive control) at 7 doses (0, 0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 mg· mL<sup>−1</sup>) for 5 seconds. After drying, the leaves with <italic>M. persicae</italic> were placed on wet filter paper and cultured on a water-soaked sponge for 48 h. Three replicates were tested for each treatment. Furthermore, the LC<sub>30,</sub> LC<sub>50</sub> and LC<sub>70</sub> values of betulin were calculated using log-probit analysis via IBM SPSS Statistics (v.22.0, Chicago, IL, USA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Zhou et al. 2024b</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<label>2.3</label><title>Greenhouse and field bioassays</title>
<p>The control effects of betulin against <italic>M. persicae</italic> in the greenhouse and field were evaluated by a spraying-based method as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Zhou et al. 2023</xref>). The commercial insecticide pymetrozine and an aqueous solution containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween-80 and 3% (v/v) acetone were employed as positive and negative controls, respectively. Sprays of 0.1641 mg·mL<sup>−1</sup> (LC<sub>50</sub>) betulin and 1.0612 mg·mL<sup>−1</sup> (LC<sub>50</sub>) pymetrozine (Table S1) were prepared in aqueous solutions including 3% (v/v) acetone and 0.1% (v/v) Tween-80, respectively. Before the control effect assays, each tobacco (<italic>N. tabacum</italic> L.) seedling was pre-inoculated with 60 apterous adults of <italic>M. persicae</italic>. In the greenhouse trial, each treatment included 8 replications, and each replication consisted of 3 tobacco plants growing under controlled conditions as described above. The field trial (Beibei District, Chongqing, China.) was conducted under natural conditions with an average temperature of 20 °C. Each treatment had 8 replications, covering an area of 20 m<sup>2</sup>, with 3 protected rows per replication. Furthermore, each tobacco plant was sprayed with 20 mL of the corresponding solution with an electric sprayer. Mortality was recorded at 1, 5, 9, and 14 days after treatment. The control efficacy of betulin against <italic>M. persicae</italic> was calculated according to the methods of Zhou (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Zhou et al. 2023</xref>).</p>

<label>2.4</label><title>RNA-seq assay</title>
<p>After exposure to 0.1641 mg· mL<sup>−1</sup> (48 h LC<sub>50</sub>) betulin for 48 h, 100 apterous <italic>M. persicae</italic> adults were sampled for each of 3 replicates. and total RNA was extracted via TRIzol reagent (Tiangen, Beijing, China) to construct mRNA sequencing libraries. RNA-seq analysis was performed on the Ion Proton BGISEQ-500 platform (Beijing Genomic Institute, BGI, China). After the raw reads were filtered, the clean reads were aligned to the <italic>M. persicae</italic> reference genome, which was downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information database, using HISAT2 (v2.1.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kim et al. 2015</xref>). The expression levels of genes in each sample were normalized to the fragments per kilobase million mapped reads (FPKM) value. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between groups were identified using the fold change factor (|Log<sub>2</sub>(FC)| &gt; 1). Functional enrichment analysis of DEGs was performed using the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases.</p>

<label>2.5</label><title>Validation by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT‒PCR)</title>
<p>The gene-specific primers used for qRT‒PCR, which were designed with Primer Premier 5.0, are listed in Table S2. According to the manufacturer’s specifications for the Bio-Rad iQ<sup>™</sup> SYBR<sup>®</sup> Green Supermix Kit, qRT‒PCR was performed with the following conditions: 60 °C for 15 s, followed by 48 cycles of 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The <italic>ribosomal protein S18</italic> gene (<italic>RPS18</italic>) was used as the reference gene to normalize the expression levels. The relative expression levels of the target genes were calculated using the 2<sup>−ΔΔ<italic>Ct</italic></sup> approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Zhou et al. 2024b</xref>).

<p>Bioassays revealed that the LC<sub>50</sub> values of betulin and pymetrozine against <italic>M. persicae</italic> at 48 h were 0.1641 and 1.0612 mg·mL<sup>−1</sup>, respectively (Table S1). To assess the control efficacy of betulin, tobacco plants infected with <italic>M. persicae</italic> were exposed to betulin (0.1641 mg·mL<sup>−1</sup>) and pymetrozine (1.0612 mg·mL<sup>−1</sup>, as a positive control) in both the greenhouse and field. In the greenhouse test (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-D</xref>), at 14 days after treatment, <italic>M. persicae</italic> in the CK group (negative control) reproduced rapidly, and tobacco leaves turned yellow and wrinkled, whereas tobacco leaves in the betulin and pymetrozine treatment groups were barely affected by the aphids (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-B</xref>). The control efficacy of betulin against <italic>M. persicae</italic> was significantly greater than that of pymetrozine at 1 day after treatment (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01), while there were no significant differences between the control efficacies of betulin and pymetrozine at 5, 9, or 14 days after treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>).

Principal coordinate analysis (PCA) revealed that the expressed genes were strongly clustered in the CK group and betulin group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Compared with those in the CK group, there were 130 up- and 41 downregulated significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in <italic>M. persicae</italic> after betulin treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C and D</xref>, Table S4). To validate the RNA‒seq results, fifteen DEGs were randomly selected with different expression levels. The relative expression trends of the fifteen DEGs determined via qRT‒PCR were similar to those detected via RNA‒seq, supporting the reliability of the RNA‒seq data (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). To further analyze the functions of the DEGs, GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) enrichment analyses were performed. GO term enrichment demonstrated that the DEGs were enriched mainly in the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor activity term (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>).

<label>3.6</label><title>Key sites for the binding of betulin to MpGABR</title>
<p>To further study the binding mode of betulin in the active pocket of MpGABR, molecular docking was performed to explore the structure–function relationships between betulin and MpGABR. The docking results revealed that the predicted binding energy between betulin and MpGABR was −6.38 kcal·mol<sup>−1</sup> (Table S7), verifying that betulin could act as a specific ligand for MpGABR. The three-dimensional binding pattern of betulin with MpGABR indicated that the four key amino acid residues (ARG224, ALA226, PHE227 and THR228) interacted with betulin in the MpGABR binding pocket (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). Among the four key amino acid residues, ALA226 and THR228 interacted with betulin via hydrogen bonding in the MpGABR binding pocket (Table S7). Betulin generated nonconventional H-bonds (C…H) with ALA226 (3.31 Å) and conventional H-bonds (C-O H) with THR228 (2.16 Å). Furthermore, sequence alignment of the key amino acid residues of GABR in different species from Hemiptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera, Thysanoptera, and Coleoptera indicated that, among the four residues, only THR228 was conserved across 11 species in the Aphididae family of Hemiptera (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>), implying that THR228 may be an essential specific site for the action of betulin on MpGABR in aphids. Mutants of aphid MpGABR were subsequently constructed, including R224A (ARG224 replaced by ALA), A226T (ALA226 replaced by THR), F227Y (PHE227 replaced by TYR, similar to the site in <italic>Drosophila</italic>), or T228R (THR228 replaced by ARG, similar to the site in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>).

This result suggested that the mutation at the THR228 site, with the highest <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> value, markedly reduced the binding ability of betulin to MpGABR, implying that the THR228 site may be an essential specific site for the binding of betulin to MpGABR.</p>

<p>To further prove that THR228 is the specific binding site for betulin in MpGABR, the WT and mutant (R122T, equivalent to THR228 in MpGABR) <italic>Drosophila</italic> DmGABR proteins were expressed in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and extracted (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A and D</xref>). The binding affinities of betulin and pymetrozine with DmGABR<sup>WT</sup> and DmGABR<sup>R122T</sup> were evaluated using MST. As shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>, betulin was able to bind to DmGABR<sup>R122T</sup> (<italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> = 342.4 µM) but not to DmGABR<sup>WT</sup>. However, pymetrozine exhibited no binding affinity for DmGABR<sup>R122T</sup> or DmGABR<sup>WT</sup> (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>). Moreover, to generate <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutant individuals carrying DmGABR<sup>R122T</sup>, the CRISPR/Cas9 genomic editing strategy was used. After exposure to different concentrations of betulin, the mortality rate of DmGABR<sup>R122T</sup> <italic>Drosophila</italic> was significantly greater than that of DmGABR<sup>WT</sup> <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>). In addition, the LD<sub>50</sub> value of betulin against DmGABR<sup>R122T</sup> <italic>Drosophila</italic> at 72 h was 27.19 µg·fly<sup>−1</sup>, whereas the LD<sub>50</sub> value of betulin against DmGABR<sup>WT</sup> <italic>Drosophila</italic> could not be calculated because the lethal concentration exceeded 1000 µg·fly<sup>−1</sup> (Table S9). Additionally, there was no significant difference in mortality between DmGABR<sup>WT</sup> and DmGABR<sup>R122T</sup> <italic>Drosophila</italic> after exposure to pymetrozine (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F</xref>). The LD<sub>50</sub> values of pymetrozine against DmGABR<sup>WT</sup> and DmGABR<sup>R122T</sup> <italic>Drosophila</italic> at 72 h were 0.23 and 0.24 µg·fly<sup>−1</sup>, respectively (Table S9). Moreover, THR228 is located at the neurotransmitter-gated ion-channel ligand-binding domain in MpGABR (Fig. S2), implying that betulin may play a role as a competitive antagonist of MpGABR. Taken together, these findings suggested that betulin bound specifically to MpGABR via THR228, resulting in the death of <italic>M. persicae</italic>.</p>

<label>4.</label><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although chemical pesticides are effective in pest control, the long-term unreasonable application of these substances has led the emergence of resistant pests, environmental deterioration, and deleterious effects on nontarget organisms, including humans, raising widespread and intense concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Devi et al. 2022</xref>). These challenges have made it urgent for the development of alternative strategies for pest control. Recently, the utilization of plant secondary metabolites as insecticides has become increasingly popular as an eco-friendly and biocontrol approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ling et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ayilara et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jahan et al. 2025b</xref>). Our previous study revealed that <italic>P. davidiana</italic>, a wild relative of cultivated peach, strongly resists <italic>M. persicae</italic> by accumulating high contents of betulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wang et al. 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wang et al. 2024</xref>). In addition, betulin, a lupane-type triterpene, possesses potent insecticidal activity and is a promising substance for the development of novel insecticides for aphid control. In this study, the insecticidal effect of betulin was further evaluated by comparing the control efficacy of betulin with that of pymetrozine against aphids in greenhouses and fields (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-G</xref>). These results indicate that betulin has a similar control effect to pymetrozine and has immense potential for development as a plant-derived insecticide.</p>
<p>Terpenes are a diverse group of plant secondary metabolites that can increase the resistance of plants to insect herbivores through direct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wang et al. 2025b</xref>) and indirect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wang et al. 2025a</xref>) defense mechanisms. In direct defense against herbivores, triterpenes play important roles in diverse biological activities, including antiparasitic, insecticidal, and antifeedant activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Tian et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ivana et al. 2023</xref>). Azadirachtin, a tetracyclic triterpenoid compound isolated from the Indian neem tree (<italic>Azadirachta indica</italic>), is one of the most prominent commercial biopesticides, exhibiting strong insect antifeedant properties as well as growth- and reproduction-regulating effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dawkar et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bae et al. 2022</xref>). Besides, triterpene glycoside compounds play crucial roles in the defense of tobacco (<italic>N. attenuata</italic>) against tobacco hornworm (<italic>Manduca sexta</italic>) larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Yang et al. 2023</xref>). Although betulin exhibits various pharmacological activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Amiri et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Li et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yan 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lv 2023</xref>), reports on its insecticidal activity are limited. Encouragingly, the effects of betulin and its derivatives on pests have attracted increasing attention. Betulinic acid and its derivatives showed larvicidal activity against <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">da Silva et al. 2016</xref>). Betulin-cinnamic acid-related hybrid compound 5b exhibited strong aphicidal activity, and compound 2l could destroy the ultrastructure of midgut cells and significantly inhibit the activity of α-amylase in diamondback moth (<italic>Plutella xylostella</italic> L.) larvae (Huang et al.). Our previous studies also indicated that betulin possesses potent insecticidal activity and is a key endogenous secondary metabolite related to the defense of peach against <italic>M. persicae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wang et al. 2022a</xref>). Elucidating the insecticidal mechanism of betulin against aphids will provide a basis for the development of novel aphicides and sustainable strategies for aphid control.</p>
<p>GABA receptors have been confirmed to be targets of terpenoids that impair insect neuronal function in herbivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Guo et al. 2023</xref>). GABRs are heteropentameric ligand-gated ion channels in the central nervous system that conduct chloride and bicarbonate ions. These receptors are targets of numerous drugs for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Thompson 2024</xref>). A variety of terpenoids act as positive allosteric modulators or noncompetitive antagonists of GABRs, such as diterpenoids (isopimaric acid and miltirone), sesquiterpenoids (picrotoxin, bilobalide and ginkgolides) and monoterpenoids (α-thujone and thymol) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Guo et al. 2023</xref>). In this study, both GO and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed that the DEGs identified by RNA-seq were enriched in GABAergic signaling-related pathways (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F and G</xref>). Additionally, the expression of the DEGs related to GABRs, particularly <italic>MpGABR</italic> (Table S4), in the betulin group was significantly lower than that in the CK group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>). Besides, the relative expression of <italic>MpGABR</italic>, <italic>MpGABRAP</italic> and <italic>MpGABRB</italic> decreased gradually after <italic>M. persicae</italic> was exposed to the LC<sub>30</sub>, LC<sub>50</sub>, and LC<sub>70</sub> of betulin for 48 h (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-D</xref>). Among them, <italic>MpGABR</italic> was the most sensitive to betulin, and its expression was reduced by 82.91% after exposure to the LC<sub>30</sub> of betulin for 48 h. Furthermore, compared with the control group, the <italic>M. persicae</italic> group with <italic>MpGABR</italic> silenced by RNAi presented a significant increase in mortality (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), by 30.44%, after 48 h of exposure to the LC<sub>50</sub> of betulin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that betulin may have insecticidal effects on aphids by inhibiting <italic>MpGABR</italic> expression. The regulation of gene expression is sophisticated and delicate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Pope and Medzhitov 2018</xref>). The regulatory network controlling <italic>GABR</italic> expression remains unclear. In adult rats, epileptic seizures have been reported to increase the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which in turn prompted the transcription factors CREB and ICER to reduce the gene expression of the GABR α1 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lund et al. 2008</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, it has been demonstrated that WIDE AWAKE, which regulated the onset of sleep, interacted with the GABR and upregulated its expression level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Liu et al. 2014</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain, circular RNA circ_sxc was found to inhibit the expression of miR-87-3p in the brain through sponge adsorption, thereby regulating the expression of neurotransmitter receptor ligand proteins, including GABR, and ensuring the normal function of synaptic signal transmission in brain neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Li et al. 2024</xref>). However, it remains unclear how betulin reduces <italic>MpGABR</italic> expression, and further research is needed.</p>
<p>Additionally, betulin has been reported to be able to bind to GABRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Manayi et al. 2016</xref>). We further investigated the interaction of betulin with the MpGABR protein. The MST assay revealed that betulin was able to bind to MpGABR (<italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> = 2.24 µM) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>), which is consistent with previous findings showing that betulin binds to GABA receptors in mouse brains <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Muceniece et al. 2008</xref>). Voltage-clamp-based electrophysiological recordings indicated that betulin acted as an inhibitor (EC<sub>50</sub> = 20.66 µM) for MpGABR (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C and D</xref>). Subsequent molecular docking analysis suggested that four key amino acid residues (ARG224, ALA226, PHE227 and THR228) interact with betulin in the MpGABR binding pocket (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>), among which merely ALA226 and THR228 interact with betulin via hydrogen bonding (Table S7). The results of the sequence alignment revealed that only THR228 was conserved across 11 species in the Aphididae family of Hemiptera (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). Furthermore, evaluation of the ability of betulin to bind to MpGABR mutants with mutations at those four sites revealed that the ability of betulin to bind to T228R was significantly weaker than its ability to bind to the WT (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D and E</xref>, Table S8), indicating that THR228 is an essential specific site for the binding of betulin to MpGABR. Moreover, to further prove that THR228 is the specific binding site for betulin in MpGABR, the binding affinities of betulin with the WT and mutant (R122T, equivalent to THR228 in MpGABR) <italic>Drosophila</italic> DmGABR proteins were assessed using MST. The results showed that betulin was able to bind to DmGABR<sup>R122T</sup> (<italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> = 342.4 µM) but not DmGABR<sup>WT</sup> (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>). Additionally, after exposure to different concentrations of betulin, the mortality rate of DmGABR<sup>R122T</sup> <italic>Drosophila</italic> was significantly greater than that of DmGABR<sup>WT</sup> <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref> and Table S9). Similarly, a previous study indicated that the R122G amino acid site substitution, generated via RNA editing, affects the sensitivity of <italic>Drosophila</italic> to fipronil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Es-Salah et al. 2008</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that betulin binds specifically to MpGABR via THR228, acting as an inhibitor of MpGABR and causing aphid death. Studies on key amino acids that are crucial for GABR function has primarily focused on transmembrane regions. For instance, based on the mutational research and <italic>Drosophila</italic> GABR modeling approach, multiple key amino acids have been identified as insecticide targets in the transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Nakao and Banba 2021</xref>). Guo et al. proposed that amino acid substitutions in transmembrane domain 2 contribute to terpenoid insensitivity during plant-insect coevolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Guo et al. 2023</xref>). However, these studies have neglected the extracellular domain. Our study signified that betulin targets the THR228 site in the extracellular domain of MpGABR, which is conserved only in the Aphididae family. Therefore, betulin is speculated to be a specific insecticidal substance evolved by plants in response to aphid infestation. Besides, further verification is needed to determine whether betulin is toxic to other insect species.</p>
<p>GABRs belong to the cysteine loop (Cys)-loop superfamily of neurotransmitter receptors and are essential heteropentameric ligand-gated ion channels in the central nervous system. After GABA binds to the extracellular Cys-loop of a GABR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ashby et al. 2012</xref>), the GABR is activated and opens up its central pore to allow chloride ions to pass through, thereby hyperpolarizing neurons and attenuating excitatory neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Tremblay et al. 2016</xref>). In insects, GABRs play important roles in circadian rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Schellinger et al. 2022</xref>), sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chaturvedi et al. 2022</xref>), movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Eick et al. 2022</xref>), and olfactory memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yamagata et al. 2021</xref>). Additionally, GABR is a critical target for a variety of insecticides and ectoparasiticides. Insecticides targeting GABRs are categorized into noncompetitive antagonists (NCAs) and competitive antagonists (CAs) according to their different binding sites. NCAs block chloride channels in nerve cells by interacting with amino acid residues of the GABA-gated chloride channel, causing a conformational change in the receptor, which interferes with the normal function of the central nervous system and ultimately leads to insect death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Nakao and Banba 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Guo et al. 2023</xref>). A series of first- and second-generation NCA insecticides have been successfully developed. Picrotoxinin, isolated from <italic>Anamirta cocculus</italic> fruit, is the oldest natural NCA and is toxic to houseflies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Tong et al. 2023</xref>). Among the first-generation NCAs, polychlorocycloalkanes, including dieldrin and lindane, were commonly used as pesticides in the middle and late 20th centuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hainzl et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tanaka 2019</xref>). As second-generation NCAs, fipronil and its derivatives are commercially available phenylpyrazole insecticides that have been widely used for agricultural pest control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Sheng et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Li et al. 2021</xref>). Additionally, CAs bind to orthogonal binding sites, such as the GABA recognition site in the extracellular region, competitively inhibiting the binding of GABA to its receptor, leading to toxic effects in insects. Given the lack of interference from existing insect resistance mechanisms, CAs hold promise for the development of efficient new insecticides. Novel 1, 6-dihydro-6-iminopyridazine-derived insecticides, as CAs, have insecticidal properties against common cutworms and houseflies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Liu et al. 2022</xref>). Besides, nootkatone, a sesquiterpenoid, also acts as a CA to induce insect mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Norris et al. 2022</xref>). Fluralaner, an isooxazoline ectoparasiticide, inhibits both parasites and <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> by acting as a CA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wang et al. 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Asahi et al. 2023</xref>). Our results revealed that the binding site (THR228) for betulin in MpGABR was located in the extracellular neurotransmitter-gated ion-channel ligand-binding domain (Fig. S2), implying that betulin acts as a CA of MpGABR. Although the mechanism by which betulin competes with GABA for binding to MpGABR requires further experimental validation, our work may have provided a novel target for developing insecticides. In this study, betulin, on the one hand, inhibited the expression of <italic>MpGABR</italic> and, on the other hand, specifically bound to MpGABR through THR228, acting as an inhibitor of MpGABR and causing aphid death (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>).</p>

<p>The development of bioinsecticides should not only focus on the toxic effects of active substance on target organisms, but also on their influence on the ecosystem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Haddi et al. 2020</xref>). Although our results indicate that betulin has specific toxicity to aphids, previous studies have reported that betulin and its derivatives had effects on <italic>Plutella xylostella</italic> L. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Huang et al. 2025</xref>), <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">de Almeida Teles et al. 2024</xref>), and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lee and Min 2024</xref>). Therefore, further research is needed to determine whether there are other insecticidal mechanisms or off target effects of betulin. Additionally, betulin exhibits a wide range of pharmacological activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Amiri et al. 2020</xref>), which have been used to treat various diseases, such as cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lv 2023</xref>), glioblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Li et al. 2022</xref>), inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Szlasa et al. 2023</xref>) and hyperlipidemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tang et al. 2011</xref>). Before applying betulin in the field, it is necessary to fully verify and consider whether betulin has any impact on farmers’ health. Furthermore, will betulin cause residue or diffusion during the field application process? Will long-term application promote the evolution of resistance to aphids or other insects? These issues also need further experimental verification. In summary, before any field application, further research on the environmental behavior, degradation process, and safety of betulin is needed.</p>

<p>Betulin, a key metabolite in the aphid-resistant wild peach <italic>P. davidiana</italic>, possesses potent aphicidal effects on <italic>M. persicae.</italic> This study confirmed that betulin exhibited excellent control efficacy against <italic>M. persicae</italic> in both greenhouse and field experiments. RNA-seq, qRT‒PCR and western blotting assays revealed that betulin significantly inhibited the expression of <italic>MpGABR</italic> in aphids. In addition, RNAi-mediated silencing of <italic>MpGABR</italic> markedly increased the sensitivity of aphids to betulin. Moreover, MST and voltage-clamp-based electrophysiological recording assays indicated that betulin was able to bind to MpGABR (<italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> = 2.24 µM) and acted as an inhibitor (EC<sub>50</sub> = 20.66 µM) of MpGABR. Molecular docking analyses suggested that the amino acid residue THR228, which is highly conserved across 11 species in the Aphididae family of Hemiptera, might be a critical specific binding site for betulin in MpGABR. Mutagenesis and genome editing assays revealed that betulin bound specifically to this amino acid residue in aphids but not in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, resulting in aphid death. Collectively, the results suggest that the aphicidal effects of betulin on aphids occur in a two-pronged manner: on the one hand, betulin inhibits <italic>MpGABR</italic> expression; on the other hand, it specifically binds to MpGABR via THR228 and acts as an inhibitor of MpGABR. Elucidating the insecticidal mechanism of betulin against aphids will provide a basis for the development of novel insecticides and sustainable strategies for aphid control.</p>

<p>Wang, Junxiu et al. investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms of the insecticidal activity of betulin against the peach aphid, Myzus persicae. There are two important findings described in this manuscript: (a) betulin inhibits the gene expression of GABA receptor in the aphid, and (b) betulin binds to the GABA receptor protein, acting as an inhibitor. The first finding is supported by RNA-Seq and RNAi, and the second one is convinced with MST and electrophysiological assays. Further investigations on the betulin binding site on the receptor protein provided a fundamental discovery that T228 is the key amino acid residue for its affinity, thereby acting as an inhibitor, backed up by site-directed mutagenesis of the heterologously-expressed receptor in E. coli and by CRISPR-genome editing in Drosophila.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This important study shows that betulin from wild peach trees disrupts neural signaling in aphids by targeting a conserved site in the insect GABA receptor. The authors present a nicely integrated set of molecular, physiological, and genetic experiments to establish the compound's species-specific mode of action. While the mechanistic evidence is solid, the manuscript would benefit from a broader discussion of evolutionary conservation and potential off-target ecological effects.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The main strengths of the study lie in its mechanistic clarity and experimental rigor. The identification of a betulin-binding single threonine residue was supported by (1) site-directed mutagenesis and (2) functional assays. These experiments strongly support the specificity of action. Furthermore, the use of comparative analyses between aphids and fruit flies demonstrates an important effort to explore species specificity, and the integration of quantitative data further enhances the robustness of the conclusions.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The revision satisfactorily addresses my concerns on evolutionary context, methodological clarity, and ecological risk.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Wang, Junxiu et al. investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms of the insecticidal activity of betulin against the peach aphid, Myzus persicae. There are two important findings described in this manuscript: (a) betulin inhibits the gene expression of GABA receptor in the aphid, and (b) betulin binds to the GABA receptor protein, acting as an inhibitor. The first finding is supported by RNA-Seq and RNAi, and the second one is convinced with MST and electrophysiological assays. Further investigations on the betulin binding site on the receptor protein provided a fundamental discovery that T228 is the key amino acid residue for its affinity, thereby acting as an inhibitor, backed up by site-directed mutagenesis of the heterologously-expressed receptor in E. coli and by CRISPR-genome editing in Drosophila.</p>
<p>Although the manuscript does have strengths in principle, the weaknesses do exist: the manuscript would benefit from more comprehensive analyses to fully support its key claims in the manuscript. In particular:</p>
<p>(1) The Western blotting results in Figure 5A &amp; B appear to support the claim that betulin inhibits GABR gene expression (L26), as a decrease in target protein levels is often indicative of suppressed gene expression. The result description for Figure 5A &amp; B is found in L312-L316, within Section 3.6 (&quot;Responses of MpGABR to betulin&quot;), where MST and voltage-clamp assays are also presented. It seems the observed decrease in MpGABR protein content is due to gene downregulation, rather than a direct receptor protein-betulin interaction. However, this interpretation lacks discussion or analysis in either the corresponding results section or the Discussion. In contrast, Figures 5C-F are specifically designed to illustrate protein-betulin interactions. Presenting Figure 5A &amp; B alongside these panels might lead to confusion, as they support distinct claims (gene expression vs. protein binding/inhibition). Therefore, I recommend moving Figure 5A &amp; B either to the end of Figure 3 or to a separate figure altogether to improve clarity and logical flow. A minor point in the Western blotting experiment is that although GAPDH was used as a reference protein, there is no explanation in the corresponding M&amp;M section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the concise and accurate summary and appreciate the constructive feedback on the article’s strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>(A) According to your suggestion, the original Figure 5A and B have been inserted into Figure 3, following Figure 3D. The original Figure 3E-I has been saved as a new figure, to illustrate the RNAi assay.</p>
<p>(b) “GAPDH was used as a reference protein” has been supplied in the M&amp;M section, see</p>
<p>Line 209.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The description of the electrophysiological recording experiment is unclear regarding the use of GABA. I didn't realize that GABA, the true ligand of the GABA receptor, was used in this inhibition experiment until I reached the Results section (L321), which states, &quot;In the presence of only GABA, a fast inward current was generated.&quot; Crucially, no details are provided on the experiment itself, including how GABA was applied (e.g., concentration, duration, whether GABA was treated, followed by betulin, or vice versa). This information is essential for reproducibility. Please ensure these details are thoroughly described in the corresponding M&amp;M section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the valuable comments.</p>
<p>(a) Detailed information on how to apply GABA has been added to the corresponding M&amp;M section (Lines 260-263): After 3 days of incubation, the oocytes were used for electrophysiological recording. GABA was dissolved in 1 × Ringer's solution to prepare 100 µM GABA solution. Subsequently, the 100 µM GABA solutions containing different concentrations of betulin (0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320 µM) were used to perfuse the oocytes.</p>
<p>(b) Additionally, we also checked other contents of M&amp;M section to ensure that sufficient detail has been supplied.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The phylogenetic analysis, particularly concerning Figures 4 and 6B, needs significant attention for clarity and representativeness. First, your claim that MpGABR is only closely related to CAI6365831.1 (L305-L310) is inconsistent with the provided phylogenetic tree, which shows MpGABR as equally close to Metopolophium dirhodum (XP_060864885.1) and Acyrthosiphon pisum (XP_008183008.2). Therefore, singling out only Macrosiphum euphorbiae (CAI6365831.1) is not supported by the data. Second, the representation of various insect orders is insufficient. All 11 sequences in the Hemiptera category (in both Figure 4 and Figure 6B) are exclusively from the Aphididae family. This small subset cannot represent the highly diverse Order Hemiptera. Consequently, statements like &quot;only THR228 was conserved in Hemiptera&quot; (L338), &quot;The results of the sequence alignment revealed that only THR228 was conserved in Hemiptera&quot; (L430), or &quot;THR228... is highly conserved in Hemiptera&quot; (L486) are not adequately supported. Third, similar concerns apply to the Diptera order, which includes 10 Drosophila and 2 mosquito samples (not diverse or representative enough), and likely to other orders as well. Thereby, the Figure 6B alignment should be revised accordingly to reflect a more accurate representation or to clarify the scope of the analysis. Fourth, there's a discrepancy in the phylogenetic method used: the M&amp;M section (L156) states that MEGA7, ClustalW, and the neighbor-joining method were used, while the Figure 4 caption mentions that MEGA X, MUSCLE, and the Maximum likelihood method were employed. This inconsistency needs to be clarified and made consistent throughout the manuscript. Fifth, I have significant concerns about the phylogenetic tree itself (Figure 4). A small glitch was observed at the Danaus plexippus node, which raises suspicion regarding potential manipulation after tree construction. More critically, the tree, especially within Coleoptera, does not appear to be clearly resolved. I am highly concerned about whether all included sequences are true GABR orthologs or if the dataset includes partial or related sequences that could distort the phylogeny. Finally, for Figure 6B, both protein (XP_) and nucleotide (XM_) sequences were mix used. I recommend using the protein sequences instead of nucleotide sequences in this figure panel, as protein sequences are more directly informative.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the careful reading and valuable comments.</p>
<p>(a) Firstly, according to your comments, phylogenetic analysis has been re-performed with more represent species from each Order (Fig. 5 and Fig. 7B). The results revealed that only THR228 was conserved across 11 species in the Aphididae family of Hemiptera. Therefore, the expressions like &quot;only THR228 was conserved in Hemiptera&quot; have been revised to “among the four residues, only THR228 was conserved across 11 species in the Aphididae family of Hemiptera” (Line 106, Line 369, Line 477, and Lines 563-564).</p>
<p>(b) We have modified the description of Fig. 5 (the original Fig. 4): MpGABR  (XP_022173711.1) was found to be genetically closely related to CAI6365831.1 from Macrosiphum euphorbiae, XP 008183008.2 from Acyrthosiphon pisum, and XP 060864885.1 from Metopolophium dirhodum (Fig. 5 and Table S6). See Lines 342-346.</p>
<p>(c) Phylogenetic analysis was performed using MEGA7 with multiple amino acid sequence alignment (ClustalW) and the neighbor-joining method. We have revised the Fig. 5 (the original Fig. 4) caption to make it accurate and consistent throughout the manuscript.</p>
<p>(d) We are sorry about the small glitch at the Danaus plexippus node. Actually, after the phylogenetic tree was constructed, it was imported in Adobe Illustration for coloring and classification annotation. There may have been operational errors during the process of resizing the image, resulting in the occurrence of the small glitch. Besides, the unclear clustering of Coleoptera may be due to improper regulation of distance (pixels) of branch from nodes. Again, thanks for your careful reading. We have rebuilt the phylogenetic tree.</p>
<p>(e) Based on your suggestion, the sequence IDs have been unified as the protein sequence IDs (Fig. 5, Fig. 7B and Table S6)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The Discussion section requires significant revision to provide a more insightful and interpretative analysis of the results. Currently, much of the section primarily restates findings rather than offering deeper discussion. For instance, L409-L419 restate the results, followed by the short sentence &quot;Collectively, these results suggest that betulin may have insecticidal effects on aphids by inhibiting MpGABR expression&quot;. It could be further expanded to make it beneficial to elaborate on proposed mechanisms by which gene expression might be suppressed, including any potential transcription factors involved. In contrast, while L422-L442 also initially summarize results, the subsequent paragraph (L445-L472) effectively discusses the potential mechanisms of inhibitory action and how mortality is triggered, which is a good model for other parts of the section. However, all the discussion ends up with a short statement, &quot;implying that betulin acts as a CA of MpGABR&quot; (L472), which appears to be a leap. The inference that betulin acts as a competitive antagonist (CA) is solely based on the location of its extracellular binding site, which does not exactly overlap with the GABA binding site. It needs stronger justification or actually requires further experimental validation. The authors should consider rephrasing this statement to acknowledge the need for additional studies to definitively confirm this mechanism of action.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's careful reading and valuable feedback, which will certainly enhance the quality of our manuscript.</p>
<p>(a) Possible reasons for the effect of betulin on MpGABR expression have been discussed in our manuscript (Lines 455-466): The regulation of gene expression is sophisticated and delicate (Pope and Medzhitov 2018). The regulatory network controlling GABR expression remains unclear. In adult rats, epileptic seizures has been reported to increase the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which in turn prompted the transcription factors CREB and ICER to reduce the gene expression of the GABR α1 subunit (Lund et al. 2008). In Drosophila, it has been demonstrated that WIDE AWAKE, which regulated the onset of sleep, interacted with the GABR and upregulated its expression level (Liu et al. 2014). In Drosophila brain, circular RNA circ_sxc was found to inhibit the expression of miR-87-3p in the brain through sponge adsorption, thereby regulating the expression of neurotransmitter receptor ligand proteins, including GABR, and ensuring the normal function of synaptic signal transmission in brain neurons (Li et al. 2024). However, it remains unclear how betulin reduces the expression of MpGABR, and further research is needed.</p>
<p>(b) In the Discussion section, we acknowledged the need for further research to ultimately confirm the mechanism by which betulin competes with GABA for binding to MpGABR (Lines 532-535): Although the mechanism by which betulin competes with GABA for binding to MpGABR requires further experimental validation, our work may have provided a novel target for developing insecticides.</p>
<p>(c) Besides, we have added the discussion of the sensitivity of GABA receptor to betulin in Discussion section (Lines 491-501): Studies on key amino acids that are crucial for GABR function has primarily focused on transmembrane regions. For instance, based on the mutational research and Drosophila GABR modeling approach, multiple key amino acids were identified as insecticide targets in the transmembrane domain (Nakao and Banba 2021). Guo et al. proposed that amino acid substitutions in the transmembrane domain 2 contribute to terpenoid insensitivity during plant-insect coevolution (Guo et al. 2023). However, these studies have neglected the extracellular domain. Our study signified that betulin targets the THR228 site in the extracellular domain of MpGABR, which is conserved only in the Aphididae family. Therefore, betulin is speculated to be a specific insecticidal substance evolved by plants in response to aphid infestation. Besides, further verification is needed to determine whether betulin is toxic to other insect species.</p>
<p>(d) Furthermore, the discussion of potential ecological risks of deploying betulin as a bioinsecticide has been elaborated in our manuscript (Lines 538-553): The development of bioinsecticides should not only focus on the toxic effects of active substance on target organisms, but also on their influence on the ecosystem (Haddi et al. 2020). Although our results indicate that betulin has specific toxicity to aphids, previous studies have reported that betulin and its derivatives had effects on Plutella xylostella L. (Huang et al. 2025), Aedes aegypti (de Almeida Teles et al. 2024), and Drosophila melanogaster (Lee and Min 2024). Therefore, further research is needed to determine whether there are other insecticidal mechanisms or off target effects of betulin. Additionally, betulin exhibits a wide range of pharmacological activities (Amiri et al. 2020), which have been used to treat various diseases, such as cancer (Lv 2023), glioblastoma (Li et al. 2022), inflammation (Szlasa et al. 2023) and hyperlipidemia (Tang et al. 2011). Before applying betulin in the field, it is necessary to fully verify and consider whether betulin has any impact on farmers' health. Furthermore, will betulin cause residue or diffusion in the process of field application? Will long-term application promote the evolution of resistance to aphids or other insects? These issues also need further experimental verification. In summary, before any field application, further research is needed on the environmental behavior, degradation process, and safety of betulin.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are several important limitations that need to be addressed. The manuscript does not explore whether the observed sensitivity to betulin reflects a broadly conserved feature of GABA receptors across animal lineages or a more lineage-specific adaptation. This evolutionary context is crucial for understanding the broader significance of the findings.</p>
<p>In addition, while the compound's aphicidal effect is well established, the potential for off-target effects in non-target organisms - especially vertebrates - remains unaddressed, despite prior evidence that betulin interacts with mammalian GABAa receptors. There is little discussion on the ecological or environmental safety of exogenous betulin application, such as persistence, degradation, or exposure risks.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for the time and effort dedicated to our manuscript's detailed review and assessment. The revision suggestions were constructive, and we have provided a point-by-point response to address them.</p>
<p>(a) Briefly introduce the evolutionary conservation of GABA receptors has been added in the Introduction (Lines 90-98): Previous study has proposed that vertebrate and human GABR genes maintain a broad and conservative gene clustering pattern, while in invertebrates, this pattern is missing, indicating that these gene clusters formed early in vertebrate evolution and were established after diverging from invertebrates. Notably, invertebrates each possess a unique GABR gene pair, which are homologous with human GABR α and β subunits, suggesting that the existing GABR gene cluster evolved from an ancestral α - β subunit gene pair (Tsang et al. 2006). During the coevolution of plants and insects, the duplications and amino acid substitutions in GABR may be beneficial for the adaptation to insecticides and terpenoid compounds (Guo et al. 2023).</p>
<p>(b) We have added the discussion of the sensitivity of GABA receptor to betulin in Discussion section (Lines 491-501): Studies on key amino acids that are crucial for GABR function has primarily focused on transmembrane regions. For instance, based on the mutational research and Drosophila GABR modeling approach, multiple key amino acids were identified as insecticide targets in the transmembrane domain (Nakao and Banba 2021). Guo et al. proposed that amino acid substitutions in the transmembrane domain 2 contribute to terpenoid insensitivity during plant-insect coevolution (Guo et al. 2023).

Therefore, betulin is speculated to be a specific insecticidal substance evolved by plants in response to aphid infestation. Besides, further verification is needed to determine whether betulin is toxic to other insect species.</p>
<p>(c) The discussion of potential ecological risks of deploying betulin as a bioinsecticide has been elaborated in our manuscript (Lines 538-553): The development of bioinsecticides should not only focus on the toxic effects of active substance on target organisms, but also on their influence on the ecosystem (Haddi et al. 2020). Although our results indicate that betulin has specific toxicity to aphids, previous studies have reported that betulin and its derivatives had effects on Plutella xylostella L. (Huang et al. 2025), Aedes aegypti (de Almeida Teles et al. 2024), and Drosophila melanogaster (Lee and Min 2024). Therefore, further research is needed to determine whether there are other insecticidal mechanisms or off target effects of betulin. Additionally, betulin exhibits a wide range of pharmacological activities (Amiri et al. 2020), which have been used to treat various diseases, such as cancer (Lv 2023), glioblastoma (Li et al. 2022), inflammation (Szlasa et al. 2023) and hyperlipidemia (Tang et al. 2011). Before applying betulin in the field, it is necessary to fully verify and consider whether betulin has any impact on farmers' health. Furthermore, will betulin cause residue or diffusion in the process of field application? Will long-term application promote the evolution of resistance to aphids or other insects? These issues also need further experimental verification. In summary, before any field application, further research is needed on the environmental behavior, degradation process, and safety of betulin.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Introduction</p>
<p>(a) It lacks a deeper biological and evolutionary framing of the GABA receptor system. As GABA receptors are highly conserved across animal taxa, the observed interaction between betulin and the aphid GABA receptor could have broader implications. This possibility is not addressed in the current version, which limits the reader's appreciation of the relevance of this mode of action.</p>
<p>(b) Previous reports of betulin activity in mammalian systems are not mentioned in the introduction, even though they are directly relevant to concerns about off-target toxicity. Therefore, the introduction should be revised to (i) briefly introduce the evolutionary conservation of GABA receptors, and (ii) acknowledge that betulin may affect a broader range of organisms, which sets up the need for caution in its application.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your important suggestions.</p>
<p>(a) Briefly introduce the evolutionary conservation of GABA receptors has been added in the Introduction (Lines 90-98): Previous study has proposed that vertebrate and human GABR genes maintain a broad and conservative gene clustering pattern, while in invertebrates, this pattern is missing, indicating that these gene clusters formed early in vertebrate evolution and were established after diverging from invertebrates. Notably, invertebrates each possess a unique GABR gene pair, which are homologous with human GABR α and β subunits, suggesting that the existing GABR gene cluster evolved from an ancestral α - β subunit gene pair (Tsang et al. 2006). During the coevolution of plants and insects, the duplications and amino acid substitutions in GABR may be beneficial for the adaptation to insecticides and terpenoid compounds (Guo et al. 2023).</p>
<p>(b) The possible effects of betulin on a broader range of organisms have been acknowledged in the Introduction section (Lines 68-77): An immune stimulant, Ir-Bet, was prepared using iridium complex and betulin, which evoked ferritinophagy-enhanced ferroptosis, thereby activating anti-tumor immunity (Lv 2023). The anti-inflammatory effect of betulin has been reported in macrophages at lymphoma site in mice (Szlasa et al. 2023). Betulin has been found to improve hyperlipidemia and insulin resistance and decrease atherosclerotic plaques by inhibiting the maturation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (Tang et al. 2011). Besides, betulin and its derivatives have been found to exhibit insecticidal activity against Plutella xylostella L. (Huang et al. 2025), Aedes aegypti (de Almeida Teles et al. 2024), and Drosophila melanogaster (Lee and Min 2024).</p>
<p>(c) At the end of the introduction, we remind that betulin should be used with caution (Lines 111-112): However, given that betulin may affect a wider range of organisms, it should be used with caution.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Method</p>
<p>Number of biological replicates in all assays and justification of thresholds used for significance in RNAi and survival experiments are not addressed in the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your careful reading. We have checked Materials and Methods section and added corresponding number of biological replicates in all assays. Besides, the p-values for the corresponding significance analyses of RNAi and survival experiments have been added to our Manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2)  Discussion</p>
<p>(a) Consistent with the comments on the Introduction, the absence of discussion on (i) the evolutionary conservation of GABA receptor sensitivity to betulin, (ii) potential off-target effects in non-target insects and vertebrates (if so, this cannot be use for &quot;eco-friendly pesticide&quot; as the authors stated in the manuscript), and (iii) ecological risks associated with the exogenous application of betulin limits both the interpretive depth and applied relevance of the study.</p>
<p>(b) To strengthen the Discussion, the authors should consider addressing: (i) whether the observed sensitivity reflects a conserved pharmacological vulnerability across animal taxa or a lineage-specific adaptation; (ii) the potential ecological risks of deploying betulin as a bioinsecticide, and (iii) the need for future research into the environmental fate, degradation, and safety profile of betulin prior to any field-level application.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable comments.</p>
<p>(a) We have added the discussion of the sensitivity of GABA receptor to betulin in Discussion section (Lines 491-501): Studies on key amino acids that are crucial for GABR function has primarily focused on transmembrane regions. For instance, based on the mutational research and Drosophila GABR modeling approach, multiple key amino acids were identified as insecticide targets in the transmembrane domain (Nakao and Banba 2021). Guo et al. proposed that amino acid substitutions in the transmembrane domain 2 contribute to terpenoid insensitivity during plant-insect coevolution (Guo et al. 2023). However, these studies have neglected the extracellular domain. Our study signified that betulin targets the THR228 site in the extracellular domain of MpGABR, which is conserved only in the Aphididae family. Therefore, betulin is speculated to be a specific insecticidal substance evolved by plants in response to aphid infestation. Besides, further verification is needed to determine whether betulin is toxic to other insect species.</p>
<p>(b) The discussion of potential ecological risks of deploying betulin as a bioinsecticide has been elaborated in our manuscript (Lines 538-551): The development of bioinsecticides should not only focus on the toxic effects of active substance on target organisms, but also on their influence on the ecosystem (Haddi et al. 2020). Although our results indicate that betulin had specific toxicity to aphids, previous studies have reported that betulin and its derivatives had effects on Plutella xylostella L. (Huang et al. 2025), Aedes aegypti (de Almeida Teles et al. 2024), and Drosophila melanogaster (Lee and Min 2024). Therefore, further research is needed to determine whether there are other insecticidal mechanisms or off target effects of betulin. Additionally, betulin exhibits a wide range of pharmacological activities (Amiri et al. 2020), which have been used to treat various diseases, such as cancer (Lv 2023), glioblastoma (Li et al. 2022), inflammation (Szlasa et al. 2023) and hyperlipidemia (Tang et al. 2011). Before applying betulin in the field, it is necessary to fully verify and consider whether betulin has any impact on farmers' health. Furthermore, will betulin cause residue or diffusion in the process of field application? Will long-term application promote the evolution of resistance to aphids or other insects? These issues also need further experimental verification.</p>
<p>(c) Additionally, at the end of the Discussion, we remind that more research is needed before any field application of betulin (Lines 551-553): In summary, before any field application, further research on the environmental behavior, degradation process, and safety of betulin is needed.</p>
