<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Noncoding RNA plays a pivotal role as novel regulators of endothelial cell function. Type 2 diabetes, acknowledged as a primary contributor to cardiovascular diseases, plays a vital role in vascular endothelial cell dysfunction due to induced abnormalities of glucolipid metabolism and oxidative stress. In this study, aberrant expression levels of circHMGCS1 and miR-4521 were observed in diabetes-induced vascular endothelial dysfunction. The overexpression of circHMGCS1 or silencing of miR-4521 expedited the onset of diabetes and aggravated vascular endothelial dysfunction. Mechanistically, circHMGCS1 upregulated arginase 1 by sponging miR-4521, leading to decrease in vascular nitric oxide secretion and inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity, and an increase in the expression of adhesion molecules and generation of cellular reactive oxygen species, reduced vasodilation and accelerated the impairment of vascular endothelial function. Collectively, these findings illuminate the physiological role and interacting mechanisms of circHMGCS1 and miR-4521 in diabetes-induced cardiovascular diseases, suggesting that modulating the expression of circHMGCS1 and miR-4521 could serve as a potential strategy to prevent diabetes-associated cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, our findings provide a novel technical avenue for unraveling ncRNAs regulatory roles of ncRNAs in diabetes and its associated complications.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The incidence of CVD in T2DM individuals was estimated to be at least two to four times higher than that in non-diabetic individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Gregg et al, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Yun &amp; Ko, 2021</xref>). T2DM gives rise to abnormal metabolic conditions, including chronic hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, inflammation, and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Roden &amp; Shulman, 2019</xref>). These processes ultimately lead to vascular endothelial damage, which disrupts the maintenance of vascular homeostasis, thereby promoting the development of CVD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lundberg &amp; Weitzberg, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Niemann et al, 2017</xref>). Vascular endothelial dysfunction (VED) is considered the underlying basis for vascular complications at all stages of T2DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Eelen et al, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Meigs et al, 2004</xref>). However, the mechanism by which the key molecules trigger endothelial dysfunction in diabetes-induced vascular impairment remains unknown.</p>
<p>Endothelial cells form a continuous monolayer lining the arterial, venous, and lymphatic vessels, playing a crucial physiological role in maintaining vascular homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bazzoni &amp; Dejana, 2004</xref>). Moreover, endothelial cells actively regulate vascular tone, preserve endothelial integrity, and modulate platelet activity, contributing to hemostasis and endothelial repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Li et al, 2019</xref>). The leading cause of T2DM is a prolonged high-sugar, high-fat diet (HFHG), commonly known as a Western diet, which inevitably leads to VED, characterized by reduced content of nitric oxide (NO), uncoupling of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), increased formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and upregulation of endothelial-related adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1), and endothelin 1 (ET-1). These alterations ultimately lead to elevated blood pressure and impaired vascular arteriolar relaxation, contributing to CVD development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Xu et al, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Yeh et al, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zheng et al, 2018</xref>). Despite this understanding, the identification of pivotal regulatory factors governing gene expression in diabetes-induced VED remains a formidable challenge.</p>
<p>circRNAs are generated through back-splicing of precursor messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs), exhibiting features such as a covalently closed loop structure, high stability, conservation, and tissue-specific expression. These molecules primarily function as miRNA sponges, regulators of transcription, and interactors with proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kristensen et al, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Liu &amp; Chen, 2022</xref>). Conversely, miRNAs are single-stranded small RNA molecules of 21â23 nucleotides, characterized by high conservation, temporal and tissue-specific expression, and relatively poor stability. miRNAsâcritical regulators of gene expressionâcontrol a wide array of cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Gebert &amp; MacRae, 2019</xref>). The interplay between miRNAs and circRNAs forms a complex regulatory network, profoundly influencing diverse biological pathways and disease states. miRNAs serve as guides, targeting specific mRNAs to induce their degradation or translational repression, thereby suppressing gene expression post-transcriptionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Treiber et al, 2019</xref>). By contrast, circRNAs contain miRNA binding sites, competitively inhibiting miRNA activity and thereby reducing miRNA binding to other mRNAs. This competitive adsorption effect modulates intracellular miRNA levels, affecting miRNA-mediated regulation of other target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cheng et al, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Huang et al, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Shen et al, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Zeng et al, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>The expression levels of circRNA in diabetic patients exhibit abnormalities, and its potential as a biomarker for early diagnosis or therapeutic target has been gradually being substantiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Jiang et al, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Stoll et al, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Tian et al, 2018</xref>). However, research on circRNA in the context of diabetes-induced VED is scarce. Current research has predominantly focused on the regulatory roles of circRNA in diabetic cardiomyopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Yuan et al, 2023</xref>), diabetic nephropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Yang &amp; Liu, 2022</xref>), gestational diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Du et al, 2022</xref>), and diabetic retinopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zhu et al, 2019</xref>). Investigations into circRNA regulation of VED have only described the phenomenon and analyzed the correlation of the results, lacking the precision to infer causation accurately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Jiang et al, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Liu et al, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ma et al, 2023</xref>). Moreover, comprehension of VED induced by the complex multifactorial processes of diabetes pathogenesis remains relatively inadequate. Additionally, the interaction between circRNA and miRNA in diabetes-induced VED remains a subject of research controversy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cheng et al, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Liu et al, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Pan et al, 2018</xref>). Therefore, a more comprehensive research approach is required to elucidate the specific mechanisms by which circRNA operates in diabetes-related CVDs.</p>
<p>The present study elucidated the mechanisms underlying the interaction between circRNA and miRNA in regulating diabetes-associated VED. Through the screening strategy, we successfully identified circHMGCS1âa circRNA originating from the pre-mRNA of HMGCS1. We demonstrated that the upregulation of circHMGCS1 and downregulation of miR-4521 significantly promoted diabetes-induced VED. Moreover, in-depth mechanistic investigations revealed that circHMGCS1 functioned as a miR-4521 sponge, increasing arginase 1 (ARG1) expression in vascular endothelial cells and accelerating VED progression. Furthermore, the expression patterns and interaction mechanisms between circHMGCS1 and miR-4521 in endothelial cells were identified for the first time in these findings, which also highlight the circHMGCS1/miR-4521/ARG1 axis as a novel therapeutic target for interventions designed to protect patients from diabetes-induced VED.</p>

<title>Global expression analysis of endotheliocyte circRNAs</title>
<p>To explore the potential role of circRNAs in regulating endotheliocyte function, we characterized the transcriptome of circRNA derived from total RNA in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) stimulated by high palmitate and high glucose (PAHG), which allowed us to investigate the potential role of circRNAs in diabetes-induced VED (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figures S1A</xref>-<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1C</xref>). A total of 17,179 known circRNAs were identified, with 66 of them exhibiting differential expression (GEO submission: GSE237597). Our main focus was on circRNAs that shared identical genomic and splicing lengths that exhibited fold changes greater than 2 or less than â2 (p &lt; 0.01) in PAHG-treated HUVECs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Specifically, 48 circRNAs were upregulated, whereas 18 were downregulated (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1D</xref>). Furthermore, approximately 66.65% of circRNAs were found to be produced through reverse splicing of exons (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1E</xref>).</p>

<p>The observed changes in circRNA levels were confirmed through the real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of the five most upregulated circRNAs, suggesting that the results of the RNA-seq data are credible. Among them, circHMGCS1 (hsa_circ_0008621, 899 nt in length, identified as circHMGCS1 in subsequent studies because of its host gene being HMGCS1) exhibited significant upregulation compared with the non-PAHG-treated condition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). The circHMGCS1 sequence is situated on chromosome 5 of the human genome, specifically at 43292575-43297268 with no homology to mouse sequences. Subsequently, divergent primers were designed to amplify circHMGCS1, whereas convergent primers were designed to amplify the corresponding linear mRNA from cDNA and genomic DNA (gDNA) in HUEVCs. amplification of circHMGCS1 was observed in cDNA but not in gDNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), which confirmed the circularity of circHMGCS1. Sanger sequencing of the amplified product of circHMGCS1 confirmed its sequence alignment with the annotated circHMGCS1 in circBase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). This observation confirms the origin of circHMGCS1 from exons 2 to 7 of the HMGCS1 gene (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>RNA-Fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (RNA-FISH) confirmed the robust expression of cytoplasmic circHMGCS1 in HUVECs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). The qRT-PCR analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA revealed the predominant cytoplasmic expression of circHMGCS1 in HUVECs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). qRT-PCR also demonstrated that circHMGCS1 displayed a stable half-life exceeding 24 h, whereas the linear transcript HMGCS1 mRNA had a half-life of less than 8 h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). Furthermore, circHMGCS1 exhibited resistance to digestion by ribonuclease R (an exonuclease that selectively degrades linear RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Xiao &amp; Wilusz, 2019</xref>), also known as RNase R), whereas linear HMGCS1 mRNA was easily degraded upon RNase R treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). These findings indicate that the higher expression of circHMGCS1 in VED is more than just a byproduct of splicing and suggestive of functionality.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Upregulation of circHMGCS1 promotes diabetes-induced VED</title>
<p>To explore the potential role of circHMGCS1 in regulating endothelial cell function, we cloned exons 2â7 of HMGCS1 into lentiviral vectors for ectopic overexpression of circHMGCS1 (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>). We found that circHMGCS1 was successfully overexpressed in HUVECs without significant changes in HMGCS1 mRNA expression, and the level of the circular transcripts increased nearly 60-fold than the level of the linear transcripts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). These results confirm that the circularization is efficient and that circHMGCS1 has no effect on HMGCS1 expression. Further experiments demonstrated that the overexpression of circHMGCS1 stimulated the expression of adhesion molecules (VCAM1, ICAM1, and ET-1) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>), suggesting that circHMGCS1 is involved in VED promotion. We then used PAHG to stimulate HUVEC-overexpressing circHMGCS1. NO levels were significantly decreased after PAHG stimulation for 24 h, and circHMGCS1 overexpression further decreased NO levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), indicating that increased circHMGCS1 expression inhibits endothelial diastolic function. eNOS activity was inhibited by PAHG, and upregulated circHMGCS1 expression further decreased eNOS activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Superoxide is one of the major ROS known to promote atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Griendling et al, 2016</xref>). Therefore, we used DHE to assess superoxide levels in endothelial cells. The overexpression of circHMGCS1 enhanced PAHG-induced ROS generation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>), increasing oxidative stress in endothelial cells. The expression levels of adhesion molecules (VCAM1, ICAM1, and ET-1) were further elevated with circHMGCS1 overexpression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2H</xref>). These findings suggest that elevated expression of circHMGCS1 may contribute to the development of endothelial cell dysfunction.</p>

<title>miR-4521 protects endothelial cells from PAHG-induced dysfunction</title>
<p>circRNAs may function as ceRNAs to sponge miRNAs, thereby modulating miRNA target depression and imposing an additional level of post-transcriptional regulation in human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Zhong et al, 2018</xref>). Accordingly, we conducted miRNA sequencing in PAHG-stimulated HUVECs to identify the potential miRNA targets of circHMGCS1. The deep sequencing analysis revealed 98 significantly differentially expressed miRNAs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>, GEO submission: GSE237295). We then used the miRanda database and ceRNA theory to obtain four candidate miRNAs (miR-4521, miR-3143, miR-98-5p, and miR-181a-2-3p) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). qRT-PCR confirmed that all four miRNAs were downregulated (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Next, we observed that each of the four miRNA mimics induced a significantly increase in the expression of their corresponding miRNAs in HUVECs through the application of synthetic miRNA mimics (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A</xref>). Relative to the other three miRNAs, miR-4521 mimics significantly inhibited adhesion molecules (ICAM1, VCAM1, and ET-1) expression in HUVECs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3F</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3G</xref>), making it a suitable candidate for further endothelial function studies. We then investigate the effect of miR-4521 on PAHG-stimulated endothelial cell function using synthetic miR-4521 mimics and miR-4521 inhibitor in HUVECs (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figures S3B</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3C</xref>). Enhanced miR-4521 levels effectively restored PAHG-induced reductions in NO content and eNOS activity in HUEVCs, while miR-4521 inhibition led to opposite results (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3H</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3I</xref>). whereas miR-4521 mimics significantly inhibited PAHG-induced expression of ROS and adhesion molecules (VCAM1, ICAM1, and ET-1) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>), whereas the miR-4521 inhibitor increased the PAHG-induced expression of ROS and adhesion molecules (VCAM1, ICAM1, and ET-1) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3K</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3L</xref>, and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3D</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3E</xref>).

<title>circHMGCS1 acts as a miR-4521 sponge to regulate endothelial dysfunction</title>
<p>We then explored the interaction mechanism between circHMGCS1 and miR-4521. As displayed in <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A</xref>, the overexpression of circHMGCS1 reduced the expression level of miR-4521. Meanwhile, bioinformatics analysis revealed the predicted binding sites between miR-4521 and circHMGCS1 (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4B</xref>). We constructed a dual-luciferase reporter by inserting the wild-type (WT) or mutant (MUT) linear sequence of circHMGCS1 into the pmirGLO luciferase vector. The co-transfection of miR-4521 mimics with the circHMGCS1 luciferase reporter gene in HEK293T cells, reducing luciferase activity; mutations in the binding sites between circHMGCS1 and miR-4521 abrogated the effect of miR-4521 mimics on the activity of the circHMGCS1 luciferase reporter gene mutant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Furthermore, AGO2 immunoprecipitation in HUVECs transfected with miR-4521 or its mutants demonstrated that miR-4521 facilitates the association of AGO2 with circHMGCS1 in HUVECs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Meanwhile, we used biotinylated miR-4521 mimics in HUVECs stably overexpressing circHMGCS1 to further validate the direct binding of miR-4521 and circHMGCS1. The qRT-PCR results revealed that miR-4521 captured endogenous circHMGCS1, and the negative control with a disrupting putative binding sequence failed to coprecipitate circHMGCS1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Moreover, the RNA-FISH assay showed colocalization of miR-4521 and circHMGCS1 in the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Altogether, these findings indicate that circHMGCS1 functions as a molecular sponge for miR-4521.</p>

<p>Rescue experiments were conducted to investigate whether circHMGCS1 regulates endothelial cell function through miR-4521 sponging. We achieved miR-4521 inhibition by transfecting HUVECs with a recombinant adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9) vector carrying miR-4521 sponges. Notably, miR-4521 sponges significantly promoted the PAHG-induced reduction in NO content and eNOS activity. Under this condition, increased circHMGCS1 expression did not interfere with the changes in NO content and eNOS activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>). Moreover, miR-4521 sponges elevated ROS expression in PAHG treated HUVECs, whereas no further additional effect on ROS expression was observed upon the overexpression of circHMGCS1 when miR-4521 was sponged (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). Further evaluation of endothelial functional molecules revealed that circHMGCS1 failed to stimulate the expression of these factors when miR-4521 was sponged (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4H</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4J</xref>). Furthermore, the reduction in NO content and eNOS activity induced by circHMGCS1 overexpression was reversed by miR-4521 mimics (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4K</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4L</xref>), and the circHMGCS1-mediated increase in ROS content was inhibited by miR-4521 mimics (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4M</xref>). Furthermore, the expression of adhesion molecules (ICAM1, VCAM1, and ET-1) was increased in circHMGCS1-transfected HUVECs, and this effect was significantly ameliorated by miR-4521 mimics (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4N</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4P</xref>).

<title>circHMGCS1 serves as a miR-4521 sponge to regulate diabetes-induced VED</title>
<p>To further explore the interaction between miR-4521 and circHMGCS1 in diabetes-induced VED, we administered exogenous miR-4521 agomir (mimics) via tail vein injection to mice, whereas agomir NC, expressing random sequence, served as the negative control in HFHG-induced diabetes to examine its effect on diabetes and associated VED (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5A</xref>). Compared with to non-diabetic WT (Control) mice, DM mice exhibited a significant increase in body weight, upon miR-4521 agomir application, the body weight of diabetic mice significantly decreased compared with the untreated diabetic mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), and elevated fasting blood glucose levels in DM mice were likewise substantially inhibited (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). By contrast, the combined treatment of circHMGCS1 and miR-4521 agomir did not significantly affect the body weight and blood glucose levels. OGTT and ITT experiments demonstrated that miR-4521 agomir considerably enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in diabetic mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5C</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>, and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5B</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5C</xref>). Blood lipid biochemistry analysis revealed that miR-4521 agomir restored abnormal blood lipid levels in diabetic mice (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figures S5D</xref>-<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5G</xref>). Notably, the abundant presence of circHMGCS1 in the body can negate the inhibitory effect of miR-4521 on diabetes development. These results suggest that miR-4521 can inhibit the occurrence of diabetes, whereas circHMGCS1 specifically dampens the function of miR-4521, weakening its protective effect against diabetes.</p>

<p>To investigate the roles of miR-4521 and circHMGCS1 in mouse vascular relaxation, we conducted an <italic>ex vivo</italic> culture of thoracic aortas from mice subjected to different treatments. A significant impairment in acetylcholine (Ach)-induced vascular relaxation response in the thoracic aorta of diabetic mice was markedly improved by 4521 agomir, emphasizing the critical involvement of miR-4521 in vascular relaxation. Conversely, circHMGCS1 inhibited the protective function of miR-4521 on vascular relaxation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Across all experimental groups, the smooth muscle exhibited a normal endothelium-dependent relaxation response to the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5H</xref>), revealing intact smooth muscle function. Meanwhile, diabetic mice displayed a significant increase in SBP compared with normal mice, which was significantly restrained by miR-4521 agomir treatment. Nevertheless, this beneficial effect was nullified in the presence of circHMGCS1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). Furthermore, miR-4521 agomir inhibited intimal thickening and smooth muscle cell proliferation in diabetic mice, whereas upregulation of circHMGCS1 abrogated this effect (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). These findings demonstrate that circHMGCS1 and miR-4521 play specific roles in regulating vascular endothelial function in diabetic mice.</p>
<p>We measured the NO level to further investigate the interaction between miR-4521 and circHMGCS1 in regulating diabetes-induced VED. Compared with the control group, the NO level decreased in the thoracic aorta of diabetic mice; however, miR-4521 agomir treatment increased its content (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>). Furthermore, miR-4521 treatment effectively enhanced eNOS activity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>), whereas circHMGCS1 hindered miR-4521 regulatory function on NO content and eNOS activity. Furthermore, miR-4521 reduced ROS production in the blood vessels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5J</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5K</xref>) and inhibited the expression of endothelial adhesion molecules (ICAM1, ET-1, and VCAM1) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5L</xref>). Nonetheless, in the presence of circHMGCS1, the effect of miR-4521 was abrogated. These results indicated that circHMGCS1 acts as a miR-4521 sponge, participating in diabetes-induced VED.</p>

<title>ARG1 is a direct target of miR-4521 to accelerate endothelial dysfunction</title>
<p>To investigate whether circHMGCS1-associated miR-4521 regulated VED-related gene expression by targeting the 3â-untranslated region (UTR), we conducted predictions of mRNAs containing miR-4521 binding sites using the GenCard, mirDIP, miRWalk, and Targetscan databases. Through bioinformatics analyses, we identified binding sites for miR-4521 on KLF6, ARG1, and MAPK1 genes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated the involvement of elevated arginase activity in diabetes-induced VED. Arginase can modulate the production of NO synthesized by eNOS through competitive utilization of the shared substrate L-arginine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jung et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Romero et al, 2008</xref>). Moreover, miR-4521 possesses the capability to bind to the 3â untranslated region of ARG1 in both human and mouse genomes (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6A</xref>). The protein expression of ARG1 was increased in the aorta of diabetic mice and PAHG-treated HUVECs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6B</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6B</xref>).

<p>To verify the regulatory effect of ARG1 in diabetes-induced VED, we transfected HUVECs with lentiviral vectors containing cloned ARG1 sequences to achieve ARG1 overexpression (pLV-ARG1). The NO content assay revealed that elevated ARG1 expression significantly suppressed the reduction of NO content induced by PAHG in HUVECs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). Moreover, we measured eNOS activityâa significant regulator of NO productionâand observed its inhibition by ARG1 overexpression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). Besides, upregulated ARG1 expression increased the production of ROS in endothelial cells, elevating oxidative stress in HUVECs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>). These findings suggest ARG1 involvement in promoting VED development, and miR-4521 mediates the participation of ARG1 in diabetes-induced VED.</p>
<p>To explore the regulatory effect of the interaction between circHMGCS1 and miR-4521 on ARG1 expression, we transfected HUVECs with either miR-4521 mimics or miR-4521 inhibitors. Subsequently, we evaluated the gene and protein expression levels of ARG1 using qRT-PCR and western blotting. miR-4521 mimics repressed ARG1 transcription and protein expression, whereas miR-4521 inhibition upregulated ARG1 expression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6I</xref>-<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6K</xref>). Additionally, circHMGCS1 overexpression significantly further promoted ARG1 transcription and protein expression during the PAHG treatment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6L</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6M</xref>), confirming the regulatory function of circHMGCS1 in VED-related ARG1 expression. We next studied the function of miR-4521, which acts as a sponge for circHMGCS1 to regulate ARG1 in HUVECs. The mRNA and protein levels of ARG1 were significantly increased when HUVECs were transfected with circHMGCS1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6N</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6O</xref>). However, miR-4521 overexpression counteracted the effects of circHMGCS1 on ARG1 mRNA and protein expression. Besides, the inhibition of miR-4521 using a miR-4521 sponge in HUVECs further increased ARG1 expression under the PAHG treatment. Notably, elevated circHMGCS1 expression did not affect ARG1 regulation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6P</xref>). Moreover, compared with diabetic mice, circHMGCS1 overexpression dampened the function of miR-4521 agomir on ARG1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6Q</xref>).

<p>Considering the role of ARG1 in regulating endothelial cell function through circHMGCS1 and miR-4521, we downregulated ARG1 expression in mice by administering AAV9 ARG1 shRNA through tail vein injection (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7A</xref>). As anticipated, AAV9 ARG1 shRNA-infused mice exhibited decreased body weight and lower fasting blood glucose levels compared with diabetic mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7F</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7G</xref>). Moreover, OGTT and ITT demonstrated that reduced ARG1 levels in AAV9 ARG1 shRNA-treated mice preserved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7H</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7I</xref>, and <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figures S7B</xref> and <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">S7C</xref>).

However, the overexpression of circHMGCS1 or miR-4521 had no significant effect on glucose and lipid metabolism in AAV9 ARG1 shRNA-expressing mice. These findings confirm that ARG1 is an indispensable regulator for circHMGCS1 and miR-4521 in regulating diabetes.</p>
<p>We next investigated whether ARG1 regulates vascular endothelial cell function in the context of diabetes. Knocking down ARG1 in the thoracic aorta of mice expressing AAV9 ARG1 shRNA restored diastolic function of the thoracic aorta in diabetic mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7J</xref>), emphasizing the vital role of ARG1 in VED. Furthermore, all experimental groups exhibited a normal endothelium-dependent relaxation response to the NO donor SNP, suggesting intact smooth muscle function (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7H</xref>). Moreover, AAV9 ARG1 shRNA effectively inhibited diabetes-induced intima thickening and inhibited smooth muscle cell proliferation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7K</xref>), and which also counteracted the elevation of SBP induced by diabetes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7L</xref>). However, the regulatory effects of circHMGCS1 and miR-4521 on vascular dilation were ineffective in the presence of ARG1 shRNA. We next measured VED-related functional factors.

Notably, circHMGCS1 and miR-4521 lost their regulatory capacity on vascular endothelial cell function in the presence of ARG1 shRNA.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The field of ncRNA biology has garnered considerable attention and has witnessed intensive research over the last few years. ncRNAs possess the capacity to function as novel regulators in various physiological systems and disease contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Esteller, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Matsui &amp; Corey, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Statello et al, 2021</xref>). However, most studies have explored the expression patterns and functions of ncRNAs within single disease settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arcinas et al, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Shan et al, 2017</xref>). The present study contributes to the understanding of ncRNAs and their involvement in diabetes-associated CVD, characterized by disruption of lipid metabolic homeostasis and redox balance in vascular endothelial cells under diabetic conditions. A comprehensive genome-wide analysis revealed 17,179 known circRNA loci transcribed in diabetic endothelial cells. Based on conservation, endothelial specificity, and abundance criteria, five circRNAs were selected for validation, indicating their predominant upregulation in the diabetic endothelial environment. Among them, we discovered a novel circRNA, circHMGCS1, exhibiting high abundance, stability, and cell specificity in diabetic endothelial cells and contributing to endothelial function regulation. Our findings establish that circHMGCS1 promotes VED progression, and its overexpression exacerbates endothelial cell dysfunction. Our study highlights the pivotal role of circHMGCS1 in regulating endothelial cell function during diabetes.</p>
<p>circRNAs play regulatory roles by acting as microRNA sponges or interacting with proteins to regulate alternative splicing, transcription, and epigenetic modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arcinas et al, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hansen et al, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Memczak et al, 2013</xref>). To investigate the mechanism of circHMGCS1 in VED regulation, we analyzed miRNA sequencing results and prediction software to identify miR-4521 as a novel endothelial-expressed miRNA. miR-4521 was found to possess a stable binding site with circHMGCS1, and its expression was significantly decreased in endothelial cells within a diabetic environment. Our functional studies revealed that miR-4521 mimics attenuated VED development in diabetes, whereas its inhibition exacerbated VED progression. These findings preliminarily demonstrate the regulatory ability of miR-4521 in VED. The interaction between circHMGCS1 and miR-4521 was further characterized through luciferase reporter gene assays, RNA pull-down, and RNA immunoprecipitation. AAV9-mediated circHMGCS1 overexpression in endothelial cells dampened miR-4521 expression and accelerated diabetes-induced VED. Conversely, restoring miR-4521 expression effectively alleviated VED progression, highlighting the critical role of miR-4521 in counteracting circHMGCS1-mediated promotion of diabetes-induced VED. Moreover, the absence of miR-4521 aggravated diabetes-induced VED, whereas exogenous circHMGCS1 addition did not affect VED development. Intriguingly, exogenous miR-4521 significantly restrained diabetes-induced VED exacerbation, which was attenuated upon the subsequent addition of exogenous circHMGCS1. These findings underscore the essential regulatory role of the circHMGCS1 and miR-4521 interaction in maintaining diabetic vascular homeostasis.</p>
<p>Finally, we investigated the downstream targets crucial for circHMGCS1-mediated endothelial cell function. Arginase is a dual-nucleus manganese metalloenzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of L-arginine, primarily producing L-ornithine and urea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kanyo et al, 1996</xref>). ARG1 and ARG2âtwo isoforms of arginaseâexist in vertebrates, including mammals. Although ARG1 and ARG2 share the same catalytic reaction, they are encoded by different genes and exhibit distinct immunological characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hara et al, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pudlo et al, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Su et al, 2021</xref>). Elevated ARG1 activity in endothelial cells has been identified as a significant contributor to VED in T2DM individuals. This dysfunction is attributed to the excessive formation of ROS caused by the competition between ARG1 and eNOS for L-arginine. Consequently, oxidases or mitochondrial complexes become overactivated, resulting in reduced NO levels and subsequent VED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Caldwell et al, 2018</xref>). By contrast, inhibiting arginase has been shown to considerably enhance endothelial function in T2DM patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mahdi et al, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Shemyakin et al, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Zhou et al, 2018</xref>). Our findings suggest that T2DM enhances ARG1 activity and expression in vascular endothelial cells. Conversely, ARG1 inhibition in endothelial cells delayed the onset of diabetes and preserved NO metabolite levels in the aorta. Additionally, Ach-induced vasodilation remains intact in the absence of ARG1 in the aortic ring, as ARG1 inhibition promotes eNOS-dependent relaxation, thereby preventing VED. Meanwhile, ROS content in the aorta of diabetic mice could be reduced under ARG1 inhibition, thereby suppressing the occurrence of oxidative stress. AAV9-mediated overexpression of circHMGCS1 increases ARG1 expression, which is inhibited by exogenous miR-4521 intervention. In the absence of miR-4521, circHMGCS1 cannot regulate ARG1 expression, whereas exogenous miR-4521 intervention inhibits the diabetes-induced increase in ARG1 expression <italic>in vivo</italic>, and this effect is counteracted by circHMGCS1 overexpression. Both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> data suggest that the miR-4521 or circHMGCS1 fails to regulate the effect of diabetes-induced VED in the absence of ARG1. Therefore, ARG1 may serve as a promising VED biomarker, and circHMGCS1 and miR-4521 play a key role in regulating diabetes-induced VED by ARG1.</p>
<p>It would be intriguing to elucidate the mechanisms through which circHMGCS1 and miR-4521 exert their regulatory roles in endothelial cell function. The present study elucidated the potential VED-associated mechanisms in diabetes, with a specific focus on the complicated mutual effects between circHMGCS1 and miR-4521. The ceRNA network involving circHMGCS1-miR-4521-ARG1 can become a novel and significant regulatory pathway for preventing and potentially treating diabetes-induced VED. Our findings suggest that targeted inhibition of circHMGCS1 or the overexpression of miR-4521 could serve as effective strategies in mitigating diabetes-induced VED. These insights underscore the promising function of ncRNAs in developing therapeutic interventions for diabetes-associated VED.</p>

<p>After sacrificing the mice, the thoracic aortae and mesenteric arteries were carefully removed and dissected in an oxygenated ice-cold Krebs solution. The changes in the isometric tone of the aortic rings and second-order mesenteric arteries were recorded using a wire myograph (Danish Myo, DK). The arterial segments were stretched to achieve an optimal baseline tension (3 mN for the aorta) and allowed to equilibrate for 1 h. Subsequently, the segments were contracted using 60 mmol/L of KCl and rinsed with Krebs solution.

<title>Western blot analysis</title>
<p>Western blot was performed following previously described procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Xu et al, 2022</xref>). Protein extraction from cells or tissues was carried out using protein lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Beyotime, China). The concentrations of the protein lysates were determined using the Beyotime BCA Protein Assay Kit (Beyotime, China) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Equal quantities of proteins (20 Î¼g/lane) were loaded onto 8% or 10% SDS-PAGE gels and subsequently transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore, USA). The membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4Â°C. The primary antibodies used were as follows: anti-ARG1 (diluted 1:1,000; Abcam, ab133543), anti-ARG2 (diluted 1:1,000; Abcam, ab264066), anti-ET-1 (diluted 1:1,000; Abcam, ab2786), anti-VCAM1 (diluted 1:1,000; Abcam, ab134047), anti-ICAM1 (diluted 1:1,000; Abcam, ab222736), anti-Î²-actin (diluted 1:2,000; Abcam, ab5694), and anti-GAPDH (diluted 1:2,000; Abcam, ab8245). After incubation with the corresponding secondary antibodies for 2 hours at room temperature, the membranes were washed. Antibody binding was detected using an ECL detection reagent (Millipore, USA). Digital images were captured using a Gel DocTM XR+ System with ImageLab software (BioRad, USA). The quantification of the labeled bands was performed using ImageJ 1.55.</p>

<title>RNA Fluorescent <italic>In Situ</italic> Hybridization (RNA-FISH)</title>
<p>The RNA-FISH assay was conducted in HUVECs. Cy3-labeled circHMGCS1 probe and FAM-labeled miR-4521 probe were custom-designed and synthesized by RiboBio (China). The signals emanating from the probes were detected using the Ribo<sup>TM</sup> FISH Kit (RiboBio) in accordance with the manufacturerâs protocol. Briefly, frozen sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes, followed by PBS washing. The fixed sections were treated with PBS containing 0.5% triton X-100 at 4Â°C for 5 min, followed by incubation in pre-dehydration buffer at 37Â°C for 30 min. Subsequently, probes targeting circMAP3K5 and miR-4521 were applied to the sections. Hybridization was performed in a humid chamber at 37Â°C overnight. Post-hybridization washing was initially conducted with 4Ã saline sodium citrate containing 0.1% tween-20 at 42Â°C, followed by further washing with 2Ã saline sodium citrate at 42Â°C to eliminate non-specific and repetitive RNA hybridization. The slides were counterstained with DAPI (beyotime, China) and examined using an Olympus FV1200 (Olympus, Japan) confocal microscopy system. The mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) was determined using Image J software and subjected to statistical analysis. The probe sequences are detailed as follows: Cy3-circHMGCS1: 5â-UCCCACGAAGCCCUCAGUUGCUAUG-3â, FAM-miR-4521: 5â-UUUGACUCGUGUCCUGAAGGAAUCG-3â.</p>

<title>Luciferase reporter assay</title>
<p>The complete sequence of circHMGCS1 and a mutant circHMGCS1 sequence lacking the miRNA binding site were chemically synthesized. These sequences were inserted into the Nhel and SaII sites of the pmirGLO vector to generate expression vectors denoted as circHMGCS1-WT and circHMGCS1-MUT. Transfection was carried out using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, USA) with 50 nM miR-4521 mimics, miR-NC, miR-4521 inhibitor, and miR-NC inhibitor. HEK293T cells were seeded in 96-well plates and cultured until reaching 50%-70% confluence prior to transfection. After 48-h of transfection, cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was quantified utilizing the Dual Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay Kit (Yeason, China). The pmirGLO vector expressing Renilla luciferase was utilized as an internal control for transfection, while the empty pmirGLO vector served as the negative control. Firefly luciferase activity of the pmirGLO vector was normalized with Renilla luciferase activity for comparison. Luciferase reporter assay was also used to investigate the regulation of miR-4521 on the expression of its target genes. For ARG1 and miR-4521, either wild-type or mutant ARG1 3âUTR fragments (433 bp) were inserted into NheI/SalI restriction sites of pmirGLO. 1 Î¼g plasmids of ARG1 3âUTR-WT and ARG1 3âUTR-MUT, 50 nM miR-4521 mimics, miR-NC, miR-4521 inhibitor and miR-NC inhibitor were transfected. Luciferase activity was evaluated 48 hours post-transfection using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay Kit (Yeason).</p>

<title>Histological and morphometric analysis</title>
<p>Aortic tissues were prepared by fixing them in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and subsequently embedding them in paraffin. The resulting paraffin-embedded tissues were then sectioned into 4-Î¼m-thick slices. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E) staining was performed on these sections to visualize the vascular tissue structures and assess the degree of thickness in the thoracic aorta. The average thickness of five randomly selected regions of the thoracic aorta was measured using OlyVIA software (Olympus, Japan).</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analyses were conducted using Prism software (GraphPad 8.0). Data are presented as mean Â± standard deviation (SD) unless otherwise stated. Prior to statistical analysis, the normality of data distribution was evaluated using the Shapiro-Wilk test. For comparisons between the two groups, an unpaired two-tailed Studentâs t-test was used. When comparing more than the two groups, either a one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted, followed by the Bonferroni multiple comparison post hoc test. Group differences were considered statistically significant at a p-value of &lt;0.05. The level of significance was indicated by asterisks, with *, **, and *** denoting p-values lower than 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001, respectively.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>HMGCS1, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase1 is predicted to be involved in Acetyl-CoA metabolic process and mevalonate-cholesterol pathway. To induce diet-induced diabetes, they fed wild-type littermates either a standard chow (Control) or a high fat-high sucrose (HFHG) diet, where the diet composition consisted of 60% fat, 20% protein, and 20% carbohydrate (H10060, Hfkbio, China). The dietary regimen was maintained for 14 weeks. Throughout this period, body weight and fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels were measured on a weekly basis. Although the authors induced diabetes with a diet also rich in fat, the cholesterol concentration or metabolism was not investigated. After the treatment, were the animals with endothelial dysfunction? How was the blood pressure of the animals?</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>To explore the potential role of circHMGCS1 in regulating endothelial cell function, the authors cloned exons 2-7 of HMGCS1 into lentiviral vectors for ectopic overexpression of circHMGCS1 (Figure S2). The authors could use this experiment as a concept proof and investigate the glucose concentration in the cell culture medium. Is the pLV-circ HMGCS1 transduction in HUVEC increasing the glucose release? (Line 163)</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Pg 20. The cells were transfected with miR-4521 mimics, miR-inhibitor, or miR-NC and incubated for 24 hours. Subsequently, the cells were treated with PAHG for another 24 hours.</p>
<p>Were the cells transfected with lipofectanine? The protocol or the lipofectamine kit used should be described. The lipofectamine protocol suggests using an incubation time of 72 hours. Why did the authors incubate for only 24 hours?</p>
<p>If the authors did the mimic and inhibitor curves, these should be added to the supplementary figures. Please, describe the miRNA mimic and antagomir concentration used in cell culture.</p>
<p>(2) Pg 20, line 507. What was the miR-4521 agomiR used to treatment of the animals?</p>
<p>(3) Figure 1B. The results are showing the RT-qPCR for only 5 circRNA, however, the results show 48 circRNAs were upregulated, and 18 were downregulated (Figure S1D). Why were the other cicRNAs not confirmed? The circRNAs upregulated with high expression are not necessarily with the best differential expression comparing control vs. PAHG groups. Furthermore, Figure 1A and S1D show circRNAs downregulated also with high expression. Why were these circRNAs not confirmed?</p>
<p>(4) Figure 1B shows the relative circRNAs expression. Were host genes expressed in the same direction?</p>
<p>(5) Line 128. The circRNA RT-qPCR methodology was not described. The methodology should be described in detail in the Methods Session.</p>
<p>(6) Line 699. The relative gene expression was calculated using the 2-ÎÎCt method. This is not correct, the expression for miRNA and gene expression are represented in percentage of control.</p>
<p>(7) Line 630. Detection of ROS for tissue and cells. The methodology for tissue was described, but not for cells.</p>
<p>(8) Line 796. RNA Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (RNA-FISH). Figure 1F shows that the RNA-Fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH) confirmed the robust expression of cytoplasmic circHMGCS1 in HUVECs (Figure 1F). However, in the methods, lines 804 and 805 described the probes targeting circMAP3K5 and miR-4521 were applied to the sections. Hybridization was performed in a humid chamber at 37{degree sign}C overnight. Is it correct?</p>
<p>(9) Line 14. Fig 1-H. The authors discuss qRT-PCR demonstrated that circHMGCS1 displayed a stable half-life exceeding 24 h, whereas the linear transcript HMGCS1 mRNA had a half-life less than 8 h (Figure 1H).</p>
<p>
Several of the antibodies may contain trace amounts of RNases that could degrade target RNA and could result in loss of RNA hybridization signal or gene expression. Thus, all of the solutions should contain RNase inhibitors. The HMGCS1 mRNA expression could be degraded over the incubation time (0-24hs) leading to incorrect results. Moreover, in the methods is not mentioned if the RNAse inhibitor was used. Please, could the authors discuss and provide information?</p>
<p>(10) Further experiments demonstrated that the overexpression of circHMGCS1 stimulated the expression of adhesion molecules (VCAM1, ICAM1, and ET-1) (Figures 2B and 2C), suggesting that circHMGCS1 is involved in VED. How were these genes expressed in the RNA-seq?</p>
<p>(11) Line 256. By contrast, the combined treatment of circHMGCS1 and miR-4521 agomir did not significantly affect the body weight and blood glucose levels. OGTT and ITT experiments demonstrated that miR-4521 agomir considerably enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in diabetic mice (Figures 5C, 5D, and Figures S5B and S5C). Why didi the miR-4521 agomir treatment considerably enhance glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in diabetic mice, but not the blood glucose levels?</p>
<p>(12) In the experiments related to pull-down, the authors performed Biotin-coupled miR-4521 or its mutant probe, which was employed for circHMGCS1 pull-down. This result only confirms the Luciferase experiments shown in Figure 4A. The experiment that the authors need to perform is pull-down using a biotin-labeled antisense oligo (ASO) targeting the circHMGCS1 backsplice junction sequence followed by pulldown with streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads to capture the associated miRNAs and RNA binding proteins (RBPs). Also, the ASO pulldown assay can be coupled to miRNA RT-qPCR and western blotting analysis to confirm the association of miRNAs and RBPs predicted to interact with the target circRNA.</p>
<p>(13) In Figure 5, the authors showed that the results suggest that miR-4521 can inhibit the occurrence of diabetes, whereas circHMGCS1 specifically dampens the function of miR-4521, weakening its protective effect against diabetes. In this context, what are the endogenous target genes for the miR-4521 that could be regulating diabetes?</p>
<p>(14) In the western blot of Figure 5, the Î²-actin band appears to be different from the genes analyzed. Was the same membrane used for the four proteins? The Ponceau S membrane should be provided.</p>
<p>(15) Why did the authors use AAV9, since the AAV9 has a tropism for the liver, heart, skeletal muscle, and not to endothelial vessels?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors observed an aggravated vascular endothelial dysfunction upon overexpressing circHMGCS1 and inhibiting miR-4521. This study discovered that circHMGCS1 promotes arginase 1 expression by sponging miR-4521, which accelerated the impairment of vascular endothelial function.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study is systematic and establishes the regulatory role of the circHMGCS1-miR-4521 axis in diabetes-induced cardiovascular diseases.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors selected the miR-4521 as the target based on their reduced expression upon circHMGCS1 overexpression. Since the miRNA level is downregulated, the downstream target gene is expected to be upregulated even in the absence of circRNA. The changes in miRNA expression opposite to the levels of target circRNA could be through Target RNA-Directed MicroRNA Degradation. In addition, miRNA can also be stabilized by circRNAs. Hence, selecting miRNA targets based on opposite expression patterns and concluding miRNA sponging by circRNA needs further evidence of direct interactions.</p>
<p>(2) The majority of the experiments were performed with an overexpression vector which can generate a lot of linear RNAs along with circRNAs. The linear RNAs produced by the overexpression vectors can have a similar effect to the circRNA due to sequence identity.</p>
<p>(3) There is a lack of data of circHMGCS1 silencing and its effect on target miRNA &amp; mRNAs.</p>
