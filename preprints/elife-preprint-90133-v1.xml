<title>Abstract</title>
<p>How our brain generates diverse neuron types that assemble into precise neural circuits remains unclear. Using <italic>Drosophila</italic> lamina neurons (L1-L5), we show that the homeodomain transcription factor (HDTF) Brain-specific homeobox (Bsh) is initiated in progenitors and maintained in L4/L5 neurons to adulthood. Bsh specifies L4/L5 fate by activating HDTFs Ap (L4) and Pdm3 (L5) and repressing the HDTF Zfh1 to prevent ectopic L1/L3 fate, thereby generating lamina neuronal diversity. Subsequently, Bsh and Ap function in a feed-forward loop within postmitotic L4 neurons to activate the synapse recognition molecule DIP-β, thereby specifying synaptic connectivity. Expression of a Bsh:Dam fusion specifically in L4 reveals Bsh binding to the <italic>DIP-β</italic> locus and candidate L4 functional identity genes. We propose that HDTFs function hierarchically to coordinate neuronal molecular identity, circuit formation, and function. Hierarchical HDTFs may represent a conserved mechanism for linking neuronal diversity to circuit assembly and function.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Our ability to perceive and respond to the world requires a diverse array of neuron types characterized initially by transcription factor (TF) combinatorial codes, followed by neuron type-specific functional attributes such as cell surface molecules, neurotransmitters, and ion channels. It has been well documented how initial neuronal diversity is generated: in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse, spatial and temporal factors act combinatorially to generate molecularly distinct newborn neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bayraktar and Doe, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Doe, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Erclik et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Holguera and Desplan, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Sen et al., 2019</xref>). Yet most spatial and temporal factors are only transiently present in newborn neurons, therefore another mechanism is required to bridge initial fate to mature features such as connectivity, neurotransmitters, and ion channels. It remains poorly understood how initial fate decision of newborn neurons leads to the functional identity of mature neurons. Work from the Hobert lab in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> found that each adult neuron type expresses a unique combination of HDTFs, which have been called terminal selectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hobert, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Reilly et al., 2020</xref>). Terminal selector HDTFs not only drive expression of neuron functional identity genes, but also activate pan-neuronal genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hobert, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Howell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kratsios et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Stefanakis et al., 2015</xref>). Loss of terminal selector HDTFs frequently results in altered neuronal identity and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arlotta and Hobert, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cros and Hobert, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Reilly et al., 2022</xref>). Although a great deal is known about HDTFs in the specification of neuron-type specific morphology and synaptic connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cubelos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">De Marco Garcia and Jessell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Friedrich et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hasegawa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Özel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sakkou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Santiago and Bashaw, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Thor and Thomas, 1997</xref>), little is known beyond <italic>C. elegans</italic> about whether these HDTFs couple initial neuronal fate decision to function identity features of mature neurons. Thus, while <italic>C. elegans</italic> provides a powerful model for understanding how molecular and functional neuronal diversity is generated, it remains unknown the extent to which this model is generalizable to other organisms. Here we use the <italic>Drosophila</italic> lamina, the first ganglion in the optic lobe, to test the hypothesis that HDTFs couple the initial fate decision to later circuit formation and functional aspects of the neuron.</p>
<p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> lamina has only five intrinsic neuron types (L1-L5), which are analogous to bipolar cells in the vertebrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sanes and Zipursky, 2010</xref>). During late larval and early pupal stages, lamina progenitor cells (LPCs) give rise to L1-L5 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fernandes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Huang et al., 1998</xref>). The core motion detection neurons L1-L3 receive direct synaptic inputs from photoreceptors and mediate visual motion detection, whereas L4 and L5 receive synaptic inputs from L2 and L1 respectively, and their function is currently unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Meinertzhagen and O’Neil, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Rivera-Alba et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Silies et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tuthill et al., 2013</xref>). The cell bodies of each lamina neuron type are localized in a layer-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Tan et al., 2015</xref>). L2/L3 cell bodies are intermingled in the most distal layer while L1, L4, and L5 form distinct layers progressively more proximal (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Each lamina neuron type expresses unique TF markers. L1, L2 and L3 neurons express Svp, Bab2 and Erm respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Tan et al., 2015</xref>). L4 and L5 neurons express the HDTFs Bsh/Ap and Bsh/Pdm3, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hasegawa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Tan et al., 2015</xref>). Work from Hasegawa et al has shown that in <italic>bsh</italic> mutants, L4 adopts L3-like morphology, L5 becomes glia, and Ap mRNA level is reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hasegawa et al., 2013</xref>). This suggests that the HDTF Bsh is important for L4/L5 neuron type specification.</p>

<p>Here, we focus on HDTF combinations Bsh/Ap in L4 and Bsh/Pdm3 in L5 neurons to elucidate whether and how HDTFs couple the specification of lamina neuronal diversity to synaptic connectivity. We ask: are Bsh, Ap and Pdm3 HDTFs maintained from progenitor to adult; is the early-expressed (primary) HDTF Bsh required for initial neuronal molecular identity; does it act via the later-expressed (secondary) HDTFs Ap and Pdm3; do primary and secondary HDTF Bsh and Ap drive expression of the synapse recognition molecule Dpr-interacting protein-β (DIP-β), which we previously showed to be required for proper connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Xu et al., 2019</xref>); does Bsh directly bind the <italic>DIP-β</italic> locus and other loci encoding proteins characteristic of L4 mature neuronal identity; and lastly, is Bsh required for normal visual behaviors?</p>

<title>Sequential expression of HDTFs during lamina neurogenesis</title>
<p>L4 and L5 neurons are generated by a subset of LPCs during late larval and early pupal stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fernandes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Huang et al., 1998</xref>), but it is unknown exactly when Bsh, Ap and Pdm3 are initially expressed. To address this question, we identified the Tailless (Tll) TF as a novel marker for LPCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-C</xref>). Indeed, Tll and the neuronal marker Elav have precise complementary high-level expression, validating Tll as an LPC marker (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-C</xref>, summarized in 1G). Importantly, we found that Bsh was first detected in a subset of Tll+ LPCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). These Bsh+ progenitors were adjacent to the Elav+Bsh+ neurons, suggesting that the Tll+Bsh+ LPCs differentiate into Elav+Bsh+ neurons, although we have not directly tracked their fate. In contrast, Ap and Pdm3 were first detected much later, in postmitotic L4 and L5 neurons respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-E</xref>). Ap and Pdm3 were never detected in LPCs or newborn L4 or L5 neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-E</xref>), showing that Bsh is expressed prior to Ap and Pdm3. Expression of Bsh, Ap and Pdm3 was maintained in L4/L5 neurons into the adult (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>), consistent with a potential role as terminal selectors in maintaining neuron identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Deneris and Hobert, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Serrano-Saiz et al., 2018</xref>). We conclude that Bsh expression is initiated in LPCs whereas Ap and Pdm3 are initiated in postmitotic neurons. Due to its earlier expression we refer to Bsh as a primary HDTF, and due to their later expression we refer to Ap and Pdm3 as secondary HDTFs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Bsh activates Ap/Pdm3 expression and specifies L4/L5 neuronal fate</title>
<p>Bsh is expressed prior to Ap and Pdm3, raising the possibility that Bsh activates Ap and Pdm3 expression. We used R27G05-Gal4 to express Bsh RNAi in LPCs. R27G05-Gal4 is expressed in all LPCs and turned off in lamina neurons, though the UAS-myristoylated-GFP reporter can be detected in the cell bodies of neurons until ∼66 hours after pupa formation (APF) (<xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). As expected, Bsh-knockdown (KD) eliminates Bsh expression in LPCs and newborn neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-F</xref>). Bsh remains undetectable in the lamina neurons in the adult, despite lack of RNAi expression, which indicates that Bsh expression is unable to reinitiate in neurons if lost in LPCs (<xref rid="figs2b" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A’-B’</xref>). Importantly, Bsh-KD resulted in nearly complete loss of Ap and Pdm3 expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G-J</xref>); these neurons are not dying, as the number of Elav+ neurons is unchanged (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K</xref>). Note that ectopic Ap expression in L5 is caused by the R27G05-Gal4 line, probably due to its genome insertion site, but this does not affect our conclusion that Bsh is required for Ap and Pdm3 expression. Consistent with the Bsh-KD phenotype, we found similar results using a Bsh Crispr/Cas9 knock out (KO) (<xref rid="figs2b" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E-I</xref>). Taken together, we conclude that the primary HDTF Bsh is required to drive expression of the secondary HDTFs Ap and Pdm3 and specify L4/L5 neuronal fate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2L</xref>).</p>

<p>To determine if Bsh is continuously required for Ap expression in L4, we used a Bsh Crispr/Cas9 knock out (Bsh-KO) to reduce Bsh expression beginning in postmitotic L4 neurons, which led to a decrease in Bsh+ neurons between 2d-3d APF (<xref rid="figs2c" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Despite the loss of Bsh expression in most L4 neurons, we observed no loss of Ap expression and no derepression of other lamina neuron markers (<xref rid="figs2d" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). These results show (a) that all known lamina neuron markers become independent of Bsh regulation in postmitotic neurons, and (b) that Ap may undergo positive autoregulation after its initiation, rendering it independent of Bsh. Autoregulation is a common feature of HDTFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Leyva-Díaz and Hobert, 2019</xref>). We conclude that Bsh is not required to maintain Ap expression or repress other lamina neuron markers in L4 postmitotic neurons.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Bsh suppresses L1/L3 neuronal fate</title>
<p>We next asked whether L4/L5 neurons are transformed into another neuronal type following Bsh-KD. Above we showed that the number of Elav+ lamina neurons remains unchanged in Bsh-KD, indicating that L4/L5 have assumed a different cell fate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K</xref>). To test for ectopic generation of another lamina neuron type, we assayed expression of Svp (L1), Bab2 (L2) and Erm (L3). We found that Bsh-KD led to ectopic expression of the L1 and L3 markers Svp and Erm in the positions normally occupied by L4/L5 cell bodies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-E</xref>). Notably, we never saw cell bodies co-expressing Erm and Svp, which indicates that the absence of Bsh generates ectopic L1 and L3 neuron fate but not a hybrid neuronal fate. In contrast, the L2 marker Bab2 was unaffected by Bsh-KD (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F-H</xref>). We conclude that the primary HDTF Bsh promotes L4/L5 fate and suppresses L1/L3 neuronal fate, thereby increasing lamina neuronal diversity.</p>

<p>Although we have shown that Bsh-KD generates L1/L3 neurons instead of L4/L5 neurons, it was not clear if this was a one-to-one switch, e.g. L4&gt;L3 and L5&gt;L1. To identify the neuronal fate generated at the expense of L5 fate following Bsh-KD, we used Bsh-LexA&gt;LexAop-GFP to label Bsh+ LPCs and L5 neurons (<xref rid="figs3a" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A-B”</xref>). We found that Bsh-KD generated GFP+ neurons (normally L5) that lacked the L5 marker Pdm3 and instead showed ectopic expression of the L1 marker Svp (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3I-L</xref>). Interestingly, some of the GFP+Svp+ neurons had cell bodies displaced from the L5 layer into the L1 layer (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>), which suggests that L1 neurons may actively seek out their appropriate settling layer. Furthermore, we also observed a transformation of L5 to L1 in neuronal morphology. In control, L5 neurons have very few dendrites in the lamina neuropil, whereas L1 neurons have bushy dendrites throughout the lamina (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3M</xref>, N). In contrast, Bsh-KD resulted in the transformed L5 neurons elaborating ectopic L1-like dendrite arbors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3O</xref>; summarized in 3P). Because Bsh-KD transforms L5 into L1 identity, the remaining neurons must show an L4 to L3 transformation. This is consistent with a previous report showing transformation of L4 to L3 morphology in <italic>bsh</italic> mutant clones, although unlike our results they observed an L5&gt;glial fate change using L5-Gal4 to trace L5 in <italic>bsh</italic> clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hasegawa et al., 2013</xref>). The difference in results (where we see L5&gt;L1 and they see L5&gt;glia) is likely due to the abnormal expression of L5-Gal4 in <italic>bsh</italic> mutants, since Bsh is required for L5 identity. Taken together, we conclude that Bsh is required to specify L4/L5 molecular and morphological identity, and to suppress L3/L1 molecular and morphological identity.</p>
<p>Bsh-KD in LPCs results in a loss of Ap expression and ectopic L1/L3 marker expression. To exclude the possibility that Bsh represses L1/L3 fate through Ap, we knocked down Ap expression from their time of birth using an LPC-Gal4 line. As expected, Ap-KD eliminates Ap in L4 neurons (<xref rid="figs3b" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, Ap remained undetectable in lamina neurons in the adult, which indicates that Ap expression is unlikely able to reinitiate if normal initiation is lost (<xref rid="figs3b" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Importantly, loss of Ap did not affect Bsh expression in L4, and did not lead to ectopic expression of other lamina neuron markers (<xref rid="figs3c" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Taken together, we conclude that Bsh but not Ap is required to repress L1/L3 lamina neuronal fate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3P</xref>).</p>

<title>Bsh represses Zfh1 to suppress L1/L3 neuronal fate</title>
<p>How does the primary HDTF Bsh repress L1 and L3 neuronal fates? Following Bsh-KD, the L1 marker Svp was not detected in LPCs, only appearing in postmitotic neurons (<xref rid="figs3a" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C-D</xref>’’’). This temporal delay in ectopic Svp expression suggests that Bsh acts through an intermediate to repress Svp and Erm expression. To find this intermediate TF, we screened published RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Tan et al., 2015</xref>) and found that the HDTF Zfh1 was present in all LPCs before becoming restricted to L1 and L3 neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-D</xref>). To determine if Zfh1 is required for L1 and L3 neuronal fate, we used RNAi to perform Zfh1-KD in LPCs. As expected, Zfh1-KD significantly decreased Zfh1 nuclear levels in all LPCs and neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D-E</xref>’’, <xref rid="figs4a" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-D</xref>), and resulted in a loss of Svp+ L1 and Erm+ L3 neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4D-F</xref>), consistent with a role in specifying L1 and L3 neuronal identity. In contrast, Zhf1-KD did not increase the total number of Ap/Pdm3+ neurons (<xref rid="figs4a" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E-G</xref>), showing that Zfh1 does not repress L4/L5 neuronal identity. We observed that Zfh1-KD resulted in fewer lamina neurons overall, including reduction of Bsh+ L4 and L5 neurons (<xref rid="figs4a" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E’-K</xref>), this suggests a potential role for Zfh1 in LPCs in regulating lamina neurogenesis. Importantly, Bsh-KD resulted in ectopic expression of Zfh1 in the L4/L5 cell body layers and in GFP+ neurons (normally L5) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4G-I</xref>, <xref rid="figs4a" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1L-N</xref>). We propose that Bsh and Zfh1 are both primary HDTFs (specifying L4/L5 and L1/L3, respectively) and that Bsh represses Zfh1 to suppress L1/L3 neuronal fate (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>).</p>

<p>In <italic>C. elegans,</italic> terminal selector genes show non-redundant control of neuronal identity genes and redundant control of pan-neuronal genes. To see if the same mechanism is used by the HDTF Bsh, we profiled Bsh direct targets with precise spatial and temporal control: only in L4 neurons at the time of synapse formation (46-76h APF).

<p>Next, we determined which Bsh-bound genomic targets showed enriched transcription in L4 neurons during synapse formation, using a recently published L4 scRNA sequencing data from the same stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jain et al., 2022a</xref>). There are 958 genes that are significantly transcribed in L4 at 48h or 60h APF. Among them, 421 genes show Bsh:Dam binding peaks while 537 genes do not show Bsh:Dam binding peaks (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Genes having Bsh:Dam binding peaks include numerous candidate L4 identity genes: ion channels, synaptic organizers, cytoskeleton regulators, synaptic recognition molecules, neuropeptide/receptor, neurotransmitter/receptor, and pan-neuronal genes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>, Supplementary File 1). Genes expressed in L4 but not having Bsh:Dam binding peaks include long non-coding RNA, mitochondrial genes, ribosomal protein, heat shock protein, ATP synthase and others (Supplementary File 2).</p>
<p>We previously showed that DIP-β, encoding a cell surface protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is specifically expressed in L4 neurites in the proximal lamina, and is required for proper L4 circuit formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Xu et al., 2019</xref>). Here we found Bsh binding peaks in L4 neurons within the first intron of the <italic>DIP-β</italic> gene (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Interestingly, the Ecdysone receptor (EcR), which controls the temporal expression of <italic>DIP-β</italic> in L4 neurons, also has a DNA-binding motif in the <italic>DIP-β</italic> first intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jain et al., 2022b</xref>), suggesting Bsh and the EcR pathway may cooperate to achieve the proper spatial (Bsh) and temporal (EcR) expression pattern of the DIP-β synapse recognition molecule. Taken together, consistent with the work of terminal selector in <italic>C. elegans,</italic> we found evidence that Bsh:Dam shows direct binding to L4 identity genes -- including <italic>DIP-β</italic> -- as well as pan-neuronal genes (summarized in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>).</p>
<p>Although our experiment focused on Bsh targets during the stages of synapse formation, we checked for Bsh binding at the HDTF loci that might be bound by Bsh during the earlier stages of neuronal identity specification. We found that Bsh:Dam showed a Bsh binding peak at the <italic>ap</italic> locus, suggesting that Bsh may redundantly maintain Ap expression in L4 neurons through the stage of synapse formation (along with potential Ap positive autoregulation) (<xref rid="figs5a" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>). In contrast, Bsh:Dam did not show binding peaks at <italic>pdm3</italic> or <italic>zfh1</italic> loci, which might be due to the inaccessibility of <italic>pdm3</italic> or <italic>zfh1</italic> loci. Indeed, Dam (open chromatin) does not show a peak at <italic>pdm3</italic> or z<italic>fh1</italic> loci, suggesting that <italic>pdm3</italic> or <italic>zfh1</italic> loci are not accessible in L4 neurons during synaptogenesis (<xref rid="figs5a" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p>

<title>Bsh and Ap form a coherent feed-forward loop to activate DIP-β</title>
<p>Here we ask whether Bsh or Ap are required for expression of DIP-β in L4 neurons.

Furthermore, using the STaR method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Xu et al., 2019</xref>) we found that L4 primary dendrite length and presynaptic Bruchpilot (Brp) puncta in the proximal lamina were both decreased following Bsh-KO (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6E-I</xref>); this is distinct from the DIP-β-KD phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Xu et al., 2019</xref>).

<p>To test whether Ap controls DIP-β expression in L4, we knocked down Ap using RNAi in all lamina neurons and observed a strong decrease in DIP-β levels in L4 neurons (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6J-M</xref>). We next combined the STaR method with Ap-shRNA, resulting in loss of Ap expression in L4 at 2d APF, and a strong decrease in DIP-β levels in L4 neurons (<xref rid="figs6a" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, Ap-KD in L4 neurons increased Brp puncta in the distal/proximal lamina and increased the length of L4 primary dendrites, which is similar to DIP-β-KD phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Xu et al., 2019</xref>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6N-R</xref>).

<title>Bsh is required for normal visual behavior</title>
<p>Bsh is required to specify L4/L5 neuronal fate and generate lamina neuronal diversity (L1-L3 &gt; L1-L5), raising the hypothesis that lack of Bsh may compromise lamina function. To test this, we used an apparatus (the Fly Vision Box) that integrates multiple assays including visual motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zhu et al., 2009</xref>), phototaxis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Benzer, 1967</xref>) and spectral preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gao et al., 2008</xref>) in flies walking in transparent tubes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>; see Methods). We used the LPC-specific driver R27G05-Gal4 to express Bsh RNAi in LPCs. We found that Bsh-KD in LPCs resulted in lack of Bsh in the adult lamina (<xref rid="figs7a" ref-type="fig">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Flies with Bsh-KD in LPCs, where L4/L5 neurons are transformed into L1/L3 neurons, showed a reduced response to a high-speed stimulus, suggesting weakened sensitivity to visual motion (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). Previous work found that L4 function is not required for motion detection when silencing L4 neuron activity alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Silies et al., 2013</xref>) which suggests that L4 and L5 acting together might be required for normal sensitivity to visual motion. When tested with both UV and green LEDs, the Bsh-KD flies had reduced phototaxis to both dim and bright lights, suggesting less sensitivity to both UV and green lights. Interestingly, the Bsh-KD flies exhibited larger responses towards bright UV illumination in the spectral preference assay (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7C</xref>, D). This apparent attraction to bright UV light may result from more weakened sensitivity to the green light, which may be expected since L4 and L5 are indirect R1-6 targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Takemura et al., 2015</xref>).

<p>HDTFs are evolutionarily conserved factors in specifying neuron-type specific structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hobert, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hobert and Kratsios, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kitt et al., 2022</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, some HDTFs function as terminal selectors, controlling the expression of all neuronal identity genes and diversifying neuronal subtypes, while other HDTFs act downstream of terminal selectors to activate a subset of identity genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gordon and Hobert, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hobert, 2016</xref>). Here, we show that the Bsh primary HDTF functions for L4/L5 fate specification by promoting expression of the Ap and Pdm3 secondary HDTFs and suppressing the HDTF Zfh1 to inhibit ectopic L1/L3 fate, thereby generating lamina neuronal diversity. In L4, Bsh and Ap act in a feed-forward loop to drive the expression of synapse recognition molecule DIP-β, thereby bridging neuronal fate decision to synaptic connectivity (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>). Our DamID data provides support for several hundred Bsh direct binding targets that also show enriched expression in L4 neurons; these Bsh targets include predicted and known L4 identity genes as well as pan-neuronal genes, similar to the regulatory logic first observed in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hobert, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Stefanakis et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). HDTFs are widely expressed in the nervous system in flies, worms, and mammals. By characterizing primary and secondary HDTFs according to their initiation order, we may decode conserved mechanisms for generating diverse neuron types with precise circuits assembly.</p>
<p>How can a single primary HDTF Bsh activate two different secondary HDTFs and specify two distinct neuron fates: L4 and L5 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>)? In our accompanying work we show that Notch signaling is activated in newborn L4 but not in L5. This is not due to an asymmetric partition of a Notch pathway component between sister neurons, as is common in most regions of the brain(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mark et al., 2021</xref>), but rather due to L4 being exposed to Delta ligand in the adjacent L1 neurons; L5 is not in contact with the Delta+ L1 neurons, and thus does not have active Notch signaling. We show that while Notch signaling and Bsh expression are mutually independent, Notch is necessary and sufficient for Bsh to specify L4 fate over L5. With Notch signaling, L4 generates a distinct open chromatin landscape which results in distinct Bsh genome-binding loci, leading to L4-specific gene transcription. We propose that Notch signaling and HDTF function are integrated to diversify neuronal types.</p>
<p>We used DamID (this work) and a scRNAseq dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jain et al., 2022a</xref>) to identify genomic loci containing both Bsh direct binding sites and L4-enriched expression. Genes that have Bsh:Dam binding peaks but are not detect in L4 scRNA sequencing data at 48h or 60h APF might be due to the following reasons: they are transcribed later, at 60h – 76h APF; the algorithm (find_peaks; peaks2genes) that we used to detect Bsh:Dam peaks and call the corresponding genes is not 100% accurate; some regulatory regions are outside the stringent +/-1 kb association with genes; Bsh may act as transcription repressor; TFs generally act combinatorially as opposed to alone and that many required specific cooperative partner TFs to also be bound at an enhancer for gene activation; and scRNAseq data is not 100% accurate for representing gene transcription (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, Supplementary File 3).</p>
<p>Does the primary HDTF Bsh control all L4 neuronal identity genes? It seems likely, as Bsh:Dam shows binding to L4-transcribed genes that could regulate L4 neuronal structure and function, including the functionally validated synapse recognition molecule DIP-β. Furthermore, we found Bsh and Ap form a feed-forward loop to control DIP-β expression in L4 neurons. Similarly, in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, terminal selectors UNC-86 and PAG-3 form a feed-forward loop with HDTF CEH-14 to control the expression of neuropeptide FLP-10, NLP-1 and NLP-15 in BDU neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gordon and Hobert, 2015</xref>), suggesting an evolutionarily conserved approach, using feed-forward loops, for terminal selectors to activate neuronal identity genes. An important future direction would be testing whether Bsh controls the expression of all L4 identity genes via acting with Ap in a feed-forward loop. One intriguing approach would be profiling the Ap genome-binding targets in L4 during synapse formation window and characterizing the unique and sharing genome-binding targets of Bsh and Ap in L4 neurons.</p>
<p>Evolution can drive a coordinated increase in neuronal diversity and functional complexity. We hypothesize that there was an evolutionary path promoting increased neuronal diversity by the addition of primary HDTF Bsh expression in lamina progenitors. This is based on our finding that the loss of a single HDTF (Bsh) results in reduced lamina neuron diversity (only L1-3) that may represent a simpler ancestral brain. A similar observation was described in <italic>C. elegans</italic> where loss of a single terminal selector caused two different neuron types to become identical, which was speculated to be the ancestral ground state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arlotta and Hobert, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cros and Hobert, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Reilly et al., 2022</xref>), suggesting phylogenetically conserved principles observed in highly distinct species. Future directions would be (1) to test whether evolutionarily primitive insects, such as silverfish(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Truman and Riddiford, 1999</xref>), lack Bsh expression and L4/L5 neurons, retaining only the core motion detection L1-L3 neurons; and (2) to determine whether all five lamina neurons or only L1-L3 are conserved as bipolar cells in the mouse retina. Our findings provide a testable model whereby neural circuits evolve more complexity by adding the expression of a primary HDTF (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>R27G05-GAL4 is turned on in all LPCs and turned off in lamina neurons.</title>
<p>(A-A’’’) R27G05-Gal4 drives GFP expression in all LPCs and lamina neurons (white dash circle) which are labeled by Dac at 96 hours after larval hatching (ALH). Hth labels LPCs next to lamina furrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Piñeiro et al., 2014</xref>). Here and below, scale bar, 10 µm.</p>
<p>(B, C) R27G05-Gal4 is turned off in lamina neurons. Activating R27G05-Gal4 at 29C at the beginning of wandering L3 for 20 hours (by inactivating Gal80ts) reveals continued expression of GFP; in contrast, activating R27G05-Gal4 at 29C at 1d APF for 20 hours reveals little GFP, showing that R27G05 is not expressed in pupal stages containing postmitotic lamina neurons. Genotype: R27G05-Gal4&gt;UAS-myrGFP, tubP-Gal80[ts].</p>
<p>(D, E) Although R27G05-Gal4 is turned off by 1d APF, GFP persists in lamina neuron cell bodies until 66h APF and in their neurites until 75h APF. Genotype: R27G05-Gal4&gt;UAS-myrGFP.</p>

<title>Knocking down HDTF in neurons</title>
<p>Genotype for knocking down Ap specifically in L4 neurons: 31C06-AD, 34G07-DBD&gt;UAS-RSR:PEST, 79C23-S-GS-RSRT-Stop-RSRT-smFP:V5-2a-GAL4, UAS-Ap-shRNA. The genetic element 79C23-S is a bacterial artificial chromosome that encodes the <italic>Brp</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). 31C06-AD, 34G07-DBD drives the expression of R recombinase (RSR) in L4 neurons and RSR removes the stop codon from 79C23-S-GS-RSRT-Stop-RSRT-smFP:V5-2a-GAL4. Therefore Brp:smFP:V5-2a-GAL4 is transcribed and translated in L4 neurons into two proteins, Brp:smFP:V5 and GAL4. GAL4 together with 31C06-AD, 34G07-DBD drives the expression of Ap-shRNA to knockdown Ap. There is no continuous Ap-shRNA expression when using 31C06-AD, 34G07-DBD to drive expression of Ap-shRNA directly because 31C06-AD, 34G07-DBD depends on Ap.</p>

The bedgraph files were used for data visualization on IGV (v.2.13.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Robinson et al., 2011</xref>). The Log2 ratio bedgraph files (Bsh:Dam/Dam) were used for calling Bsh peaks in L4 neurons using find_peaks (FDR&lt;0.01; min_quant=0.9) and the generated peak files were used for calling genes using peaks2genes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/owenjm/find_peaks">https://github.com/owenjm/find_peaks</ext-link>). The gene list of Bsh peaks (score&gt;2.5) in L4 neurons were then combined with L4 scRNAseq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jain et al., 2022a</xref>) (normalization number&gt;2). The bam files of Dam and Bsh:Dam were used to create sorted bam files and indexed bam files (bam.bai) using SAMtools (v1.15.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Li et al., 2009</xref>). Sorted bam files and indexed bam files were then computed using the multiBamSummary and plotCorrelation functions of deepTools (v3.5.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ramírez et al., 2016</xref>) for correlation coefficients between biological replicates.</p>

<title>Behavioral experiments</title>
<p>The Fly Vision Box apparatus was developed at the Janelia Research Campus as a high-throughput assay integrating several tests of visually guided behavior for flies in tubes. Groups of flies (usually 10-15) are placed in the clear acrylic tubes, inside a temperature-controlled box. The box contains 6 tubes, each with a strip of green LEDs (patterns of 4 pixels on / 4 pixels off moving at the indicated temporal frequency or contrast) lining one wall, for the motion vision experiments, and a single green and single UV LED on each end of each corridor, for the phototaxis and spectral-preference assays. During the spectral preference task, a green LED is illuminated (at level 10) at the end of each tube, while at the opposite end of the tubes a UV LED is illuminated at increasing brightness levels. The tubes are capped with a polished acrylic plug that is transparent. 4 small (pager) motors are mounted on the corners of the box to provide a mechanical startle in between trials. A camera mounted above the box records fly movements at 25 frames/s. The camera is fitted with an Infrared-passing filter and the tubes are suspended above an Infrared backlight.</p>
<p>In visual motion response assay, stimulus with different temporal frequency (0, 0.5, 2, 5, 10, 20, 42 HZ) or 5Hz temporal frequency, but with the indicated contrast level were given. The flies walk against the direction of motion, quantified with a Direction Index. The phototaxis behavior measures the movement of flies towards UV or green LED with the indicated (relative) intensity level at the end of the tubes. The Direction Index is shown integrated over each trial length. In spectral preference task, for lower UV levels, flies walk towards the green LED, but walk towards the UV LED at higher UV levels.</p>
<p>A full experiment lasts ∼30 minutes and consists of 44 conditions, presented in short blocks, during which a series of conditions (e.g. the 4 LED settings for the phototaxis assay) are presented twice (for Phototaxis) or 4 times each for the other tests, where on consecutive trials the stimulus is presented with opposite direction (for motion) or at the opposite ends of the tubes (for phototaxis and spectral preference). Each trial begins immediately after a 0.5 s mechanical startle by the motors. The box is heated to 34°C. The heating and motorized startle ensure that flies are active throughout and respond to these stimuli.</p>

<title>Quantification and Statistical Analysis for behavioral experiments</title>
<p>Videos are tracked offline with custom code written in MATLAB. After tracking, the trajectories were analyzed on a per-frame basis to see whether flies were walking in one direction (either following the moving patterns or walking towards one end-cap LED) or the other. The behavior is summarized as a ‘Direction Index’ which is simply the difference between flies walking in one direction and the other (by convention the direction against the motion, or towards the illuminated LED, is the positive one) divided by the total number of flies in the tube. For example, with 12 flies in a tube, during one frame, 7 are moving in the positive direction and 4 are moving in the negative direction (and 1 is not moving), then for this frame, DI = (7-4)/12 = 0.25.</p>
<p>For the summarized plots in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>, the Direction Index is averaged over the entire 10 second duration of each motion stimulus trial. For the phototaxis and spectral preference experiments, the DI is integrated (accumulated) across time and the data recorded for each trial is the peak (negative or positive) of this curve. For the 10 or 15 second trials, the maximum possible value is 10 or 15 (10, 15 s × 1). Individual data points in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> represent the mean or peak DI metric summarizing all the flies in each tube, and the summary data are the mean and standard deviation across tubes.</p>
<p>The data summarized are part of a larger series of experimental conditions that include several other tasks that are largely redundant with those presented. Nevertheless, the flies experienced 44 different conditions, and so all data were used for a False Discovery Rate controlling procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>)with q = 0.05. The data from conditions not shown do not contain additional tests with statistically significant differences between the 2 tested genotypes.</p>

<title>Quantification of DIP-β fluorescence signal</title>
<p>Using image J, we quantified DIP-β signal in control and knockdown brains by measuring fluorescence signal along the long axis of lamina cartridges (see white lines in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>) from the distal dash line to the proximal dash line (3 cartridges per brain). Signal intensity values and cartridge lengths were converted to percentages by setting the highest intensity within each cartridge as 100% intensity and the full length of the cartridge as 100% distance. Statistical analysis using unpaired t tests was performed after setting uniform intervals (using the spline function on MATLAB) of 0.01% distance. We presented 20-100% as 0-100% to focus on L4 signal (the first 20% is DIP-β signal in LaWF2).</p>

<title>Quantification of Brp puncta in the distal and proximal regions of lamina cartridges</title>
<p>Using confocal microscopy, we generated z-stacks of the lamina down the long axis of lamina cartridges. Within each z-stack (i.e. each optic lobe) 20 cartridges in the center of the lamina were identified and the number of Brp puncta in their distal halves was counted. The top (distal edge; top dash line in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>) and bottom (proximal edge; bottom dash line in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>)) of each cartridge was determined by the first section below L4 cell body and last section containing L4 neuron processes (myrtd::TOM), respectively. The midpoint of each cartridge was then identified as the section in between the top and bottom sections. Brp puncta were counted in the sections distal to the midpoint of each cartridge as distal Brp puncta and in the sections proximal to the midpoint of each cartridge as proximal Brp puncta. Genotypes were scored in a blind manner.</p>

<p>In this very strong and interesting paper the authors present a convincing series of experiments that reveal molecular mechanism of neuronal cell type diversification in the nervous system of Drosophila. The authors show that a homeodomain transcription factor, Bsh, fulfills several critical functions - repressing an alternative fate and inducing downstream homeodomain transcription factors with whom Bsh may collaborate to induce L4 and L5 fates (the author's accompanying paper reveals how Bsh can induce two distinct fates). The authors make elegant use of powerful genetic tools and an arsenal of satisfying cell identity markers.</p>
<p>I believe that this is an important study because it provides some fundamental insights into the conservation of neuronal diversification programs. It is very satisfying to see that similar organizational principles apply in different organisms to generate cell type diversity. The authors should also be commended for contextualizing their work very well, giving a broad, scholarly background to the problem of neuronal cell type diversification.</p>
<p>My one suggestion for the authors is to perhaps address in the Discussion (or experimentally address if they wish) how they reconcile that Bsh is on the one hand: (a) continuously expressed in L4/L4, (b) binding directly to a cohort of terminal effectors that are also continuously expressed but then, on the other hand, is not required for their maintaining L4 fate? A few questions: Is Bsh only NOT required for maintaining Ap expression or is it also NOT required for maintaining other terminal markers of L4? The former could be easily explained - Bsh simply kicks of Ap, Ap then autoregulates, but Bsh and Ap then continuously activate terminal effector genes. The second scenario would require a little more complex mechanism: Bsh binding of targets (with Notch) may open chromatin, but then once that's done, Bsh is no longer needed and Ap alone can continue to express genes. I feel that the authors should be at least discussing this. The postmitotic Bsh removal experiment in which they only checked Ap and depression of other markers is a little unsatisfying without further discussion (or experiments, such as testing terminal L4 markers). I hasten to add that this comment does not take away from my overall appreciation for the depth and quality of the data and the importance of their conclusions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this paper, the authors explore the role of the Homeodomain Transcription Factor Bsh in the specification of Lamina neuronal types in the optic lobe of Drosophila. Using the framework of terminal selector genes and compelling data, they investigate whether the same factor that establishes early cell identity is responsible for the acquisition of terminal features of the neuron (i.e., cell connectivity and synaptogenesis).</p>
<p>The authors convincingly describe the sequential expression and activity of Bsh, termed here as 'primary HDTF', and of Ap in L4 or Pdm3 in L5 as 'secondary HDTFs' during the specification of these two neurons. The study demonstrates the requirement of Bsh to activate either Ap and Pdm3, and therefore to generate the L4 and L5 fates. Moreover, the authors show that in the absence of Bsh, L4 and L5 fates are transformed into a L1 or L3-like fates.</p>
<p>Finally, the authors used DamID and Bsh:DamID to profile the open chromatin signature and the Bsh binding sites in L4 neurons at the synaptogenesis stage. This allows the identification of putative Bsh target genes in L4, many of which were also found to be upregulated in L4 in a previous single-cell transcriptomic analysis. Among these genes, the paper focuses on Dip-β, a known regulator of L4 connectivity. They demonstrate that both Bsh and Ap are required for Dip-β, forming a feed-forward loop. Indeed, the loss of Bsh causes abnormal L4 synaptogenesis and therefore defects in several visual behaviors.</p>
<p>The authors also propose the intriguing hypothesis that the expression of Bsh expanded the diversity of Lamina neurons from a 3 cell-type state to the current 5 cell-type state in the optic lobe.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, this work presents a beautiful practical example of the framework of terminal selectors: Bsh acts hierarchically with Ap or Pdm3 to establish the L4 or L5 cell fates and, at least in L4, participates in the expression of terminal features of the neuron (i.e., synaptogenesis through Dip-β regulation).</p>
<p>The hierarchical interactions among Bsh and the activation of Ap and Pdm3 expression in L4 and L5, respectively, are well established experimentally. Using different genetic drivers, the authors show a window of competence during L4 neuron specification during which Bsh activates Ap expression. Later, as the neuron matures, Ap becomes independent of Bsh. This allows the authors to propose a coherent and well-supported model in which Bsh acts as a 'primary' selector that activates the expression of L4-specific (Ap) and L5-specific (Pdm3) 'secondary' selector genes, that together establish neuronal fate.</p>
<p>Importantly, the authors describe a striking cell fate change when Bsh is knocked down from L4/L5 progenitor cells. In such cases, L1 and L3 neurons are generated at the expense of L4 and L5. The paper demonstrates that Bsh in L4/L5 represses Zfh1, which in turn acts as the primary selector for L1/L3 fates. These results point to a model where the acquisition of Bsh during evolution might have provided the grounds for the generation of new cell types, L4 and L5, expanding lamina neuronal diversity for a more refined visual behaviors in flies. This is an intriguing and novel hypothesis that should be tested from an evo-devo standpoint, for instance by identifying a species when L4 and L5 do not exist and/or Bsh is not expressed in L neurons.</p>
<p>To gain insight into how Bsh regulates neuronal fate and terminal features, the authors have profiled the open chromatin landscape and Bsh binding sites in L4 neurons at mid-pupation using the DamID technique. The paper describes a number of genes that have Bsh binding peaks in their regulatory regions and that are differentially expressed in L4 neurons, based on available scRNAseq data. Although the manuscript does not explore this candidate list in depth, many of these genes belong to classes that might explain terminal features of L4 neurons, such as neurotransmitter identity, neuropeptides or cytoskeletal regulators. Interestingly, one of these upregulated genes with a Bsh peak is Dip-β, an immunoglobulin superfamily protein that has been described by previous work from the author's lab to be relevant to establish L4 proper connectivity. This work proves that Bsh and Ap work in a feed-forward loop to regulate Dip-β expression, and therefore to establish normal L4 synapses. Furthermore, Bsh loss of function in L4 causes impairs visual behaviors.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>● The last paragraph of the introduction is written using rhetorical questions and does not read well. I suggest rewriting it in a more conventional direct style to improve readability.</p>
<p>● A significant concern is the way in which information is conveyed in the Figures. Throughout the paper, understanding of the experimental results is hindered by the lack of information in the Figure headers. Specifically, the genetic driver used for each panel should be adequately noted, together with the age of the brain and the experimental condition. For example, R27G05-Gal4 drives early expression in LPCs and L4/L5, while the 31C06-AD, 34G07-DBD Split-Gal4 combination drives expression in older L4 neurons, and the use of one or the other to drive Bsh-KD has dramatic differences in Ap expression. The indication of the driver used in each panel will facilitate the reader's grasp of the experimental results.</p>
<p>● Bsh role in L4/L5 cell fate:</p>
<p>
o It is not clear whether Tll+/Bsh+ LPCs are the precursors of L4/L5. Morphologically, these cells sit very close to L5, but are much more distant from L4.</p>
<p>
o Somatic CRISPR knockout of Bsh seems to have a weaker phenotype than the knockdown using RNAi. However, in several experiments down the line, the authors use CRISPR-KO rather than RNAi to knock down Bsh activity: it should be explained why the authors made this decision. Alternatively, a null mutant could be used to consolidate the loss of function phenotype, although this is not strictly necessary given that the RNAi is highly efficient and almost completely abolishes Bsh protein.</p>
<p>
o Line 102: Rephrase &quot;R27G05-Gal4 is expressed in all LPCs and turned off in lamina neurons&quot; to &quot;is turned off as lamina neurons mature&quot;, as it is kept on for a significant amount of time after the neurons have already been specified.</p>
<p>
o Line 121: &quot;(a) that all known lamina neuron markers become independent of Bsh regulation in neurons&quot; is not an accurate statement, as the markers tested were not shown to be dependent on Bsh in the first place.</p>
<p>
o Lines 129-134: Make explicit that the LPC-Gal4 was used in this experiment. This is especially important here, as these results are opposite to the Bsh Loss of Function in L4 neurons described in the previous section. This will help clarify the window of competence in which Bsh establishes L4/L5 neuronal identities through ap/pdm3 expression.</p>
<p>● DamID and Bsh binding profile:</p>
<p>
○ Figure 5 - figure supplement 1C-E: The genotype of the Control in (C) has to be described within the panel. As it is, it can be confused with a wild type brain, when it is in fact a Bsh-KO mutant.</p>
<p>
○ It Is not clear how L4-specific Differentially Expressed Genes were found. Are these genes DEG between Lamina neurons types, or are they upregulated genes with respect to all neuronal clusters? If the latter is the case, it could explain the discrepancy between scRNAseq DEGs and Bsh peaks in L4 neurons.</p>
<p>● Dip-β regulation:</p>
<p>
○ Line 234: It is not clear why CRISPR KO is used in this case, when Bsh-RNAi presents a stronger phenotype.</p>
<p>
○ Figure 6N-R shows results using LPC-Gal4. It is not clear why this driver was used, as it makes a less accurate comparison with the other panels in the figure, which use L4-Split-Gal4. This discrepancy should be acknowledged and explained, or the experiment repeated with L4-Split-Gal4&gt;Ap-RNAi.</p>
<p>
○ Line 271: It is also possible that L4 activity is dispensable for motion detection and only L5 is required.</p>
<p>● Discussion: It is necessary to de-emphasize the relevance of HDTFs, or at least acknowledge that other, non-homeodomain TFs, can act as selector genes to determine neuronal identity. By restricting the discussion to HDTFs, it is not mentioned that other classes of TFs could follow the same Primary-Secondary selector activation logic.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>In this very strong and interesting paper the authors present a convincing series of experiments that reveal molecular mechanism of neuronal cell type diversification in the nervous system of Drosophila. The authors show that a homeodomain transcription factor, Bsh, fulfills several critical functions - repressing an alternative fate and inducing downstream homeodomain transcription factors with whom Bsh may collaborate to induce L4 and L5 fates (the author's accompanying paper reveals how Bsh can induce two distinct fates). The authors make elegant use of powerful genetic tools and an arsenal of satisfying cell identity markers.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I believe that this is an important study because it provides some fundamental insights into the conservation of neuronal diversification programs. It is very satisfying to see that similar organizational principles apply in different organisms to generate cell type diversity. The authors should also be commended for contextualizing their work very well, giving a broad, scholarly background to the problem of neuronal cell type diversification.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>My one suggestion for the authors is to perhaps address in the Discussion (or experimentally address if they wish) how they reconcile that Bsh is on the one hand: (a) continuously expressed in L4/L4, (b) binding directly to a cohort of terminal effectors that are also continuously expressed but then, on the other hand, is not required for their maintaining L4 fate? A few questions: Is Bsh only NOT required for maintaining Ap expression or is it also NOT required for maintaining other terminal markers of L4? The former could be easily explained - Bsh simply kicks of Ap, Ap then autoregulates, but Bsh and Ap then continuously activate terminal effector genes. The second scenario would require a little more complex mechanism: Bsh binding of targets (with Notch) may open chromatin, but then once that's done, Bsh is no longer needed and Ap alone can continue to express genes. I feel that the authors should be at least discussing this. The postmitotic Bsh removal experiment in which they only checked Ap and depression of other markers is a little unsatisfying without further discussion (or experiments, such as testing terminal L4 markers). I hasten to add that this comment does not take away from my overall appreciation for the depth and quality of the data and the importance of their conclusions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Great suggestions, we will discuss these two hypotheses as requested.</p>
<p>Bsh initiates Ap expression in L4 neurons which then maintain Ap expression independently of Bsh expression, likely through Ap autoregulation. During the synaptogenesis window, Ap expression becomes independent from Bsh expression, but Bsh and Ap are both still required to activate the synapse recognition molecule DIP-beta. Additionally, Bsh also shows putative binding to other L4 identity genes, e.g., those required for neurotransmitter choice, and electrophysiological properties, suggesting Bsh may initiates L4 identity genes as a suite of genes. The mechanism of maintaining identity features (e.g., morphology, synaptic connectivity and functional properties) in the adult remains poorly understood. It is a great question whether primary HDTF Bsh maintains the expression of L4 identity genes in the adult. To test this, in our next project, we will specifically knock out Bsh in L4 neurons of the adult fly and examine the effect on L4 morphology, connectivity and function properties.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, the authors explore the role of the Homeodomain Transcription Factor Bsh in the specification of Lamina neuronal types in the optic lobe of Drosophila. Using the framework of terminal selector genes and compelling data, they investigate whether the same factor that establishes early cell identity is responsible for the acquisition of terminal features of the neuron (i.e., cell connectivity and synaptogenesis).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the positive words!</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors convincingly describe the sequential expression and activity of Bsh, termed here as 'primary HDTF', and of Ap in L4 or Pdm3 in L5 as 'secondary HDTFs' during the specification of these two neurons. The study demonstrates the requirement of Bsh to activate either Ap and Pdm3, and therefore to generate the L4 and L5 fates. Moreover, the authors show that in the absence of Bsh, L4 and L5 fates are transformed into a L1 or L3-like fates.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Finally, the authors used DamID and Bsh:DamID to profile the open chromatin signature and the Bsh binding sites in L4 neurons at the synaptogenesis stage. This allows the identification of putative Bsh target genes in L4, many of which were also found to be upregulated in L4 in a previous single-cell transcriptomic analysis. Among these genes, the paper focuses on Dip-β, a known regulator of L4 connectivity. They demonstrate that both Bsh and Ap are required for Dip-β, forming a feed-forward loop. Indeed, the loss of Bsh causes abnormal L4 synaptogenesis and therefore defects in several visual behaviors. The authors also propose the intriguing hypothesis that the expression of Bsh expanded the diversity of Lamina neurons from a 3 cell-type state to the current 5 cell-type state in the optic lobe.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the excellent summary of our findings!</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, this work presents a beautiful practical example of the framework of terminal selectors: Bsh acts hierarchically with Ap or Pdm3 to establish the L4 or L5 cell fates and, at least in L4, participates in the expression of terminal features of the neuron (i.e., synaptogenesis through Dip-β regulation).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The hierarchical interactions among Bsh and the activation of Ap and Pdm3 expression in L4 and L5, respectively, are well established experimentally. Using different genetic drivers, the authors show a window of competence during L4 neuron specification during which Bsh activates Ap expression. Later, as the neuron matures, Ap becomes independent of Bsh. This allows the authors to propose a coherent and well-supported model in which Bsh acts as a 'primary' selector that activates the expression of L4-specific (Ap) and L5-specific (Pdm3) 'secondary' selector genes, that together establish neuronal fate.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks again!</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Importantly, the authors describe a striking cell fate change when Bsh is knocked down from L4/L5 progenitor cells. In such cases, L1 and L3 neurons are generated at the expense of L4 and L5. The paper demonstrates that Bsh in L4/L5 represses Zfh1, which in turn acts as the primary selector for L1/L3 fates. These results point to a model where the acquisition of Bsh during evolution might have provided the grounds for the generation of new cell types, L4 and L5, expanding lamina neuronal diversity for a more refined visual behaviors in flies. This is an intriguing and novel hypothesis that should be tested from an evo-devo standpoint, for instance by identifying a species when L4 and L5 do not exist and/or Bsh is not expressed in L neurons.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the appreciation of our findings!</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>To gain insight into how Bsh regulates neuronal fate and terminal features, the authors have profiled the open chromatin landscape and Bsh binding sites in L4 neurons at mid-pupation using the DamID technique. The paper describes a number of genes that have Bsh binding peaks in their regulatory regions and that are differentially expressed in L4 neurons, based on available scRNAseq data. Although the manuscript does not explore this candidate list in depth, many of these genes belong to classes that might explain terminal features of L4 neurons, such as neurotransmitter identity, neuropeptides or cytoskeletal regulators. Interestingly, one of these upregulated genes with a Bsh peak is Dip-β, an immunoglobulin superfamily protein that has been described by previous work from the author's lab to be relevant to establish L4 proper connectivity. This work proves that Bsh and Ap work in a feed-forward loop to regulate Dip-β expression, and therefore to establish normal L4 synapses. Furthermore, Bsh loss of function in L4 causes impairs visual behaviors.</p>
