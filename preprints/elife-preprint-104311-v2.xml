<title>Abstract</title><p>Endogenous Retroviruses (ERVs) are integrated into the host DNA as result of ancient germ line infections, majorly by now extinct exogenous retroviruses. Accordingly, vertebrates’ genomes contain thousands of ERV copies, providing “fossil” records for the ancestral retroviral diversity and its evolution within the host. Like exogenous retroviruses, ERV proviral sequence consists of <italic>gag, pro-pol</italic>, and <italic>env</italic> genes flanked by long terminal repeats (LTRs). In particular, the characterization of <italic>env</italic> gene changes over time allows both to understand ERVs evolutionary trajectory and to infer their potential role in host physiology, including their pathological involvement. Despite their potential impact on the host, a detailed characterization has been performed for few domesticated <italic>env</italic> genes, while a comprehensive survey of their abundance and diversity among primates’ genomes is still lacking. The study primarily focused on ERVs’ <italic>env</italic> that are known to be present in hominoid species, given their well-characterized nature and availability in public databases. Hence using these <italic>env</italic> sequences, we reconstructed 32 Env sequences representing the prototypes of these ancestral proteins in Class I, Class II, and Class III HERVs. These reconstructed Envs were then used for similarity search, phylogenetic analysis, and examination of recombination events occurred within primates’ genomes that were applied to 55 primate species across the <italic>Catarrhini</italic> and <italic>Platyrrhini</italic> parvorders. Through such comprehensive pipeline, we reconstituted a phylogenetic distribution of ERV based specifically on the <italic>env</italic> genes, showing that the ERVs have been prevalent and widely distributed across the primate lineage. We observed for the first time the presence of the HML (human mouse mammary tumor virus-like) group in the <italic>Platyrrhini</italic> parvorder, indicating initiation of spread of HML supergroup before the split between New World Monkeys (NWM) and Old World Monkeys (OWM) i.e. even before 40 mya. Importantly, we confirmed interclass and intra-class <italic>env</italic> recombination events confirming the phenomenon of “<italic>env</italic> snatching” among primates’ ERVs. As a result, we demonstrate that tracing the diversity patterns of ERVs’ <italic>env</italic> provides relevant insights into the retroviral evolutionary history of ERVs in <italic>Catarrhini</italic> and <italic>Platyrrhini</italic> parvorders. Overall, our findings reveal that <italic>env</italic> recombination contributes to the diversification of ERVs, thereby broadening our comprehension of retroviral and primate evolution.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Retroviruses, discovered over a century ago, are a diverse group of animal viruses characterized by a common replication mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Mager &amp; Stoye, 2015</xref>). Their lifecycle involves reverse transcription of a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) into a double stranded DNA (dsDNA), which integrates into the host genome forming a provirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Mager &amp; Stoye, 2015</xref>). While the retroviruses circulating nowadays typically infect somatic cells, an abundance of ancient retroviruses have been able to integrate their genome into germline cells, becoming endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) and allowing their vertical transmission from one host to another through generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Sverdlov, 2000</xref>). Over the span of millions of years, thousands of ERV copies have been accumulated throughout the vertebrate lineage and can range from complete proviral structures to highly fragmented remnants of the provirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hayward, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Mager &amp; Stoye, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Weiss, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Likewise exogenous RVs, ERVs also consists of four major viral protein-coding genes i.e. <italic>gag, pro-pol</italic> and <italic>env</italic> flanked by identical long-terminal repeats (LTRs) at 5’ and 3’ ends of the provirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hayward, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Johnson, 2019</xref>). Among the four viral genes <italic>gag</italic> and <italic>pro</italic>-<italic>pol</italic> are well conserved across retroviral species while <italic>env</italic> is the most diverse, being responsible for the specific tropism of the infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Henzy &amp; Johnson, 2013</xref>). Given that the reverse transcriptase (RT) domain of the <italic>pol</italic> gene is a highly conserved region, it is widely used to infer phylogenetic relationships and to categorize retroviruses into distinct taxonomic lineages within the Retroviridae family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Henzy &amp; Johnson, 2013</xref>). Based on RT sequences, ERVs are classified into three main classes i.e. Class I (Gammaretroviruses and Epsilonretroviruses), Class II (related to Deltaretroviruses, Lentiviruses, Betaretroviruses, and Alpharetroviruses) and Class III (Spumaretroviruses) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Blomberg et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Gifford et al., 2018</xref>). Various phylogenetic relationships of ERVs are also based on the comparisons between RT and the transmembrane (TM) region of the <italic>env</italic> gene, however discrepancies may arise due to the diversity of the <italic>env</italic> gene among different ERVs of the same class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Blomberg et al., 2009</xref>). While the analysis of RT sequences identifies the evolutionary lineage that gives rise to a retroviral species, studying the <italic>env</italic> gene provides insights into the bases of such retroviral evolution, signaling the emergence of new viruses leading to cross species transmission.</p>
<p>The ERVs’ Envelope (Env) glycoprotein encoded by <italic>env</italic> gene consists of two main components, i.e. surface (SU) and transmembrane (TM) units, which includes some domains used for its characterization and phylogenetic analysis: the immunosuppressive domain (ISD), the fusion peptide (FP), the heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2), and the CX(6)C motif(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chabukswar et al., 2023</xref>). In addition, the most recent ERV group, the HML2, is divided into type I and type II due to the presence of alternative splicing variants of <italic>env</italic> thus producing Np9 (type I) and Rec (type II), differing in the presence and absence of a 292 nucleotide (nt) deletion in the <italic>env</italic> gene, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chabukswar et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Heyne et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Subramanian et al., 2011</xref>). The divergence in the <italic>env</italic> gene can be accounted by two main factors i.e. mutations and recombination. Mutations lead to modification in <italic>env</italic> nt sequence, whereas recombination events involve the transfer of <italic>env</italic> portions across viral genomes. Recombination occurs between viral genomes present in the same host cell as they exchange one or more genetic portion(s), potentially leading to the emergence of new viral strains and viruses, expansion of viral lineages, increase in their virulence and pathogenicity, and resistance to antiviral drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Pérez-Losada et al., 2015</xref>). A high degree of mosaicism in the <italic>env</italic> gene has been previously reported in the form of recombinations or secondary integrations, and tends to complicate the sequence-based HERV classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Vargiu et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, we previously observed the presence of recombinant forms of HML2 elements in Old World Monkeys (OWMs), specifically in <italic>Macaca mulatta</italic> and <italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chabukswar et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>The analysis of the patterns of <italic>env</italic> diversity is an essential step to better understand the evolution of ERVs and reconstruct the structure of the ancestral ERV viral genes, which in turn can help in various functional analysis of the correspondent ancestral proteins, as the changes in the genes overtime has affected their production and functions. Hence, in the present study we aimed to reconstruct the <italic>env</italic> gene from the different HERV groups by generating a representative collection of 32 full-length consensus Envs for Class I, Class II and Class III. These proteins were used for the screening of representative species of <italic>Catarrhini</italic> (<italic>Hominidae, Cercopithecinae</italic> and <italic>Colobinae</italic>) and <italic>Platyrrhini</italic> parvorders, identifying <italic>env</italic> genes and investigating their diversity by implementing a similarity search strategy, followed by the study of their phylogeny and recombination patterns. With this approach, we provided a comprehensive description of the ERV <italic>env</italic> diversity in 55 primates species, showing the presence of several class II ERVs in the <italic>Platyrrhini</italic> parvorder that have not been previously reported, and detailing the occurrence of events of interclass and intraclass <italic>env</italic> recombination that significantly expand our understanding of retroviral evolution.</p>

<title>Generation of Representative HERV Envelope protein sequences</title>
<p>The <italic>env</italic> consensus sequences that have been previously reported in <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> and Table 6 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Vargiu et al. 2016</xref> were collected and used as a query to extract the correspondent <italic>env</italic> genes for each HERV group from human genome (GRCh38/hg38) available on UCSC Genome Browser through the BLAT search function. To build these consensus sequences, we followed different approaches, we first extracted a total of 33 HERV elements that have been previously reported in Table 6 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Vargiu et al.2016</xref>, as the ones including the most intact <italic>env</italic> genes, belonging to the Class I groups HERV9, HERVFC, HERVH, HERVT, HERVW, HERVE, HERV3 and the Class II groups HML2 (18 out of 33 sequences), HML5, HML6, and HML8 For the other HERV groups not included in this list, we referred to the <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Vargiu et al., 2016</xref>, which provides a summary of 39 canonical HERV clades found in the human genome (GRCh37/hg19). More 190 sequences were extracted from the additional files of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Vargiu et al., 2016</xref> for which we generated a bed file and extracted them with the flanking of 200 nt at both 3’ and 5’ ends using the table browser tool in the genome browser (Supplementary file1 Sheet1 (S1)). These 190 sequences initially extracted were divided into canonical and non-canonical forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Vargiu et al., 2016</xref>) where canonical refers to sequences that are well-preserved and match the structural and functional features of complete <italic>env</italic> genes, and non-canonical refers to sequences with significant structural alterations or truncations that deviate from this typical form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Vargiu et al., 2016</xref>). These sequences were further aligned group-specifically, to understand if any of the sequence codes for complete Env proteins. Further, to select some sequences to be used as a reference, we extracted 19 consensus sequences from Dfam (both nt and aa), and 17 reported HERV-Env proteins from UniProt for which the accession numbers are provided in Supplementary file 1 Sheet2 (S2). The sequences used to perform alignments for each HERV group are described in detail in Supplementary file 1 Sheet3 (S3), which were then aligned to references sequences taken from Dfam, NCBI and UniProt sequences (Supplementary file 1 (S2)).</p>
<p>For each HERV group alignment, we translated the nt sequences in 3 forward frames to check the presence of stop codons using the Geneious software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.geneious.com">http://www.geneious.com</ext-link>). Furthermore, in order to reconstruct the Env proteins, we translated <italic>env</italic> nt sequence alignments into all three forward frames in Geneious to identify the translatable regions. The correct reading frame was identified according to the alignment and comparison with known Env domain and the high sequence similarity to the reference Env proteins taken from Dfam and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Vargiu et al., 2016</xref>. The insertions or deletions (indels) were retained in the initial alignment but were carefully managed during the reconstruction process. Regions with ambiguous or excessive indels that compromised the alignment integrity were further masked or excluded. The correct reading frame was further validated by identifying the conserved domains characteristic of Env proteins, such as signal peptide, SU, and TM domains using NCBI CD prediction tool. The frames lacking these hallmark features were excluded from the reconstruction process. The Env protein consensus sequences were generated for each group by realigning the extracted translated portions to the reference sequence to generate a complete representative Env sequence for each HERV group. These generated Env sequences were then aligned to the exogenous retroviruses of all classes. For this, we collected 52 envelope protein sequences from UniProt database that included different strains as well as subtypes of exogenous retroviruses from all the genera (i.e. alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, intermediate-Beta like, spuma and lentiviruses). The Uniprot accession numbers for the Envs of the exogenous retroviruses have been provided in Supplementary file 1 (S2).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>ERV Env Screening in Primate Genomes</title>
<p>The reconstructed HERV Env sequences were used as a query to analyze 55 primate genomes, including the representative species from both the <italic>Catarrhini</italic> (<italic>Hominidae, Cercopithecinae</italic> and <italic>Colobinae</italic> families<italic>)</italic> and <italic>Platyrrhini</italic> parvorders. All the genome assemblies were sourced from NCBI Assembly database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/</ext-link>). The screening of the genomes for the <italic>env</italic> sequences was done by performing the tBLASTn (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi">https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi</ext-link>) search for all the HERV groups separately. The tBLASTn algorithm uses amino acid sequences to compare the translated nt database in all six frames, and hence the nt hits obtained were further refined. The search parameters included a minimum sequence identity threshold of 40% and an E-value cutoff of 1E-5. Hits shorter than 40% of the complete <italic>env</italic> gene were excluded from further analysis. To ensure specificity, secondary integrations and repetitive elements were manually curated and removed. All the primate genome assemblies that were screened during the tBLASTn search are listed in the supplementary file 2 while the accession numbers for hits obtained for gamma-like, beta-like and spuma-like are available in the Supplementary phylogenetic <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figures 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, and 5.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Sequence Alignments and Phylogenetic Analysis</title>
<p>All the hits obtained from the tBLASTn search were filtered and were downloaded in fasta format. For each group, sequences whose length was less than 50% of the entire <italic>env</italic> gene were discarded. We then performed group specific nt sequence alignments using MAFFT algorithm of Geneious software. These alignments were further used to carry out phylogenetic analysis with the IQTREE software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iqtree.org/">http://www.iqtree.org/</ext-link>) for gamma-like, beta-like and spuma-like <italic>env</italic> nt sequences. The trees were inferred using maximum likelihood (ML) methods in IQ-TREE with a bootstrap of 1000 replicates. The trees generated were further visualized and annotated by the Figtree V1.4.3. software(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/">http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/</ext-link>).</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Detection of Recombination Events</title>
<p>After the phylogenetic analysis of gamma, beta and spuma-like ERVs, the recombination events were detected using RDP, Geneconv, Bootscan, Maxchi, Chimaera, Siscan and 3SEQ methods implemented in RDP4 software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://web.cbio.uct.ac.za/~darren/rdp.html">http://web.cbio.uct.ac.za/~darren/rdp.html</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Martin &amp; Rybicki, 2000</xref>). The default settings of the RDP4 software that were used are (i) only potential recombination events detected by four or more of the above-mentioned methods; (ii) sequences were treated as linear and (iii) window size of 30 variable nt positions used for the RDP method. The breakpoint positions and the recombinant sequences indicated for the potential recombination event were further confirmed through comparative genomics. The detected recombinant sequences were further used to perform BLAT search in the primate genomes available in UCSC Genome to confirm the position and location of recombinant sequence in the host genomes. To highlight the initiation of the recombination events, a phylogenetic tree of all the genomes of <italic>Catarrhini</italic> parvorder available on the genome browser was generated using the TimeTree server by simply uploading the list of primate species on the server. The tree reflects host phylogeny and was based on whole-genome sequences, except for Gorilla species, since the <italic>Gorilla gorilla gorilla</italic> genome was used to generate the primate phylogeny. We further annotated the events on the phylogenetic tree based on the genomes in which the recombinants were detected.</p>

<title>Reconstruction of the Retroviral Envelope from Human ERVs</title>
<p>To understand the ERVs evolutionary dynamics, reconstructing the ancestral ERV prototypes is a crucial step and requires to address two important issues i.e., the biases present in the ERV data used and the changes that had occurred after each single retrovirus was integrated into the host genome. With the purpose of providing prototype Env proteins for the different HERVs, we reconstructed the Env sequence of 32 HERV groups, including members of Class I (gamma- and epsilon-like, 20), II (beta-like, 10), and III (spuma-like, 2) (Table1, Supplementary file1(S4)). To ensure accuracy, all reconstructed sequences were manually curated to verify the presence of functional regions and sequence integrity. A schematic representation of the Env reconstruction process is shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

Second, we performed group specific alignments for all the ERV sequences with Mafft and further divided the sequences into subtypes based on the alignments, as in case of HERV3 and HML3. Then, we translated the nt sequences into three forward frames in the alignment and extracted only the translated portions that did not have any stop codons. Lastly, the extracted aa portions were aligned to the reference sequence of each group and hence, a reconstructed env sequence was generated for HERV groups as mentioned in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p></caption>

<p>Since the Env reconstruction was performed based on the data available for HERVs, to confirm the accuracy of reconstruction by its relatedness to the other RVs, we generated Env protein phylogeny of reconstructed Envs with 58 Env proteins of exogenous RVs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). As expected, we observed a class specific clustering of the reconstructed Envs with that of exogenous RVs, except for HERVS which was clustered with Class I RVs and not with the Class III RVs, indicating that HERVS has a Class I Env that is related to PRIMA41, PABL and HERV1_Artodact, as also previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Vargiu et al., 2016</xref>).</p>

<title>Distribution of ERVs in Primate Genomes</title>
<p>To track the spreading of the above HERV groups across primates’ evolution and evaluate their conservation, we used the above HERV Env consensus sequences to identify the <italic>env</italic> genes of class I, class II and class III ERVs through a group specific tBLASTn search in a the genome of 55 primate species. From the tBLASTn similarity search, we obtained 1374 hits for class I i.e. gamma-like <italic>env</italic>, 873 hits for class II i.e. beta-like <italic>env</italic> and 96 for class III i.e. spuma-like <italic>env</italic>. For all the three classes, we generated nt alignments and performed maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenies using IQTREE software with a bootstrap of 1000 replicates.</p>
<p>For the gamma-like <italic>env</italic> 1374 hits the best fit model generated for the phylogeny using the IQTREE was TVM+F+R4 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>, Supplementary file 3). The phylogenetic analysis revealed group-specific clustering of env genes, primarily within the HERVHF supergroup, which includes HERVH, HERVFA, HERVFB, and HERVFC. The HERVHF supergroup is believed to have integrated into the <italic>Catarrhini</italic> lineage around 30–45 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Li et al., 2022</xref>). Our study also observed a widespread distribution of this supergroup, with most occurrences in Hominidae genomes, followed by other species. (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>, Supplementary file 3). Similarly, we also observed a wide distribution of ERVT, ERVW, ERVE and ERVFRD followed by some small clusters of ERVH48, ERV9 and ERVIP. Additionally, we noticed distinct occurrences and clusters of HERV15, along with HERVR, ERVV1, ERVV2 and PABL, despite their exclusion from the blast analysis. Although HERV15, HERVR, ERVV1, ERVV2 and PABL were excluded from the primary Blast analysis, we observed distinct occurrence and clusters of these sequences in the subsequent phylogenetic analysis. This is likely because the Env consensus sequences, even though being group specific, share regions of homology with the excluded sequences. As a result, the consensus sequences effectively captured related members of the supergroup, even those not explicitly included in the initial dataset (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). Of note, the consistent group specific clustering of the reconstructed Env sequences observed in the phylogenetic trees supports the robustness of the consensus sequences in representing the broader supergroup.</p>

<p>Likewise, phylogenetic analysis was also performed for 873 beta-like <italic>env</italic> hits obtained from tBLASTn. The best fit model for the phylogeny obtained was TVM+F+I+R3, with the major grouping obtained for HML2, which was further divided into two subclusters corresponding to the presence of Np9 (type I) and Rec (type II) <italic>env</italic> splicing variants (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>, Supplementary file 4). The HML2 group is present in abundance followed by HML8 and HML10 while smaller clusters were observed for HML1, HML3, HML6 and HML9 (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>, Supplementary file 4). A very few sequences were obtained in the <italic>Callithrix jacchus</italic> that belong to <italic>Platyrrhini</italic> parvorder. In addition to the above clusters for HML2 Np9 and Rec, a third cluster of HML2 Rec included sequences that are annotated as ERVK-7, ERVK-19 and ERVK-25. The tBLASTn search for HML4 (HERVK-13) in the platyrrhini genomes, we obtained a fewer hits in <italic>Callithrix jacchus,</italic> and hence to confirm the presence of HML4 group in <italic>Callithrix jacchus</italic> and other Platyrrhini genomes we performed the BLAT search in two <italic>Platyrrhini</italic> genomes available on UCSC Genome Browser i.e. Marmoset (<italic>Callithrix jacchus</italic>; Callithrix_jacchus_cj1700_1.1/calJ) and Squirrel monkey (<italic>Saimiri boliviensis</italic>; Broad/saiBol1). We also performed the BLAT search for other HML supergroup members which have not been previously reported in the Platyrrhini parvorder.</p>
<p>From the BLAT search, we obtained 6 copies of HML2 annotated as HERVK in the squirrel monkey genome while no HML2 sequences were detected in <italic>Callithrix jacchus</italic> (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). We also identified the presence of other members of HERVK supergroup i.e. HML1, HML4, HML8, HML9 and HML10 in the squirrel monkey genome that has not been reported previously (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The sequences identified are in few cases full-length ERV copies while in most of the cases are of very short length or fragmented. These results indicates two possible hypotheses for the presence of HML1, HML2, HML4, HML8, HML9 and HML10 in squirrel money: either the onset of these HMLs began even before 30 mya i.e. before the split between NWM and OWM, that occurred around 43 mya or they got fixed in to the genome as a results of cross-species transmission of RVs after the split.</p>

<p>While performing tBLASTn search for both HERVL and HERVS, hits were mostly obtained for gamma-like ERVs, specifically for ERV3-1, ERVFC-1, ERVFRD and ERV-W. These results were in line with our previous studies which states that HERVL is more similar to ERV3-1 in hyrax, tenrec, armadillo, alligator and turtle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bénit et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cordonnier et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Vargiu et al., 2016</xref>). The hits were further refined by excluding all the gamma-like ERVs as well as refined by excluding short elements and removing the sequence of other repetitive elements acquired by secondary integrations. Hence, we obtained only 96 hits specific to HERVL and HERVS. An ML phylogenetic tree with the best fit model of K3Pu+F+R3 was generated with the bootstrap of 1000 replicates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>, Supplementary file 5). The phylogenetic analysis performed for these groups showed that a major distribution took place in <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> followed by <italic>Macaca mulatta</italic> and other primate genomes.</p>
<p>Apart from the group specific <italic>env</italic> clustering, we also observed some small clusters hinting towards the presence of recombinant ERVs, for example, the grouping of HML4 for <italic>Callithrix jacchus</italic> with HML2 in the beta-like <italic>env</italic> phylogeny.</p>

<title>Evidence of Recombination in the ERVs’ Env</title>
<p>An important factor for the diversity of the <italic>env</italic> gene are recombination events, since recombination is a ubiquitous process that may give rise to new variants of existing viruses, possibly also accounting for changes of the original tropism. Hence, we aimed to detect the potential recombination events in our gamma, beta and spuma-like <italic>env</italic> alignments. To this purpose, we used RDP4 software, which implements multiple built-in methods to detect recombination events, which are confirmed when four or more methods yield a positive signal. The software identified multiple recombination events in the gamma and beta alignment files generated in this study (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>). Since the spuma-like <italic>env</italic> alignment includes only two groups i.e. HERVL and HERVS, and no recombination among them was detected, the spuma-like <italic>env</italic> were aligned with gamma-like <italic>env,</italic> to check the presence of recombination among the two classes. The RDP4 software provides an overview of each recombination event, including the major parent (the sequence contributing the majority of the recombinant), the minor parent (the sequence contributing smaller portions to the recombinant), and the breakpoint position (the nt position where the recombination occurs). Using the detected recombination events and their specific breakpoint positions, we performed BLAT searches in the UCSC Genome Browser for all gamma-like, beta-like, and spuma-like <italic>envs</italic>. While performing the BLAT search, we considered all the primate genomes available in Genome Browser (n=15), also with the purpose of tracing back the initiation of these recombination events along primates’ evolution (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>). From the BLAT analysis of gamma-like, beta-like, and spuma-like <italic>env</italic> sequences, we observed a distinct <italic>env</italic>-LTR recombination pattern. In all cases, the minor parents identified by the RDP software were LTRs within the <italic>env</italic> sequences.</p>

<p>The recombination events detected in the gamma-like <italic>env</italic> alignment are ERVH-ERVE- MER11C, ERV15-LTR12, ERV15-MER11A, and PRIMA41-LTR5/LTR18. The first event was detected in ERVH, in which ERVE was present in the SU region while MER11C that is an LTR of HML8 group was present in the TM region of the <italic>env</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>). This event was only identified in 4 genomes (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, Supplementary file 6), suggesting a very recent occurrence (i.e. less than 9 mya) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>). In fact, the recombinant sequences were shared only between 4 species of <italic>Catarrhini</italic> parvorder and were absent in more distantly related primates (such as gibbons, orangutans, etc.). This observation, together with the presence of shared recombination sites, suggest that the insertion occurred after the divergence of these species, while its absence in others indicate that it is a recent recombination event. It can be said that this recombinant form of ERVH emerged possibly due to the co-packaging of ERVH, ERVE and HML8 and thus the recombinant form ERVH-ERVE-MER11C was fixed in the genome of human, chimpanzee, gorilla, and bonobo with the very few copies. Other recombination events were observed in ERV15 and PRIMA41, in which a LTR was detected in the TM region of the <italic>env</italic> gene. The ERV15-LTR12/MER11A was detected in 12 primate genomes while the PRIMA41-LTR15/LTR18 that involves the LTR of ERV15 and ERV3 groups, respectively, was observed in only 6 genomes (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>). Of note, these two events were present as a single copy in each genome in just one chromosome, as indicated in supplementary file 6. These single events might have occurred due to the template switching mechanism during the reverse transcription process and eventually were fixed in the chromosome.</p>
<p>Similar events were detected in beta-like <italic>env</italic> alignment, where the LTRs were detected in the TM region of the HML <italic>env</italic> gene. The events detected were HML10-LTR13, HML2-LTR13 and HML2-MER11A/MER11B (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>). Single chromosomal recombination event was detected for HML10-LTR13 and HML2-LTR13, where the presence of LTR13, which is the LTR of the HML4 group, was detected in the HML10 and HML2 <italic>env</italic> gene in 9 genomes (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>). Similar to ERV15, these events are also present as single copies in the primate genomes. Unlike the above mentioned single chromosomal recombination events, the HML2-MER11A/MER11B recombination event was found in high abundance in the genomes of species from the <italic>Cercopithecinae</italic> and <italic>Colobinae</italic> subfamilies. However, within the <italic>Hominidae</italic> family, this recombination was detected in only a single species, <italic>Nomascus leucogenys</italic>. Especially, abundant number of copies of this recombinant were detected in the two Macaque genomes i.e. <italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic> and <italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>. The HML8 group contains three types of LTR i.e. MER11A, MER11B and MER11C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Scognamiglio et al., 2023</xref>), of which the presence of MER11A in HML2 <italic>env</italic> was detected in <italic>Chlorosebus sabaeus, Macaca fascicularis, Macaca mulatta, Papio hamadryas, Nasalis larvatus</italic> and <italic>Rhinopithecus roxellana</italic> while MER11B was detected in <italic>Nomascus leucogenys, Chlorocebus sabaeus, and Macaca fascicularis</italic> (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>) suggesting that the HML2 template switching took place with two of the three above different variants of HML8. Since no evidence of this recombination event was found in most of the species of <italic>Hominidae</italic> except for <italic>Nomascus leucogenys,</italic> it is likely that it occurred after the split between <italic>Colobinae</italic> subfamily and <italic>Platyrrhini</italic>, simultaneously with the abundant spread of HML2. All the recombinations detected in the HML group are hypothesized to be emerged due to the template switching mechanism as in the gamma-like HERVs and hence were fixed in the primate genomes.</p>
<p>Lastly for the spuma-like <italic>env,</italic> we detected two recombination events for ERVL i.e. ERVL- MER11C and ERVL-LTR13 (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>). These two single chromosome recombination events were detected in six species genomes (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). As mentioned for all the above recombination events, ERVL seems to have also followed the same mechanism of template switching for both the LTRs.</p>
<p>Finally, to infer the functional effect of the presence of LTRs in the <italic>env</italic> region of ERVs, we performed the conserved domain (CD) search in NCBI. We first used the reconstructed Env to identify the domains present in the <italic>env</italic> and then performed the same search with the recombinant forms. In <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, all the CDs are listed, reporting their position in the <italic>env</italic> obtained from NCBI for the non-recombinant forms as well as their presence or absence in the recombinant forms. Of note, a consistent pattern of loss of CD is observed for the ERVs which have an LTR in the <italic>env</italic> gene. The domains are either completely absent or truncated due to the recombination with the LTR, leading to the loss of function in the corresponding protein. As shown in <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, the only domain identified for ERVH is TLV coat, but other domains have been identified for the recombinant form of ERVH-ERVE-MER11A suggesting an <italic>env</italic> acquisition event for the ERVH group by the co-packaging with ERVE. From the overall results, it seems that the LTRs of HML8 (MER11A, MER11B and MER11C) are the most frequently found in the <italic>env</italic> gene of different ERVs and are associated with recombination in primate genomes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>ERVs are “fossils” of the ancient exogenous RVs that have become extinct, that can still carry out certain functional roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Sverdlov, 2000</xref>). Indeed, the genomic integration of ERVs and its widespread dispersion has led to the domestication of some ERV proteins for useful functions. The best known examples of the conservation of an open reading frame (ORF) linked to the expression in appropriate tissue are syncytin-1 and syncytin-2 encoded by HERVW (ERVWE1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Blond et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Grandi &amp; Tramontano, 2017</xref>) and HERVFRD-1 (ERVFRD-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Rote et al., 2004</xref>), respectively. Another recurrent ERV domestication is aimed to its use as a restriction factor and interfering in steps of exogenous RV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Frank &amp; Feschotte, 2017</xref>). Available ERV Env studies are mostly focused on finding their possible role in physiological or pathological conditions, but limited studies have been performed to understand ERVs’ evolutionary dynamics. For this, a focus on how various factors may affect the Env divergence is required.</p>
<p>The initial step in understanding such ERVs evolutionary dynamics – which encompasses their origin, proliferation within the host genome, and the mechanisms of inactivation and elimination – is to precisely reconstruct their viral genes that can also be essential to define their host-virus interactions. In addition, understanding their residual functions can help both in elucidating their potential role in various pathological conditions, and allow their exploitation as antivirals, gene therapy vectors, etc. In this scenario, an Env reconstruction clearly aids in broadening the understanding and discovering of various aspects of currently existing ERVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Johnson, 2019</xref>). Hence, with the intention of studying the ERV Envs divergence, we firstly reconstructed 32 ancestral ERVs Env prototypes that can help in various functional analysis such as gene regulation and expression, pathogenicity, evolutionary dynamics, host-ERV interaction, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Johnson, 2019</xref>). The screening of 55 primate genomes in <italic>Catarrhini</italic> (<italic>Hominidae, Cercopithecinae, Colobinae</italic>) and <italic>Platyrrhini</italic> parvorders using the reconstructed Env sequences for each HERV class demonstrated that the majority of ERV <italic>env</italic> nt sequences hits are obtained in the <italic>Catarrhini</italic> parvorder specifically in Hominidae Superfamily. In the phylogenetic analyses performed for each Class, we observed a group-specific clustering of all the ERVs. Over time, the genomic persistence of ERVs has been accompanied by insertions, deletions, mutations, and even the loss of the <italic>env</italic> gene, all of which contribute to biases in their phylogenetic analyses. As a result, we report some mixed clustering among the ERV classes. Apart from the 17 gamma-like <italic>env</italic>, we also observe hits for ERV15, HERVR, ERVV1, ERVV2 and PABL <italic>env</italic> genes which were initially not included in the dataset, meaning that the generated consensus sequences represent very well the members of the same supergroup. Our investigation demonstrates that the superfamilies HERVHF and HERVW9 of gamma-like <italic>env</italic>, HML2 group of beta-like <italic>env</italic> integrated in the primate lineage over 30-45 mya, earlier than previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Li et al., 2022</xref>). In fact, several studies focused on the characterization and identification of HERVs in the primate genome - also reported the presence of the HML supergroup in the <italic>Catarrhini</italic> parvorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Grandi et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Scognamiglio et al., 2023</xref>) and by far HML5 has been known to be the most ancient member of the HERVK supergroup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Lavie et al., 2004</xref>), as its presence has been previously reported in marmoset and squirrel monkey. These reports indicate that their integration began after the split between <italic>Catarrhini</italic> and <italic>Platyrrhini</italic> i.e. ∼30 mya, as the HML sequences were not detected in <italic>Callithrix jacchus</italic> genome except for HML5. However, we identified the presence of members of HERVK supergroup i.e. HML1, HML2, HML4, HML8, HML9 and HML10 in the squirrel monkey genome that has never been previously reported, while no HML2 sequences were detected in <italic>Callithrix jacchus</italic> (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Thus, we show that the onset of integration of HML1, HML2, HML4, HML8, HML9 and HML10 initiated in the <italic>Platyrrhini</italic> even before 43 mya, possibly having a lower rate of amplification as they are less numerous in this parvorder, while they were spread more abundantly after the split of <italic>Catarrhini</italic> and <italic>Platyrrhini</italic>. Differently from gamma-like and beta-like ERVs, we detected only 96 hits for spuma-like <italic>env.</italic> the reason for such lower prevalence of spuma-like ERVs in the genome could be that they either less frequently integrate into the germ line or might have a shorter persistence in the genome as compared to gamma-like or beta-like ERVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hayward et al., 2015</xref>). Overall, the present phylogenomic approach suggests the widespread presence of the gamma ERVs, indicating that they may have been integrated in the host genomes through multiple sources, and demonstrates the onset of class II ERV even before the split between <italic>Catarrhini</italic> and <italic>Platyrrhini</italic> parvorders. A complex evolutionary trajectory as compared to the one of spuma-like ERVs.</p>
<p>Numerous studies have reported multiple recombination events in ERVs in the vertebrate lineage leading to several modifications throughout the endogenization process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chabukswar et al., 2023</xref>). Recombination mechanisms contributing to the observed variation in the ERVs primarily involve template switching during reverse transcription. Other processes, such as homologous recombination within the host genome, can also lead to the exchange of genetic material between ERVs. While cross-species transmission and <italic>env</italic> acquisition or degradation are critical processes in shaping ERV evolution and diversity, they are not direct mechanism of recombination but rather represent the outcome or influences on recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chabukswar et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Pérez-Losada et al., 2015</xref>). Such events can greatly increase the diversity among the ERVs and complicate their classification. Hence, to detect the presence of such recombination events in primates we performed recombination analysis and identified 8 potential recombination events i.e. ERVH-ERVE-MER11C, ERV-15-LTR12, ERV-15- MER11A, HML2-LTR13, HML2-MER11A, HML2-MER11B, HML10-LTR13, ERVL-MER11C and ERVL-LTR13 in gamma-like and beta-like and spuma-like <italic>env</italic> sequences (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). We confirmed these events using the genome assemblies available in Genome Browser, hence assuming the presence of these recombinants in the other primate genomes of the superfamily.</p>
<p>The potential mechanism due to which such events occur in the genomes is the co-packaging of two different ERVs or an ERV and an exogenous RV in a virus particle, followed by the template switch between the two genomes. In the template switching mechanism the two RV copies are co-packaged into the virus particle, and the template switch occurs as the RT dissociates from one template to another resulting in intermolecular i.e. homologous or nonhomologous recombination or intramolecular i.e. deletions or insertions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Delviks- Frankenberry et al., 2011</xref>). As in the case of the recombinants detected in the present study, a template switch could have occurred between the highly conserved TM region of the <italic>env</italic> of one ERV and the LTR of the other ERV due to sequence similarities, resulting in the observed recombination of an LTR inserted into the TM region of the <italic>env</italic> gene. According to the mechanism of template switching, the LTR found within the <italic>env</italic> gene has the features of a viral RNA genome LTR (i.e. not with the complete U5-R-U3 structure that characterizes the proviral ones), as indeed it is observed in the sequences. Additionally, it is possible that the observed recombinant events arose from the co-packaging from ERV and a related exogenous RV, especially if the latters were still actively circulating at the time when the events occurred. Such interactions could have facilitated inter-viral recombination, leading to the integration of recombinant sequences into the host genome. A prominent example of such event is the recombination between exogenous MuLv and its endogenous form leading to the generation of recombinant polytrophic MuLVs that utilize a different cell surface receptor for their entry, altering the host range and increasing their pathogenic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alamgir et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chabukswar et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Evans et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Williams et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>As in case of ERVH-ERVE-MER11C, ERVH seems to acquire the <italic>env</italic> gene of the ERVE group, leading to the generation of a recombinant ERV that retains the potentially coding ERVE Env, while for the rest of the recombinant sequences an LTR exchange with the TM region of the <italic>env gene</italic> is observed, eventually leading to loss of the <italic>env</italic> function, further promoting the intragenomic spreading of <italic>env</italic>-less ERVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Magiorkinis et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, such swapping of the <italic>env</italic> region can also possibly lead to the emergence of different variants of the existing RV, as in case of HML2-MER11A/MER11B, where it is predicted that different HML8 variants swapped their LTR with the TM region of the HML2 <italic>env</italic>, and thus spreading in abundance in the <italic>Cercopithecinae</italic> subfamily members and creating diversity in the HML2 group. The recombination between HML2-MER11A/B in the macaque genomes was previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chabukswar et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Williams et al., 2024</xref>), suggesting that the HML8 region appeared in HML2 <italic>env</italic> region due to the recombination between HML2 and HML8 virus due to co-packaging of HML2 and HML8 RNAs during the reverse transcription and has been experimentally verified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Williams et al., 2024</xref>. Similar to HML2-MER11A/B recombination, various recombinant events have been reported in this study for gamma-, beta- and spuma-like Envs, having the LTRs in the TM region of the <italic>env.</italic> Hence, as suggested, it is worth considering that these events can have implications in the biology of these viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Williams et al., 2024</xref>). These kind of events have also been previously reported for Harlequin which have a complicated structure of LTR2-HERVE- MER57I-LTR8-MER4I-HERVI-HERVE-LTR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Vargiu et al., 2016</xref>). The recombination events described in the present study provide more insights of the prevalence of recombinant ERV forms within the host genome, underlying the role of recombination as a driving force behind the ERVs diversification.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>ERVs are the remnants of ancestral exogenous RVs whose origin and diversity are still not completely understood and are a great tool to study the coevolution of host and RVs. The present study provides a phylogenomic perspective of the retroviral <italic>env</italic> gene diversity. With this study approach we provide the evidence for inter- as well as intra-group recombination events. Present results demonstrate the prevalence of ERVs across the primate lineage as well as the diversification of the retroviral Env through the process of recombination over the evolutionary timescale. Overall, this analysis gives further knowledge in studying the host- virus interactions on a larger scale.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Retroviruses have been endogenized into the genome of all vertebrate animals. The envelope protein of the virus is not well conserved and acquires many mutations hence can be used to monitor viral evolution. Since they are incorporated into the host genome, they also reflect the evolution of the hosts. In this manuscript the authors have focused their analyses to the env genes of endogenous retroviruses in primates. Important observations made include the extensive recombination events between these retroviruses that were previously unknown and the discovery of HML species in genomes prior to the splitting of old and new world monkeys.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>They explored a number of databases and made phylogenetic trees to look at the distribution of retroviral species in primates. The authors provide a strong rationale for their study design, they provide a clear description of the techniques and the bioinformatics tools used.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript is based on bioinformatics analyses only. The reference genomes do not reflect the polymorphisms in humans or other primate species. The analyses thus likely under estimate the amount of diversity in the retroviruses. Further experimental verification will be needed to confirm the observations.</p>
<p>Not sure which databases were used, but if not already analyzed, ERVmap.com and repeatmesker are ones that have many ERVs that are not present in the reference genomes. Also long range sequencing of the human genome has recently become available which may also be worth studying for this purpose.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>All comments have been adequately addressed.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>Chabukswar et al analysed endogenous retrovirus (ERV) Env variation in a set of primate genomes using consensus Env sequences from ERVs known to be present in hominoids using a Blast homology search with the aim of characterising env gene changes over time. The retrieved sequences were analysed phylogenetically, and showed that some of the integrations are LTR-env recombinants.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>The strength of the manuscript is that such an analysis has not been performed yet for the subset of ERV Env genes selected and most of the publicly available primate genomes.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the weaknesses of the manuscript outnumber its strengths. Especially the methods section does not contain sufficient information to appreciate or interpret the results. The results section contains methodological information that should be moved, while the presentation of the data is often substandard. For instance, the long lists of genomes in which a certain Env was found could better be shown in tables. Furthermore, there is no overview of the primate genomes Saili how did you answer to this?, or accession numbers, used. It is unclear whether the analyses, such as the phylogenetic trees, are based on nucleotide or amino acid sequences since this is not stated. tBLASTn was used in the homology searches, so one would suppose aa are retrieved. In the Discussion, both env (nt?) and Env (aa?) are used.</p>
<p>For the non-hominoids, genome assembly of publicly available sequences is not always optimal, and this may require Blasting a second genome from a species. Which should for instance be done for the HML2 sequences found in the Saimiri boliviensis genome, but not in the related Callithrix jacchus genome. Finally, the authors propose to analyse recombination in Env sequences but only retrieve env-LTR recombinant Envs, which should likely not have passed the quality check.</p>
<p>Since the Methods section does not contain sufficient information to understand or reproduce the results, while the Results are described in a messy way, it is unclear whether or not the aims have been achieved. I believe not, as characterisation of env gene changes over time is only shown for a few aberrant integrations containing part of the LTR in the env ORF.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the critiques of the manuscript and their constructive suggestions to improve the clarity, methodological rigor, and data presentation.</p>
<p>(1) The concern regarding the insufficient data in the methods has been resolved in the revised manuscript by adding a supplementary file that contains the genome assemblies that  were used to perform the tBLAStn analysis using the reconstructed Env sequences. The requested accession numbers are available for all sequences in the supplementary phylogenetic figures.</p>
<p>(2) We have also modified the manuscript by moving a portion of the results section in the methods section, in particular all the methodological description of the reconstruction of Env part (Line 197-231).</p>
<p>(3) As suggested, the long list of genomes mentioned in the results section in which the Env tBLASTn hits were obtained are now provided in the table form (Table 2) as an overall summary of the distribution of ERV Env in the genomes and the genome assemblies are mentioned in Supplementary file 2.</p>
<p>(4) As for the point regarding the tBLASTn usage in the homology searches, we first performed tBLASTn analysis using the reconstructed Env amino acid sequences as query and performed tBLASTn similarity search in the primate genomes. The tBLASTn algorithm uses the amino acid sequences to compare with the translated nucleotide database in all six frames and hence the hits obtained are nucleotide sequences (Line 381-383). These nt sequences were used for all the further analysis such as sequence alignment, phylogenetic analysis and recombination analysis. For better clarity, we have specified the use of <italic>env</italic> nt alignments in the methods section to avoid the raised confusion in the discussion.</p>
<p>(5) For the HML supergroup characterization in squirrel monkey genome <italic>(Saimiri boliviensis)</italic>, we used the tBLASTn hits obtained in the <italic>S. boliviensis</italic> from the initial analysis to perform the comparative genomics in two Platyrrhini genomes available on UCSC Genome browser. In particular, this analysis was performed to confirm the presence of specific members of HML supergroup in squirrel monkey genomes that has not been previously reported. We used the available genome assemblies because of the annotations available on Genome browser, and especially the possibility to use the repeatmasker tracks and the comparative genomics tools in order to use the human genome as a reference. We reported the coordinates for the members of HML supergroup that were retrieved through the comparative genomic assemblies by applying the repeat masker custom track, that have many ERVS that are not present in NCBI reference genomes.</p>
<p>(6) The concern regarding only retrieving env-LTR recombinant Envs has been addressed in the revised results section (Lines 747-758). As also mentioned in the methods section, the RDP software detects the recombinant sequences and a breakpoint position for the recombinant signals and hence we confirmed only those sequences that were predicted as potential recombinant sequences by the RDP software through comparative genomics. All the sequences predicted by the software were env-LTR recombinant and hence we confirmed and reported only those recombinant sequences in the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>The paper could be strengthened by:</p>
<p>- a rigorous rewriting and shortening of the manuscript, thereby eliminating all textbook-like paragraphs, and all biological misinterpretations and confusions. Distinguish between retroviral replication as an exogenous virus, and host genome remodeling affecting ERVs. Rewrite the sections on template switching by RT being the basis for the observed recombinations, while host genome recombinations are far more likely. ERVs with such aberrant env/LTR gene recombination are unlikely to be fit for cross-species transmission. Likely, such a recombinant was generated in a common ancestor. Also, host RNA polymerase II transcribes retroviral RNA (line 79), not RT.</p>
<p>- check lines 89-90 as pro is part of the pol gene in gamma- and lentiviruses.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion, we have revised the manuscript by shortening the introduction section and eliminating the textbook like paragraphs and also clarifying the recombination mechanism. We have revised the introduction section at Lines 102-111, and the clarification for the recombination mechanism is provided at lines 1668-1675</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- adding much more information to the Methods section. Such as which genomes were searched, were nt or aa have been retrieved and analysed, were multiple genomes of a species searched, a list of databases used ('various databases' in line 164 does not suffice), etc.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the observation. As mentioned above, in the revised manuscript we have provided more detailed methods by including a supplementary file for the genome assemblies used for tBLASTn analysis and comparative genomics. For the sequence alignment, phylogenetic analysis and recombination analysis we used nt sequences, as it is also mentioned in the revised version. Lastly, all the databases that were used and are mentioned in the methods section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- more information is needed on the alignments and phylogenetic trees. For instance, how were indels treated? How long were the alignments on average regarding informative sites?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the questions, to answer them we have added a paragraph (Lines 359-362) describing the reconstruction process in more details.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- confirm the findings about the presence or absence of an ERV, such as for the squirrel monkey genome, using additional genomes of the species</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As mentioned above, we only used the genome assemblies available on the genome browser because of the annotations available on Genome browser, blasting the second NCBI RefSeq genome using the BLAST algorithm does not provide accurate information and annotations compared to that of Genome browser and hence we reported the coordinates for the members of HML supergroup that were retrieved through the comparative genomic assemblies by applying the repeat masker custom track, that have many ERVS that are not present in NCBI reference genomes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- present the lists of findings in primate genomes on pages 9 and 10 in tables</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion, we have provided a new table (Table 2) in the revised version summarizing the ERV Env distribution results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- a significant limitation of the study is that only env ERVs found in hominoids have been searched in OWM and NWM, not ones specific for monkeys. This should be mentioned somewhere.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As the reviewer pointed out, the study was designed to explore ERVs’ Env  sequences in hominoids which were then searched in the OWM and NWM genomes, this is now better stated in the introduction at Lines 57-60.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- define abbreviations at first use (e.g. HML in abstract)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion, we have mentioned the abbreviations in the abstract, where we mentioned HML first (Line 65)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- explain 'pathological domestication' (line 42). Domestication implies usefulness to the host. And over time, deleterious insertions would have been likely purged from a population.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the observation, we have modified the sentence and provided a clearer explanation for the pathological and physiological consequences of ERVs’ env (lines 52-57).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Furthermore:</p>
<p>- why begin the discussion with a lengthy description of domestication and syncytins, which is not part of the current study?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the critique. Accordingly, we have now modified the discussion section by shortening the part about domestication of syncytins, and just mentioned them as an example at lines 942-944.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Chabukswar et al. describes a comprehensive attempt to identify and describe the diversity of retroviral envelope (env) gene sequences present in primate genomes in the form of ancient endogenous retrovirus (ERV) sequences.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The focus on env can be justified because of the role the Env proteins likely played in determining viral tropism and host range of the viruses that gave rise to the ERV insertions, and to a lesser extent, because of the potential for env ORFs to be coopted for cellular functions (in the rare cases where the ORF is still intact and capable of encoding a functional Env protein). In particular, these analyses can reveal the potential roles of recombination in giving rise to novel combinations of env sequences. The authors began by compiling env sequences from the human genome (from human endogenous retrovirus loci, or &quot;HERVs&quot;) to build consensus Env protein sequences, and then they use these as queries to screen other primate genomes for group-specific envs by tBLASTn. The &quot;groups&quot; referred to here are previously described, as unofficial classifications of endogenous retrovirus sequences into three very broad categories - Class I, Class II and Class III. These are not yet formally recognized in retroviral taxonomy, but they each comprise representatives of multiple genera, and so would fall somewhere between the Family and Genus levels. The retrieved sequences are subject to various analyses, most notably they are screened for evidence of recombination. The recombinant forms appear to include cases that were probably viral dead-ends (i.e. inactivating the env gene) even if they were propagated in the germline.</p>
<p>The availability of the consensus sequences (supplement) is also potentially useful to others working in this area.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The weaknesses are largely in presentation. Discussions of ERVs are always complicated by the lack of a formal and consistent nomenclature and the confusion between ERVs as loci and ERVs as indirect information about the viruses that produced them. For this reason, additional attention needs to be paid to precise wording in the text and/or the use of illustrative figures.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the general observation. We put additional attention to the wording in text/figures, and hope to have improved the manuscript clarity.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Reviewing the manuscript was a challenge because figures were difficult to read. As provided, the fonts were sometimes too small to read in a standard layout and had to be expanded on screen.</p>
<p>The tree in Figure 3 could also be made easier to read, for example if the authors collapsed related branches and gave the clusters a single, clear label (this is not necessary, just a suggestion) - especially if the supplementary trees have all the labelled branches for any readers who want specific details.</p>
<p>I also recommend asking a third party (perhaps a scientific colleague) with fluency in English grammar and familiarity with English scientific idiom to provide some editorial feedback on the text.</p>
<p>Figure 4 legend is confusing. From the description it sounds like the tree in 4B is a host phylogeny, but it's not clearly stated. And if so, how was the tree generated? Is it based on entire genomes? Include at least enough methodological detail or citations that someone could recreate it, if necessary. The details and how it was done should be briefly mentioned here and in detail in the Methods section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the observation. As for Figure 4 we have modified its legend and more clearly stated how the phylogenetic tree of the primate genomes was generated using TimeTree. We have also provided further details in the methods section (Lines 475-489).</p>
<p>As suggested we have revised English.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 42 - what is &quot;pathological domestication&quot;? It sounds like a contradiction in terms.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the observation. We have modifies the sentence and provided clearer explanation for the pathological and physiological consequences of ERVs’ env (lines 52-57).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Lines 166-167 - the authors use the word &quot;classes&quot; but then use a list of terms that correspond to genera within the Retroviridae. The authors should be cautious here, as &quot;class&quot; and &quot;genus&quot; are both official taxonomic terms with different meanings. Do they mean genus? Or, if a more informal term is needed, perhaps &quot;group&quot;?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the observation, the ERVs have been classified into three classes (Class I, II and III) based on the relatedness to the exogenous retroviruses <italic>Gammaretrovirus</italic>, <italic>Betaretrovirus</italic> and <italic>Spumaretrovirus</italic> genera respectively and hence have been mentioned in the manuscript as per the nomenclature proposed by Gifford et al., 2018 which has been cited at Lines 122-125.</p>

<p>Line 283-285 - this was confusing. How could the authors have noted distinct occurrences and clusters of these if they were excluded from the BLAST analysis?

Could this also then lead to false identification? Perhaps a few more words to explain should be added.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for the observation. While performing the tBlastn search we did obtain the hits for HERV15, HERVR, ERVV1, ERVV2 and PABL, and we have mentioned the detailed explanation about this observation in the revised manuscript at lines 619-627.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the observation. We have revised the explanation for the recombination events in the discussion section, as some parts of the results have been moved to discussion section (Lines 1058-1065)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Lines 369-372. It's not clear why this means the event was a &quot;very recent occurrence&quot;. Do the authors mean that there were shared integration sites between some of the species, and that these sites lacked the insertions in other species (e.g. gibbon, orangutan, monkeys)?</p>
<p>For the long section on recombination events involving an env sequence with an LTR in it, can the authors explain how they know when it's a recombination event versus integration of one provirus into another one, followed by recombination between LTRs to generate a solo-LTR?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the observation. Regarding the very recent occurrence of the recombination event, we have explained it in revised manuscript at lines 769-824 writing “In fact, the recombinant sequences were shared only between 4 species of <italic>Catarrhini</italic> parvorder and were absent in more distantly related primates (such as gibbons, orangutans, etc.). This with the presence of shared recombination sites suggests that the insertion occurred after the divergence of these species, while its absence in others indicate that it is a recombination event.”</p>
<p>For the observation regarding the env-LTR recombination events, the recombinants were first detected by the RDP software and were further validated through the BLAT search in the genomes available on genome browser. The explanation on how we obtained these env-LTR recombination events is now provided in lines 746-763 of the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Retroviruses have been endogenized into the genome of all vertebrate animals. The envelope protein of the virus is not well conserved and acquires many mutations hence can be used to monitor viral evolution. Since they are incorporated into the host genome, they also reflect the evolution of the hosts. In this manuscript the authors have focused their analyses on the env genes of endogenous retroviruses in primates. Important observations made include the extensive recombination events between these retroviruses that were previously unknown and the discovery of HML species in genomes prior to the splitting of old and new world monkeys.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>They explored a number of databases and made phylogenetic trees to look at the distribution of retroviral species in primates. The authors provide a strong rationale for their study design, they provide a clear description of the techniques and the bioinformatics tools used.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript is based on bioinformatics analyses only. The reference genomes do not reflect the polymorphisms in humans or other primate species. The analyses thus likely underestimates the amount of diversity in the retroviruses. Further experimental verification will be needed to confirm the observations.</p>
<p>Not sure which databases were used, but if not already analyzed, ERVmap.com and repeatmesker are ones that have many ERVs that are not present in the reference genomes. Also, long range sequencing of the human genome has recently become available which may also be worth studying for this purpose.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the observations and comments. We would like to clarify that the intent of the work was to perform bioinformatics analysis and so a wet lab experimental verification of the observations are out of the scope of the present manuscript. For the aim of the manuscript, we have used the NCBI reference genomes, while for the report of the coordinates of HML supergroup in the squirrel monkey genome and the coordinates of the recombination events through BLAT search we have used genomes assemblies available on Genome browser with repeat masker custom track, since it has well represented ERV annotations.</p>
<p>The suggestion regarding using long range sequencing of human genome is an interesting perspective and hence in the future work we will try to implement it in our analysis as well as perform an experimental verification, since, again, the focus of the present work does not include wet experimental part.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>In a few places the term HERV has been used when describing ERVs in non-human primates. This needs to be corrected.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the observation. We have checked and accordingly modified the terms in the manuscript wherever necessary.</p>
