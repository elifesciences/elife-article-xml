<title>Abstract</title><p>Neural network architecture determines its functional output. However, the detailed mechanisms are not well characterized. In this study, we focused on the neural network architectures of male and hermaphrodite C. elegans and the association with sexually dimorphic behaviors. We applied graph theory and computational neuroscience methods to systematically discern the features of these two neural networks. Our findings revealed that a small percentage of sexual-specific neurons exerted dominance throughout the entire male neural net-work, suggesting male’s prioritized sexual-related behavior outputs. Based on the structural and dynamical characteristics of two complete neural networks, sub-networks containing sex-specific neurons and their immediate neighbors, or sub-networks exclusively comprising sex-shared neurons, we predicted dimorphic behavioral outcomes for males and hermaphrodites. To verify the prediction, we performed behavioral and calcium imaging experiments and dissected a circuit that is specific for the increased spontaneous local search in males for mate-searching. Our research sheds light on the neural circuits that underlie sexually dimorphic behaviors in C. elegans, and provides significant insights into the inter-connected relationship between network architecture and functional outcomes at the whole-brain level.</p>

<label>1</label><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The concept that neural network architecture plays a crucial role in determining func-tional output has gained widespread acceptance in the neuroscience field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>], and it has also been applied in artificial intelligence, where optimizing network performance involves modifying the network architecture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. The same number of neurons form specialized architectures that may result in distinct functions, e.g., neurons may exe-cute continuous topographic mapping in vision system or discrete parallel processing in olfactory circuit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. The convergent-divergent feature in the Drosophila olfactory circuit facilitates a wide range of odor representations and supports olfactory mem-ory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. The modified characteristics of the engram cell at both cellular and circuitry levels elucidate the underlying mechanisms of learning and memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], e.g., AMPA receptors recycling on the membrane mediates the synaptic strength to regulate memory formation and forgetting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. However, due to the absence of connectome data, limited research has been directed towards exploring the relation-ship between neural network architecture and the behavioral functional output at the whole-brain level.</p>
<p>Sexually dimorphic behavior provides an intriguing platform to study the rela-tionship between neural network architectures and behavioral outcomes. Sexually dimorphic behaviors are generally categorized into two types: those with qualitative differences, observed in only one sex, and those with quantitative differences, displayed by both sexes but at varying levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Some animals exhibit sex-specific behaviors. For example, male satin bowerbirds construct intricate bowers and engage in elabo-rate courtship displays nearby to attract females. The female assesses the quality of the bower and the male’s performance for mate selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Studies have discovered the molecular and circuitry mechanisms of sex-specific behaviors in some cases. For instance, the male-specific isoform of Fruitless, Fru(M), in Drosophila plays an essential role in regulating male courtship behavior. Interestingly, females expressing Fru(M) also exhibit courtship behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Male-specific P1 interneuron drives male courtship initiation and motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Pregnant female mice actively participate in nesting behaviors to create a suitable environment for offspring. Using brain-wide immediate early gene mapping, Topilko et al discovered that the Edinger-Westphal (EW) nucleus plays an important role in regulating nesting behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Males tend to exhibit more frequent or intense aggressive behaviors than females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. However, reproductive state significantly influences female attack behavior, as evidenced by lac-tating female mice displaying maternal aggressiveness to protect the offspring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. The male aggression is mediated by the progesterone receptor (PR) expressing neu-rons located in the ventromedial hypothalamus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], and artificially activation of these neurons triggers male aggression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Estrogen receptor-<italic>α</italic> (Esr1) positive neurons in female ventromedial hypothalamus are essential for lactation-related aggression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>].</p>
<p>C. elegans has two sexes, male and hermaphrodite. Numerous studies have unveiled sexual dimorphism at gene expression, neural circuity and behavioral lev-els [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Males are attracted to hermaphrodite pheromones, through dimorphic expression of pheromone receptors in male-specific neurons and some sex-shared sensory neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. Male C. elegans exhibit faster movement, potentially due to mechanisms at the interneuron level or neuromuscular junction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. Cook et al. reconstructed the neural networks of male and hermaphrodite C. elegans by compiling serial images acquired through electron microscopy. They iden-tified 302 neurons in hermaphrodite and 385 neurons in male, along with their synaptic connections, including chemical and electrical synapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. These two networks serve as the foundation for understanding behavioral dimorphism at the whole brain level. In this study, we generated the functional neural networks of male and hermaphrodite C. elegans by merging neurons with the same function. Using graph theory and computa-tional neuroscience methods, we systematically analyzed the structural and dynamical differences between these two neural networks. We identified circuitry mechanisms underlying the role of sex-specific neurons in the male neural network and predicted sexually dimorphic behaviors based on these structural and dynamical differences. Our predictions were validated by discovering a circuit with sex-shared neurons and dimorphic connections responsible for enhanced local search behavior in males. This study provides evidence for the significant role of neural network architecture and the circuitry bases of dimorphic behaviors.</p>

<label>2.1</label><title>Structural characteristics of functional neural networks in male and hermaphrodite C. elegans</title>
<p>We employed network science methods to systematically analyze the structural fea-tures of male and hermaphrodite neural networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. In order to simplify network size to emphasize the functional connectivity, we merged neurons with similar func-tions into singular node. For instance, neurons ADAL (ADA Left) and ADAR (ADA Right) were consolidated as node ADA, and their total synaptic connections were inte-grated as the connections of ADA. Neurons with diverse functions were maintained as separate nodes, such as ASEL and ASER. We generated two simplified functional neural networks: the male neural network that comprises 161 neuron nodes and the hermaphrodite neural network that is composed of 122 nodes (Supplementary figure 1, Supplementary table 1). In Supplementary figure 1, synaptic connections between neurons are denoted by clockwise lines. The line width corresponds to the synapse number, which is the sum of chemical synapses and electrical synapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. Given that chemical synapses are one-directional while electrical synapses are two-directional, we considered that one electrical synapse between two neurons is equivalent to two recip-rocal chemical synapses to generate the connection matrix (Supplementary table 1). We found that 120 nodes are shared in these two neural networks (Supplementary figure 2), suggesting the dimorphic behaviors are largely mediated by male-specific neurons or synaptic connection differences among sex-shared neurons.</p>
<p>Given the directional nature and variable synapse numbers of the synaptic connections, we abstracted these neural networks as two directed-weighted graphs (Supplementary figure 1). We used graph theory methods designed for directed-weighted graphs to facilitate feature detection in both the male and hermaphrodite neural networks. One obvious observation is that the absence of connections between pharyngeal neurons and other neurons in the male neural network (Supplementary figure 1), suggesting a relatively independent functionality of pharyngeal neurons in males, though several studies imply the non-synaptic communications in C. elegans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>].</p>
<p>The node strength measures how strongly a node directly possesses with other nodes in the network. We calculated the node strength for each node and revealed that the distribution of node strengths in both hermaphrodite and male networks follow an exponential distribution (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Overall, neurons in the male network exhibit a larger node strength (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Comparing the node strengths of sex-specific neurons and sex-shared neurons, we found that the increased node strengths of sex-specific neurons in the male neural network, but not in the hermaphrodite network (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>), indicating the stronger connections of sex-specific neurons in the male neural network. A substantial node strength indicates a neuron’s potential to exert dominance in shaping behavioral outputs. By classifying behavioral outputs of the top 20 neurons based on node strength, we predict enhanced mating and suppressed locomotion and chemotaxis behaviors in males (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Several sex-shared neurons are in the top 20 list in both neural networks, including AVA, ALA and RIA, highlighting their important roles in both sexes (Supplementary table 2).</p>

<p>We further analyzed the node strength by dividing it into node out-strength and in-strength, representing the synaptic outputs or inputs of individual neurons, respec-tively. Both out-strength and in-strength exhibit an exponential distribution (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1J</xref>). It is observed that neurons in males have stronger out-strength compared to those in hermaphrodites, particularly for male-specific neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1G-I</xref>). Interestingly, although the overall in-strength in both male and hermaphrodite neural networks is similar (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1K</xref>), the analysis shows a difference in how sex-specific and sex-shared neurons receive inputs. Male-specific neurons receive more substantial input signals compared to sex-shared neurons in males (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1L</xref>), suggesting a height-ened sensitivity or importance in processing inputs related to sex-specific behaviors in males. In contrast, female-specific neurons in hermaphrodites exhibit the pattern of decreased in-strength (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1M</xref>), highlighting a sex-dependent variation in neural network architecture and function.</p>
<p>The node strength takes into account the total synapse number of individual neurons, regardless the number of connections with other neurons. Next, we calcu-lated edge weight that is defined by assigning a number to each edge, representing the synapse number of the individual connection between two neurons. Our analy-sis indicated that, on average, male neural networks tend to have larger edge weights compared to hermaphrodite networks (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1N</xref>). This suggests that the male net-work may have stronger synaptic connections per connection on average. A closer look at the edge weights of sex-specific and sex-shared neuron-related edges reveals a nuanced picture. In males, the edge weights associated with sex-specific neurons are comparable to those associated with sex-shared neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1O</xref>). This indicates a uniformity in how connections are established within the male neural network, regard-less of whether the neurons are involved in sex-specific or shared functions. However, in hermaphrodites, the edge weights of sex-specific neurons are significantly smaller than those of sex-shared neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1P</xref>), suggesting that synaptic connections in the hermaphrodite network may be organized differently, with decreased modification of sexual-related behaviors.</p>
<p>Focusing on the top edge weights in the male neural network, we found that the consistent high weights of ALA-related edges in both sexes underscore the impor-tance of ALA-mediated harsh touch escape behavior for individuals of both males and hermaphrodites (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1N</xref> and Supplementary figure 3). However, in males, the weights of edges associated with AVA and RIA are notably higher (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1N</xref> and Supplementary figure 3), indicating the increased AVA-or RIA-mediated behaviors in males.</p>
<p>In graph theory, the shortest path problem involves finding a path between two nodes in a graph that minimizes the sum of the weights. For a neural network repre-sented as a graph, the shortest path between two neurons can provide insight into the functional correlation between them, especially when they are not directly connected. A shorter shortest path in the male neural network suggests a more cohesive inter-connection of functional relationships among neurons in males (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1Q</xref>). When comparing the shortest paths between two sex-shared neurons or those involving at least one sex-specific neuron, it is observed that the latter shows a tighter connection in males compared to hermaphrodites (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1R</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1S</xref>).</p>
<p>Betweenness centrality in a graph measures the number of shortest paths that pass through a particular node, thus highlighting the key functional nodes within the network. The top betweenness centrality of AVA in both male and hermaphrodite networks (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1T-V</xref>) underscores the critical role of AVA in both sexes. By exam-ining the top 20 neurons ranked by betweenness centrality, we infer that males exhibit enhanced mechanosensation, mate-searching, and mating behaviors (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1W</xref>). These predictions are based on the understanding that nodes with high between-ness centrality are often involved in a significant number of shortest paths, indicating that they are integral to the network’s function and connectivity. AVA, in partic-ular, may be central to various behaviors and processes, including mechanosensory responses and social interactions such as mate-searching and mating.</p>
<p>Acknowledging the crucial influence of sex-specific neurons and their interactions in driving behaviors unique to each sex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>], we generated the sex-specific sub-neural networks that include the sex-specific neurons along with their directed-connected sex-shared neurons. This approach allows us to delve into the intrinsic properties of neural networks that exhibit sexual dimorphism (Supplementary figure 4).</p>
<p>Our analysis of sex-specific sub-neural networks has revealed that they share simi-lar characteristics with their respective entire neural networks. Node strengths, which include total node strength, node out-strength, and node in-strength, are found to fol-low exponential distributions within these sex-specific sub-networks for both males and hermaphrodites (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A</xref>, 2E, and 2I). In males, the sex-specific sub-neural network exhibits enhanced node strengths when compared to the hermaphrodite’s, indicating a more robust connectivity within the male network (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). And the male sex-specific neurons reveal larger total node strengths and node out-strengths (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>), while the node in-strengths remain similar to those of hermaphrodites (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K</xref>). In contrast, hermaphrodites show no significant difference in total strengths, out-strengths, and in-strengths between sex-specific neurons and sex-shared neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2D</xref>, 2H, and 2L). The large edge weights and short length of the shortest path within the male sex-specific sub-neural network suggest a tighter functional con-nection, indicative of a more integrated network (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2M-R</xref>). Specifically, the top edge weights of AIY→RIA and RIA→RMD DV in the male sub-neural network, along with the role of RIA in sensorimotor integration for olfactory steering, suggest that this AIY→RIA→RMD DV circuit plays a significant role in mediating chemotaxis-related behaviors in males (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2M</xref>). Additionally, the high betweenness centrality of AVA and the top edge weights of AVA→DA and AVA→VA within the male sub-neural network point to AVA’s regulatory role in locomotion, which is essential for male’s sex-related behaviors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2M</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2S</xref>). These findings underscore the importance of understanding the connectivity and functional roles of neurons within sex-specific neural networks and how these factors contribute to the manifestation of sex-specific behaviors.</p>

<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that sex-shared neurons can form dimorphic circuits that are responsible for mediating behaviors that vary between males and hermaphrodites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. Therefore, we generated the sex-shared sub-neural net-works containing sex-shared neurons and the connections among them (Supplementary figure 5) and analyzed the characteristics of these sex-shared sub-neural networks for both sexes.</p>
<p>Interestingly, our findings indicate that sex-shared sub-neural networks display distinct features when compared to the complete neural networks. Both of these sub-networks exhibit node strengths that follow a similar exponential distribution (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref>, 3B, 3D, 3E, 3G, and 3H). To quantify the differences in node strength between two sexes, we calculated the node strength difference for each neuron, defined as the node strength of the male neuron minus that of the hermaphrodite neuron (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3C</xref>, 3F, and 3I). Significantly, some neurons show an increase in node strength in males, including the commander neuron AVA, motor neurons VA and VB, and the interneuron RIA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3C</xref>, 3F, and 3I). This increase in node strength suggests that the neural functions associated with AVA and RIA may be heightened in males. Conversely, the comparatively reduced node strength observed in several neurons in males could be indicative of behaviors that are specific to hermaphrodites, such as those related to neurons URY, PVC, and PVR (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3C</xref>, 3F, and 3I).</p>

<p>In examining the edge weight feature of the neural networks, we identified several edges that are specific to one sex (Supplementary table 3). These findings under-score the potential influence of these sex-specific edges on the generation of dimorphic behavioral outputs. For clarity, we focus on the top five weighted sex-specific edges and their edge counts, as indicated in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>. When comparing the weights of shared edges, it is observed that they tend to be more substantial in males (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>). This disparity in edge weight is particularly notable in circuits related to RIA, such as AIY→RIA→RMD DV, and circuits associated with AVA, including AVA→DA and AVA→VA, which are markedly enriched in males. On the other hand, circuits like PVP-AQR and those involving FLP neurons, such as FLP→AVD and FLP→AVB, appear to be more dominant in hermaphrodites (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3L</xref>). These circuit-specific differences suggest that they may contribute to distinct behavioral manifestations between two sexes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we observed a decrease in the shortest paths among pharyngeal neu-rons, such as M3, M5, and NSM, in the male neural network (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3M</xref>, 3N). Along with a lack of connections with other neurons (Supplementary figure 1), this obser-vation indicates the formation of a functional unit consisting of pharyngeal neurons, which may be critical for male-specific behaviors. We have noted an increase in the shortest paths involving the RIP neuron, such as RIP→ASI, RIP→ADE, RIP→ALN, RIP→ASJ, and RIP→ASER (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3N</xref>), along with a decrease in the betweenness centrality of the RIP neuron (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3O</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3P</xref>). These changes strongly suggest an enhanced dimorphic function of the RIP neuron in hermaphrodites, which could be integral to hermaphrodite-specific behaviors.</p>

<label>2.2</label><title>Dynamical characteristics of functional neural networks in male and hermaphrodite C. elegans</title>
<p>To systemically study the dynamics of these two neural networks, we performed com-putational neuroscience method to assess the functional role of individual neurons in the network. We utilized non-spiking RC model to simulate neuronal activity because it is widely accepted that neurons in C. elegans are non-spiked, with the acknowl-edgment of action potentials in several neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. To simplify the simulation, we standardized parameters for all neurons, maintaining a resting potential of −60mV and the fixed linear correlation of the current input and synapse number (Supplemen-tary file 1). We stimulated individual neurons by shifting the membrane potential to +60mV for a duration of 40 seconds and monitored the membrane potential changes of all the other neurons. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> illustrates the stimulation of AVA in hermaphrodite neural network as an example, the other neurons of hermaphrodite neural network exhibit diverse response patterns (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). From these simulations, we identified the neuron that exhibited the strongest response when an individual neuron was stim-ulated, creating functional pairs. We found that only 30% of these functional pairs are conserved across both neural networks (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref> and Supplementary table 4). To gauge the influence of a neuron as an upstream component within the network, we measured the cumulative changes in membrane potential across all other neurons when a particular neuron was stimulated. A substantial alteration in membrane poten-tial across all other neurons would indicate that a particular neuron has a significant impact on the entire network as an upstream component. According to our results, neurons in the male network are more capable of activating the network than those in the hermaphrodite network (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Furthermore, sex-specific neurons, when acting as upstream neurons, have a greater effect on the network in males than do sex-shared neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>), a trend not observed in hermaphrodites (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Similar patterns were observed when assessing the dynamic functions of neurons as part of the downstream component of the network (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4G-I</xref>). By categorizing the top 20 upstream and top 20 downstream neurons, we attempted to predict sexually dimorphic behaviors. Both predictions highlighted mating behavior as a key aspect of male-specific behaviors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4F</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4J</xref>).</p>

<label>2.3</label><title>A neural circuit for dimorphic spontaneous local search behavior</title>
<p>Given the structural and dynamical discrepancies identified between the male and hermaphrodite neural networks, several sexually dimorphic behaviors can be pre-dicted. In particular, male behavior is primarily characterized by an emphasis on sexual-related behaviors. The AVA neuron emerges as pivotal to the function of the male network, participating in both sex-specific and sex-shared sub-neural networks. Considering that AVA regulates local search behavior in hermaphrodite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>] and enhanced connections of AVA in the male neural network, therefore, we examined the hypothesis that AVA-related neural circuit could be a key regulatory component for dimorphic spontaneous local search behavior in males.</p>
<p>We placed individual worms onto distinct food patches and recorded the num-ber of reversals over the initial ten minutes in the new environment; this number indicates local search behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. Results showed that males display high level of local search behavior on both thick and thin food patches, as well as patch without food (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-D</xref>). The absence of food alters the initial local search behavior in hermaphrodites, with no impact on males (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>). The males’ enhanced local search behavior is dependent on sexual maturity, as evidenced by the similar reversal rates of late larval males and hermaphrodites (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). To explore the potential impact of the prior experiences during development on male’s local search behavior, we separated L4 male on three distinct types of plates: a plate devoid of both food and hermaphrodites, a plate containing food without hermaphrodites or a plate with both food and hermaphrodites. There was no significant difference among males with different prior experiences, suggesting that developmental experiences do not influence the enhanced local search behavior in males (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). Overall, we discovered a sexually dimorphic behavior in C. elegans, that sexually matured males exhibit enhanced local search behavior regardless the environment.</p>

<p>To examine AVA’s role in local search behavior, we temporally suppressed AVA activity by expressing HisCl1 (histamine-gated chloride channel) in AVA and administrating histamine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. The significantly reduced reversal rates indicate the commanding role of AVA in driving reversals in both males and hermaphrodites (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5H</xref>). Subsequently, we conducted in vivo calcium imaging studies on AVA neurons. Our findings revealed that AVA neurons exhibit spontaneous cal-cium transients, with adult males showing a significantly higher frequency of these events compared to hermaphrodites (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5J</xref>). However, this difference is not observed in late larval males (Supplementary figure 6), which aligns with the behavioral outcomes.</p>
<p>Next, to identify male’s local search target, we assessed male’s behavioral prefer-ence towards hermaphrodites. We generated four food patches with equal distance to the center of the plate, then placed approximately 30 adult hermaphrodites on diag-onal food patches for 1 hour, followed by introducing approximately 30 males to the center of the plate (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5K</xref>). After 1 hour, we quantified the distribution of males across food patches with and without hermaphrodites. A greater proportion of wild-type males congregated on patches containing hermaphrodites. However, inhibiting AVA activity notably reduced the preference for hermaphrodites (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5L</xref>). These findings suggest that AVA-mediated enhancement of male local search behavior aids in locating hermaphrodites for mating purposes.</p>
<p>In order to elucidate the AVA-related dimorphic circuit responsible for male-specific local search behavior, we quantified the differences in chemical synaptic connections with AVA neurons between males and hermaphrodites. Notably, PQR, RIC, and DVC neurons demonstrated the highest synaptic output to AVA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, 6B and Supple-mentary <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">figure 7</xref>), suggesting their potential role as upstream neurons. Consequently, we investigated the effect of PQR, RIC, and DVC on male’s enhanced local search behavior by blocking their synaptic release using TeTx expression driven by cell-specific promoters (Supplementary figure 8). Our findings indicated that selectively blocking either RIC or DVC significantly reduced the local search behavior in males (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6E</xref>), but not in hermaphrodites (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref>). However, PQR is not involved in local search regulation in both male and hermaphrodite (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>, 6H and Supplementary figure 9). To further validate these results, we conducted AVA calcium imaging under conditions where PQR, DVC, or RIC synaptic activity was blocked. A decrease in the frequency of spontaneous calcium transients was observed specifically when DVC or RIC activity was suppressed, indicating that both DVC and RIC are indeed upstream neurons of AVA and play a crucial role in modulating the enhanced local search behavior observed in males (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I-N</xref>). These results are consistent with the behavioral observations.</p>

<p>DVC identified as a glutamatergic neuron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>] and activates AVA calcium transient events for local search behavior in males (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6K</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether NMDA or AMPA receptors on AVA regulates local search behavior. we gener-ated transgenic strains that individually silence NMDA and AMPA receptor genes in AVA neurons (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). By examining the reversal rates, we evaluated the impact on local search behavior. Our results indicated that individually silencing AMPA recep-tor gene glr-2, as well as NMDA receptor genes, nmr-1 or nmr-2, led to a significant decrease in reversal rates in males (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>, 7D, and 7F). However, no such effect was observed in hermaphrodites (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>, 7E, and 7G). This suggests that both AMPA and NMDA receptors are crucial for mediating local search behavior in males. Furthermore, since RIC is known to release octopamine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>], we explored the influence of octopamine receptors SER-3 and SER-6 in AVA on local search behavior (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). By silencing ser-3 and ser-6 genes specifically in AVA neurons and assessing the reversal rates, we aimed to determine their contribution. Our findings demonstrated that silencing ser-3 in AVA significantly reduced the reversal rate in males, without affecting hermaphrodites (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7I</xref>). In contrast, silencing ser-6 in AVA had no discernible effect on the reversal rate in either sex (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7J</xref>, 7K, and Supple-mentary figure 10). These results suggest that the octopamine receptor SER-3 plays a specific role in regulating the increased local search behavior observed in males.</p>

<label>3</label><title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we systematically analyze the structural and dynamical differences of neural networks, which set the circuitry basis for the dimorphic behaviors in male and hermaphrodite C. elegans. We reveal that male neural network characteristics determine the prioritized sexual-related behaviors in males. We predict dimorphic behavioral outputs according to the structural and dynamical features, and further verify the prediction by dissecting a circuit responsible for the enhanced local search behavior in males.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<label>3.1</label><title>Male C. elegans develops multiple mechanisms to increase the mating efficiency</title>
<p>The overwhelming majority (99.9%) of the C. elegans population consists of hermaphrodites, which prefer self-fertilization over mating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. Therefore, the evolution pressure has driven the rare males to develop multiple mechanisms to increase the mating efficiency.</p>
<p>We find that male’s neural network contains about 25% (41/161) male-specific neurons, while neural network in hermaphrodite only contains about 1.6% (2/122) hermaphrodite-specific neurons that regulates hermaphrodite specific egg-laying behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. Structural analysis shows that male-specific neurons form strong con-nections within male neural networks, revealing the important roles of these neurons and setting the basis for males’ prioritized sexual-related behavior. Our functional simulation analysis confirms the prediction based on structural features, emphasizing the substantial impact of male-specific neurons on the male neural network.</p>
<p>Not only the dominate role of male-specific neurons, the distinct connections and functions of sex-shared neurons facilitate sexual-related behaviors through different mechanisms. Males express pheromone receptors in both sex-shared sensory neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>] and male-specific neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>] to increase pheromone sensitivity. Besides the increased pheromone receptors in the sensory neurons, males rewire the synap-tic connections at the interneuron and motor neuron level to promote sex-related behavior. AVA neuron is the command neuron for driving reversals, which plays an essential role for hermaphrodite behaviors, including navigation, food searching, aver-sive response, learning and memory etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]. We find that AVA have strong connections with sex-specific neurons and shows the key position for the functional connection in the whole male network as well as the male-specific sub-network, it suggests that AVA plays an important role for mating behavior in males. Indeed, previous study demonstrated that AVA integrates the signals for sex-specific neu-rons to complete a series of stereotyped steps during mating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>]. Beyond directly regulating mating behavior, we find that AVA-related rewired circuit in male medi-ate increased local search behavior that indirectly enhance the mating efficiency. The highly increased connections between command neuron AVA and downstream motor neurons VA and DA indicates a strong motor control in males. Sex-shared neurons DVC and RIC have increased chemical synapses with AVA in male, and our behavioral assay and calcium imaging results show that the circuit involving glutamatergic neu-ron DVC, octopaminergic neuron RIC and command neuron AVA regulate enhanced spontaneous local search behavior that facilitate mate-searching. For further prioritiz-ing the value of hermaphrodites, males decrease food attraction to promote food lawn leaving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>], and decrease aversive response to nociceptive stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>].</p>

<label>3.2</label><title>Structural and dynamical feature based sexually dimorphic behavior prediction</title>
<p>In C. elegans, pharyngeal neurons that govern the pharyngeal pumping mechanism for feeding are organized into a specialized sub-network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>]. Previous research has demonstrated that signals from non-pharyngeal neurons can modulate feeding behav-iors through regulating pharyngeal neurons in hermaphrodites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>]. Structural and functional studies characterized RIP neuron as a pivotal intermediary to connect pha-ryngeal neurons with others in hermaphrodite neural network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>]. Interestingly, our current study reveals a distinct pattern in male worms. Unlike previous findings, we observed no direct connections between the pharyngeal neurons and other neurons, as depicted in Supplementary figure 1. Instead, we noted a robust interconnection among the pharynx neurons themselves and a loose functional linkage of the RIP neu-ron with sensory neurons responsible for internal and external environment changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>] in neural network (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3N</xref>). These findings suggest that males may possess an independent regulatory mechanism for feeding behaviors.</p>
<p>Our previous study demonstrated that the AIY→RIA circuit is fundamental for sensorimotor integration in olfactory steering in hermaphrodites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>]. AIY receives inputs from various sensory neurons, including AWC and AWA, in both sexes (Sup-plementary figure 11). Notably, AWC and AWA in males are involved in sexual attraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. Here, we discover an enhanced circuit at the inter-motor neuron level, AIY→RIA→RMD DV circuit (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3L</xref>), therefore, we predict that enhanced AIY→RIA→RMD DV circuit facilitates pheromone-guided olfactory steer-ing behavior in males. A recent study showed that AFD expresses a dimorphic level of the insulin-like peptide INS-39 in males, suggesting a dimorphic function of AFD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Our analysis show that neuron AFD exhibits the highest number of synaptic connec-tions with AIY (Supplementary figure 11), therefore, further exploring the function of the AFD→AIY circuit in males is of significant interest.</p>
<p>Previous functional studies have demonstrated that AVA, as the command neuron, drives locomotion to regulate diverse behaviors in both sexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>]. Here, we present structural evidence for the essential role of AVA in the neural networks of males and hermaphrodites. We find that AVA has a large number of synapses, including both synaptic inputs and outputs, in two neural networks (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, 1G and 1K). Interestingly, with respect to the difference in synapse numbers among sex-shared neurons, AVA exhibits a dimorphic connection pattern in males and hermaphrodites, as well as playing a key role in the sex-specific sub-neural network of males. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that a wide range of behaviors mediated by AVA are sexually dimorphic. Here, we have demonstrated that AVA and the upstream neurons DVC and RIC regulate enhanced local search behavior in males (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>-<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). However, PQR, which reveals the largest synapse number difference with AVA between the two sexes, is not involved. Thus, it is intriguing to investigate the function of PQR-AVA circuit in males to discover how this dimorphic circuit mediates sexually specific behavior.</p>
<p>We have identified several synaptic connections that exist only in one sex (Sup-plementary table 3 and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>). One male-specific circuit involving PHA and two hermaphrodite-specific circuits comprising PHB and URY are highlighted according to the sex-specific connections (Supplementary figure 12). Indeed, studies have demon-strated the mechanisms of sex-specific pruning of PHA and PHB neuronal synapses and the corresponding sexually dimorphic behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. Sensory neuron URY is involved in pathogen avoidance in hermaphrodites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>]. Therefore, it is intriguing to examine whether URY activates downstream motor neurons RMD DV and SMD or interneuron AVE, to generate avoidance behavior in a sex-specific manner.</p>
<p>Overall, this study elucidates the neural circuitry underlying prioritized sexual behaviors in males, also predicts potential dimorphic behaviors and the associated circuits.</p>

<p>Cell-specific gene knockdown was carried out based on the methodology outlined in a previous publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>] with some modifications.

<label>4.6</label><title>Local search behavioral assay</title>
<p>A 10 uL of OP50 bacterial liquid culture was transferred onto a 3 cm NGM plate and allowed to dry at room temperature for either 0.5 hours or 16 hours to differentiate food thickness. Individual one-day-old adult male or hermaphrodite C. elegans were then placed on the assay plate. The plate was positioned under a high-speed camera (MV-CA060-11GM, Hikvision) to record for 10 minutes at a frame rate of 10 Hz. Reversal behaviors were manually counted for further analysis. In the subsequent local search behavioral assay with transgenic animals, only the last 3 minutes of the 10-minute search period were recorded and analyzed.</p>

<label>4.7</label><title>Manipulating AVA neuron with histamine administration</title>
<p>The protocol for temporally inhibiting AVA neurons with histamine treatment in AVA::hisCl1 transgenic animals was adapted from a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. A 1 M histamine-dihydrochloride (H7125, Sigma-Aldrich) stock solution was prepared and stored in a −4°C freezer. For experimental use, the stock solution was diluted with double-distilled water (ddH2O) to a final concentration of 200 mM. To prepare the histamine-containing food lawn, 10 uL of the 200 mM histamine-dihydrochloride solu-tion was mixed with 190 uL of E. coli OP50 culture to achieve a final concentration of 10 mM histamine. Assay plates were prepared by seeding 10 uL of this bacterial mixture onto the center of 3 cm NGM plates and allowing the plates to dry for 0.5 to 3 hours before the experiment.</p>

<label>4.8</label><title>Hermaphrodite preference assay</title>
<p>A 9 cm NGM assay plate pretreated with 10 uM histamine solution (H7125, Sigma-Aldrich) was divided into four equal sectors. A food lawn was created at the center of each sector by drying 50 uL of OP50 bacterial liquid culture for 2 hours at room temperature. Approximately 30 one-day-old adult GR1333 hermaphrodites were trans-ferred onto two diagonal food lawns, initiating a 2-hour pheromone-releasing period. After this period, about 30 one-day-old adult males were quickly placed at the center of the assay plate and allowed to freely select a sector for 1 hour. Following the selec-tion period, the number of males in each sector was manually counted. The Choice Index was calculated based on the distribution of males across the sectors:

<label>4.9</label><title>Calcium imaging and data analysis</title>
<p>One-day-old males or hermaphrodites were paralyzed with 10 mM levamisole (A606644-0100, Sango Biotech) and placed on a glass slide with a thin layer of NGM agar. Images were captured for ten minutes at a frame rate of 4.84 frames per second using a Zeiss LSM980 confocal microscope equipped with an EMCCD camera and a ×60 oil immersion objective. The images were processed using ImageJ software. The dynamic tracking plugin “TurboReg” was used to pre-process the raw image gallery and correct any frame misalignment. Regions of interest (ROIs) were manually drawn around the AVA soma, and the gray values of these ROIs were measured to obtain the time series of calcium signals. Approximately 144 frames (about 5% of the total 2876–2879 frames) were averaged to establish the <italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> baseline value. △<italic>F</italic> was calcu-lated as △<italic>F</italic> = <italic>F</italic> − <italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub>, where F represents the average fluorescence intensity of the ROI in each frame. The frequency of calcium events was determined by counting the number of signal intervals with △<italic>F/F</italic><sub>0</sub> exceeding a threshold value of 1 during the 10-minute recording period.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work seeks to predict differences in neural function and behavior between male and hermaphrodite C. elegans by comparing their nervous system maps of synaptic wiring. The authors then seek to validate some of their predictions by measuring differences in neural activity or behavior, including in response to neuron-specific genetic manipulations. In particular, the authors focus on the role of neuron AVA which has notable differences in its connectivity between the male and hermaphrodite, and they use this and behavior measurements to argue for a role of AVA in mate-searching behavior in males.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A major strength of this work is its approach to investigating differences in wiring between males and hermaphrodites in a systematic and quantitative way. The work laudably takes advantage of recently available comprehensive connectomes, including across sexes of the same species, and applies concepts from network science to mining their differences. Another strength of the work is that it supplements network analysis with measurements of behavior, including with cell-specific genetic manipulations. The measurements and analysis will be of value to the scientific community.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The evidence to support conclusions about the special relationship between differences in AVA's wiring and male mate-finding appears incomplete. The authors selected AVA based on changes in wiring and then observed a decrease in male chemotaxis towards hermaphrodites for animals in which neuron AVA is inhibited. This is presented as evidence that specifically AVA is important for mate-finding, and therefore that changes in wiring inform changes in function. But given AVA's known role in all reversal-related locomotion, it is important to more forcefully rule out an alternative hypothesis that the observed deficits in mate-finding could be explained by any reversal circuitry motor defect (including those without wiring differences), rather than specifically attributed to AVA and its wiring. Similarly, more evidence is needed to show that deficits in reversal circuitry preferentially affect mate-seeking compared to other goal-directed navigation behaviors.</p>
<p>There are some areas where methods would benefit from further justification or clarification. For example, the work would benefit from better justification for selecting sub-networks to study, or for combining bilaterally symmetric neurons. More details are also needed to better interpret calcium imaging studies, such as details about the indicator and illumination wavelength and intensity.</p>
<p>Finally, there are some weaknesses inherent to the entire field of connectomic analysis that are necessarily also present here. For example, it is unclear how to weight the relative contributions of chemical versus electrical gap junctions when performing analyses of the wiring diagram, and the choice could potentially influence results. The wiring diagram also lacks information about timescales of neural dynamics or the role of neuromodulators or other molecular details that may influence the strength or function of various connections, and this poses a major challenge for predicting neural dynamics from neural wiring. For example, in their neural dynamics simulation, the authors assume that all neurons have the same conductance and reversal potentials - a standard practice - despite known diversity among neurons that limits the usefulness of this approach. It will be helpful to further acknowledge these limitations of the broader field.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In their study, Wang and co-workers aimed to identify sexual dimorphisms in the connectomes of male and hermaphrodite C. elegans, and link these to sex-related behaviors. To this end they analyzed and compared various network properties of simplified male and hermaphrodite connectome datasets, and then focused on the AVA premotor neurons, linking their distinctive connectivity with their differential influence on reversing behaviors between the two sexes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study employs a range of basic methods from network and computational neuroscience and provides experimental testing of one of the predictions of the analysis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Various aspects of sexual dimorphism in the nervous system of C. elegans have already been described and discussed (reviewed, for example, in Emmons 2018, Walsh et al. 2021). In particular, Cook et al, (2019), who mapped the male connectome (which serves as the key data in the current study), included in their work an analysis of connectome-level differences between males and hermaphrodites. Unfortunately, the foundations of the current study are somewhat problematic, and the results it provides are rather rudimentary and do not provide substantial new insight.</p>
<p>My critique of the study can be organized around several major issues.</p>
<p>(1) Source data</p>
<p>A large portion of the work is based on the analysis of a single male and a single hermaphrodite connectome datasets from Cook et al. 2019. These original connectomes were simplified in the current study, merging most individual neurons into neuron class nodes. As a measure of edge weight, the authors used the number of synaptic contacts between each two nodes. Cook et al. 2019 estimated this number to be of high variance, and even when considering unweighted connectivity (whether two nodes are at all connected or not) substantial variability exists between independent connectome datasets (e.g., Birari and Rabinowitch, 2024). Therefore, basing the analysis on synaptic weights from a single connectome (for each sex) may be somewhat unreliable.</p>
<p>On top of this, a huge gap may exist between connectome structure and function, especially when overlooking: (1) the sign of the synapses (excitatory vs. inhibitory), (2) synaptic efficiency (a single strong synapse may be more efficient than multiple weak synapses), (3) the spatial distribution of the synapses (clusters of synapses, for example, may be stronger than scattered synapses). These should at the very least be acknowledged. Moreover, the pooling of electrical and chemical synapses done by the authors is problematic, as is assuming all electrical synapses are bidirectional. These and other factors may undermine the results of the analysis, and, again, at the very least should be considered and discussed.</p>
<p>A minimal validation of the analysis could be achieved by sensitivity analyses. For example, studying how consistent the results are when: separately analyzing the chemical and electrical networks; binarizing synaptic contacts to existing vs. non-existing connections regardless of weight; and comparing with additional connectome datasets (at least for hermaphrodites).</p>
<p>Another important approach for validation would be synaptic labeling of key pathways, in order to establish the extent to which they maintain sexual dimorphism across the population (as performed, for example, by Cook et al., 2019; Pechuk et al. 2022).</p>
<p>(2) Statistical analysis</p>
<p>Comparing any two connectomes will show differences in connectivity and other network properties. The question is to what degree the differences found in the current study between two particular male and hermaphrodite connectomes transcend such basic inconsistencies. This fundamental question is not addressed in the manuscript.</p>
<p>A second major concern is that a considerable portion of the results are based on improper comparisons between male and hermaphrodite connectome measures.</p>
<p>In Figure 1D,I,M,V, Figure 2D,H,L, Figure 4E,I there is no sense in statistically testing the differences between hermaphrodite sex-specific (N=2) and shared nodes. The sample size is way too small. Corresponding conclusions about male-specific neurons being different from hermaphrodite-specific neurons in terms of connectivity are thus improperly founded. Similarly, the analyses in Figure 1P,S, 2O,R contain more data points, because of connectivity, but could still be misleading, since all the edges there contain either HSN or VC (just two nodes).</p>
<p>More so, any claim comparing the differences between two measures in males vs. hermaphrodites should be based on a 2X2 (or 3X2) design (e.g., tested using 2-way ANOVA with an interaction term). It is erroneous to interpret comparisons between two effects without directly comparing them (Makin et al., 2019).</p>
<p>When more than one comparison is performed, a one-way ANOVA should precede post hoc analyses, and corrections for multiple comparisons should be carried out and reported.</p>
<p>The plots in Figure 1E,W and Figure 4F,J are illustrative but do not contain any statistical test to support the claims about which functions are emphasized in which sex. They also rely on a very superficial categorization of individual neuron class function, whereas in reality, in C. elegans many neurons serve multiple functions.</p>
<p>In Figures 5-7 individual data points should be plotted, and the error bars and boxes should be defined (in all figures).</p>
<p>Finally, Figure 3C,F,I,L,N,P and Figure 5A-C lack statistical analysis (e.g., via bootstrapping). In addition, the term 'significantly' in the text should be reserved for statistical significance.</p>
<p>(3) Testing network predictions</p>
<p>A key emphasis of the network analysis concerns the AVA premotor neurons. It is well established that reversing behavior is controlled by premotor neurons such as AVA (e.g., Maricq et al. 1995) and that AVA activity is spontaneous and coupled to reversing (e.g., Chronis et al. 2007). More so, it has already been shown that male reversal frequency is higher than that of hermaphrodites (e.g., Mah et al. 1992; Zhao et al. 2003). Similar findings in the current study are thus not very surprising. The current study does add some new detail. Namely, the higher frequency of AVA activity in adult males compared to hermaphrodites, and the presumably sex-specific roles of RIC and DVC as well as several AVA glutamate receptors, in modulating reversing. At the same time, PQR, for example, showed no such role, contrary to the predictions.</p>
<p>Incidentally, AVA is not a commander neuron, but rather a command or, preferably, a premotor neuron. Altogether, the major specific focus of the analysis, predicting a sexually dimorphic role for AVA, is not very novel.</p>
<p>(4) Further predictions</p>
<p>The discussion section presents several additional predictions stemming from the analysis. However, to me, they seem almost arbitrary.</p>
<p>The statement claiming that the authors found the male pharyngeal connectome to be more strongly wired to the main connectome as opposed to previous findings, is unclear. Sex-specific differences in connectivity between the pharyngeal and somatic networks are immediately evident from the connectomes and do not require graph theoretical tools to be discovered (page 4 and discussion of Figure 3N).</p>
<p>The prediction that the AIY→RIA→RMD_DV circuit may facilitate pheromone-guided olfactory steering behavior in males is not very strong. On the one hand, it is known that males respond to sex pheromones (notably, however, if these pheromone receptors are ectopically expressed in hermaphrodites then hermaphrodites also respond to the pheromones [Wan et al. 2019]). Since these pheromone-sensing neurons are also involved in other sensory processes, it is quite trivial that the circuits involved in general sensory-based steering should be shared with specific pheromone-based steering. The fact that the interneurons in the circuit may be more strongly connected (excitatory, inhibitory, electrical?) in males could imply many things but does not add much to the picture.</p>
<p>The authors also mention AFD as having more synaptic contacts with AIY in males, and link this somehow to the dimorphic expression of insulin-like peptides in AFD. However, neuropeptide-based transmission is largely independent of synaptic connections, so I don't see the relevance.</p>
<p>(5) Methods</p>
<p>The example provided in the Methods section for calculating graph measures is very helpful. I am not sure, however, why the length of a path was defined as the reciprocal sum of the edge weights of the connections within the path. Why the reciprocal? Is it the sum of the reciprocals? Do more synaptic contacts imply a shorter path?</p>
<p>The description in the text (as opposed to the Methods section) of node strength is not very clear: &quot;The node strength measures how strongly a node directly possesses with other nodes in the network&quot; - This should be clarified.</p>
<p>For the RC simulation, I assume the sodium and potassium conductances are fixed. If so, they are leak currents themselves. What does the extra leak current represent? Obviously the simulation includes multiple arbitrary assumptions and parameter values. It would be useful to discuss at least the considerations for choosing the model design and parameters. I also assume that the delayed responses in the bottom neurons in Figure 4A (that still respond) are due to indirect synaptic connections (path lengths &gt; 1)?</p>
