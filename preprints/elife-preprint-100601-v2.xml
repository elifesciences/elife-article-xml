<title>Abstract</title>
<p><italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) is the most prevalent modification of mRNA which controls diverse physiological processes. Although m<sup>6</sup>A modification has been reported to regulate type I interferon (IFN) responses by targeting the mRNA of IFN-β and the interferon stimulated genes (ISGs), the detailed mechanism of how m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase complex (MTC) rapidly responds to conduct the modification on nascent mRNA during IFN-β stimulation remains largely unclear. Here, we demonstrate that WTAP, the adaptor protein of m<sup>6</sup>A MTC, undergoes dephosphorylation-regulated phase transition from aggregates to liquid-like condensates under IFN-β stimulation, thereby mediates m<sup>6</sup>A modification of a subset of ISG mRNAs to restrict their expression. The phase transition of WTAP promotes the interaction with nucleus-translocated transcription factor STAT1, which recruits MTC to the promoter regions of ISGs and directing the co-transcriptional m<sup>6</sup>A modification on ISG mRNAs. Collectively, our findings reveal a novel regulatory role of WTAP phase transition in manipulating signaling pathways and fine-tuning immune response by orchestrating dynamic m<sup>6</sup>A modification through the cooperation of transcription factors and MTC.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>This revised manuscript significantly advances understanding of WTAP phase transition function on mediating ISGs expression through the following updates.
1. Mechanistic Link Between Phase Separation and WTAP Function:
The study establishes a direct relationship between WTAP-mediated phase separation and its transcriptional regulatory activity. Additional experiments demonstrate that phase separation inhibitor 1,6-hexanediol (hex) selectively block interaction of WTAP with STAT1 and its recruitment to interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) promoters. Crucially, hex exert their effects without altering WTAP phosphorylation status, resolving previous ambiguities about the interdependence of phosphorylation and phase separation. These results validate phase separation as an essential upstream event governing WTAP-STAT1 complex formation, WTAP-ISG promoter regions interaction and the m6A deposition.
2. Renew the function of Intrinsically Disordered Region (IDR) on WTAP phase separation event:
Revised manuscript provides further evidence to confirm the IDR function on WTAP phase separation. Updated structural predictions identify the conserved disordered domains locates on C-terminal domain (CTD) of WTAP, which potentially drives its liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), linking specific IDR motifs to phase separation event, offering a structural basis for its phase separation behavior.
3. Expanded RNA-seq and MeRIP-seq Analyses:
Newly integrated RNA-seq data systematically confirm the function of WTAP global transcriptional impact on interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), while addition of MeRIP-seq results reveal its m6A-dependent post-transcriptional regulatory network. Cross-analysis identifies emphasizing the multi-layer regulation on ISGs, including transcriptional control via STAT1 and post-transcriptional modulation via m6A. Also proposed a potential of co-transcriptional m6A modification. These datasets further validated the regulatory mechanism of WTAP.
4. Discussion of m6A Modification Function in Type I Interferon Signaling and Antiviral Response:
The Discussion section now incorporates a review of m6A functions in type I interferon responses and the antiviral response.
The experimental rigor is strengthened after revision. While maintaining consistency with prior conclusions about WTAP phase transition function, this version delivers substantially deeper mechanistic insights into how phase separation orchestrates WTAP dependent m6A modification functions in ISGs regulation.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Innate immunity is the first defense line against invading pathogens, mainly through the induction of type I interferon (IFN) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Goubau, Deddouche, &amp; Reis e Sousa, 2013</xref>). Once the type I IFN is stimulated and initiated, the signal should be tightly restricted to maintain the homeostasis of immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Henault et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Schneider, Chevillotte, &amp; Rice, 2014</xref>). In the past few years, a large number of studies have reported the post-translational modification of signaling proteins that regulate type I IFN signaling, such as phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Uddin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wen Z, Zhong Z, &amp; Jr., 1995</xref>), ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cui et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Qin et al., 2016</xref>) and methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mowen et al., 2001</xref>). However, whether post-transcriptional modification of mRNA affects type I IFN responses remains largely unclear.</p>
<p>Methylation at the <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup> position of adenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) is the most pervasive post-transcriptional modification of mRNA. Deposition of m<sup>6</sup>A is catalyzed by methyltransferase complex (MTC), including a key adaptor protein Wilm’s tumor– associated protein (WTAP) and key catalyze proteins methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) and methyltransferase-like 14 (METTL14)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Schapira, 2016</xref>). The m<sup>6</sup>A-modified RNAs are recognized by YT521B homology (YTH) domain family proteins, including YTHDC1, YTHDC2, YTHDF1, YTHDF2 and YTHDF3. m<sup>6</sup>A modification have been found to regulate different cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Knuckles &amp; Bühler, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Meyer &amp; Jaffrey, 2017</xref>), such as differentiation of stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Geula et al., 2015</xref>), circadian clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Zhong et al., 2018</xref>), splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Z. Zhang et al., 2010</xref>), translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">X. Wang et al., 2015</xref>) and destabilization of mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">X. Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Meanwhile, m<sup>6</sup>A modification can be reversed by demethylase fat mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO) and AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zheng et al., 2013</xref>). m<sup>6</sup>A modification is critical for newborn mRNA produced by specific stimulation to participate in further physiological activities. While m<sup>6</sup>A modification of <italic>IFN-</italic>β mRNA suppresses antiviral responses during viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rubio, Depledge, Bianco, Thompson, &amp; Mohr, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Winkler et al., 2019</xref>), this modification also paradoxically enhances antiviral response through different regulation of ISG transcripts, such as enhancing translation of IFIT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">McFadden et al., 2021</xref>) and prolonging <italic>STAT1</italic> and <italic>IRF1</italic> mRNAs stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">L. Wang et al., 2020</xref>), demonstrating the complexity of m<sup>6</sup>A in immune modulation. Given the crucial role of precise and timely m<sup>6</sup>A modification on mRNA in fine-tuning antiviral responses, further investigation is required to clarify the function of non-catalytic protein WTAP and how MTC responds to IFN-β stimulation.</p>
<p>Here, we observed the phase transition from gel-like aggregates to liquid-like condensates of WTAP driven by IFN-β-induced dephosphorylation. Based on the results from the WTAP mutation assay, we revealed that under IFN-β stimulation, the liquid-phase of WTAP cooperated with transcription factor STAT1 to recruit MTC at the promoter regions of ISG, mediating the m<sup>6</sup>A modification on newborn ISG mRNAs and regulated the expression of a subset of ISGs, thereby modulating antiviral type I IFN responses. Our study sheds light on the mechanism by which phase transition of WTAP bridges transcription factors and MTC to fine-tune m<sup>6</sup>A deposition on specific mRNAs.</p>

<title>WTAP undergoes phase separation during IFN-β stimulation</title>
<p>To explore the detailed mechanism of WTAP-directed m<sup>6</sup>A modification on ISG mRNAs, we first investigated the expression of WTAP during virus infection. We infected cells with RNA virus Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) or DNA virus Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1), and conducted the immunofluorescence experiments. Surprisingly, we found WTAP was clustered and formed condensate-like pattern in cells during virus infection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and Figure 1-figure supplement 1A). We then stimulated cells with IFN-β and observed the increasing number of WTAP condensates formation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Previous studies have reported that some components in the methyltransferase complex such as METTL3 or YTHDFs undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) during m<sup>6</sup>A modification process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Han et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">J. Li et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, we suspected whether the IFN-β-mediated WTAP condensates indicated phase separation.</p>

<p>A considerable number of proteins undergo phase separation via interactions between intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). IDRs contain more charged and polar amino acids to present multiple weakly interacting elements, and lack hydrophobic amino acids to show flexible conformations(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hou et al., 2024</xref>). By searching WTAP protein structure (within part of MTC complex) in protein structure bank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/7VF2">https://www.rcsb.org/structure/7VF2</ext-link>), we found that WTAP IDR was predicted to span amino acids from 245 to 396, giving a clue that WTAP might have the ability to undergo phase separation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). To directly prove the phase separation properties of WTAP <italic>in vitro</italic>, we purified the recombinant mCherry-WTAP protein, mixed recombinant mCherry-WTAP with physiological buffer and found that the buffer became turbid (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Observation under microscope showed that mCherry-WTAP automatically formed liquid-like condensates which could be reversed by 1,6-hexanediol (hex), an inhibitor of phase separation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Phase diagram of WTAP phase separation was also established under different concentrations of potassium chloride and recombinant mCherry-WTAP (Figure 1-figure supplement 1B). Fusion of condensates were observed and larger condensates were formed <italic>in vitro</italic> (Figure 1-figure supplement 1C). These data together confirmed that WTAP underwent phase separation <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
<p>To further explore the protein properties, we detected the phase separation behavior of WTAP in cells. Gene expressing mCherry-WTAP was introduced in WTAP-KO HeLa cells to generate mCherry-WTAP-rescued HeLa cells, followed with IFN-β stimulation. A few WTAP condensates were discovered in untreated cells while an increasing number of WTAP condensates were observed under IFN-β stimulation. After hex treatment, WTAP condensates in IFN-β treated cells dissipated into a dispersed pattern (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Similarly, hex treatment in virus-infected cells also disrupted the formation of WTAP condensates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and Figure 1-figure supplement 1A). We next checked the mobility of WTAP condensates by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments. Intriguingly, WTAP exhibited lower recovery intensity in untreated cells but higher mobility with rapid recovery intensity in IFN-β-treated cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). These results suggested a potential dynamic transformation in WTAP phase separation. While WTAP underwent gel-like phase separation under basal conditions, IFN-β induced its phase transition to form the liquid-like condensates under physiological conditions.</p>
<p>Previous studies have uncovered that protein phase separation could be controlled by interaction between specific regions through multiple factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Murthy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">J. Wang et al., 2018</xref>), including electrostatic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Boyko, Qi, Chen, Surewicz, &amp; Surewicz, 2019</xref>), hydrophobic contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Reichheld, Muiznieks, Keeley, &amp; Sharpe, 2017</xref>) or hydrogen bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Gabryelczyk et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, we tried to figure out the phase separation-driven region of WTAP. We analyzed the net charge per region and hydropathy of WTAP, but no specific domains with opposite charge or high level of hydrophobicity were found (Figure 1-figure supplement 2A-B), indicating that electrostatic interaction and hydrophobic contacts might not be the key driving force for WTAP phase separation. We then analyzed the abundance of amino acids and found that Serine (Ser), Glutamine (Gln), Glutamate (Glu) and Leucine (Leu) were present at significantly higher levels than other amino acids within WTAP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and Figure1-figure supplement 2C). Gln and Leu were mainly located in the N-terminal domain (NTD) while Ser was mostly enriched in the C-terminal domain (CTD), implying the different properties of NTD and CTD (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Notably, IDR of WTAP were predicted to cover the entire serine-rich CTD region. Previous researches reported that hydrogen bond between serine side chain mediated the intermolecular interaction and LLPS of FUS. In addition, abnormal glutamine-repeat resulted in the formation of β-sheet and solid/gel-like aggregates with lower mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Perutz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tanaka, Morishima, Akagi, Hashikawa, &amp; Nukina, 2001</xref>), which were related to neurodegenerative diseases like Huntington’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gourfinkel-An et al., 1997</xref>). Therefore, we wondered whether glutamine-rich NTD and serine-rich CTD of WTAP induced the distinct phase separation. As predicted, we found full-length WTAP and CTD WTAP formed liquid condensates, while NTD of WTAP clustered and formed aggregates with lower mobility, which was confirmed through FRAP experiments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref> and Figure 1-figure supplement 2D). Intriguingly, we further observed that full-length WTAP transited from liquid-like condensates to aggregates after incubation for several minutes while CTD of WTAP remained liquid phase (Figure 1-figure supplement 2E). Collectively, these data validated the different phase separation potential of NTD and CTD of WTAP.</p>

<title>IFN-β-mediated dephosphorylation induces the phase transition of WTAP</title>
<p>Since the serine-rich CTD played the key role in liquid condensates formation of WTAP, we wondered whether IFN-β-mediated WTAP phase transition through serine-phosphorylation by electrostatic repulsion among negatively charged phosphate. We first detected the phosphorylation level of WTAP through immunoprecipitation (IP) assay and found that phosphorylation of WTAP was significantly decreased under IFN-β stimulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Through IP assays, we aimed to identify the phosphatases that dephosphorylate WTAP, thus checked the interaction between WTAP and family of protein phosphatases (PPPs), and found that PPP4 presented the strongest interaction with WTAP (Figure 2-figure supplement 1A). IFN-β stimulation promoted the interaction between WTAP and PPP4 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and Figure 2-figure supplement 1B). Both knockdown of <italic>PPP4</italic> and the potent PPP4 inhibitor fostriecin restrained the dephosphorylation of WTAP in IFN-β treated cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).

<p>To validate the effects of phosphorylation on the phase transition of WTAP, we first confirming the phosphorylation site of WTAP by mass spectrometry (MS) assays. MS results identified six phosphorylated serine/threonine sites within WTAP, while five of six phosphorylation sites were located in CTD of WTAP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and Figure 2-figure supplement 1D). We then constructed a series of phosphorylation mimic, serine/threonine to aspartate mutants (S/T-D) or phosphorylation-deficient, serine/threonine to alanine mutant (S/T-A) of WTAP, and observed the phase separation of WTAP mutants <italic>in vitro</italic>. We found that introducing three or more phosphorylation-mimic mutations in WTAP promoted protein aggregation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref> and Figure 2-figure supplement 1E). While the 5ST-D mutant induced aggregation, the 5ST-A mutant formed liquid condensates comparable to wild-type (WT) WTAP, which remained unphosphorylated in the E. coli expression system lacking endogenous kinase activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). We next conducted FRAP experiments and found that mobility of WT WTAP as well as 5ST-A was significantly higher than that of its 5ST-D mutant <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). However, hyperphosphorylated WT WTAP in untreated cells showed lower mobility as 5ST-D mutant compared to phosphorylation-deficient 5ST-A mutant, while IFN-β-induced dephosphorylation promoted the recovery efficiency of WT WTAP as higher as 5ST-A mutants of WTAP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). Additionally, we found the liquid condensates of WTAP after IFN-β stimulation was blunted in <italic>PPP4</italic> knocked-down cells and fostriecin treatment (Figure 2-figure supplement 1F-H), revealed that IFN-β triggered PPP4-mediated dephosphorylation of WTAP controlled the phase transition of WTAP. Taken together, we validated hyperphosphorylation of WTAP tended to form aggregates with low mobility due to electrostatically repulsed between phosphorylated serine sites, while hypophosphorylation of WTAP promoted the mobility and forms liquid condensates. IFN-β-mediated dephosphorylation promotes the transition from aggregates to liquid-phase of WTAP both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>).</p>

<p>We then collected the mRNA of control and <italic>WTAP</italic><sup>sgRNA</sup> cells stimulated with or without IFN-β to perform m<sup>6</sup>A methylated RNA immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (MeRIP-Seq).

<p>To further delineate the function of WTAP phase separation on m<sup>6</sup>A modification, we treated cells with hex to disrupt the phase separation of WTAP, and detected the m<sup>6</sup>A deposition in cells with virus infection or IFN-β treatment. We found that virus infection or IFN-β stimulation induced m<sup>6</sup>A modified ISG mRNAs, and their m<sup>6</sup>A modification was disrupted by phase separation inhibitor hex (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and Figure 4-figure supplement 1A-B). Hex increased ISG mRNAs stability in control cells but had no effect in <italic>WTAP</italic><sup>sgRNA</sup> cells, suggesting WTAP phase separation was essential for ISG mRNAs m<sup>6</sup>A deposition and stabilization (Figure 4-figure supplement 1C). Next, we aimed to uncover the distinct ability to direct m<sup>6</sup>A modification of ISGs between aggregates or liquid-phase separated WTAP. Knockdown of <italic>PPP4</italic> or treatment with its inhibitor fostriecin, maintained WTAP in a hyperphosphorylated and aggregated status under IFN-β stimulation, and the m<sup>6</sup>A modification level on ISG mRNAs were surprisingly found to be decreased (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B-C</xref>). Enhanced mRNA level was also detected with PPP4 deficiency or inhibition (Figure 4-figure supplement 1D-E).

<title>Liquid-phase separated WTAP recruits MTC and STAT1 on promoter regions to direct the m<sup>6</sup>A modification of ISG mRNAs</title>
<p>Although m<sup>6</sup>A modification of ISGs has been reported previously, the detailed mechanism of how WTAP directed m<sup>6</sup>A modification on ISG mRNAs and the distinct mechanism between WTAP aggregates and liquid-phase separated WTAP were still unknown. By analyzing expression levels of WTAP and other m<sup>6</sup>A methylation complex proteins, no significantly alteration were observed during 6 hours of IFN-β stimulation (Figure 5-figure supplement 1A-B). By MeRIP-seq, we discovered the m<sup>6</sup>A modification sites of ISGs were preferentially localized to CDS region (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>), which aligned with co-transcriptional m<sup>6</sup>A patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barbieri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">H.

Occupancy of the promoters of WTAP-regulated ISGs (2000 bp upstream of genes were analyzed, while 500 bp upstream of genes were considered as the proximal part of promoter) were predicted through directing using AnimalTFDB 3.0 website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/AnimalTFDB/">http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/AnimalTFDB/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hu et al., 2019</xref>).

The interaction between WTAP, METTL3 and STAT1 was dramatically inhibited with hex treatment both in cells and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E-F</xref>, and Figure 5-figure supplement 1D). By immunofluorescence (IF) experiments, we found IFN-β promoted the interaction between WTAP, METTL3 and nuclear-translocated STAT1 in cells, which could be abolished by hex (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). The interaction between WTAP, METTL3 and STAT1 were enhanced in the liquid-phase mutant WTAP 5ST-A rescued cells, which could be impaired by hex treatment (Figure 5-figure supplement 1E). The condensation among recombinant GFP-STAT1, mCherry-WTAP and CFP-METTL3 <italic>in vitro</italic> were detected, and observed that WTAP was able to form condensates with STAT1 or METTL3 alone while condensation of STAT1 and METTL3 was significantly diminished in the absence of WTAP (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H-I</xref> and Figure 5-figure supplement 1F). Consistent with the results in cells, the interaction between WTAP and STAT1 was blunted by hex (Figure 5-figure supplement 1G). Notably, both 2% and 5% hex did not alter the PPP4c-mediated WTAP dephosphorylation level, confirming that hex inhibited WTAP phase separation but not its de-phosphorylation event (Figure 5-figure supplement 1H). Altogether, our data showed that phase separated WTAP functioned as the key adaptor protein bridging METTL3 and STAT1 to direct the m<sup>6</sup>A modification of ISG mRNAs.</p>
<p>We next tried to figure out how STAT1-MTC bound and mediated m<sup>6</sup>A modification on ISG mRNAs. By performing the chromosome immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR experiments, we found that WTAP interacted with promoter regions of ISGs along with STAT1 under IFN-β stimulation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-B</xref>). STAT1 deficiency abolished the binding affinity between WTAP and ISG promoter regions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>), implying that nucleus-translocated transcription factor STAT1 directed WTAP and MTC to promoter regions of ISGs to conduct m<sup>6</sup>A deposition process on mRNA. <italic>PPP4</italic> knockdown impaired interaction between WTAP and ISG promoter region, linking the interaction efficiency to phase transition of WTAP (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). WTAP 5ST-D mutant THP-1 cells exhibited significantly reduced binding ability with ISG promoter regions compared to WT WTAP and 5ST-A mutant THP-1 cells after IFN-β stimulation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>), which consistent with the m<sup>6</sup>A modification results (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Hex treatment also restrained the interaction between WTAP and ISGs promoter regions in WT WTAP and WTAP 5ST-A cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>), consistent with the m<sup>6</sup>A modification results (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Collectively, WTAP phase separation was important for the promoter regions targeting and subsequent m<sup>6</sup>A deposition on ISG mRNAs.</p>

<p>Taken together, our findings revealed the driving force of aggregation and liquid condensates formation of WTAP, and demonstrated the distinct function between aggregates and liquid-phase separated WTAP. Based on our findings, we proposed a working model of WTAP phase transition in the regulation of m<sup>6</sup>A modification of ISG mRNAs under IFN-β stimulation. In untreated cells, hyperphosphorylated WTAP tended to form gel-like aggregates with lower mobility, restricting interaction between WTAP-dependent MTC and ISG promoter region. After IFN-β stimulation, protein phosphatase PPP4 mediated the dephosphorylation of WTAP, resulting in the phase transition from aggregates to liquid-phase of WTAP. Liquid-phase WTAP exhibited enhanced mobility, recruiting METTL3 and nucleus-translocated STAT1 to form STAT1-WTAP-METTL3 condensates. Guided by STAT1, these condensates were able to bind with ISG promoter regions and mediate the m<sup>6</sup>A modification of ISG mRNAs during the STAT1-driven transcription process, thereby prompting diverse regulation on stability of ISG mRNAs. Our work uncovered how WTAP phase transition couples gene transcription with mRNA modification, providing a novel mechanism on multi-layer regulation of ISGs expression via m<sup>6</sup>A modification (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Type I IFN response is a crucial part of the antiviral immunity, which is strictly controlled by various types of regulation to avoid unexpected tissue damages. m<sup>6</sup>A deposition is one of the most widespread post-transcriptional modifications, which is involved in various aspects of RNA metabolism to regulate different biological events, including antiviral response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Garcias Morales &amp; Reyes, 2021</xref>). m<sup>6</sup>A deposition on IFN-β mRNA is reported to dampen type-I IFN production by destabilizing transcripts, yet no m<sup>6</sup>A is detected on ISG mRNAs in the same study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Winkler et al., 2019</xref>). Subsequent works, however, reveal the diverse effects on antiviral responses mediated by the m<sup>6</sup>A modification of ISG mRNAs. hnRNPA2B1-dependent m<sup>6</sup>A modification of <italic>cGAS</italic>, <italic>IFI16</italic> and <italic>STING</italic> promotes their nuclear exportation to amplify the cytoplasmic innate sensor signaling, while METTL3/METTL14-mediated m<sup>6</sup>A modification on IFITM1 and MX1 up-regulates their translation efficiency to positively regulate the antiviral response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">McFadden et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">McFadden et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">L. Wang, Wen, &amp; Cao, 2019</xref>). Conversely, m<sup>6</sup>A modification destabilizes IRF7 mRNA to suppress antiviral responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">A. Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Virus hijacks MTC components (e.g., WTAP degradation) to suppress the translational of <italic>IRF3</italic> and stability of <italic>IFNAR1</italic> mRNA via reduced m<sup>6</sup>A deposition, thereby exacerbating antiviral dysregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Ge et al., 2021</xref>). In our study, we employed IFN-β treatment to avoid the influence of m<sup>6</sup>A modification-mediated IFN-β mRNA decay, experimentally validated m<sup>6</sup>A deposition on a subset of ISG mRNAs fine-tunes antiviral responses by reducing transcript stability, maintaining a steady antiviral response and alleviates the hyper-activation of IFN-β signaling. Our findings together demonstrated the diverse function of m<sup>6</sup>A modification on ISG mRNAs, including suppression of transcription, promotion of translation, regulation of mRNA stabilization or even the cellular trafficking of mRNA, highlighting the complexity of m<sup>6</sup>A modification in mRNA fate determination, and emphasizing the needs of precise regulation on immune response.</p>
<p>WTAP, a core scaffolding protein of MTC, recruits and stabilizes other MTC components, such as METTL3 and METTL14, into nuclear speckles. Abnormal expression of WTAP is discovered in multiple diseases, including cancer or diabetes, to address dysfunctional m<sup>6</sup>A modification in specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Q. Huang, Mo, Liao, Chen, &amp; Zhang, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Z. X. Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yu et al., 2021</xref>). However, how WTAP reacts in response to specific stimulation and selectively targets specific mRNA remains unclear. Here, we focused on the function of WTAP on antiviral response, uncovered the novel mechanism that WTAP underwent IFN-β-induced dephosphorylation-mediated gel-to-liquid phase transition, which mediated its interaction with transcription factor STAT1, directing MTC to conduct the m<sup>6</sup>A modification on nascent ISG mRNAs co-transcriptionally.</p>
<p>Phase separation is a well-known phenomenon associated with the formation of membraneless organelles, which concentrates the substrates and enzymes and accelerates biochemistry reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alberti, Gladfelter, &amp; Mittag, 2019</xref>). Previous researches uncover the involvement of phase separation in m<sup>6</sup>A modification process, METTL3 and YTHDFs undergo LLPS during the m<sup>6</sup>A deposition and recognition process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Han et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">J. Li et al., 2022</xref>), and m<sup>6</sup>A modification promotes the LLPS of RNA-binding proteins, including m<sup>6</sup>A-mRNA-YTHDFs and m<sup>6</sup>A-eRNA/YTHDC1/BRD4 condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Gao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lee et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Ries et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">J. Wang et al., 2020</xref>). However, whether other MTC components exhibits phase separation is still unknown. Here, we observed that WTAP also went through phase separation both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo.</italic> We found WTAP mainly formed the aggregates with lower mobility in untreated cells, and transited to liquid condensates with IFN-β treatment, implying that phase separation participated in WTAP-dependent m<sup>6</sup>A deposition under IFN-β stimulation. We found hex treatment or phospho-mimic mutations (5ST-D) trapped WTAP in low-mobility aggregates, impairing ISG promoter binding and m<sup>6</sup>A deposition. These results uncovered the mechanism and the crucial role of WTAP phase separation and phase transition in MTC assembly and ISGs m<sup>6</sup>A deposition under IFN-β stimulation. Furthermore, the phase transition of WTAP suggested a potential mechanism that aggregation of WTAP might work as a backup storage, and the stimuli-induced phase transition was developed to perform the m<sup>6</sup>A modification timely and precisely in response to the requirement of cell development or abnormal situations. Thus, investigation of WTAP phase separation in different model could be conducted to explain the mechanism of m<sup>6</sup>A modification under complex stimulation and explore possible therapeutic targets of multiple diseases.</p>
<p>Post-translational modifications are one of the most common ways to modulate characteristic of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Y. Y. Luo, Wu, &amp; Li, 2021</xref>), like phosphorylation of serine and threonine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Markevich, Hoek, &amp; Kholodenko, 2004</xref>) and methylation of arginine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Guccione &amp; Richard, 2019</xref>). Several reports indicate that phosphorylation of phase-separated proteins are associated with the solid/gel-like aggregates formation or solid/gel-to-liquid phase transition, participating in various physiological process such as the pathogenesis of tau protein aggregates or acute transcriptional response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arendt, Stieler, &amp; Holzer, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Boyko et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">H. Zhang et al., 2022</xref>), but whether the phosphorylation-controlled phase transition of proteins regulate other physiological process remains to be illustrated. In this study, we observed PPP4-mediated dephosphorylation of WTAP at serine/threonine residues triggered a gel-to-liquid phase transition, enabling STAT1-MTC recruitment. Consistently, phosphomimic 5ST-D mutant of WTAP mainly aggregated as lower mobility form compared to phosphodeficient 5ST-A mutant of WTAP, which formed liquid condensates in cells, indicating that phosphorylation level of WTAP balanced its phase transition. Therefore, our findings shed light on the mechanism of post-translational modification-regulated phase transition of WTAP and put forward an open question whether phosphorylation and other post-translational modifications function as the key strategy for global phase transition of proteins <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Since we found the phase transition event of WTAP and its interaction with transcription factor STAT1, we proposed that co-transcriptional m<sup>6</sup>A modification on nascent ISG transcripts might occur during IFN-β stimulation. As a global modification in cells, m<sup>6</sup>A modification can be hindered by MTC along with the inhibition role of exon junction complex, lead to the specificity of modification, mapping the m<sup>6</sup>A topology and maintain in stable state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">He et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Z. Luo et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Uzonyi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yang, Triboulet, Liu, Sendinc, &amp; Gregory, 2022</xref>). More and more results suggest that MTC can be recruited by methylated histone proteins or transcription factors, enrich in different chromatin loci, such as promoter, to dynamically deposit m<sup>6</sup>A modification on nascent mRNA co-transcriptionally under certain circumstance or function in various physiological activities, implying the importance of interaction between MTC and chromatin architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dou et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Sendinc &amp; Shi, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Xu et al., 2022</xref>). Transcription factor SMAD2/3, STAT5B, KLF9 and CEBPZ are found to recruit MTC on transcriptional start sites (TSS) and specifically direct the m<sup>6</sup>A modification on a subset of downstream transcripts mRNA CDS region, thereby affecting the cell fate decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barbieri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bertero et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bhattarai et al., 2024</xref>). In line with this, we validated that the IFN-β-induced WTAP-STAT1 interaction guided MTC to the promoter regions of ISGs to direct the m<sup>6</sup>A modification on ISG mRNAs. We also revealed that the WTAP-mediated m<sup>6</sup>A modification of ISG mRNAs mainly occurs within the coding regions, different from its distribution in the general transcriptome that enriched within mRNA 3’-UTR. Our findings raised a novel perspective that transcription factor-MTC interaction directed co-transcriptional m<sup>6</sup>A modification to balance immune activation and homeostasis.</p>
<p>Taken together, our study drew a full picture of the phase transition of WTAP and the function of STAT1-MTC directed m<sup>6</sup>A modification on ISG mRNAs under IFN-β stimulation. Our findings unraveled a novel mechanism of fine-tuning m<sup>6</sup>A methylated mRNA profile under stimulation, and provided a possible therapeutic target in antiviral responses and many other diseases.</p>

Recombinant mCherry-WTAP, CFP-METTL3 and GFP-STAT1 were cloned into pET-28A plasmid, while ST-D and 5ST-A mutants of WTAP were constructed by mutating the pET-28A-mCherry-WTAP plasmid using Muta-direct<sup>TM</sup> Kit (Sbsgene, cat. #SDM-15). After transformed into <italic>E.</italic> coli, protein was extracted as shown in <italic>Supplementary Appendix, Extended Methods</italic>.</p>
<p>For detection of interaction among mCherry-WTAP or its indicated mutants, CFP-METTL3 and GFP-STAT, purified proteins were mixed using physiological buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 10% PEG8000) in the final concentration of 10 μM and placed on the slides. Mixtures were incubated and imaged at 37°C in a live-cell-imaging chamber of Leica TCS-SP8 STED 3X confocal fluorescence microscope while images were analyzed by LAS AF software.</p>

<title>Phase separation assay and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)</title>
<p>Expression, purification, and interaction of mCherry-WT WTAP, 5ST-A/ST-D mutants, CFP-METTL3 and GFP-STAT1 were shown in <italic>Supplementary Appendix, Extended Methods</italic>. For <italic>in vitro</italic> phase separation assay, recombinant mCherry-WT WTAP, NTD, CTD, ΔPLD, 5ST-D and 5ST-A mutants in indicated concentration were mixed with physiological buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 10% PEG8000). After incubation, turbid solution in the 200 μL PCR tubes were directed observed. For further capture of fluorescence images, solution of recombinant mCherry-WTAP and physiological buffer were treated with or without hex at a final concentration of 10% and placed on dishes. Leica TCS-SP8 STED 3X confocal fluorescence microscope with live-cell-imaging chamber at 37°C was used to capture fluorescence images and the 3D images. For in cells separation assay, plasmids expression mCherry-WT WTAP, 5ST-D and 5ST-A were transfected into HeLa cells for 24 hours, and treated with or without 5% hex and 20 μg/mL digitonin for 1 hour. Leica TCS-SP8 STED 3X confocal fluorescence microscope with live-cell-imaging chamber at 37°C was used to capture fluorescence images. For observing the fusion of condensates, recombinant mCherry-WTAP mixed with physiological buffer or HeLa cells transfected with mCherry-WTAP plasmids were incubated in the live-cell-imaging chamber at 37°C and. Images were captured by Leica TCS-SP8 STED 3X confocal fluorescence microscope, while deconvolution was conducted by Huygens software.</p>
<p>For <italic>in vitro</italic> FRAP experiments were performed on Leica TCS-SP8 STED 3X confocal fluorescence microscope. Recombinant mCherry-WT WTAP, NTD, CTD, 5ST-D and 5ST-A mutants in indicated concentration was mixed with physiological buffer on dishes. For in cells FRAP experiment, HeLa cells transfected with mCherry-WT WTAP, 5ST-D and 5ST-A mutants were treated as indicated. Samples were imaged with Leica TCS-SP8 STED 3X confocal fluorescence microscope with live-cell-imaging chamber at 37°C. Spots of mCherry-WTAP foci were photobleached with 100% laser power using 567-nm lasers followed with time-lapse images. Images were analyzed by LAS AF software. Fluorescence intensities of regions of interest (ROIs) were corrected by unbleached control regions and then normalized to pre-bleached intensities of the ROIs.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study puts forth the model that under IFN-B stimulation, liquid-phase WTAP coordinates with the transcription factor STAT1 to recruit MTC to the promoter region of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs), mediating the installation of m6A on newly synthesized ISG mRNAs. This model is supported by strong evidence that the phosphorylation state of WTAP, regulated by PPP4, is regulated by IFN-B stimulation, and that this results in interactions between WTAP, the m6A methyltransferase complex, and STAT1, a transcription factor that mediates activation of ISGs. This was demonstrated via a combination of microscopy, immunoprecipitations, m6A sequencing, and ChIP. These experiments converge on a set of experiments that nicely demonstrate that IFN-B stimulation increases the interaction between WTAP, METTL3, and STAT1, that this interaction is lost with knockdown of WTAP (even in the presence of IFN-B), and that this IFN-B stimulation also induces METTL3-ISG interactions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The evidence for the IFN-B stimulated interaction between METTL3 and STAT1, mediated by WTAP, is quite strong. Removal of WTAP in this system seems to be sufficient to reduce these interactions and the concomitant m6A methylation of ISGs. The conclusion that the phosphorylation state of WTAP is important in this process is also quite well supported. The authors have now also provided substantial evidence that phase separation of WTAP upon interferon stimulation facilitates m6A-methylation of multiple interferon stimulated genes.</p>

<p>In this study, Cai and colleagues investigate how one component of the m6A methyltransferase complex, the WTAP protein, responds to IFNb stimulation. They find that viral infection or IFNb stimulation induces the transition of WTAP from aggregates to liquid droplets through dephosphorylation by PPP4. This process affects the m6A modification levels of ISG mRNAs and modulates their stability. In addition, the WTAP droplets interact with the transcription factor STAT1 to recruit the methyltransferase complex to ISG promoters and enhance m6A modification during transcription. The investigation dives into a previously unexplored area of how viral infection or IFNb stimulation affects m6A modification on ISGs. The observation that WTAP undergoes a phase transition is significant in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying m6A's function in immunity. However, there are still key gaps that should be addressed to fully accept the model presented.</p>
<p>Major points:</p>
<p>
(1) More detailed analyses on the effects of WTAPsgRNA on the m6A modification of ISGs:</p>
<p>
a. A comprehensive summary of the ISGs, including the percentage of ISGs that are m6A-modified,</p>
<p>
b. The distribution of m6A modification across the ISGs, and</p>
<p>
c. A comparison of the m6A modification distribution in ISGs with non-ISGs.</p>
<p>
In addition, since the authors propose a novel mechanism where the interaction between phosphorylated STAT1 and WTAP direct the MTC to the promoter regions of ISGs to facilitate co-transcriptional m6A modification, it is critical to analyze whether the m6A modification distribution holds true in the data.</p>
<p>(2) Since a key part of the model includes the cytosol-localized STAT1 protein undergoing phosphorylation to translocate to the nucleus to mediate gene expression, the authors should focus on the interaction between phosphorylated STAT1 and WTAP in Figure 4, rather than the unphosphorylated STAT1. Only phosphorylated STAT1 localizes to the nucleus, so the presence of pSTAT1 in the immunoprecipitate is critical for establishing a functional link between STAT1 activation and its interaction with WTAP.</p>
<p>(3) The authors should include pSTAT1 ChIP-seq and WTAP ChIP-seq on IFNb-treated samples in Figure 5 to allow for a comprehensive and unbiased genomic analysis for comparing the overlaps of peaks from both ChIP-seq datasets. These results should further support for their hypothesis that WTAP interacts with pSTAT1 to enhance m6A modifications on ISGs.</p>
<p>Minor points:</p>
<p>
(1) Since IFNb is primarily known for modulating biological processes through gene transcription, it would be informative if the authors discussed the mechanism of how IFNb would induce the interaction between WTAP and PPP4.</p>
<p>(2) The authors should include mCherry alone controls in Figure 1D to demonstrate that mCherry does not contribute to the phase separation of WTAP. Does mCherry have or lack a PLD?</p>
<p>(3) The authors should clarify the immunoprecipitation assays in the methods. For example, the labeling in Fig. 2A suggests that antibodies against WTAP and pan-p were used for two immunoprecipitations. Is that accurate?</p>
<p>(4) The authors should include overall m6A modification levels quantified of GFPsgRNA and WTAPsgRNA cells, either by mass spectrometry (preferably) or dot blot.</p>

<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study puts forth the model that under IFN-B stimulation, liquid-phase WTAP coordinates with the transcription factor STAT1 to recruit MTC to the promoter region of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), mediating the installation of m<sup>6</sup>A on newly synthesized ISG mRNAs. This model is supported by strong evidence that the phosphorylation state of WTAP, regulated by PPP4, is regulated by IFN-B stimulation, and that this results in interactions between WTAP, the m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase complex, and STAT1, a transcription factor that mediates activation of ISGs. This was demonstrated via a combination of microscopy, immunoprecipitations, m<sup>6</sup>A sequencing, and ChIP. These experiments converge on a set of experiments that nicely demonstrate that IFN-B stimulation increases the interaction between WTAP, METTL3, and STAT1, that this interaction is lost with the knockdown of WTAP (even in the presence of IFN-B), and that this IFN-B stimulation also induces METTL3-ISG interactions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The evidence for the IFN-B stimulated interaction between METTL3 and STAT1, mediated by WTAP, is quite strong. Removal of WTAP in this system seems to be sufficient to reduce these interactions and the concomitant m<sup>6</sup>A methylation of ISGs. The conclusion that the phosphorylation state of WTAP is important in this process is also quite well supported.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The evidence that the above mechanism is fundamentally driven by different phase-separated pools of WTAP (regulated by its phosphorylation state) is weaker. These experiments rely relatively heavily on the treatment of cells with 1,6-hexanediol, which has been shown to have some off-target effects on phosphatases and kinases (PMID 33814344).</p>
<p>Given that the model invoked in this study depends on the phosphorylation (or lack thereof) of WTAP, this is a particularly relevant concern.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful for the reviewer’s positive comment and constructive feedback. 1,6-hexanediol (hex) was considered an inhibitor of hydrophobic interaction, thereby capable of dissolving protein phase separation condensates. Hex (5%-10% w/v) was still widely used to explore the phase separation characteristic and function on various protein, including some phosphorylated proteins such as pHSF1, or kinases such as NEMO1-3. Since hydrophobic interactions involved in various types of protein-protein interaction, the off-target effects of hex were inevitable. It has been reported that hex impaired RNA polymerase II CTD-specific phosphatase and kinase activity at 5% concentration4, which led to the reviewer’s concern. In response to this concern, we investigated the phosphorylation level of WTAP under hex concentration gradient treatment. Surprisingly, we found that both 2% and 5% hex maintained the PPP4c-mediated dephosphorylation level of WTAP but still led to the dissolution of WTAP LLPS condensates (Figure 5-figure supplement 1H; Author response image 1), indicating that hex dispersed WTAP phase separation in a phosphorylation-independent manner. Consistent with our findings, Ge et al. used 10% hex to dissolve WTAP phase separation condensates5. Additionally, we found the phosphorylation level of STAT1 was not affected by both 2% and 5% hex, revealing the off-target and impairment function of hex on kinases or phosphatases might not be universal (Figure 5-figure supplement 1H). Collectively, since the 5% hex we used did not influence the de-phosphorylation event of WTAP, function of WTAP LLPS mediating interaction between methylation complex and STAT1 revealed by our results was independent from its phosphorylation status.</p>

<p>Related to this point, it is also interesting (and potentially concerning for the proposed model) that the initial region of WTAP that was predicted to be disordered is in fact not the region that the authors demonstrate is important for the different phase-separated states.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A considerable number of proteins undergo phase separation via interactions between intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). IDR contains more charged and polar amino acids to present multiple weakly interacting elements, while lacking hydrophobic amino acids to show flexible conformations6. In our study, we used PLAAC websites (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://plaac.wi.mit.edu/">http://plaac.wi.mit.edu/</ext-link>) to predict IDR domain of WTAP, and a fragment (234-249 amino acids) was predicted as prion-like domain (PLD). However, deletion of this fragment failed to abolish the phase separation properties of WTAP, which might be the main confusion to reviewers. To explain this issue, we checked the WTAP structure (within part of MTC complex) from protein data bank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/7VF2">https://www.rcsb.org/structure/7VF2</ext-link>) and found that the prediction of IDR has been renewed due to the update of different algorithm. IDR of WTAP expanded to 245-396 amino acids, encompassing the entire CTD region. Our results demonstrate that the CTD was critical for WTAP LLPS, as CTD deficiency significantly inhibited the formation of liquid condensates both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in cells. Also, phosphorylation sites on CTD were important for the phase transition of WTAP. These observations highlight the phosphorylation status on CTD region as a key driving force of phase separation, consistent with the established role of IDR in regulating LLPS. We have revised our description on WTAP IDR in our article following the reviewers’ suggestion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Taking all the data together, it is also not clear to me that one has to invoke phase separation in the proposed mechanism.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In this article, we observed that WTAP underwent phase transition during virus infection and IFN-β treatment, and proposed a novel mechanism whereby post translational modification (PTM)-driven WTAP LLPS was required for the m<sup>6</sup>A modification of ISG mRNAs. To verify the hypothesis, we first demonstrated the relationship between PTM and phase separation of WTAP. We constructed WTAP 5ST-D and 5ST-A mutant to mimic WTAP phosphorylation and dephosphorylation status respectively, and figured out that dephosphorylated WTAP underwent LLPS. We also found that PPP4 was the main phosphatase to regulate WTAP dephosphorylation. To further investigation, we introduced the potent PPP4 inhibitor, fostriecin. Consistent with our findings in PPP4 deficient model, fostriecin treatment significantly inhibited the IFN-β-induced dephosphorylation of WTAP and disrupted its LLPS condensates, indicating that PPP4 was the key phosphatase recruited by IFN-β to regulate WTAP, confirming that PTM governs WTAP LLPS dynamics (Figure 2-figure supplement 1C and H). Furthermore, fostriecin-induced impairment of WTAP phosphorylation and phase separation correlated with reduced m<sup>6</sup>A modification level and elevated ISGs expression level (Figure 4C and Figure 4-figure supplement 1E). These findings together emphasized that dephosphorylation is required for WTAP LLPS.</p>
<p>As for the function of WTAP LLPS, we assumed that WTAP might undergo LLPS to sequester STAT1 together with m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase complex (MTC) for mediating m<sup>6</sup>A deposition on ISG mRNAs co-transcriptionally under IFN-β stimulation. Given that hex dissolved WTAP LLPS condensates without affecting dephosphorylation status (Figure 5-figure supplement 1H; Author response image 1), various experiments we performed previously actually confirmed the critical role of WTAP LLPS during m<sup>6</sup>A modification (Figure 4A), as well as the mechanism that WTAP phase separation enhanced the interaction between MTC and STAT1 (Figure 5E-F). Subsequent to reviewer’s comments, more experiments were conducted for further validation. We found the WTAP liquid condensates formed by wild type (WT) WTAP or WTAP 5ST-A mutant (which mimics dephosphorylated-WTAP) could be dissembled by hex, which also led to the impairment of the interaction between STAT1, METTL3 and WTAP (Figure 5-figure supplement 1E). In addition, <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments demonstrated that hex treatment significantly disrupted the interaction between recombinant GFP-STAT1 and mCherry-WTAP which expressed in the <italic>E. coli</italic> system (Figure 5F and Figure 5-figure supplement 1G). Notably, this prokaryotic expression system lacks endogenous phosphorylation machinery, resulting in non-phosphorylated mCherry-WTAP. For further validation, we performed the interaction of WTAP WT or 5ST-A with the promoter regions of ISG as well as the m<sup>6</sup>A modification of ISG mRNAs were attenuated by WTAP LLPS dissolution (Figure 4E and Figure 6E). These findings together revealed that WTAP LLPS were the critical mediators of the STAT1-MTC interactions, ISG promoter regions binding and the co-transcription m<sup>6</sup>A modification.</p>
<p>Collectively, our results demonstrated that IFN-β treatment recruited PPP4c to dephosphorylate WTAP, thereby driving the formation of WTAP liquid condensates which were essential for facilitating STAT1-MTC interaction and m<sup>6</sup>A deposition, subsequently mediated ISG expression. Since we revealed a strong association between PTM-regulated WTAP phase transition and its m<sup>6</sup>A modification function, WTAP LLPS was a novel and functionally distinct mechanism that must be reckoned with in this study.</p>

<p>In this study, Cai and colleagues investigate how one component of the m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase complex, the WTAP protein, responds to IFNb stimulation. They find that viral infection or IFNb stimulation induces the transition of WTAP from aggregates to liquid droplets through dephosphorylation by PPP4.

The observation that WTAP undergoes a phase transition is significant in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying m<sup>6</sup>A's function in immunity. However, there are still key gaps that should be addressed to fully accept the model presented.</p>
<p>Major points:</p>
<p>(1) More detailed analyses on the effects of WTAP sgRNA on the m<sup>6</sup>A modification of ISGs:</p>
<p>a. A comprehensive summary of the ISGs, including the percentage of ISGs that are m<sup>6</sup>A-modified. merip-isg percentage</p>
<p>b. The distribution of m<sup>6</sup>A modification across the ISGs. Topology</p>
<p>c. A comparison of the m<sup>6</sup>A modification distribution in ISGs with non-ISGs. Topology</p>
<p>In addition, since the authors propose a novel mechanism where the interaction between phosphorylated STAT1 and WTAP directs the MTC to the promoter regions of ISGs to facilitate co-transcriptional m<sup>6</sup>A modification, it is critical to analyze whether the m<sup>6</sup>A modification distribution holds true in the data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s summary of our manuscript and the constructive assessment. We have conducted the related analysis accordingly to present the m<sup>6</sup>A modification in ISGs in our model as reviewers suggested. Our results showed that about 64.29% of core ISGs were m<sup>6</sup>A modified under IFN-β stimulation (Figure 3-figure supplement 1B; Figure 3G), which was consistent with the similar percentage in previous studies[7,8]. The m<sup>6</sup>A distribution of the ISGs transcripts including <italic>IFIT1</italic>, <italic>IFIT2</italic>, <italic>OAS1</italic> and <italic>OAS2</italic> was validated (Figure 3-figure supplement 1H).</p>
<p>Generally, m<sup>6</sup>A deposition preferentially located in the vicinity of stop codon, while m<sup>6</sup>A modification was highly dynamic under different cellular condition. However, we compared the topology of m<sup>6</sup>A deposition of ISGs with non-ISGs, and found that m<sup>6</sup>A modification of ISG mRNAs showed higher preference of coding sequences (CDS) localization compared to global m<sup>6</sup>A deposition (Figure 3H). Similarly, various researches uncovered the m<sup>6</sup>A deposition regulated by co-transcriptionally m<sup>6</sup>A modification preferred to locate in the CDS [9-11]. Since our results of m<sup>6</sup>A modification distribution of ISGs was consistent with the co-transcriptional m<sup>6</sup>A modification characteristics, we believed that our hypothesis and results were correlated and consistent.</p>

<p>(2) Since a key part of the model includes the cytosol-localized STAT1 protein undergoing phosphorylation to translocate to the nucleus to mediate gene expression, the authors should focus on the interaction between phosphorylated STAT1 and WTAP in Figure 4, rather than the unphosphorylated STAT1. Only phosphorylated STAT1 localizes to the nucleus, so the presence of pSTAT1 in the immunoprecipitate is critical for establishing a functional link between STAT1 activation and its interaction with WTAP.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the constructive comments. As we showed in Figure 4, we found the enhanced interaction between phase-separated WTAP and the nuclear-translocated STAT1 which were phosphorylated under IFN-β stimulation, indicating the importance of phosphorylation of STAT1. We repeated the immunoprecipitation experiments to clarify the function of pSTAT1 in WTAP interaction. Our results showed that IFN-β stimulation induced the interaction of WTAP with both pSTAT1 and STAT1 (Figure 5-figure supplement 1C), indicating that most of the WTAP-associated STAT1 was phosphorylated. Taken together, our data proved that LLPS WTAP bound with nuclear-translocated pSTAT1 under IFN-β stimulation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors should include pSTAT1 ChIP-seq and WTAP ChIP-seq on IFNb-treated samples in Figure 5 to allow for a comprehensive and unbiased genomic analysis for comparing the overlaps of peaks from both ChIP-seq datasets. These results should further support their hypothesis that WTAP interacts with pSTAT1 to enhance m<sup>6</sup>A modifications on ISGs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising this thoughtful comment. In this study, MeRIP-seq and RNA-seq along with immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence experiments supported that phase transition of WTAP enhanced its interaction to pSTAT1, thus mediating ISGs m<sup>6</sup>A modification and expression by enhancing its interaction with nuclear-translocated pSTAT1 during virus infection and IFN-β stimulation. However, how WTAP-mediated m<sup>6</sup>A modification was related to STAT1-mediated transcription remained unclear. Several researches have revealed the recruitment of m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase complex (MTC) to transcription start sites (TSS) of coding genes and R-loop structure by interacting with transcriptional factors STAT5B, SMAD2/3, DNA helicase DDX21, indicating the engagement of MTC mediated m<sup>6</sup>A modification on nascent transcripts at the very beginning of transcription [11-13]. These researches inspired us that phase-separated WTAP could be recruited to the ISG promoter regions via interacting with nuclear-translocated pSTAT1. To validate this mechanism, we have conducted ChIP-qPCR experiments targeting STAT1 and WTAP, revealed that IFN-β induced the comparable recruitment dynamics of both STAT1 and WTAP to ISG promoter regions (Figure 6A-B). Notably, STAT1 deficiency significantly abolished the bindings between WTAP and ISG promoter regions (Figure 6C). These findings established nuclear-translocated STAT1-dependent recruitment of phase separated WTAP and ISG promoter region, substantiated our hypothesis within the current study. We totally agree that ChIP-seq data will be more supportive to explore the mechanism in depth. We will continuously focus on the whole genome chromatin distribution of WTAP and explore more functional effect of transcriptional factor-dependent WTAP-promoter regions interaction in the future.</p>

<p>(1) Since IFNb is primarily known for modulating biological processes through gene transcription, it would be informative if the authors discussed the mechanism of how IFNb would induce the interaction between WTAP and PPP4.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Protein phosphatase 4 (PPP4) is a multi-subunit serine/threonine phosphatase complex that participates in diverse biologic process, including DDR, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis[14]. Several signaling pathway such as NF-κB and mTOR signaling, can be regulated by PPP4. Previous research showed that deficiency of PPP4 enhanced IFN-β downstream signaling and ISGs expression, which was consistent with our findings that knockdown of PPP4C impaired WTAP-mediated m<sup>6</sup>A modification, enhanced the ISGs expression[15,16]. Since there was no significant enhancement in PPP4 expression level during 0-3 hours of IFN-β stimulation in our results, we explored the PTM that may influence the protein-protein interaction, such as ubiquitination. Intriguingly, we found the ubiquitination level of PPP4 was enhanced after IFN-β stimulation, which may affect the interaction between PPP4 and WTAP (Author response image 3). Further investigation between PPP4 and WTAP will be conducted in our future study.</p>

<p>(2) The authors should include mCherry alone controls in Figure 1D to demonstrate that mCherry does not contribute to the phase separation of WTAP. Does mCherry have or lack a PLD?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>According to the crystal structure of mCherry protein in protein structure database RCSB-PDB, mCherry protein presents as a β-barrel protein, with no IDRs or multivalent interaction domains including PLD, indicating that mCherry protein has no capability to undergo phase separation. This characteristic makes it a suitable protein to tag and trace the localization or expression levels of proteins, and a negative control for protein phase separation studies. As the reviewer suggested, we include mCherry alone controls in the revised version (Figure 1D).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors should clarify the immunoprecipitation assays in the methods. For example, the labeling in Figure 2A suggests that antibodies against WTAP and pan-p were used for two immunoprecipitations. Is that accurate?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Due to the lack of phosphorylated-WTAP antibody, the detection of phosphorylation of WTAP was conducted by WTAP-antibody-mediated immunoprecipitation. We conducted immunoprecipitation to pull-down WTAP protein by WTAP antibody, then used antibody against phosphoserine/threonine/tyrosine (pan-p) to detect the phosphorylation level of WTAP. To avoid the misunderstanding, we have modified the description from pan-p to pWTAP (pan-p) in figures and revised the figure legends.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank reviewer for raising these useful suggestions. As we showed in Figure 3F and J-K, the m<sup>6</sup>A modification event and degradation of ISG mRNAs were significantly depleted in <italic>WTAP</italic><sup>sgRNA</sup> cell lines, indicating that function of WTAP was deficient. Thus, we used the <italic>WTAP</italic><sup>sgRNA</sup> #2 cell line to perform most of our experiment.

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study presents a valuable finding on the mechanism used by WTAP to modulate the IFN-β stimulation. It describes the phase transition of WTAP driven by IFN-β-induced dephosphorylation. The evidence supporting the claims of the authors is solid, although major analysis and controls would strengthen the impact of the findings. Additionally, more attention to the figure design and to the text would help the reader to understand the major findings.</p>
<p>Strength:</p>
<p>The key finding is the revelation that WTAP undergoes phase separation during virus infection or IFN-β treatment. The authors conducted a series of precise experiments to uncover the mechanism behind WTAP phase separation and identified the regulatory role of 5 phosphorylation sites. They also succeeded in pinpointing the phosphatase involved.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, as the authors acknowledge, it is already widely known in the field that IFN and viral infection regulate m<sup>6</sup>A mRNAs and ISGs. Therefore, a more detailed discussion could help the reader interpret the obtained findings in light of previous research.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful for the positive comments and the unbiased advice by the reviewer. To interpret our findings in previous research, we have revised the manuscript carefully and added more detailed discussion on ISG mRNAs m<sup>6</sup>A modification during virus infection or IFN stimulation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It is well-known that protein concentration drives phase separation events. Similarly, previous studies and some of the figures presented by the authors show an increase in WTAP expression upon IFN treatment. The authors do not discuss the contribution of WTAP expression levels to the phase separation event observed upon IFN treatment. Similarly, METTL3 and METTL14, as well as other proteins of the MTC are upregulated upon IFN treatment. How does the MTC protein concentration contribute to the observed phase separation event?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank reviewer for pointing out the importance of the concentration dependent phase transition. Previously, Ge et al. discovered that expression level of WTAP was up-regulated during LPS stimulation, thereby promoting WTAP phase separation ability and m<sup>6</sup>A modification, indicating that WTAP concentration indeed affects the phase separation event. In our article, we have generated the phase diagram with different concentration of recombinant mCherry-WTAP <italic>in vitro</italic> (Figure 1-figure supplement 1C). For in cells experiments, we constructed the TRE-mCherry-WTAP HeLa cells in which the expression of mCherry-WTAP was induced by doxycycline (Dox) in a dose-dependent manner (Author response image 5A). We detected the LLPS of mCherry-WTAP at different concentrations by increasing the doses of Dox, and found that WTAP automatically underwent LLPS only in an artificially high expression level (Author response image 5B). However, the cells we used to detect the WTAP phase separation in our article was mCherry-WTAP-rescued HeLa cells, in which mCherry-WTAP was introduced in <italic>WTAP</italic><sup>sgRNA</sup> HeLa cells to stably express mCherry-WTAP. We had adjusted and verified the mCherry-WTAP expression level precisely to make the protein abundance similar to endogenous WTAP in wild type (WT) HeLa cells (Author response image 5C). We also repeated the IFN-β stimulation experiments and found no significant increase of WTAP protein level (Figure 5-figure supplement 1A). These findings indicated the phase separation of WTAP in our article was not artificially induced due to the extremely high protein expression level.</p>
<p>MTC protein expression level was crucial for m<sup>6</sup>A modification during virus infection event. Rubio et al. and Winkler et al. revealed that WTAP, METTL3 and METTL14 were up-regulated after 24 hours of HCMV infection[8,17]. Recently, Ge et al. proposed that WTAP protein was degraded after 12 hours of VSV and HSV stimulation5,18. However, these studies only focused on the virus infection event, how the MTC protein expression change after direct IFN-β stimulation was still unclear. Our study investigated the transition change of WTAP under IFNβ stimulation in a short time, we detected the expression level of MTC proteins within 6 hours of IFN-β treatment, and found no significant enhancement of WTAP, METTL3 or METTL14 protein level and mRNA level (Figure 5-figure supplement 1B and Figure 5-figure supplement 1A;). Our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments showed that introducing CFP-METTL3 protein have no significant influence on WTAP phase separation (Figure 4H). Additionally, we performed in cells experiments and found that increased expression of METTL3 had no effect on WTAP phase separation event (Author response image 5D). Taken together, WTAP phase separation can be promoted by dramatically increased concentration of WTAP both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in cells, but the phase separation of WTAP under IFN-β stimulation in our study was not related with the expression level of MTC proteins.</p>

<p>How is PP4 related to the IFN signaling cascade?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Both reviewer #2 and reviewer #3 raised a similar point on the relationship between PPP4 and IFN signaling. In short, protein phosphatase 4 (PPP4) participates in diverse biologic process, including DDR, cell cycle progression and apoptosis14 and several signaling pathway. Previous research showed that deficiency of PPP4 enhanced IFN-β downstream signaling and ISGs expression, which was consistent with our findings that knockdown of PPP4C impaired WTAP-mediated m<sup>6</sup>A modification, and enhanced the ISGs expression[15,16]. Since there was no significant enhancement in PPP4C expression level during 0-3 hours of IFN-β stimulation in our results, we tried to explore the post-translation modification which may influence the protein-protein interaction, such as ubiquitination. Intriguingly, we found the ubiquitination level of PPP4 was enhanced after IFN-β stimulation, which may affect the interaction between PPP4 and WTAP (Author response image 4). Investigation between PPP4 and WTAP will be conducted in our further study (also see minor points 1 of reviewer#2).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Related to the points raised in 'weaknesses' above, if the authors want to claim that this mechanism is reliant on WTAP phase-separated states, additional controls should be done to demonstrate this. Based on the available data it seems that it is just as likely that the phosphorylation state of WTAP is mediating interactions with other factors and/or altering its subcellular localization, which may or may not be related to phase separation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful for the constructive suggestions. As we showed in , Figure 5-figure supplement 1H; Author response image 1 along with the explanation above, 5% hex dispersed the phase separation condensates of WTAP without affecting its phosphorylation status, proving the interaction between STAT1 and methylation complex impaired by hex was depended on WTAP LLPS but not its phosphorylation status (Figure 5E-H). To further confirmed the recruitment of WTAP LLPS on ISG promoter region, we performed the immunoprecipitation and ChIP-qPCR experiments of wild type (WT) WTAP, 5ST-D and 5ST-A rescued THP-1 cells. Our results uncovered the interaction between de-phosphorylated-mimic WTAP mutant and STAT1, and its binding ability with ISG promoter regions were depleted by hex without affecting its phosphorylation status (Author response image 2, Figure 5-figure supplement 1 F, Figure 6E). Taken together, we identified the de-phosphorylation event that regulated phase transition of WTAP during IFN-β stimulation, and proposed that LLPS of WTAP mediated by dephosphorylation was the key mechanism to bind with STAT1 and mediate the m<sup>6</sup>A modification on ISG mRNAs.</p>

<p>I would suggest performing an IP of WTAP with the 5StoA mutation to confirm the missing interaction with WTAP.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we investigated the interaction between STAT1 and WTAP in WT cells and WTAP 5ST-A-rescued THP-1 cells. Our results showed that interaction between STAT1, METTL3 and WTAP were enhanced with WTAP 5ST-A mutation, which was depleted by hex treatment (Figure 5-figure supplement 1E). Thus, the interaction of WTAP WT or 5ST-A with the promoter regions of ISG were attenuated by WTAP LLPS dissolution (Figure 6E). Taken together, the interaction between STAT1 and MTC were relied on LLPS of WTAP.</p>

<p>In the graphical abstract, it is confusing to represent WTAP as a line. All other proteins are presented as circles. It is easy to confuse WTAP protein with an RNA. Additionally, m<sup>6</sup>A is too big in size. It should be smaller than a protein.</p>
