<title>Abstract</title><p>Infertility affects up to 12% of couples globally, with genetic factors contributing to nearly half of the cases. Advances in genomic technologies have led to the discovery of genes like <italic>Bend2</italic>, which plays a crucial role in gametogenesis. In the testis, <italic>Bend2</italic> expresses two protein isoforms: full-length and a smaller one. Ablation of both proteins results in an arrested spermatogenesis. Because the <italic>Bend2</italic> locus is on the X chromosome, and the <italic>Bend2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> mutants are sterile, BEND2’s role in oogenesis remained elusive.</p>
<p>In this study, we employed a novel <italic>Bend2</italic> mutation that blocks the expression of the full-length BEND2 protein but allows the expression of the smaller BEND2 isoform. Interestingly, this mutation does not confer male sterility and mildly affects spermatogenesis. Thus, it allowed us to study the role of BEND2 in oogenesis. Our findings demonstrate that full-length BEND2 is dispensable for male fertility, and its ablation leads to a reduced establishment of the ovarian reserve. These results reveal a critical role for full-length BEND2 in oogenesis and provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the establishment of the ovarian reserve. Furthermore, these findings hold relevance for the diagnostic landscape of human infertility.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Infertility is a complex and multifaceted issue affecting approximately 8-12% of couples worldwide, with genetic factors playing a significant role in up to 50% of cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Ding and Schimenti, 2021</xref>). The intricate process of human reproduction involves a delicate interplay of numerous genes and biological pathways, making the genetic landscape of infertility both diverse and challenging to unravel.</p>
<p>Advancements in genomic technologies and high-throughput sequencing have facilitated the identification of novel genes implicated in reproductive processes. Among these discoveries, <italic>Bend2</italic> has recently emerged as a novel gene involved in mammalian gametogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Malcher et al., 2022</xref>). BEND2 is a member of the BEN domain-containing protein family, whose members play diverse roles in cellular processes such as transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling, and protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abhiman et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Mouse models have been instrumental in identifying novel genes involved in mammalian fertility. This approach has significantly expanded our understanding of the genetic factors underlying reproductive processes in both males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Garretson et al., 2023</xref>). A recent study reported that BEND2 is required to complete spermatogenesis since it is a crucial regulator of mammalian meiosis in spermatocytes (Ma et al., 2022) Click or tap here to enter text.. BEND2 is specifically expressed in spermatogenic cells shortly before and during the prophase of meiosis I. In the testis, <italic>Bend2</italic> expresses two protein isoforms: full-length, named p140, and smaller one, p80. BEND2 is essential for the transition from zygonema to pachynema, as its knockout in male mice arrests meiosis at this stage. Its absence leads to disrupted synapsis and induced non-homologous chromosomal pairing. BEND2 interacts with multiple chromatin-associated proteins, including components of transcription-repressor complexes. Additionally, BEND2 regulates chromatin accessibility and modifies H3K4me3, influencing the overall chromatin state during spermatogenesis. These functions collectively establish BEND2 as a key regulator of meiosis, gene expression, and chromatin state in mouse male germ cells. Nonetheless, its role in oogenesis remains unexplored since the <italic>Bend2</italic> locus is on the X chromosome, and mutant males are sterile.</p>
<p>In this study, we aimed to elucidate the role of <italic>Bend2</italic> in oogenesis using a novel mutation of <italic>Bend2</italic> that does not confer male sterility. Using this novel <italic>Bend2</italic> mutation, we have investigated the effects of full-length BEND2 ablation on meiosis, oocyte quality, and follicular dynamics. Furthermore, as this mutation does not cause male infertility, it allowed us to investigate the role of BEND2 in mammalian meiosis in more detail. Our findings contribute to expanding our understanding of the genetic factors influencing mammalian fertility and provide potential avenues for diagnosing genetic determinants of human infertility.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>BEND2 is highly expressed in spermatogenic nuclei before meiosis initiation and during early meiotic prophase I, independent of meiotic recombination</title>
<p>Taking advantage of several unannotated transcripts detected in 14 dpp wild-type mouse testis from our previous RNA sequencing analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Marcet Ortega, Roig and Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona. Departament de Biologia Cel·lular, 2016</xref>), we found a novel splice variant of the then annotated <italic>Gm15262</italic> gene, which is an X-linked gene containing two BEN domains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). This variant is specifically expressed in mouse testes and fetal ovaries containing germ cells undergoing meiotic prophase I and shows a nuclear localization at the heterochromatin of spermatocytes when the GFP-tagged splice variant is electroporated to the testes of young mice (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1 A-B</xref>). Thus, we hypothesize this gene could be essential for spermatocyte and oocyte development. Based on sequence homology, we named this <italic>Gm15262</italic> gene as the mouse homolog of the human <italic>Bend2</italic>, and thus, we renamed it <italic>Bend2</italic>, as also proposed by others recently (Ma et al., 2022).</p>

<p>We generated a polyclonal antibody against BEND2 using the novel splice variant of <italic>Bend2</italic> as an immunogen (see validation in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). To examine BEND2 expression during spermatogenesis, we immunostained PFA-fixed testis sections against BEND2 and the DNA damage marker γH2AX to allow the identification of spermatocytes. BEND2 was abundantly detected in the nuclei of the peripheral cells of tubules from stage V until XII-I (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). This nuclear staining first appeared in spermatogonia before DSBs were generated. BEND2 staining was highly present in spermatocytes from pre-leptotene when meiosis initiates and persisted until early pachytene. In late pachytene and diplotene cells, little BEND2 remained in the nuclei of spermatocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Notably, this expression pattern of BEND2 is reminiscent of the one reported before (Ma et al., 2022).</p>

<p>Furthermore, to reveal if the localization of BEND2 in germ cells could have originated as a response to critical events of the meiotic prophase, we examined BEND2 expression in testis sections from recombination-defective mice lacking SPO11. In SPO11-deficient testis, where no DSBs are formed at the onset of meiosis, spermatocytes cannot initiate meiotic recombination, thereby failing to synapse and entering apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barchi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Baudat et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Pacheco et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, we found BEND2 was extensively present in nuclei of spermatogonia, leptotene, zygotene, and zygotene-like spermatocytes, as in wild-type mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Very occasionally, few BEND2 signals could be observed in some SPO11-deficient spermatocytes, presumably at a more advanced pachytene-like stage. This is consistent with its reduced expression after early pachytene in wild-type mice. Similarly, BEND2 expression was not altered in <italic>Dmc1</italic> mutant spermatocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), which cannot complete meiotic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barchi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Pittman et al., 1998</xref>). Altogether, these results indicate that although BEND2 is highly expressed during early meiotic prophase I when meiotic recombination initiates and progresses, its expression starts as early as in spermatogonia before meiosis begins and is independent of either DSB formation or completion of recombination.</p>
<p>We also examined BEND2 expression in 16 dpc fetal ovary sections by IF and found it localizing at nuclei of some zygotene stage oocytes (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1C</xref>). However, due to scarce samples and technical obstacles, we could not characterize BEND2 expression in oocytes at earlier stages from 12-14 dpc ovary sections.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Full-length BEND2 deficiency causes increased apoptosis and persistent unrepaired DSBs in spermatocytes</title>
<p>To address the germ cell functions of BEND2 in mice, we generated BEND2-deficient mice by CRISPR/Cas9. Part of exon 11 of <italic>Bend2</italic> was targeted to be removed to disrupt the first BEN domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/y</sup></italic> mice developed into adults without apparent differences in general physical appearance compared to their littermates. Male <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/y</sup></italic> mice were fertile. The size and weight of <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/y</sup></italic> testes were comparable to that of wild-type testes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>). Similarly to Ma et al., (2022), using our BEND2 antibody, we detected two BEND2-related proteins in wild-type testes by WB: one was ∼130 kDa, and another was ∼75 kDa (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Although the predicted size of full-length BEND2 is 80.9 kDa, based on previous reports (Ma et al., 2022), the 130 kDa protein corresponds to the full-length BEND2, which displays a slower electrophoretic mobility due to its unusual sequence/structure. The 75 kDa protein corresponds to a smaller version of BEND2 lacking the N-terminus, p80 (Ma et al., 2022). Interestingly, we did not detect any BEND2 protein in wild-type testes of 48.3 kDa, which would be expected from the novel transcript 255p1 we identified.</p>
<p>We were unable to detect the full-length BEND2 in <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/y</sup></italic> mouse testis extracts by WB (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). The staining of BEND2 observed in wild-type cells was not present in mutant cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). However, the p80 BEND2-related protein was still present in <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/y</sup></italic> mutant testes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Moreover, an alternative <italic>Bend2</italic> transcript skipping exon 11 was detected in <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/y</sup></italic> testis by RT-PCR and sequencing (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>We attempted to test if this exon 11-skipped transcript was also present in wild-type mouse testis by RT-PCR and if it represented the p80 BEND2-related protein detected in both wild-type and <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/y</sup></italic> testis by immunoprecipitation (IP) coupled to peptide mass fingerprinting analysis. Unfortunately, only the full-length <italic>Bend2</italic>-202 transcript was consistently amplified in our RT-PCR analysis, and our <italic>in-house</italic> BEND2 antibody did not give satisfactory IP results (<italic>Data was not shown</italic>). Overall, these results suggest that the full-length BEND2 was successfully eliminated from mutant mouse testis. Also, the p80 BEND2 protein, likely corresponding to an exon 11-skipped transcript, is present and might be functional in our mutant testis, based on the observed phenotype (see below).</p>
<p>Histological analysis of <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/y</sup></italic> testes revealed the presence of cells at all the stages of spermatogenesis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). However, a significant increase of apoptotic cells was detected in <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/y</sup></italic> testes via TUNEL assays (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001 t-test, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B-C</xref>). Further staging analysis showed that <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/y</sup></italic> mice presented a comparable number of apoptotic spermatocytes (66.8 ± 9.7%, mean ± SD, N=4) than wild-type mice (52.5 ± 9.5%, mean ± SD, N=4, <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05 One-Way ANOVA, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). Therefore, the full-length BEND2 might be dispensable for completing spermatogenesis, and its absence only caused a slight defect in spermatogenesis.</p>

<p>To further explore the causes of the increased apoptosis in BEND2–deficient testes, we assessed chromosome synapsis and meiotic recombination progress in spermatocytes by IF. In wild-type spermatocytes, SYCP3 began to form each developing chromosome axis at leptotene. At zygotene, synapsis initiated as SYCP1 appeared at the synapsed region of the homologs. At pachytene, synapsis was completed as SYCP3 and SYCP1 completely colocalized. At diplotene, SCs disassembled, and SYCP1 were lost from separated SYCP3-labelled axes, but homologous chromosomes remained held together by chiasmata.</p>
<p>Synapsis progressed similarly to wild-type spermatocytes in <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/y</sup></italic> spermatocytes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). However, the fraction of diplotene spermatocytes was significantly increased (<italic>p</italic>=0.019, One-Way ANOVA). Additionally, the fraction of pachytene spermatocytes (48.6 ± 6.8%, mean ± SD, N=4) seemed to decrease in <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/y</sup></italic> mice, compared to wild-type mice (57.3 ± 4.5%, mean ± SD, N=4, <italic>p</italic>=0.078 One-Way ANOVA). This accumulation of <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/y</sup></italic> spermatocytes at the diplotene stage could be explained if there was a later block of the meiotic progression or if <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/y</sup></italic> spermatocytes might exit pachytene faster than wild-type spermatocytes. Taken together, these results demonstrated that in the absence of the full-length BEND2, spermaocytes could complete synapsis and progress through meiotic prophase but following a slightly altered timeline.</p>

<p>During early meiosis, recombination initiates with SPO11-mediated DSB formation, leading to the phosphorylation of the histone H2AX by ATM and thus triggering a series of DSB repair responses in the meiotic prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Huang and Roig, 2023</xref>). In wild-type mice, ϒH2AX progressively disappeared from the autosomes while DSBs were repaired as prophase progressed. By pachytene, most ϒH2AX was associated with the sex body. Few ϒH2AX patches could be observed on the autosomes from late pachytene, presumably corresponding to unrepaired DSBs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, a marked increase in the number of ϒH2AX patches was detected from early pachytene until late diplotene in <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/y</sup></italic> spermatocytes, indicating a possible delay in DSB repair (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). Alternatively, the same results could be observed if more DSBs were formed during prophase in <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/y</sup></italic> spermatocytes.</p>
<p>Once DSBs are resected, replication protein A (RPA) transiently binds to the nascent ssDNA overhangs, promoting the assembly of the recombinases RAD51 and DMC1 at DSB sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Moens et al., 2002</xref>). RAD51 and DMC1 replace RPA and form nucleoprotein filaments with the ssDNA, directing homology search and strand invasion to proceed along the DSB repair pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brown and Bishop, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hinch et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>In wild-type spermatocytes, the number of RPA foci peaked around early zygotene and progressively diminished as recombination proceeded; on the other hand, there were many RAD51 foci since leptotene, and the number started to decline from early zygotene (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C-D</xref>), consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Moens et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Pacheco et al., 2015</xref>). In <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/y</sup></italic> males, the spermatocytes had similar initial RPA and RAD51 foci numbers, suggesting that DSB formation was not affected by the loss of BEND2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C-D</xref>). However, <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/y</sup></italic> cells tended to accumulate more RPA foci and lose RAD51 foci as they progressed along the meiotic prophase. The differences became significant for RPA at late leptotene (<italic>p</italic>=0.0015 t-test, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>) and RAD51 at late zygotene and pachytene (<italic>p</italic>=0.0428 and 0.0002 respectively t-test, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>), indicating a subtle defect in the replacement of RPA by RAD51.</p>
<p>Because of meiotic recombination, at least one crossover per bivalent is generated to ensure accurate chromosome segregation at the first meiotic division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Zickler and Kleckner, 1999</xref>). We examined MLH1 foci, which become apparent at mid-late pachytene and mark most crossover-designated sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Anderson et al., 1999</xref>). We did not detect significant differences in the number of MLH1 foci in <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/y</sup></italic> spermatocytes (22.0 ± 2.3, mean ± SD, N=68) compared to wild-type cells (22.5 ± 2.9, mean ± SD, N=74, <italic>p</italic>=0.2543, t-test, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>), suggesting that BEND2 deficiency did not affect crossover formation in spermatocytes.</p>
<p>Homologous recombination is the principal DSB repair pathway in meiosis responding to SPO11-dependent DSBs. But in late spermatocytes (late pachytene and diplotene), other DSB repair pathways, such as non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or inter-sister homologous recombination (IS-HR), take over (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ahmed et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Enguita-Marruedo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Goedecke et al., 1999</xref>). Moreover, during pachytene, new DSBs could be formed by SPO11-independent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Carofiglio et al. 2013</xref>). Therefore, the increased presence of ϒH2AX patches observed in <italic>Bend2</italic> mutant mice might be explained by the inactivation of these alternative DSB repair pathways during the late meiotic prophase or an increase of SPO11-independent DSBs during pachytene.</p>
<p>To gain insight into these hypotheses, we studied if the NHEJ pathway activity is reduced during meiosis in <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/y</sup></italic> mice by examining the localization and expression of its constitutive protein, Ku70, on testes sections. As anticipated, Ku70 was observed as a patch-like signal on sex bodies in pachytene and diplotene spermatocytes. A punctuated signal, marking presumably DSB sites in the nucleus, was seen in cells of all spermatogenesis stages besides round and elongated spermatids (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2A</xref>). The number of Ku70 foci colocalizing with SYCP3 in spermatocytes in pachytene and diplotene stages was similar between control and mutant samples (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2B</xref>). No differences were observed in the proportion of tubules expressing Ku70 either. These results were further confirmed with Western blot analysis (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2C and D</xref>), thus suggesting that <italic>Bend2</italic> depletion does not affect NHEJ activation.</p>

<title>BEND2 deficiency leads to LINE-1 retrotransposon suppression</title>
<p>The formation of SPO11-independent DSBs during meiotic prophase has been linked to the LINE-1 retrotransposon activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Carofiglio et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Malki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Soper et al., 2008</xref>). To evaluate if the LINE-1 activity was increased in <italic>Bend2</italic> mutant mice, we examined LINE1 expression in mouse testes by IF and WB.</p>
<p>As expected, the most prominent LINE-1 staining localized to the cytoplasm of leptotene, zygotene, and pachytene spermatocytes (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig S3A</xref>). The signal intensity varied greatly between seminiferous tubules of the same sample in both wild-type and mutant animals. In <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/y</sup></italic> mice, spermatocytes showed similar signal intensity compared to control mice. Contrary to the expected, a statistically significant lower number of LINE-1 positive tubules was observed in mutant mice. An average of 2.8% and 0.5% positive tubules was observed in control and <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/y</sup></italic> mice, respectively (<italic>p</italic>=0.02, t-test) (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig S3B</xref>). Western blot analysis validated the lower LINE-1 protein expression in <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/y</sup></italic> testes sections (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2B</xref>). Indeed, a significant decrease in LINE-1 protein levels was found in <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/y</sup></italic> mice (<italic>p</italic>=0.0469, t-test, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig S3C</xref>), thus confirming the IF results. Defects in the demethylation efficiency of LINE-1 in <italic>Bend2</italic> mutant mice during the prophase may explain these results. On the other hand, the signal intensity was equal in wild-type and mutant mice, suggesting that some tubules successfully complete LINE-1 demethylation, thus resulting in normal LINE-1 expression.</p>

<p>To investigate if the loss of BEND2 affected oogenesis, a more detailed histological analysis of whole ovaries was performed in young (1 week old), adolescent (3 weeks old), adult (15-20 weeks old), and aged (40 weeks old) <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/Δ11</sup></italic> and <italic>Bend2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice. At 1 week, <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/Δ11</sup></italic> females exhibited a significantly reduced number of oocytes (<italic>p</italic>=0.0012, t-test; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>) mainly due to a reduced number of primordial follicles (<italic>p</italic>=0.0007, t-test; <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig S4A</xref>). Growing follicles were found at all stages, with no statistically significant differences between <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/Δ11</sup></italic> and control mice (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig S4A</xref>). This tendency continued in prepubertal 3-week-old animals. At this stage, Bend2 mutant ovaries seemed to contain fewer oocytes (<italic>p</italic>=0.0834, t-test; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>) and primordial follicles (<italic>p</italic>=0.0704, t-test; <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig S4B</xref>). At an adult stage of 15-20 weeks, the mutant ovaries presented significantly fewer oocytes (<italic>p</italic>=0.0040, t-test; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>), again due to a reduction in the number of primordial follicles (p=0.0024, t-test; <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig S4C</xref>). Interestingly, at this stage, we also noticed a significant reduction in the number of antral follicles in mutant mice (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001, t-test; <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig S4C</xref>), which could partly explain the reduced fertility of these females. Finally, at 40 weeks, there tended to be fewer oocytes and primordial follicles in <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/Δ11</sup></italic> ovaries than in <italic>Bend2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> ovaries (<italic>p</italic>=0.1171 and p=0.1383, t-test; <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig S4D</xref>). These results suggest a reduction in the oocyte pool established at birth and the possible occurrence of premature ovarian insufficiency in <italic>Bend2</italic> mutant females.</p>
<p>To certify that BEND2 was required to establish the ovarian reserve, we counted the oocyte population present in newborn <italic>Bend2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/Δ11</sup></italic> mutant mice by staining ovarian sections with the germ-cell marker DDX4 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). <italic>Bend2</italic> mutant ovaries contained almost 40% fewer oocytes than control ovaries (<italic>p</italic>=0.0037, t-test; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>), evidencing that the absence of the full-length BEND2 resulted in a reduced ovarian reserve.</p>

<title>Mutant <italic>Bend2</italic> oocytes show persistent unrepaired DSBs and impaired crossover formation</title>
<p>To address the cause of this reduced ovarian reserve, we first analyze the expression of LINE-1, which has been associated with increased perinatal oocyte death in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Malki et al., 2019</xref>). However, we found similar percentage of oocytes expressing LINE-1 in <italic>Bend2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/Δ11</sup></italic> ovarian sections (20.2 ± 0.6; 16.8 ± 2.3, mean ± SEM; p=0.1851, t-test; <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig S5</xref>).

<p>Next, we examined if errors during the meiotic prophase could be responsible for the observed reduced ovarian reserve in <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/Δ11</sup></italic> mice. Thus, we studied chromosome synapsis and meiotic recombination progress in fetal oocytes by IF. In wild-type ovaries, most oocytes at 18 dpc were at the pachytene stage, a small fraction was still at the zygotene stage, and a minority at the leptotene stage. At 1 dpp, almost all oocytes were at the pachytene and diplotene stages (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). In <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/Δ11</sup></italic> ovaries, zygotene, and pachytene oocytes undergoing normal synapsis and diplotene oocytes undergoing desynapsis were observed at 18 dpc and 1 dpp (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>).</p>

<p>Consistent with the observation in <italic>Bend2</italic> mutant males, we also found increased levels of ϒH2AX in late prophase <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/Δ11</sup></italic> oocytes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). In wild-type females, ϒH2AX patches could be detected along axes in most pachytene oocytes and many diplotene oocytes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). This is different from wild-type males, in which ϒH2AX can only be detected as very few patches in late pachytene cells and is almost undetectable in most diplotene cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>), presumably because synapsis progresses faster than recombination in females than in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Roig et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/Δ11</sup></italic> oocytes, higher levels of ϒH2AX were observed at all stages analyzed (early pachytene, late pachytene, and diplotene, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). Many early pachytene <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/Δ11</sup></italic> oocytes exhibited an overall intense ϒH2AX signal reminiscent of wild-type zygotene cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). To quantitatively compare these differences, we measured the ϒH2AX signal intensity in early pachytene oocytes and counted the ϒH2AX patches in late pachytene and diplotene oocytes. As expected, a significant increase of ϒH2AX was present in <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/Δ11</sup></italic> oocytes at all the tested stages (<italic>p</italic>=0.0288 for early pachytene; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001 for late pachytene, early diplotene and late diplotene, t-test, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). Thus, like in <italic>Bend2</italic> mutant males, DSB repair was impaired, or more DSBs were formed in <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/Δ11</sup></italic> females.</p>
<p>In females, no differences in the number of RPA and RAD51 foci were found between wild-type and <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/Δ11</sup></italic> oocytes, apart from a slight decrease in RPA foci in <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/Δ11</sup></italic> oocytes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>) and a slight increase of RAD51 foci in pachytene <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/Δ11</sup></italic> oocytes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>). These results suggest that the increased presence of ϒH2AX in <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/Δ11</sup></italic> oocytes may not be related to defective meiotic recombination but to other causes, like meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromosomes (MSUC) or alternative DNA repair pathways.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the number of MLH1 foci in late prophase oocytes was significantly lower in <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/Δ11</sup></italic> females than in control females (<italic>p</italic>=0.006 for <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/Δ11</sup></italic>, t-test, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E</xref>). Thus, we concluded that the depletion of BEND2 caused a reduced crossover formation in oocytes, probably partly causing the reduced litter size in <italic>Bend2</italic> mutant females.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In mammals, the establishment and gradual depletion of the ovarian reserve defines a finite female reproductive life span. In this study, we demonstrated that BEND2, a new player in meiosis (Ma et al., 2022), is essential for the primordial follicle pool setup. The depletion of the full-length BEND2 causes severe defects in female oogenesis with a decreased ovarian reserve and subfertility. However, these defects may not be directly related to meiotic recombination progression or synapsis, although a high level of unrepaired DSBs persists during late meiotic prophase. We also showed that BEND2 has a role in regulating LINE-1 retrotransposon activity in spermatocytes. Our work expands our knowledge of the genetic factors influencing the ovarian reserve, potentially benefiting the genetic diagnosis of human infertility.</p>
<p>BEND2 has two C-terminal BEN domains, marked by α-helical structure, and is conserved in a range of metazoan and viral proteins. BEN domain is suggested to mediate protein–DNA and protein-protein interactions during chromatin organization and transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abhiman et al., 2008</xref>). So far, only a few BEN domain-containing proteins have been described. All of their functions are linked to transcriptional repression regardless of whether the proteins contain other characterized domains, including mammalian BANP/SMAR1, NAC1, BEND3 and RBB and <italic>Drosophila</italic> mod(mdg4), BEND1 and BEND5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dai et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gerasimova et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kaul-Ghanekar et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Korutla et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Nègre et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Rampalli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Sathyan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Xuan et al., 2012</xref>). BEND1, BEND5, and RBB are revealed to bind DNA through sequence-specific recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dai et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Xuan et al., 2012</xref>), and BEND3 specifically binds heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Sathyan et al., 2011</xref>a). Additionally, several human BEND2 fusion proteins have been identified in tumors, and the activation of BEND2 is suggested to promote oncogenic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Burford et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Scarpa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Sturm et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Williamson et al., 2019</xref>). These data suggest that BEND2 might have a role in regulating chromatin and transcriptional gene expression. A recent study showed that BEND2 is a crucial regulator of meiosis gene expression and chromatin state during mouse spermatogenesis (Ma et al., 2022).</p>
<p>In the study of Ma et al. (2022), two BEND2-related proteins (p140 and p80) were found in mouse testis, using an antibody against a short polypeptide from the C-terminus of BEND2. They demonstrated that p140 is the full-length version of BEND2, displaying slower electrophoretic mobility due to its unusual sequence/structure at the N-terminus. They also reported that BEND2 was expressed in the nuclei of spermatogenic cells around meiosis initiation. Similarly, using our antibody against the whole C-terminus of the protein, we also found two BEND2-related proteins expressed in mouse testis and a highly consistent expression pattern of BEND2 during spermatogenesis. These two proteins likely correspond to full-length and smaller isoform from Ma et al. (2022).</p>
<p>Ma et al. (2022) disrupted <italic>Bend2</italic> by deleting exons 12 and 13, which resulted in the loss of both the full-length (p140) and the smaller isoform (p80) of BEND2. In their study, <italic>Bend2</italic> mutant mice were sterile and exhibited severe meiotic recombination and synapsis defects. In contrast, our study targeted exon 11, specifically ablating the full-length p140 isoform while preserving the expression of the smaller p80 isoform in the testis. Interestingly, <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/y</sup></italic> mutant males remain fertile, with essentially normal meiotic recombination and synapsis, suggesting that the full-length BEND2 (p140) is not essential for the repair of SPO11-induced double-strand breaks or for synapsis during meiosis.</p>
<p>This observation strongly implies that p80 is sufficient to fulfill the essential roles of BEND2 in meiosis and spermatogenesis. The preserved fertility and proper progression of meiosis in our <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/y</sup></italic> mutants suggest that the smaller p80 isoform is the primary driver of BEND2’s function in these processes. Conversely, the sterility and severe meiotic defects observed in the study by Ma et al. can be attributed to the loss of p80 and p140. These findings highlight a functional redundancy or compensatory mechanism provided by p80 that allows meiosis and spermatogenesis to proceed effectively in the absence of the full-length isoform.</p>
<p>Thus, we propose that p80 is the indispensable isoform of BEND2 required for meiotic progression. Its presence in our model likely prevents the spermatogenesis arrest seen in the Ma et al. study. This hypothesis provides a compelling explanation for why our <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/y</sup></italic> males exhibit a less severe phenotype and remain fertile despite the absence of full-length BEND2. These results underscore the importance of considering isoform-specific functions when investigating the roles of multi-isoform genes in complex biological processes like meiosis and gametogenesis.</p>
<p>In our study, one common defect in mutant spermatocytes and oocytes was a significant increase in unrepaired DSBs during late prophase. Examination of the chromosomal dynamics and meiotic recombination demonstrated that the full-length BEND2 is not essential for SPO11-induced DSB repair. Since all meiotic recombination markers studied, apart from γH2AX, were mostly indistinguishable in mutant and control cells, we hypothesized that the observed unrepaired DSBs might be SPO11-independent and further explored the LINE-1 retrotransposon activation, which is known to cause DSBs during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Soper et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Carofiglio et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Malki et al., 2014</xref>) and it has been implicated in the regulation of the ovarian reserve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Martínez-Marchal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Tharp et al., 2020</xref>). Unexpectedly, we found a significant reduction in LINE-1 expression levels in mutant testis and although it was not statistically significant, mutant oocytes seemed to have a similar trend.</p>
<p>Repetitive transposon elements, including LINE-1, occupy almost half of the human genome and are extremely important for genome evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Wang, 2017</xref>). Transposon-mediated insertional mutagenesis was linked to a multitude of genetic diseases. Even though LINE-1 is active mainly during the genome-wide demethylation, transient DNA demethylation occurring at the onset of meiosis was found to trigger a persisting LINE-1 expression until mid-pachytene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Soper et al., 2008</xref>). Silencing of LINE-1 retrotransposons is achieved with multiple mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and piRNAs (piwi-interacting RNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">DiGiacomo et al., 2013</xref>). Ma et al. (2022) described that in <italic>Bend2</italic> KO male mice, there is an up-regulation of PIWIL2 expression at the onset of meiosis. PIWIL2 belongs to the PIWI subfamily of proteins that bind to piRNAs, which are required for several biological processes, including silencing retrotransposons during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">DiGiacomo et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, it is likely that <italic>Bend2</italic> depletion caused an up-regulation of the piRNA pathway, resulting in lower LINE-1 expression in our mouse mutant spermatocytes. Alternatively, as BEND2 was found to bind to repetitive sequences (Ma et al., 2022), it could interact directly with LINE-1 to promote its expression. The lower LINE-1 expression might result straightforwardly from less binding of BEND2. Finally, <italic>Bend2</italic> mutation could affect chromatin state and higher-order structures (Ma et al., 2022), which could alter LINE-1 expression and hinder DNA repair. Further studies focusing on the regulation of PIWIL2 by BEND2 will clarify these aspects of the phenotype.</p>
<p>Due to the sterility of hemizygous mutant males, female homozygous mutants can’t be produced in the study of Ma et al. (2022). So, our female mutant model facilitates further exploration of BEND2’s roles in oogenesis.</p>
<p>Interestingly, our mutant females <italic>Bend2<sup>Δ11/Δ11</sup></italic> exhibited a more severe phenotype with a reduced ovarian reserve and subfertility, which had not been described before. Mouse females establish the pool of primordial follicles around birth. As folliculogenesis begins, the pool is gradually depleted throughout reproductive life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hunter, 2017</xref>). By examining the dynamics of the oocyte pool in female mice at different ages, we showed that compared to wild-type females, BEND2-deficient females have a significantly smaller ovarian reserve. As a result, fewer follicles develop during folliculogenesis from pre-puberty throughout adulthood. Consistent with these, BEND2-deficient females produced reduced litter size, which indicates subfertility. Interestingly, our mutant oocyte quality analysis suggests that mature oocytes from mutant females are equally competent to develop into a blastocyst as control ones. These data suggest that the subfertility observed in <italic>Bend2</italic> mutants may be due to errors in later developmental stages, such as implantation or organogenesis.</p>
<p>Thus, BEND2, apart from its roles in male meiosis (Ma et al., 2022), is also required to establish the ovarian reserve during oogenesis. The full-length BEND2 may take on this role in females. However, future investigation of BEND2 expression in fetal ovaries is necessary to validate this. Genes discovered to have disease-causing roles in mouse models often offer a panel of strong candidate genes for screening human infertility factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Huang and Roig, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Riera-Escamilla et al., 2019</xref>). Our data shows that the depletion of BEND2 may lead to premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), which is also a significant cause of female infertility in humans, and its underlying genetic causes are mainly unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Rossetti et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, identifying BEND2’s requirement for normal oogenesis is also important to recognizing the genetic determinants of human POI.</p>

<p><italic>Bend2</italic> mutant mice were generated by using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. A pair of gRNAs with minimum off-target and maximum on-target activity were designed and selected to specifically target sequences that encode essential protein domains of the <italic>Bend2</italic> gene using CRISPR DESIGN TOOLS (Millipore Sigma) (gRNA1-antisense: AGTAGCAGGCTGCATAAGT GGG; gRNA2-sense: AGACCAGCCTTATTGACCA TGG).

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors investigate the role of BEND2, a novel regulator of meiosis, in both male and female fertility. Huang et al have created a mouse model where the full-length BEND2 transcript is depleted but the truncated BEND2 version remains. This mouse model is fertile, and the authors used it to study the role of BEND2 on both male and female meiosis. Overall, the full-length BEND2 appears dispensable for male meiosis. The more interesting phenotype was observed in females. Females exhibit a lower ovarian reserve suggesting that full-length BEND2 is involved in the establishment of the primordial follicle pool.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors generated a mouse model that enabled them to study the role of BEND2 in meiosis. The role of BEND2 in female fertility is novel and enhances our knowledge of genes involved in the establishment of the primordial follicle pool.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript extensively explores the role of BEND2 in male meiosis; however, a more interesting result was obtained from the study of female mice.</p>

<p>In their manuscript entitled &quot;BEND2 is a crucial player in oogenesis and reproductive aging&quot;, the authors present their findings that full-length BEND2 is important for repair of meiotic double strand break repair in spermatocytes, regulation of LINE-1 elements in spermatocytes, and proper oocyte meiosis and folliculogenesis in females. The manuscript utilizes an elegant system to specifically ablate the full-length form of BEND2 which has been historically difficult to study due to its location on the X chromosome and male sterility of global knockout animals.</p>
<p>The authors have been extremely responsive to reviewer critiques and have presented strong data and appropriate conclusions, making it an excellent addition to the field.</p>

<p>Huang et al. investigated the phenotype of Bend2 mutant mice which expressed truncated isoform. Bend2 deletion in male showed fertility and this enabled them to analyze the BEND2 function in females. They showed that Bend2 deletion in females showed decreasing follicle number which may lead to loss of ovarian reserve.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>They found the truncated isoform of Bend2 and the depletion of this isoform showed decreasing follicle number at birth.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors showed novel factors that impact ovarian reserve. Although the number of follicles and conception rate are reduced in mutant mice, the in vitro fertilization rate is normal and follicles remain at 40 weeks of age. It is difficult to know how critical this is when applied to the human case.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors investigate the role of BEND2, a novel regulator of meiosis, in both male and female fertility. Huang et al have created a mouse model where the fulllength BEND2 transcript is depleted but the truncated BEND2 version remains. This mouse model is fertile, and the authors used it to study the role of BEND2 on both male and female meiosis. Overall, the full-length BEND2 appears dispensable for male meiosis. The more interesting phenotype was observed in females. Females exhibit a lower ovarian reserve suggesting that full-length BEND2 is involved in the establishment of the primordial follicle pool.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors generated a mouse model that enabled them to study the role of BEND2 in meiosis. The role of BEND2 in female fertility is novel and enhances our knowledge of genes involved in the establishment of the primordial follicle pool.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript extensively explores the role of BEND2 in male meiosis; however, a more interesting result was obtained from the study of female mice. Only a few experiments were performed using female mice, therefore, more experiments should be performed to complete the story of the role of BEND2 on female fertility. In addition, the title and abstract of the manuscript do not align with the story, as female fertility is only a small portion of the data compared to the male fertility section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s thoughtful summary, recognition of the strengths of our study, and constructive feedback. In the revised manuscript, we have performed additional experiments to enhance our understanding of the role of BEND2 in female gametogenesis. These new experiments provide further insights into the establishment of the ovarian reserve and the role of BEND2 in female fertility.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have rewritten the title, abstract, and introduction to better align with the content of the manuscript and to reflect the balance between the male and female fertility results. We believe these changes address the reviewer’s concerns and improve the overall clarity and focus of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>• I recommend that the authors re-organize their abstract and introduction to accurately reflect the manuscript's primary focus on male fertility. Right now, the title of the manuscript is misleading. The manuscript does not investigate reproductive aging; rather, it primarily describes the depletion of primordial follicle number. The mechanism behind this depletion and whether this phenotype accelerates reproductive aging, are not explored. Clarifying these points will help align the title and content of the manuscript more accurately.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We agree that the original title and abstract did not fully capture the focus of the study. In response, we have rewritten the title, abstract, and introduction to better align with the results presented, focusing more clearly on the implications of the effects of the full-length BEND2 depletion for spermatogenesis and oogenesis. These revisions ensure that the title, the abstract, and the manuscript's introduction are now more accurately reflective of the work performed.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Figure 1: I couldn't find the validation of the polyclonal antibody against BEND2 that the authors generated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Regarding this query about the validation of the polyclonal antibody against BEND2, we apologize for any confusion. We would like to clarify that this validation is indeed presented in Figure 2 of our manuscript. To ensure this information is easily accessible, we have revised the text to explicitly mention the validation in Figure 2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Figure 2A: Could you provide the actual numbers for the weight of the mice testis?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In response to this question regarding Figure 2A and the weights of the mice testis, we have now included this data in a graph in Fig 2A and Table S1 and added this information in the results section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Figure 2C and D: I am confused by the fact that in the WB we can appreciate a high expression of the p75 protein, but the signal is very low in the IF (Figure 2D).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. We acknowledge the apparent discrepancy between the strong p75 signal observed in the Western blot (Fig. 2C) and the weaker signal seen in the immunofluorescence (Fig. 2D). We think several factors could contribute to this difference, such as differences in sensitivity and detection methods, epitope accessibility, protein localization or differences in sample preparation, antibody affinity, and experimental conditions between Western blot and IF.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• In the same figure, the authors also mention that the p75 protein is functional. On what basis do they rely on reaching this conclusion?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge that we cannot definitively confirm the functionality of the p75 protein. Our assumption was based on the observed fertility of the male mice and existing literature indicating that BEND2 is essential for completing meiosis (Ma et al., 2022). However, we understand the importance of clarity in our claims. To avoid any potential confusion, we have revised the sentence to read: &quot;The p75 BEND2 protein—likely corresponding to an exon 11-skipped transcript—is present and might be functional in our mutant testis, based on the observed phenotype (see below).&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• The phenotype in females is very interesting. The authors conclude that BEND2 influences primordial follicle formation, oocyte quality, fertility, and reproductive aging by (1) performing follicle counts, (2) analyzing the litter size, and (3) analyzing meiotic progression. Given that the authors build their story around these experiments, I strongly encourage them to expand the section on female fertility, or reorganize the manuscript, or be more cautious with some of their conclusions. They might consider performing additional experiments such as:</p>
<p>- Oocyte quality: To determine whether BEND2 impacts oocyte quality, mice should be stimulated with hormones and oocyte quality should be analyzed (GV, MI, MII progression, spindle morphology and/or fertilization, and embryo development). Does the decrease in primordial follicles correlate with the number of ovulated oocytes, or is the impact only on oocyte quality?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's suggestion to assess the impact of BEND2 on oocyte quality. Following the reviewer’s recommendation, we stimulated three control and three mutant mice. We analyzed the number of ovulated oocytes, their fertilization rate, and the percentage of embryos that developed to the blastocyst stage. These new results are included in the revised manuscript (see Results section and new Table 1). Our analyses indicate that for all parameters assessed, control and mutant oocytes behaved similarly. Specifically, there were no significant differences in the number of ovulated oocytes, fertilization rates, or the ability of embryos to progress to the blastocyst stage between the control and mutant groups. These findings suggest that mutant oocyte quality is comparable to control mice of a similar age. We have incorporated these new results into the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Reproductive aging: A fertility trial would provide more information on whether BEND2 depletion triggers an acceleration of reproductive aging. In addition, the oldest mice used by the authors are 9 months old, and at this point, fertility has not declined yet.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's suggestion regarding the assessment of reproductive aging. However, we respectfully disagree with the assertion that fertility has not declined by 9 months of age. In our colony, we have observed a significant decline in fertility around 10 months of age. Specifically, out of 18 10-month-old female mice placed in breeding cages, we observed only three pregnancies within the first 30 days (N.N. and I.R., data not published). Based on these observations, we determined that fertility begins to decline around this age in our colony, which informed our decision to use 9-month-old mice as the oldest age group for our analysis. Thus, this age is appropriate for evaluating the potential effects of BEND2 depletion on reproductive aging in our specific mouse population.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- The observation that the primordial follicle pool is already diminished in mice that are 1 week old is very interesting. Some experiments that the authors could perform to figure out the mechanism are: (1) Analyzing apoptosis. Are the primordial follicles dying during the pool's establishment, or is this an ongoing apoptotic process throughout the mice's lifespan? (2) If the authors still have ovaries from mice younger than 1 week of age (when the primordial pool is forming), they could perform DDX4 staining and quantify the number of oocytes in follicles and the total number of oocytes. These experiments would provide mechanistic insights into whether BEND2 impacts the formation of the primordial follicle pool or if the pool forms but is then depleted.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's suggestion to further explore the mechanism behind the reduced primordial follicle pool. In response, we have analyzed the number of DDX4positive cells (DDX4 labels oocytes) in newborn mutant and wild-type animals. Our results show that mutant ovaries contain significantly fewer oocytes compared to controls (see new Fig. 5). This finding supports the hypothesis that BEND2 is critical for the establishment of a normal ovarian reserve. We are grateful for this suggestion, as these additional data reinforce our conclusion that BEND2 is required to determine a normal ovarian reserve in mice.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• What is the red signal in Supplementary Figure 1C?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This image depicts the BEND2 staining pattern in 16 days post-coitum (dpc) wild-type mouse ovaries. To clarify this and prevent any confusion, we have updated the figure legend to explicitly state that the sample shown is from a wild-type mouse.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Please spell out the full term of all the acronyms.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the oversight in not fully spelling out some acronyms in the original manuscript. We have carefully reviewed the entire manuscript and have ensured that all acronyms are now spelled out in full upon their first use in the revised version. We want to thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Is Line-1 also dysregulated in the ovary? This was one of the main findings from the male part. It would be interesting to perform the same analysis in the ovary since Line1 has a role in establishing the ovarian reserve (PDMI: 31949138).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful suggestion. We have analyzed the number of LINE1 and SYCP3-positive cells in wild-type and mutant newborn ovaries (new Fig. S4). Our results show no significant difference between the two genotypes, suggesting that LINE-1 is not dysregulated in newborn <italic>Bend2</italic> mutant oocytes. These findings indicate that, at least in the context of the newborn ovary, LINE-1 does not appear to be affected by BEND2 depletion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>In their manuscript entitled &quot;BEND2 is a crucial player in oogenesis and reproductive aging&quot;, the authors present their findings that full-length BEND2 is important for repair of meiotic double strand break repair in spermatocytes, regulation of LINE-1 elements in spermatocytes, and proper oocyte meiosis and folliculogenesis in females. The manuscript utilizes an elegant system to specifically ablate the full-length form of BEND2 which has been historically difficult to study due to its location on the X chromosome and male sterility of global knockout animals.</p>
<p>While the manuscript is an overall excellent addition to the field, it would significantly benefit from a few additional experiments, as well as some additional clarification/elaboration.</p>
<p>The claim that BEND2 is required for ovarian reserve establishment is not supported, as the authors only look at folliculogenesis and oocyte abundance starting at one week of age, after the reserve is formed. Analysis of earlier time points would be much more convincing and would parse the role of BEND2 in the establishment vs. maintenance of this cell population. In spermatocytes, the authors demonstrate a loss of nuclear BEND2 in their mutant but do not comment on the change in localization (which is now cytoplasmic) of the remaining protein in these animals. This may have true biological significance and a discussion of this should be more thoroughly explored.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their thoughtful feedback and constructive suggestions to improve our manuscript.</p>
<p>In response to the comment regarding the establishment of the ovarian reserve, we have now analyzed Bend2 mutant and control newborn ovaries. Our results show a significant reduction in the number of DDX4-positive cells in mutant ovaries compared to controls. These findings demonstrate that BEND2 is required for the establishment of the ovarian reserve, as the reduction is evident at birth.</p>
<p>Regarding the cytoplasmic staining of BEND2 in mutant spermatocytes, we did perform secondary-antibody-only controls using goat anti-rabbit Cy3 to address the specificity of the signal. The staining observed in the Bend2 mutants closely resembles background staining, suggesting that the cytoplasmic signal is nonspecific. Therefore, we do not believe this represents a meaningful change in the localization of BEND2 protein in the mutants. We have clarified this in the revised manuscript to address this point.</p>
<p>We hope these additional experiments and clarifications strengthen the manuscript and address the reviewer’s concerns.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Major points:</p>
<p>(1) The title of the manuscript does not accurately capture the content of the work. The vast majority of the data presented here is from the male, which is not reflected at all in the title - perhaps considering revising it?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable suggestion. We agree that the original title did not fully reflect the focus of the manuscript. In response, we have revised the title, along with the abstract and introduction, to more accurately capture the content of the study and the emphasis on the male data. These changes ensure that the manuscript more clearly aligns with the results presented.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In Figure 2D, the authors demonstrate that WT BEND2 expression and localization are lost in the mutant, but staining is still apparent, just in the cytoplasm. Did the authors perform secondary-antibody-only controls to determine if this was background staining or real staining? If real, can they comment on the change in localization of the protein?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful question. We have indeed performed secondary antibody-only controls using goat anti-rabbit Cy3. The staining observed in the <italic>Bend2</italic> mutants closely resembles background staining, suggesting that the signal in the cytoplasm is not specific. Therefore, we do not believe this staining represents any real or meaningful expression of the BEND2 protein in the mutants.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In Figure S2A, the authors show Ku70 staining and describe that it is similar between the genotypes, but - to my eye - it looks quite distinctly different. It appears to stain in patches in WT SYCP3+ spermatocytes, versus staining in patches in the more mature, SYCP3- germ cells closer to the lumen in the mutant. Can the authors please clarify, or provide arrows to point which foci they are referring to?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the confusion caused by the image provided in the original submission. Upon review, we realized that the mutant image was not fully representative of the staining pattern observed in the majority of mutant samples. We have replaced this image with a new one in the revised manuscript, which more accurately reflects the similarity in Ku70 staining between wild-type and mutant testis. In this updated Figure S2, we have also included arrowheads to indicate the relevant foci, making it clearer to the reader. We have updated the figure legend to correspond with these changes as well.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors state that BEND2 is &quot;required to establish the ovarian reserve during oogenesis&quot; but this has not been demonstrated. The authors do show a reduced density of primordial follicles at one week of age. While this is compelling data, the ovarian reserve is established earlier in the mouse, around postnatal days 0-1, so it is not clear from this manuscript whether BEND2 is required for the maintenance of this population after PND1, leading to reduced numbers by 1 week of age, OR if it is required for the establishment of this population, which would result in reduced numbers of oocytes around the time of birth. This is a critical experiment that should be performed in order to determine which of these possibilities is likely the case. Ideally, looking at embryonic through early postnatal time points during ovarian development would be very helpful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. As mentioned earlier in response to Reviewer 1, we have performed the experiment suggested by Reviewer 2 and analyzed the number of DDX4-positive cells in newborn ovaries. Our results show that Bend2 mutant ovaries have fewer oocytes at birth than wild-type controls (Fig. 5H). This finding reinforces our conclusion that BEND2 is indeed required to establish the ovarian reserve, as the reduction in oocyte number is evident at the time of birth. We agree that this additional data strengthens our original claim, so we have included these results in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Huang et al. investigated the phenotype of Bend2 mutant mice which expressed a truncated isoform. This mutant male showed increasing apoptosis due to unrepaired double-strand breaks. However, this mutant male has fertility, and this enabled them to analyze Bend2 function in females. They revealed that Bend2 mutation in females showed decreasing follicle numbers which leads to loss of ovarian reserve.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Since their Bend2 mutant males were fertile, they were able to analyze the function of Bend2 in females and they revealed that loss of Bend2 causes less follicle formation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Why the phenotype of their mutant male is different from previous work (Ma et al.) is not clear enough although they discuss it.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment regarding the differences between our Bend2 mutant male phenotype and the previously reported phenotype by Ma et al., 2022. We believe this discrepancy is due to the fact that the <italic>Bend2</italic> locus encodes two BEND2 isoforms: p140 and p80. In contrast to the previous study, where both proteins were ablated by mutation employed (the deletion of exons 12 and 13), our exon 11 deletion specifically ablates p140 expression while allowing the expression of p80 in the testis.</p>
<p>Based on the distinct phenotypes observed in the two Bend2 mutant mouse models, we hypothesize that p80 is sufficient to fulfill BEND2’s roles in meiosis, which could explain why our Bend2 mutant males remain fertile. We have rewritten the relevant sections in the results and discussion to better articulate this hypothesis and clarify the potential mechanisms behind the observed phenotypic differences.</p>
<p>We hope these clarifications and additional details adequately address the reviewer’s concerns.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The authors showed that Bend2 mutant females had decreased fertility. This may be due to decreased ovarian reserve. Did the authors check if the mutant mice decreased or lost fertility faster than WT? If the authors have the data, please refer to it in the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We followed the breeding performance of a small number of control and Bend2 mutant females, and preliminary observations suggested no clear differences between the two groups. However, due to the limited sample size, we felt that these data were not conclusive enough to be included in the manuscript. We agree that a more thorough analysis of fertility decline over time would be valuable, and we plan to address this question in a future study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In Figure 1 A, there is no exon1 in the upper figure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have revised Figure 1A to include exon 1 and ensure the schematic is accurate. The updated figure is included in the revised version of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Figure 3A, it would be nice to show several tubules of the testis section as well as an enlarged one.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Following the reviewer's advice, we have revised Figure 3A to include new images showing several tubules and an enlarged view of one section of a tubule. These updates are included in the revised manuscript to better represent the testis sections.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Please be consistent with the format of the graph, especially Supplemental figures 2C and 4D.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have revised the figures, including Supplemental Figures 2C and 4D, to ensure consistency in the format throughout the manuscript. We have made modifications to the figures to align them more closely and improve the overall presentation.</p>
