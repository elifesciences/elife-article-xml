<title>Abstract</title><p>Brain structural circuitry shapes a richly patterned functional synchronization, supporting for complex cognitive and behavioural abilities. However, how coupling of structural connectome (SC) and functional connectome (FC) develops and its relationships with cognitive functions and transcriptomic architecture remain unclear. We used multimodal magnetic resonance imaging data from 439 participants aged 5.7 to 21.9 years to predict functional connectivity by incorporating intracortical and extracortical structural connectivity, characterizing SC-FC coupling. Our findings revealed that SC-FC coupling was strongest in the visual and somatomotor networks, consistent with evolutionary expansion, myelin content, and functional principal gradient. As development progressed, SC-FC coupling exhibited heterogeneous alterations dominated by an increase in cortical regions, broadly distributed across the somatomotor, frontoparietal, dorsal attention, and default mode networks. Moreover, we discovered that SC-FC coupling significantly predicted individual variability in general intelligence, mainly influencing frontoparietal and default mode networks. Finally, our results demonstrated that the heterogeneous development of SC-FC coupling is positively associated with genes in oligodendrocyte-related pathways and negatively associated with astrocyte-related genes. This study offers insight into the maturational principles of SC-FC coupling in typical development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In neural circuitry, long-range (extracortical) interconnections among local (intracortical) microcircuits shape and constrain the large-scale functional organization of neural activity across the cortex[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. The coupling of structural connectome (SC) and functional connectome (FC) varies greatly across different cortical regions reflecting anatomical and functional hierarchies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] and is regulated in part by genes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], as well as its individual differences relates to cognitive function[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Despite its fundamental importance, our understanding of the changes in SC-FC coupling with development is currently limited. Specifically, the alterations in SC-FC coupling during development, its association with cognitive functions, and the underlying spatial transcriptomic mechanisms remain largely unknown.</p>
<p>Network modelling of the brain enables the characterization of complex information interactions at a system level and provides natural correspondences between structure and function in the cortex[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Advances in diffusion MRI (dMRI) and tractography techniques have allowed the <italic>in vivo</italic> mapping of the white matter (WM) connectome (WMC), which depicts extracortical excitatory projections between regions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. The T1- to T2-weighted (T1w/T2w) ratio of MRI has been proposed as a means of quantifying microstructure profile covariance (MPC), which reflects a simplified recapitulation in cellular changes across intracortical laminar structure[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) can be used to derive the FC, which captures the synchronization of neural activity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. A variety of statistical[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], communication[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], and biophysical[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>] models have been proposed to study the SC-FC coupling. The communication model is particularly useful because it not only depicts indirect information transmission but also takes into account biodynamic information within acceptable computational complexity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. However, most studies have relied on WMC-derived extracortical communications as SC to predict FC, while ignoring the intracortical microcircuits, the MPC. In the present study, we propose that incorporating both intracortical and extracortical SC provides a more comprehensive perspective for characterizing the development of SC-FC coupling.</p>
<p>Previous studies in adults have revealed that the SC-FC coupling is strongest in sensory cortex regions and weakest in association cortex regions, following the general functional and cytoarchitectonic hierarchies of cortical organization[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. This organization may occur due to structural constraints, wherein cortical areas with lower myelination and weaker WM connectivity tend to have more dynamic and complex functional connectivity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Large-scale association networks emerged over evolution by breaking away from the rigid developmental programming found in lower order sensory systems[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>], facilitating regional and individual specialization[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. In terms of developmental changes in SC-FC coupling, a statistical model-based study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] identified positive age-related changes in some regions, while fewer regions exhibited negative changes. Furthermore, there is evidence that SC-FC coupling is linked to cognitive functions in healthy children[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>], adults[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>] and patients[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], suggesting that it may be a critical brain indicator that encodes individual cognitive differences. Nonetheless, a more comprehensive investigation is needed to understand the precise pattern of SC-FC coupling over development and its association with cognitive functions.</p>
<p>Cortical SC-FC coupling is highly heritable[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] and related to heritable connectivity profiles[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], suggesting that the development of coupling may be genetically regulated. The Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>] is a valuable resource for identifying genes that co-vary with brain imaging phenotypes and for exploring potential functional pathways and cellular processes via enrichment analyses[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. For instance, a myeloarchitectural study showed that enhanced myelin thickness in mid-to-deeper layers is specifically associated with the gene expression of oligodendrocytes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Another functional study found that the expression levels of genes involved in calcium ion-regulated exocytosis and synaptic transmission are associated with the development of a differentiation gradient[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. However, the transcriptomic architecture underlying the development of SC-FC coupling remains largely unknown.</p>
<p>In this study, we analysed data obtained from the Lifespan Human Connectome Project Development (HCP-D)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], which enrolled healthy participants ranging in age from 5.7 to 21.9 years. Our main objective was to investigate the SC-FC coupling of brain connectome and characterize its developmental landscapes. Specifically, we aimed to determine whether the SC-FC coupling encodes individual differences in cognition during development. Finally, we explored the genetic and cellular mechanisms underlying the development of SC-FC coupling of brain connectome. To assess the reproducibility of our findings, sensitivity and replication analyses were performed with a different tractography algorithm and a split-half independent validation method.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We selected 439 participants (5.7 – 21.9 years of age, 207 males) in the HCP-D dataset who met our inclusion criteria: available high-quality T1/T2, dMRI, and rs-fMRI data that met the quality control thresholds. For each participant, we generated multiple connectomes using 210 cortical regions from the Human Brainnetome Atlas (BNA)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>], which comprised MPC, WMC, and FC. Intracortical connectivity was represented by MPC. According to the WMC, twenty-seven weighted communication models[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] were calculated to characterize geometric, topological, or dynamic connectivity properties. Further details on these models can be found in Text S1. After analysis, we found that communicability[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], mean first passage times of random walkers[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>], and flow graphs (timescales=1) provided the optimal combination of extracortical connectivity properties because of significantly predicting FC (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, 1,000 spin test permutations, Table S1). We used these three models to represent the extracortical connectivity properties in subsequent discovery and reproducibility analyses (Figure S1).</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Spatial pattern of cortical SC-FC coupling</title>
<p>We used SCs (MPC and three WMC communication models) to predict FC per node based on a multilinear model[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>] (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), and quantified the nodewise SC-FC coupling as an adjusted coefficient of determination <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> . We observed that the grouped SC-FC coupling varied across cortical regions (mean adjusted <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.14 ± 0.08, adjusted <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> range = [0.03, 0.45], <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), and regions with significant coupling were located in the middle frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, paracentral lobule, superior temporal gyrus, superior parietal lobule, postcentral gyrus, cingulate gyrus, and occipital lobe (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, 1,000 spin test permutations, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Similar heterogeneous patterns of coupling were observed when categorizing cortical regions into seven functional subnetworks[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>] (visual, somatomotor, dorsal attention, ventral attention, limbic, frontoparietal and default mode networks). In the visual, somatomotor, default mode and ventral attention networks, SC significantly predict FC variance (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, 1,000 spin test permutations, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). The visual and somatomotor networks had higher coupling values than the other networks (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). We further investigated the alignment between SC-FC coupling and three fundamental properties of brain organization: evolution expansion[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>], myelin content[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>], and functional principal gradient[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>].</p>

<p>Our findings reveal a negative association between regional distribution of SC-FC coupling and evolution expansion (Spearman’s <italic>r</italic>=-0.52, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, 1,000 spin test permutations, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), as well as with the functional principal gradient (Spearman’s <italic>r</italic>=-0.46, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, 1,000 spin test permutations, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Conversely, nodes exhibiting higher SC-FC coupling tended to exhibit higher myelin content (Spearman’s <italic>r</italic>=0.49, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, 1,000 spin test permutations, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). In addition, the coupling pattern based on other models (using only MPC or only SCs to predict FC) and the comparison between the models were shown in Figure S2A-C.</p>
<p>Additionally, we applied Haufe’s inversion transform[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>] to yield predictor weights of various SCs, where higher or lower values indicate stronger positive or negative correlations with FC. Our results demonstrated that different SCs had preferential contributions to FC variance across cortical regions to explain FC variance (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, FDR corrected, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Specifically, in the MPC, regions with positive correlation were the orbital gyrus, precentral gyrus, right middle temporal gyrus and temporoparietal junction, while regions with negative correlations were the left superior frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule and bilateral cingulate gyrus. Regarding WMC communication models, the communicability and flow graphs tended to stronger higher positive correlations in the visual, limbic and default mode networks, whereas the mean first passage time had stronger negative correlations in the somatomotor, limbic and frontoparietal networks.</p>

<title>Age-related changes in SC-FC coupling with development</title>
<p>To track changes in SC-FC coupling during development, we used a general linear model to assess the effect of age on nodal SC-FC coupling, while controlling for sex, intracranial volume, and in-scanner head motion. Our results revealed that the whole-cortex average coupling increased during development (<italic>β</italic><sub><italic>age</italic></sub>=1.05E-03, F=3.76, <italic>p</italic>=1.93E-04, <italic>r</italic>=0.20, <italic>p</italic>=3.20E-05, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Regionally, the SC-FC coupling of most cortical regions increased with age (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, FDR corrected, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), particularly that in the frontal lobe, middle temporal gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, parietal lobe, cingulate gyrus and lateral occipital cortex. Conversely, cortical regions with significantly decreased SC-FC coupling (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, FDR corrected, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>) were located in left orbital gyrus, left precentral gyrus, right superior and inferior temporal gyrus, left fusiform gyrus, left superior parietal lobule, left postcentral gyrus, insular gyrus, and cingulate gyrus. Age correlation coefficients distributed within functional subnetworks were shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>. Regarding mean SC-FC coupling within functional subnetworks, the somatomotor (<italic>β</italic><sub><italic>age</italic></sub>=2.39E-03, F=4.73, <italic>p</italic>=3.10E-06, <italic>r</italic>=0.25, <italic>p</italic>=1.67E-07, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), dorsal attention (<italic>β</italic><sub><italic>age</italic></sub> =1.40E-03, F=4.63, <italic>p</italic>=4.86E-06, <italic>r</italic>=0.24, <italic>p</italic>=2.91E-07, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>), frontoparietal (<italic>β</italic><sub><italic>age</italic></sub>=2.11E-03, F=6.46, <italic>p</italic>=2.80E-10, <italic>r</italic>=0.33, <italic>p</italic>=1.64E-12, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>) and default mode (<italic>β</italic><sub><italic>age</italic></sub>=9.71E-04, F=2.90, <italic>p</italic>=3.94E-03, <italic>r</italic>=0.15, <italic>p</italic>=1.19E-03, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>) networks significantly increased with age and exhibited greater increase. No significant correlations were found between developmental changes in SC-FC coupling and the fundamental properties of cortical organization. Additionally, weights of different SCs varied with age, showing that MPC weight was positively correlated with age and that the weights of WMC communication models were stable (Figure S3-S6). The age-related patterns of SC-FC coupling based other coupling models were shown in Figure S2D-F.</p>

<title>SC-FC coupling predicts individual differences in cognitive functions</title>
<p>As we found that SC-FC coupling can encode brain maturation, we next evaluated the implications of coupling for individual cognition using Elastic-Net algorithm[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. After controlling for sex, intracranial volume and in-scanner head motion, we found the SC-FC coupling significantly predicted individual differences in fluid intelligence, crystal intelligence and general intelligence (Pearson’s <italic>r</italic>=0.3∼0.4, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, FDR corrected, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>).

For fluid intelligence and crystal intelligence, the predictive performances of SC-FC coupling were not better than at chance (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). The predictive performances for other cognitive subscores are shown in Figure S7. To identify the regions with the greatest contributions to individual differences in age-adjusted general intelligence, we utilized Haufe’s inversion transform[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>] to extract predictor weights across various regions. Our analysis revealed that SC-FC coupling within the prefrontal lobe, temporal lobe and lateral occipital lobe was the most predictive of individual differences in general intelligence (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). In addition, we found that the weights of frontoparietal and default mode networks significantly contributed to the prediction of the general intelligence (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, 1,000 spin test permutations, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we characterized alterations of SC-FC coupling of brain connectome during development by combining intracortical and extracortical SC to predict FC based on the HCP-D dataset. We observed that SC-FC coupling was stronger in the visual and somatomotor networks than in other networks, and followed fundamental properties of cortical organization. With development, SC-FC coupling exhibited heterogeneous changes in cortical regions, with significant increases in the somatomotor, frontoparietal, dorsal attention and default mode networks. Furthermore, we found that SC-FC coupling can predict individual differences in general intelligence, mainly with the frontoparietal and default mode networks contributing higher weights. Finally, we demonstrated that the spatial heterogeneity of changes in SC-FC coupling with age was associated with transcriptomic architectures, with genes with positive weights enriched in oligodendrocyte-related pathways and genes with negative weights expressed in astrocytes.</p>
<p>Together, these findings characterized the spatial and temporal pattern of SC-FC coupling of brain connectome during development and the heterogeneity in the development of SC-FC coupling is associated with individual differences in intelligence and transcriptomic architecture.</p>
<p>Intracortical microcircuits are interconnected through extracortical WM connections, which give rise to richly patterned functional networks[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Despite extensive research on this topic, the relationship between SC and FC remains unclear. Although many studies have attempted to directly correlate FC with the WMC, this correspondence is far from perfect due to the presence of polysynaptic (indirect) structural connections and circuit-level modulation of neural signals[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. Biological models can realistically generate these complex structural interconnections, but they have significant temporal and spatial complexity when solving for model parameters[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. Communication models using the WMC integrate the advantages of different communication strategies and are easy to construct[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. As there are numerous communication models, we identified an optimal combination consisting of three decentralized communication models based on predictive significance: communicability, mean first passage times of random walkers and flow graphs. We excluded a centralized model (shortest paths), which was not biologically plausible since it requires global knowledge of the shortest path structure[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]. In our study, we excluded the Euclidean distance and geodesic distance because spatial autocorrelation is inhibited. This study provides a complementary perspective (in addition to the role of WMC in shaping FC) that emphasizes the importance of intrinsic properties within intracortical circuit in shaping the large-scale functional organization of the human cortex. MPC can link intracortical circuits variance at specific cortical depths from a graph-theoretical perspective, enabling reflection of intracortical microcircuit differentiation at molecular, cellular, and laminar levels[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Coupling models that incorporate these microarchitectural properties yield more accurate predictions of FC from SC[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>].</p>
<p>SC-FC coupling may reflect anatomical and functional hierarchies. SC-FC coupling in association areas, which have lower structural connectivity, was lower than that in sensory areas. This configuration effectively releases the association cortex from strong structural constraints imposed by early activity cascades, promoting higher cognitive functions that transcend simple sensori-motor exchanges[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. A macroscale functional principal gradient[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>] in the human brain has been shown to align with anatomical hierarchies. Our study revealed a similar pattern, where SC-FC coupling was positively associated with evolutionary expansion and myelin content, and negatively associated with functional principal gradient during development. These findings are consistent with previous studies on WMC-FC coupling[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] and MPC-FC coupling[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Notably, we also found that the coupling pattern differed from that in adults, as illustrated by the moderate coupling of the sensorimotor network in the adult population[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. SC-FC coupling is dynamic and changes throughout the lifespan[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], particularly during adolescence[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], suggesting that perfect SC-FC coupling may require sufficient structural descriptors. Moreover, our results suggested that regional preferential contributions across different SCs lead to variations in the underlying communication process. Interestingly, the two extremes of regions in terms of MPC correlations corresponded to the two anchor points of the gradient[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. The preferential regions in WM communication models were consistent with the adult results[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>].</p>
<p>In addition, we observed developmental changes in SC-FC coupling dominated by a positive increase in cortical regions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], broadly distributed across somatomotor, frontoparietal, dorsal attention, and default mode networks[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. In a lifespan study, the global SC-FC coupling alterations with age were driven by reduced coupling in the sensorimotor network[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. This finding is consistent across age ranges, indicating that sensorimotor coupling changes appear throughout development and ageing. Furthermore, we investigated the relationships of coupling alterations with evolutionary expansion and functional principal gradient but found no significant correlations, in contrast to a previous study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. These discrepancies likely arise from differences in coupling methods. We also found the SC-FC coupling with age across regions within subnetworks has more variability than the differences between networks, suggesting that the coupling with age is more likely region-dependent than network-dependent.</p>
<p>The neural circuits in the human brain support a wide repertoire of human behaviour[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]. Our study demonstrates that the degree of SC-FC coupling in cortical regions can significantly predict cognitive scores across various domains, suggesting that it serves as a sensitive indicator of brain maturity. Moreover, even after controlling for age effects, SC-FC coupling significantly predicted general intelligence, suggesting that it can partly explain individual differences in intelligence, as shown in previous studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. In another study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], positive correlations between executive function and SC-FC coupling were mainly observed in the rostro-lateral frontal and medial occipital regions, whereas negative associations were found in only the right primary motor cortex. While SC-FC coupling was not found to predict age-adjusted executive function in our study, we observed that the frontoparietal network and the default mode network specifically contributed higher positive prediction weights for general intelligence, whereas the somatomotor network had negative prediction weights[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. The maturation of the frontoparietal network and default mode network continues into early adulthood, providing an extended window for the activity-dependent reconstruction of distributed neural circuits in the cross-modal association cortex[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. As we observed increasing coupling in these networks, this may have contributed to the improvements in general intelligence, highlighting the flexible and integrated role of these networks.</p>
<p>Classic twin studies have reported that the heritability of coupling differs among cortical regions, with higher heritability in the visual network than in other cortical networks[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. An inverse correlation between the pattern of SC-FC coupling and heritable connectivity profiles has been reported[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. This led us to hypothesize that the development of SC-FC coupling may be influenced by the expression patterns of the genetic transcriptome across various cell types with different spatial distributions. Our findings suggest that the spatial development of SC-FC coupling is associated with underlying transcriptome structure. Specifically, genes positively associated with the development of SC-FC coupling were enriched in oligodendrocyte-related pathways. Oligodendrocytes, specialized glial cells in the central nervous system, play a crucial role in myelination by producing myelin sheaths that enable saltatory conduction and provide metabolic support to axons[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]. Defects in myelination have been linked to developmental disorders[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>]. This seems to indicate that significant alterations in SC-FC coupling during development may reflect neural plasticity, such as activity-dependent myelination of axons connecting functionally coupled regions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>]. Conversely, we found that genes negatively correlated with SC-FC coupling were enriched in two specific gene pathways within astrocytes, inhibitory neurons and microglia. Both astrocytes and microglia have been implicated in synaptic pruning, a critical developmental process for the formation of fully functional neuronal circuits that eliminates weak and inappropriate synapses[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>]. Importantly, the precise establishment of synapses is crucial for establishing the intercellular connectivity patterns of GABAergic neurons[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>]. These findings suggest that the subtle alterations observed in SC-FC coupling are closely associated with the refinement of mature neural circuits.</p>
<p>Several methodological issues must be addressed. First, we implemented a conservative quality control procedure to address head motion, which unavoidably resulted in the loss of some valuable data. Given the confounding influence of head motion in fMRI studies, especially those involving developing populations, we applied censoring of high-motion frames and included motion as a covariate in the GLM analysis and cognitive prediction to minimize its effects[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>]. Second, Second, although we observed SC-FC coupling across development by integrating intra- and extracortical SC to predict FC, it is worth noting that combining deep learning models[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>], biophysical models[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], or dynamic coupling[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] perspectives may provide complementary insights. Third, the appropriateness of structurally defined regions for the functional analysis is also a topic of important debate. Fourth, we focused solely on cortico-cortical pathways, excluding subcortical nuclei from analysis. This decision stemmed from the difficulty of reconstructing the surface of subcortical regions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>] and characterizing their connections using MPC technique, as well as the challenge of accurately resolving the connections of small structures within subcortical regions using whole-brain diffusion imaging and tractography techniques[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>]. In addition, the reconstruction of short connections between hemispheres is a notable challenge. Fifth, it is important to acknowledge that changes in gene expression levels during development may introduce bias in the results. Finally, validation of sensitivity across independent datasets is a crucial step in ensuring the reliability of our results. To address this, we employed an alternative split-half validation strategy and the results supported the reliability of the current findings. However, future verification of current findings on independent datasets are still needed.</p>

Briefly, structural T1w and T2w images went through gradient distortion correction, alignment, bias field correction, registration to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, white matter and pial surface reconstruction, segment structures, and surface registration and downsampling to 32k_fs_LR mesh. A T1w/T2w ratio image, which indicates intracortical myelin, was produced for each participant[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>].

Finally, twenty-seven communication models[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] were subsequently derived from the weighted probabilistic network, including shortest path length (gamma values = {0.12, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4}), communicability[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], cosine similarity, search information (weight-to-cost transformations = {0.12, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4})[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>], path transitivity (weight-to-cost transformations = {0.12, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4})[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>], matching index[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>], greedy navigation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>], mean first passage times of random walkers[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>], and flow graphs (timescales = {1, 2.5, 5, 10})[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>]; for more details see Text S1.</p>

<title>Functional network (FC)</title>
<p>To further clean the functional signal, we performed frame censoring, regressed out nuisance variables (including white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, global signal, and 12 motion parameters), and executed temporal bandpass filtering (0.01∼0.1 Hz). Specifically, we identified censored frames with motion greater than 0.15 mm[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] based on the Movement_RelativeRMS.txt file. We flagged one frame before and two frames after each censored frame, along with any uncensored segments of fewer than five contiguous frames, as censored frames as well[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>]. We discarded fMRI runs with more than half of the frames flagged as censored frames, and excluded participants with fewer than 300 frames (less than 4 minutes). The nuisance variables were removed from time series based on general linear model. We averaged the time series of vertices into 210 cortical regions according to the BNA[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. We then computed pairwise Pearson’s correlations between regional time series, and applied Fisher’s r-to-z-transformation to the resulting correlations to generate individual FC.</p>

<p>The exclusion of participants in the whole multimodal data processing pipeline was depicted in Figure S13. In the context of fMRI data, we computed Pearson’s correlation between motion and age, as well as between the number of remaining frames and age, for the included participants aged 5 to 22 years and 8 to 22 years, respectively. These correlations were presented in Figure S14.</p>

<title>SC-FC coupling</title>
<p>A multilinear model[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>] was constructed to examine the relationship of individual nodewise SC profiles and FC profiles. For a given node, the predictive variable was nodal SC <bold>S</bold> = {<italic><bold>s</bold></italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic><bold>s</bold></italic><sub>2</sub>, ⋯, <italic><bold>s</bold></italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, ⋯, <italic><bold>s</bold></italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub>}, <italic><bold>s</bold></italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> ∈ R<sup><italic>m</italic></sup> where <italic><bold>s</bold></italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is the <italic>i</italic>th SC profiles, <italic>n</italic> is the number of SC profiles, and <italic>m</italic> is the node number. The nodal functional profile <italic><bold>f</bold></italic> is the dependent variable.

</disp-formula>
where the intercept <italic>b</italic><sub>0</sub> and regression coefficients <italic>b</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> are estimated model parameters. For each participant, goodness of fit per node represents the nodal coupling between SC and FC, quantified as the adjusted coefficient of determination[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="557107v4_eqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> is the unadjusted coefficient of determination, <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> is the number of connection (<italic>N</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> = 245 for BNA), and <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> is the number of predictors.</p>
<p>In the present study, WMC communication models that represented diverse geometric, topological, or dynamic factors, were used to explain nodal FC variation. Notably, too many predictors will result in overfitting and blindly increase the explained variance. And covariance structure among the predictors may lead to unreliable predictor weights. Thus, we applied Haufe’s inversion transform[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>] to address these issues and identified reliable communication mechanisms. Specifically, we used all twenty-seven communication models to predict FC at the node level for each participant. We applied Haufe’s inversion transform[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>] to obtain predictor weights for each model, with higher or lower values indicating stronger positive or negative correlations with FC. Next, we generated 1,000 FC permutations through a spin test[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>] for each nodal prediction in each subject and obtained random distributions of model weights. These weights were averaged over the group and were investigated the enrichment of the highest weights per region to assess whether the number of highest weights across communication models was significantly larger than that in a random discovery.</p>
<p>The significant communication models were used to represent WMC communication properties and to predict functional profiles in conjunction with MPC as structural profiles (predictors). To test the significance of the resulting adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> values and system-specific of coupling, we generated a null predictive model using a spin test[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>] with 1,000 spatially-constrained repetitions. We also used Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric one-way analysis of variance (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA) to compare coupling differences between systems. To investigate the contributions of various structural predictors, we applied Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA to test the predictive weights derived by Haufe’s inversion transform, identifying optimal predictors across regions. We corrected for multiple comparisons using FDR correction. Additionally, we used a general linear model to explore age-related developmental patterns of SC-FC coupling, while controlling for sex, intracranial volume, and in-scanner head motion. Similarly, the system-specific significance of coupling alteration was calculated based on the 1,000 repetitions of the spin test. In addition, we have constructed the models using only MPC or SCs to predict FC, respectively. Spearman’s correlation was used to assess the consistency between spatial patterns based on different models.</p>
<p>We examined the associations of SC-FC coupling and its developmental pattern with evolution expansion[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>], myelin content[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>], and functional principal gradient[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. Spearman’s correlation analyses were used to quantify the strength of correlations, with significance corrected for spatial autocorrelation with 1,000 repetitions of the spin test.</p>

<title>Prediction of cognitive function</title>
<p>Based on our predictive evaluation work[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], the Elastic-Net algorithm was applied to predict cognitive performance using nodal SC-FC coupling, which tends to yield robust prediction performance across various dimensions of cognitive tasks. The objective function is as follows:
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="557107v4_eqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic><bold>X</bold></italic> = {<italic><bold>x</bold></italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic><bold>x</bold></italic><sub>2</sub>, …, <italic><bold>x</bold></italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub>} represents an observation set (e.g., SC-FC coupling) with a sample size of <italic>n</italic>, and <italic><bold>Y</bold></italic> = {<italic>y</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>y</italic><sub>2</sub>, …, <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub>} is a label set (e.g., cognitive measure). The model solves the fitting coefficient <italic><bold>W</bold></italic> = (<italic>w</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>w</italic><sub>2</sub>, …, <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>) under the minimization objective function <italic>L</italic>(<bold>Y</bold>, <italic>f</italic>(<bold>X, W</bold>)). The L1 regularization term |·| and L2 regularization term ||·||<sup>2</sup> constraint the fitting coefficient to ensure model generalization ability. <italic>α</italic> represents regularization strength, controlling the compression loss scale, and <italic>β</italic> denotes a trade-off parameter between the L1 and L2 terms.</p>
<p>We employed a nested fivefold cross validation (CV) framework comprising an external CV and an internal CV[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. In the external CV, observations were randomly partitioned into five folds, with four of them included in the training set used to develop the model and the remaining fold used as a testing set to assess the predictive accuracy of the model. This process was repeated 100 times, and the final model performance was evaluated by averaging the predictive accuracy across the 100 models. In the internal CV, the hyperparameter spaces were first defined as α ∈ {<italic>x</italic>|<italic>x</italic> = 2<sup><italic>n</italic></sup>, <italic>n</italic> ∈ <bold>Z</bold>, <italic>n</italic> ∈ [−10,5]} and <italic>β</italic> ∈ {<italic>x</italic>|<italic>x</italic> = 0.1<italic>n</italic>, <italic>n</italic> ∈ <bold>Z</bold>, <italic>n</italic> ∈ [0,10]} . Then, the training set was further divided into five folds. Four folds composed the internal training set, which was used to generate models by successively applying 16×11 hyperparametric combinations, and the remaining fold was defined as the validation set and used to find the optimal combination. Subsequently, we retrained the model on the training set using the optimal hyperparametric combination and assessed its predictive performance on the testing set by performing Pearson’s correlation analyses of the relationship between the predicted and labelled values.</p>
<p>Prior to applying the nested fivefold cross-validation framework to each behaviour measure, we regressed out covariates including sex, intracranial volume, and in-scanner head motion from the behaviour measure[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>]. Specifically, we estimated the regression coefficients of the covariates using the training set and applied them to the testing set. This regression procedure was repeated for each fold. Additionally, we conducted control analyses using age-adjusted behavioral measures to investigate the effect of age on the predictive performance of SC-FC coupling.</p>
<p>To evaluate whether our model performed better than at chance on each behaviour measure, we performed 1,000 permutation tests by randomly shuffling the behaviour measure across participants, generating a null model of predicted performance using the same procedures. We then used the corrected resampled <italic>t</italic> test to determine statistical significance[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>]. We corrected for multiple comparisons using FDR correction. For model interpretability, we applied Haufe’s inversion transform[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>] to obtain predicted weights for various brain regions. The significance of the weights for each system was assessed by comparing them to those generated by a spin test[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>] with 1,000 repetitions.</p>

<title>Association between alterations of SC-FC coupling and gene expression</title>
<p>We preprocessed the anatomic and genomic information of the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) dataset following a recommended pipeline[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. Specifically, we used FreeSurfer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/">https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/</ext-link>) to generate preprocessed structural data for each donor and projected the BNA template onto native fsaverage space using official scripts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.brainnetome.org/resource/">http://www.brainnetome.org/resource/</ext-link>). Finally, we produced an averaged gene expression profile for 10,027 genes covering 105 left cortical regions. Restricting analyses to the left hemisphere will minimize variability across regions (and hemispheres) in terms of the number of samples available[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>].</p>
<p>PLS analysis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>] was performed to mine the linear association between the spatial development pattern of SC-FC coupling and gene expression profiles. We used absolute values of the correlation between age and SC-FC coupling in 105 left cortical regions as predicted variables and the gene expression profiles of the corresponding regions as predictor variables. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was calculated to determine the association between the PLS score and the absolute correlation value between age and SC-FC coupling. To correct for spatial autocorrelation, we compared the empirically observed value to spatially constrained null models generated by 10,000 spin permutations[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>]. We then transformed the gene weight on PLS1 into a z score by dividing the standard deviation of the corresponding weights estimated from bootstrapping, and ranked all genes accordingly. We identified significant genes at a threshold of <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 and classified them as having positive or negative gene weights. To understand the functional significance of these genes, we performed gene functional enrichment analysis (GO analysis of biological processes and pathways) using Metascape[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. We focused on the selected genes with positive or negative weights and retained enrichment pathways with an FDR-corrected &lt; 0.05.</p>
<p>To investigate the cell type-specific expression of the selected genes, we assigned them to 58 cell types derived from five studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>] focusing on single-cell research using the human postnatal cortex. To avoid potential bias in cell-type assignment, we grouped these cell types into seven canonical classes: astrocytes, endothelial cells, excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and OPCs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>]. We generated a null model by performing 10,000 random resamplings of genes within each cell type. We then tested the significance of our results against this null model. Additionally, we subjected the genes associated with each enriched term to the same analysis to explore the specificity of the cell type.</p>

<title>Reproducibility analyses</title>
<p>To evaluate the robustness of our findings under different parcellation templates, we computed MPC, SCs (WMC, communicability[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], mean first passage times of random walkers[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>], and flow graphs (timescales=1)) and FC using the multimodal parcellation from the Human Connectome Project (HCPMMP)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. We used the multilinear model to examine the association of individual nodewise SC profiles and FC profiles. Then, a general linear model was used to explore age-related developmental patterns of SC-FC coupling, while controlling for sex, intracranial volume, and in-scanner head motion. We corrected for multiple comparisons using FDR correlation. Finally, we produced an averaged gene expression profile for 10,027 genes covering 176 left cortical regions based on HCPMMP and obtained the gene weights by PLS analysis. We performed Pearson’s correlation analyses to assess the consistency of gene weights between HCPMMP and BNA.</p>
<p>To evaluate the sensitivity of our results to deterministic tractography, we used the Camino toolbox (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://camino.cs.ucl.ac.uk/">http://camino.cs.ucl.ac.uk/</ext-link>) to reconstruct fibres with a ball-and-stick model estimated from bedpostx results[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>] and to generate a fibre number-weighted network using the BNA atlas. We then calculated the communication properties of the WMC including communicability, mean first passage times of random walkers, and flow graphs (timescales=1). The same pipeline was used for subsequent SC-FC coupling, prediction, and gene analysis. To assess the consistency of our results between deterministic tractography and probabilistic tractography, we performed Pearson’s correlation analyses with significance corrected for spatial autocorrelation through 1,000 repetitions of the spin test.</p>
<p>To evaluate the generalizability of our findings, we adopted a split-half cross-validation strategy by randomly partitioning the whole dataset (WD) into two independent subsets (S1 and S2). This process was repeated 1,000 times to minimize bias due to data partitioning. Based on MPC, three communication properties of the WMC, and FC, we then used the same procedures to quantify SC-FC coupling, the correlation between age and SC-FC coupling and gene weights in both S1 and S2. Finally, we assessed the consistency of results by calculating Pearson’s correlation coefficients of the relationships between S1 and WD, S2 and WD, and S1 and S2.</p>

<p>This study presents a <bold>useful</bold> exploration of the complex relationship between structure and function in the developing human brain using a large-scale imaging dataset from the Human Connectome Project in Development and gene expression profiles from the Allen Brain Atlas. The evidence supporting the claims of the authors is <bold>solid</bold>, although the inclusion of more systematic analyses of structural and functional connectivity with respect to myelin measures and oligodendrocyte-related genes, and also more details regarding the imaging analyses, cognitive scores, and design and validation strategies, would have strengthened the paper. The work will be of interest to developmental biologists and neuroscientists seeking to elucidate structure-function relationships in the human brain.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work studies spatio-temporal patterns of structure-function coupling in developing brains, using a large set of imaging data acquired from children aged 5-22. Magnetic resonance imaging data of brain structure and function were obtained from a publicly available database, from which structural and functional features and measures were derived. The authors examined the spatial patterns of structure-function coupling and how they evolve with brain development. This work further sought correlations of brain structure-function coupling with behavior and explored evolutionary, microarchitectural and genetic bases that could potentially account for the observed patterns.</p>
<p>Strength:</p>
<p>The strength of this work is the use of currently available state-of-the-art analysis methods, along with a large set of high-quality imaging data, and comprehensive examinations of structure-function coupling in developing brains. The results are comprehensive and illuminating.</p>
<p>Weakness:</p>
<p>As with most other studies, transcriptomic and cellular architectures of structure-function coupling were characterized only on the basis of a common atlas in this work.</p>
<p>The authors have achieved their aims in this study, and the findings provide mechanistic insights into brain development, which will inspire further basic and clinical studies along this line.</p>

<p>(1) Lines 40-42: The sentence &quot;The coupling of structural connectome (SC) and functional connectome (FC) varies greatly across different cortical regions reflecting anatomical and functional hierarchies as well as individual differences in cognitive function, and is regulated by genes&quot; is a misstatement. Regional variations of structure-function coupling do not really reflect differences in cognitive function among individuals, but inter-subject variations do.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. We have made revisions to the sentence to correct its misstatement. Please see lines 40-43: “The coupling of structural connectome (SC) and functional connectome (FC) varies greatly across different cortical regions reflecting anatomical and functional hierarchies[1, 6-9] and is regulated by genes[6, 8], as well as its individual differences relates to cognitive function[8, 9].”</p>

<p>(5) Lines 233-240, Reproducibility analyses: Comparisons of parcellation templates were not made with respect to gene weights. Is there any particular reason?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. We have quantified the gene weights based on HCPMMP using the same procedures. We identified a correlation (<italic>r</italic> = 0.25, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) between the gene weights in HCPMMP and BNA. Given that this is a relatively weak correlation, we need to clarify the following points.</p>
<p>Based on HCPMMP, we produced an averaged gene expression profile for 10,027 genes covering 176 left cortical regions[1]. The excluding 4 cortical regions that had an insufficient number of assigned samples may lead to different templates having a relatively weak correlation of gene associations. Moreover, the effect of different template resolutions on the results of human connectome-transcriptome association is still unclear.</p>
<p>In brain connectome analysis, the choice of parcellation templates can indeed influence the subsequent findings to some extent. A methodological study[2] provided referenced correlations about 0.4~0.6 for white matter connectivity and 0.2~0.4 for white matter nodal property between two templates (refer to Figure 4 and 5 in [2]). Therefore, the age-related coupling changes as a downstream analysis was calculated using multimodal connectome and correlated with gene expression profiles, which may be influenced by the choice of templates.</p>
<p>We have further supplemented gene weights results obtained from HCPMMP to explicitly clarify the dependency of parcellation templates.</p>
<p>Please see lines 251-252: “The gene weights of HCPMMP was consistent with that of BNA (<italic>r</italic> = 0.25, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).”</p>

<p>Please see lines 601-604: “Finally, we produced an averaged gene expression profile for 10,027 genes covering 176 left cortical regions based on HCPMMP and obtained the gene weights by PLS analysis. We performed Pearson's correlation analyses to assess the consistency of gene weights between HCPMMP and BNA.”</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Your paper is interesting to read and I found your efforts to evaluate the robustness of the results of different parcellation strategies and tractography methods very valuable. The work is globally easy to navigate and well written with informative good-quality figures, although I think some additional clarifications will be useful to improve readability. My suggestions and questions are detailed below (I aimed to group them by topic which did not always succeed so apologies if the comments are difficult to navigate, but I hope they will be useful for reflection and to incorporate in your work).</p>
<p>* L34: 'developmental disorder'</p>
<p>** As far as I understand, the subjects in HCP-D are mostly healthy (L87). Thus, while your study provides interesting insights into typical brain development, I wonder if references to 'disorder' might be premature. In the future, it would be interesting to extend your approach to the atypical populations. In any case, it would be extremely helpful and appreciated if you included a figure visualising the distribution of behavioural scores within your population and in relationship to age at scan for your subjects (and to include a more detailed description of the assessment in the methods section) given that large part of your paper focuses on their prediction using coupling inputs (especially given a large drop of predictive performance after age correction). Such figures would allow the reader to better understand the cognitive variability within your data, but also potential age relationships, and generally give a better overview of your cohort.</p>

<p>* SC-FC coupling</p>
<p>** L162: 'Regarding functional subnetworks, SC-FC coupling increased disproportionately with age (Figure 3C)'.</p>
<p>*** As far as I understand, in Figure 3C, the points are the correlation with age for a given ROI within the subnetwork. Is this correct? If yes, I am not sure how this shows a disproportionate increase in coupling. It seems that there is great variability of SC-FC correlation with age across regions within subnetworks, more so than the differences between networks. This would suggest that the coupling with age is regionally dependent rather than network-dependent? Maybe you could clarify?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The points are the correlation with age for a given ROI within the subnetwork in Figure 3C. We have revised the description, please see lines 168-174: “Age correlation coefficients distributed within functional subnetworks were shown in Figure 3C. Regarding mean SC-FC coupling within functional subnetworks, the somatomotor (𝛽𝑎𝑔𝑒=2.39E-03, F=4.73, <italic>p</italic>=3.10E-06, <italic>r</italic>=0.25, <italic>p</italic>=1.67E07, Figure 3E), dorsal attention (𝛽𝑎𝑔𝑒=1.40E-03, F=4.63, <italic>p</italic>=4.86E-06, <italic>r</italic>=0.24, <italic>p</italic>=2.91E-07, Figure 3F), frontoparietal (𝛽𝑎𝑔𝑒 =2.11E-03, F=6.46, <italic>p</italic>=2.80E-10, <italic>r</italic>=0.33, <italic>p</italic>=1.64E-12, Figure 3I) and default mode (𝛽𝑎𝑔𝑒 =9.71E-04, F=2.90, <italic>p</italic>=3.94E-03, <italic>r</italic>=0.15, <italic>p</italic>=1.19E-03, Figure 3J) networks significantly increased with age and exhibited greater increase.” In addition, we agree with your comment that the coupling with age is more likely region-dependent than network-dependent. We have added the description, please see lines 329-332: “We also found the SC-FC coupling with age across regions within subnetworks has more variability than the differences between networks, suggesting that the coupling with age is more likely region-dependent than network-dependent.” This is why our subsequent analysis focused on regional coupling.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>*** Additionally, we see from Figure 3C that regions within networks have very different changes with age. Given this variability (especially in the subnetworks where you show both positive and negative correlations with age for specific ROIs (i.e. all of them)), does it make sense then to show mean coupling over regions within the subnetworks which erases the differences in coupling with age relationships across regions (Figures 3D-J)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Considering the interest and interpretation for SC-FC coupling, showing the mean coupling at subnetwork scales with age correlation is needed, although this eliminates variability at regional scale. These results at different scales confirmed that coupling changes with age at this age group are mainly increased.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>*** Also, I think it would be interesting to show correlation coefficients across all regions, not only the significant ones (3B). Is there a spatially related tendency of increases/decreases (rather than a 'network' relationship)? Would it be interesting to show a similar figure to Figure S7 instead of only the significant regions?</p>

<p>*** For the quantification of MPC.</p>
<p>**** L421: you reconstructed 14 cortical surfaces from the wm to pial surface. If we take the max thickness of the cortex to be 4.5mm (Fischl &amp; Dale, 2000), the sampling is above the resolution of your anatomical images (0.8mm). Could you expand on what the interest is in sampling such a higher number of surfaces given that the resolution is not enough to provide additional information?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The surface reconstruction was based on state-of-the-art equivolumetric surface construction techniques[3] which provides a simplified recapitulation of cellular changes across the putative laminar structure of the cortex. By referencing a 100-μm resolution Merkerstained 3D histological reconstruction of an entire post mortem human brain (BigBrain: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bigbrain.loris.ca/main.php">https://bigbrain.loris.ca/main.php)</ext-link>, a methodological study[4] systematically evaluated MPC stability with four to 30 intracortical surfaces when the resolution of anatomical image was 0.7 mm, and selected 14 surfaces as the most stable solution.

<p>**** L426: personal curiosity, why did you decide to remove the negative correlation of the intensity profiles from the MPC?

</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with your comment that the interpretation of negative correlation is debated in MPC. Considering that MPC is a nascent approach to network modeling, we adopted a more conservative strategy that removing negative correlation by referring to the study [4] that proposed the approach. As your comment, the negative correlation might be informative. We will also continue to explore the intrinsic information on the negative correlation reflecting microstructural relationships.</p>

<p>**** Paragraph starting on L467: did you evaluate the multicollinearities between communication models? It is possibly rather high (especially for the same models with similar parameters (listed on L440-444)). Such dependence between variables might affect the estimates of feature importance (given the predictive models only care to minimize error, highly correlated features can be selected as a strong predictor while the impact of other features with similarly strong relationships with the target is minimized thus impacting the identification of reliable 'predictors').</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with your comment. The covariance structure (multicollinearities) among the communication models have a high probability to lead to unreliable predictor weights. In our study, we applied Haufe's inversion transform[5] which resolves this issue by computing the covariance between the predicted FC and each communication models in the training set. More details for Haufe's inversion transform please see [5]. We further clarified in the manuscript, please see in lines 497-499: “And covariance structure among the predictors may lead to unreliable predictor weights.

<p>**** L477: 'significant communication models were used to represent WMC...', but in L103 you mention you select 3 models: communicability, mean first passage, and flow graphs. Do you want to say that only 3 models were 'significant' and these were exactly the same across all regions (and data splits/ parcellation strategies/ tractography methods)? In the methods, you describe a lot of analysis and testing but it is not completely clear how you come to the selection of the final 3, it would be beneficial to clarify. Also, the final 3 were selected on the whole dataset first and then the pipeline of SC-FC coupling/age assessment/behaviour predictions was run for every (WD, S1, S2) for both parcellations schemes and tractography methods or did you end up with different sets each time? It would be good to make the pipeline and design choices, including the validation bit clearer (a figure detailing all the steps which extend Figure 1 would be very useful to understand the design/choices and how they relate to different runs of the validation).</p>

<p>**** Might the imbalance of features between structural connectivity and MPC affect the revealed SC-FC relationships (3 vs 1)? Why did you decide on this ratio rather than for example best WM structural descriptor + MPC?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand your concern. The WMC communication models represent diverse geometric, topological, or dynamic factors. In order to describe the properties of WMC as best as possible, we selected three communication models after controlling covariance structure that can significantly predict FC from the 27 models. Compared to MPC, this does present a potential feature imbalance problem. However, this still supports the conclusion that coupling models that incorporate microarchitectural properties yield more accurate predictions of FC from SC[6, 7]. The relevant experiments are shown in Figure S2 below. If only the best WM structural descriptor is used, this may lose some communication properties of WMC.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>The in-scanner head motion and intracranial volume are related to some age-adjusted behavioural measures, as shown in the following table. The process of regression of covariates from cognitive measures was based on these two cognitive prediction studies [8, 9]. Please see lines 549-554: “Prior to applying the nested fivefold cross-validation framework to each behaviour measure, we regressed out covariates including sex, intracranial volume, and in-scanner head motion from the behaviour measure[59, 69]. Specifically, we estimated the regression coefficients of the covariates using the training set and applied them to the testing set. This regression procedure was repeated for each fold.”</p>

<p>** Additionally, in the paper, you propose that the incorporation of cortical microstructural (myelin-related) descriptors with white-matter connectivity to explain FC provides for 'a more comprehensive perspective for characterizing the development of SC-FC coupling' (L60). This combination of cortical and white-matter structure is indeed interesting, however the benefits of incorporating different descriptors could be studied further. For example, comparing results of using only the white matter connectivity (assessed through selected communication models) ~ FC vs (white matter + MPC) ~ FC vs MPC ~ FC. Which descriptors better explain FC? Are the 'coupling trends' similar (or the same)? If yes, what is the additional benefit of using the more complex combination? This would also add strength to your statement at L317: 'These discrepancies likely arise from differences in coupling methods, highlighting the complementarity of our methods with existing findings'. Yes, discrepancies might be explained by the use of different SC inputs. However, it is difficult to see how discrepancies highlight complementarity - does MCP (and combination with wm) provide additional information to using wm structural alone?~</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>According to your comment, we have added the analyses based on different models using only the myelin-related predictor or WM connectivity to predict FC, and further compared the results among different models. please see lines 519-521: “In addition, we have constructed the models using only MPC or SCs to predict FC, respectively. Spearman’s correlation was used to assess the consistency between spatial patterns based on different models.”</p>
<p>Please see lines 128-130: “In addition, the coupling pattern based on other models (using only MPC or only SCs to predict FC) and the comparison between the models were shown in Figure S2A-C.” Please see lines 178-179: “The age-related patterns of SC-FC coupling based other coupling models were shown in Figure S2D-F.”</p>
<p>Although we found that there were spatial consistencies in the coupling patterns between different models, the incorporation of MPC with SC connectivity can improve the prediction of FC than the models based on only MPC or SC. For age-related changes in coupling, the differences between the models was further amplified.

<p>** For the interpretation of results: L31 'SC-FC coupling is positively associated with genes in oligodendrocyte-related pathways and negatively associated with astrocyte-related gene'; L124: positive myelin content with SC-FC coupling...and similarly on L81, L219, L299, L342, and L490:</p>
<p>***You use a T1/T2 ratio which is (in large part) a measure of myelin to estimate the coupling between SC and FC. Evaluation with SC-FC coupling with myeline described in Figure 2E is possibly biased by the choice of this feature. Similarly, it is possible that reported positive associations with oligodendrocyte-related pathways and SC-FC coupling in your work could in part result from a bias introduced by the 'myelin descriptor' (conversely, picking up the oligodendrocyte-related genes is a nice corroboration for the T1/T2 ration being a myelin descriptor, so that's nice). However, it is possible that if you used a different descriptor of the cortical microstructure, you might find different expression patterns associated with the SCFC coupling (for example using neurite density index might pick up neuronal-related genes?). As mentioned in my previous suggestions, I think it would be of interest to first use only the white matter structural connectivity feature to assess coupling to FC and assess the gene expression in the cortical regions to see if the same genes are related, and subsequently incorporate MPC to dissociate potential bias of using a myelin measure from genetic findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your insightful comments. In this paper, however, the core method of measuring coupling is to predict functional connections using multimodal structural connections, which may yield more information than a single modal. We agree with your comment that separating SCs and MPC to look at the genes involved in both separately could lead to interesting discoveries. We will continue to explore this in the future.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>** Generally, I find it difficult to understand the interpretation of SC-FC coupling measures and would be interested to hear your thinking about this. As you mention on L290-294, how well SC predicts FC depends on which input features are used for the coupling assessment (more complex communication models, incorporating additional microstructural information etc 'yield more accurate predictions of FC' L291) - thus, calculated coupling can be interpreted as a measure of how well a particular set of input features explain FC (different sets will explain FC more or less well) ~ coupling is related to a measure of 'missing' information on the SC-FC relationship which is not contained within the particular set of structural descriptors - with this approach, the goal might be to determine the set that best, i.e. completely, explains FC to understand the link between structure and function. When you use the coupling measures for comparisons with age, cognition prediction etc, the 'status' of the SC-FC changes, it is no longer the amount of FC explained by the given SC descriptor set, but it's considered a descriptor in itself (rather than an effect of feature selection / SC-FC information overlap) - how do you interpret/argue for this shift of use?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. In this paper, we obtain reasonable SC-FC coupling by determining the optimal set of structural features to explain the function. The coupling essentially measures the direct correspondence between structure and function. To study the relationship between coupling and age and cognition is actually to study the age correlation and cognitive correlation of this direct correspondence between structure and function.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>** In a similar vein to the above comment, I am interested to hear what you think: on L305 you mention that 'perfect SC-FC coupling may be unlikely'. Would this reasoning suggest that functional activity takes place through other means than (and is therefore somehow independent of) biological (structural) substrates? For now, I think one can only say that we have imperfect descriptors of the structure so there is always information missing to explain function, this however does not mean the SC and FC are not perfectly coupled (only that we look at insufficient structural descriptors - limitations of what imaging can assess, what we measure etc). This is in line with L305 where you mention that 'Moreover, our results suggested that regional preferential contributions across different SCs lead to variations in the underlying communication process'. This suggests that locally different areas might use different communication models which are not reflected in the measures of SC-FC coupling that was employed, not that the 'coupling' is lower or higher (or coupling is not perfect). This is also a change in approach to L293: 'This configuration effectively releases the association cortex from strong structural constraints' - the 'release' might only be in light of the particular structural descriptors you use - is it conceivable that a different communication model would be more appropriate (and show high coupling) in these areas.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your insightful comments. We have changed the description, please see lines 315317: “SC-FC coupling is dynamic and changes throughout the lifespan[7], particularly during adolescence[6,9], suggesting that perfect SC-FC coupling may require sufficient structural descriptors.”</p>

<p>*Cognitive predictions:</p>
<p>** From a practical stand-point, do you think SC-FC coupling is a better (more accurate) indicator of cognitive outcomes (for example for future prediction studies) than each modality alone (which is practically easier to obtain and process)? It would be useful to check the behavioural outcome predictions for each modality separately (as suggested above for coupling estimates). In case SC-FC coupling does not outperform each modality separately, what is the benefit of using their coupling? Similarly, it would be useful to compare to using only cortical myelin for the prediction (which you showed to increase in importance for the coupling). In the case of myelin-&gt;coupling-&gt; intelligence, if you are able to predict outcomes with the same performance from myelin without the need for coupling measures, what is the benefit of coupling?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>From a predictive performance point of view, we do not believe that SC-FC coupling is a better indicator than a single mode (voxel, network or other indicator). Our starting point is to assess whether SC-FC coupling is related to the individual differences of cognitive performances rather than to prove its predictive power over other measures. As you suggest, it's a very interesting perspective on the predictive power of cognition by separating the various modalities and comparing them. We will continue to explore this issue in the future study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>** The statement on L187 'suggesting that increased SC-FC coupling during development is associated with higher intelligence' might not be completely appropriate before age corrections (especially given the large drop in performance that suggests confounding effects of age).</p>

Adding a distribution of remaining frames across participants (vs age) would be useful to see in the supplementary methods to better understand the data you are using.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have supplemented the exclusion information of the subjects during the data processing, and the distribution and aged correlation of motion and remaining frames. Please see lines 481-485: “Quality control. The exclusion of participants in the whole multimodal data processing pipeline was depicted in Figure S13. In the context of fMRI data, we computed Pearson’s correlation between motion and age, as well as between the number of remaining frames and age, for the included participants aged 5 to 22 years and 8 to 22 years, respectively. These correlations were presented in Figure S14.”</p>

<p>** L454: 'Pearson's correlation's... ' In contrast to MPC you did not remove negative correlations in the functional matrices. Why this choice?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Whether the negative correlation connection of functional signal is removed or not has always been a controversial issue. Referring to previous studies of SC-FC coupling[12-14], we find that the practice of retaining negative correlation connections has been widely used. In order to retain more information, we chose this strategy. Considering that MPC is a nascent approach to network modeling, we adopted a more conservative strategy that removing negative correlation by referring to the study [4] that proposed the approach.</p>

<p>- Gene expression:</p>
<p>** L635, you focus on the left cortex, is this common? Do you expect the gene expression to be fully symmetric (given reported functional hemispheric asymmetries)? It might be good to expand on the reasoning.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>An important consideration regarding sample assignment arises from the fact that only two out of six brains were sampled from both hemispheres and four brains have samples collected only in the left. This sparse sampling should be carefully considered when combining data across donors[1]. We have supplemented the description, please see lines 569-571: “Restricting analyses to the left hemisphere will minimize variability across regions (and hemispheres) in terms of the number of samples available[40].”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>** Paragraph of L537: you use evolution of coupling with age (correlation) and compare to gene expression with adults (cohort of Allen Human Brain Atlas - no temporal evolution to the gene expressions) and on L369 you mention that 'relative spatial patterns of gene expressions remain stable after birth'. Of course this is not a place to question previous studies, but would you really expect the gene expression associated with the temporary processes to remain stable throughout the development? For example, myelination would follow different spatiotemporal gradient across brain regions, is it reasonable to expect that the expression patterns remain the same? How do you then interpret a changing measure of coupling (correlation with age) with a gene expression assessed statically?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with your comment that the spatial expression patterns is expected to vary at different periods. We have revised the previous description, please see lines 383-386: “Fifth, it is important to acknowledge that changes in gene expression levels during development may introduce bias in the results.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Reproducibility analyses:</p>
<p>** Paragraph L576: are we to understand that you performed the entire pipeline 3 times (WD, S1, S2) for both parcellations schemes and tractography methods (~12 times) including the selection of communication models and you always got the same best three communication models and gene expression etc? Or did you make some design choices (i.e. selection of communication models) only on a specific set-up and transfer to other settings?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The choice of communication model is established at the beginning, which we have clarified in the article, please see lines 106-108: “We used these three models to represent the extracortical connectivity properties in subsequent discovery and reproducibility analyses (Figure S1).” For reproducibility analyses (parcellation, tractography, and split-half validation), we fixed other settings and only assessed the impact of a single factor.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>** Paragraph of L241: I really appreciate you evaluated the robustness of your results to different tractography strategies. It is reassuring to see the similarity in results for the two approaches. Did you notice any age-related effects on tractography quality for the two methods given the wide age range (did you check?)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our study, the tractography quality was checked by visual inspection. Using quantifiable tools to tractography quality in future studies could answer this question objectively.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>** Additionally, I wonder how much of that overlap is driven by the changes in MPC which is the same between the two methods... especially given its high weight in the SC-FC coupling you reported earlier in the paper. It might be informative to directly compare the connectivity matrices derived from the two tracto methods directly. Generally, as mentioned in the previous comments, I think it would be interesting to assess coupling using different input settings (with WM structural and MPC separate and then combined).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As your previous comment, we have examined the coupling patterns, coupling differences, coupling age correlation, and spatial correlations between the patterns based on different models, as shown in Figure S2. Please see our response to the previous comment for details.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>** L251 - I also wonder if the random splitting is best adapted to validation in your case given you study relationships with age. Would it make more sense to make stratified splits to ensure a 'similar age coverage' across splits?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our study, we adopt the random splitting process which repeated 1,000 times to minimize bias due to data partitioning. The stratification you mentioned is a reasonable method, and keeping the age distribution even will lead to higher verification similarity than our validation method. However, from the validation results of our method, the similarity is sufficient to explain the generalization of our findings.</p>

<p>Minor comments</p>
<p>L42: 'is regulated by genes'</p>
<p>** Coupling (if having a functional role and being regulated at all) is possibly resulting from a complex interplay of different factors in addition to genes, for example, learning/environment, it might be more cautious to use 'regulated in part by genes' or similar.</p>

<p>L43 (and also L377): 'development of SC-FC coupling'</p>
<p>** I know this is very nitpicky and depends on your opinion about the nature of SC-FC coupling, but 'development of SC-FC coupling' gives an impression of something maturing that has a role 'in itself' (for example development of eye from neuroepithelium to mature organ etc.). For now, I am not sure it is fully certain that SC-FC coupling is more than a byproduct of the comparison between SC and FC, using 'changes in SC-FC coupling with development' might be more apt.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have corrected it, please see lines 43-44.</p>

<p>L261 'SC-FC coupling was stronger ... [] ... and followed fundamental properties of cortical organization.' vs L168 'No significant correlations were found between developmental changes in SC-FC coupling and the fundamental properties of cortical organization'.</p>
<p>**Which one is it? I think in the first you refer to mean coupling over all infants and in the second about correlation with age. How do you interpret the difference?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Between the ages of 5 and 22 years, we found that the mean SC-FC coupling pattern has become similar to that of adults, consistent with the fundamental properties of cortical organization. However, the developmental changes in SC-FC coupling are heterogeneous and sequential and do not follow the mean coupling pattern to change in the same magnitude.</p>

<p>L283: 'We excluded a centralized model (shortest paths), which was not biologically plausible' ** But in Text S1 and Table S1 you specify the shortest paths models. Does this mean you computed them but did not incorporate them in the final coupling computations even if they were predictive?</p>
<p>** Generally, I find the selection of the final 3 communication models confusing. It would be very useful if you could clarify this further, for example in the methods section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We used all twenty-seven communication models (including shortest paths) to predict FC at the node level for each participant. Then we identified three communication models that can significantly predict FC. For the shortest path, he was excluded because he did not meet the significance criteria. We have further added methodological details to this section, please see lines 503-507.</p>

<p>L332 'As we observed increasing coupling in these [frontoparietal network and default mode network] networks, this may have contributed to the improvements in general intelligence, highlighting the flexible and integrated role of these networks' vs L293 'SC-FC coupling in association areas, which have lower structural connectivity, was lower than that in sensory areas. This configuration effectively releases the association cortex from strong structural constraints imposed by early activity cascades, promoting higher cognitive functions that transcend simple sensori-motor exchanges'</p>
<p>** I am not sure I follow the reasoning. Could you expand on why it would be the decoupling promoting the cognitive function in one case (association areas generally), but on the reverse the increased coupling in frontoparietal promoting the cognition in the other (specifically frontoparietal)?</p>
