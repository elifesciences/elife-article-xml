<abstract><p>CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) with endocrine therapy are standard for hormone receptor-positive (HR<sup>+</sup>) metastatic breast cancer. However, most patients eventually develop resistance and discontinue treatment, and there is currently no consensus on effective second-line strategies. Here, we demonstrate that maintaining CDK4/6i therapy, either alone or in combination with CDK2 inhibitors (CDK2i), slows the growth of drug-resistant HR<sup>+</sup> models by prolonging G1 progression. Mechanistically, sustained CDK4/6 blockade in drug-resistant cells reduces E2F transcription and delays G1/S via a non-canonical, post-translational regulation of retinoblastoma protein (Rb). Durable suppression of both CDK2 activity and growth of drug-resistant cells requires co-administration of CDK2i with CDK4/6i. Moreover, cyclin E overexpression drives resistance to the combination of CDK4/6i and CDK2i. These findings elucidate how continued CDK4/6 blockade constrains resistant tumors and support clinical strategies that maintain CDK4/6i while selectively incorporating CDK2i to overcome resistance.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Metastatic breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in women globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). A key dysregulation in breast cancer involves the overactivation of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Active CDK4/6 phosphorylates the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), a crucial regulator that prevents cell-cycle initiation by sequestering E2F transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Rb phosphorylation results in the release of E2F, thereby promoting CDK2 activation and cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Understanding this mechanism has driven significant advancements in therapeutic strategies, particularly for hormone receptor-positive (HR<sup>+</sup>)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2<sup>-</sup>) breast cancer, which constitutes approximately 70% of breast cancer cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). The current standard first-line treatment for HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup> metastatic breast cancer is a combination of CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) and endocrine therapy (ET) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Although this strategy has significantly improved patient outcomes, resistance remains a major challenge: approximately 30% of patients develop resistance within two years, and the majority ultimately relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Upon disease progression, CDK4/6i therapy is typically discontinued, often resulting in aggressive tumor regrowth and a lack of effective second-line treatment options.</p>
<p>While continuing ET after disease progression confers clinical benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), the value of maintaining CDK4/6i treatment beyond progression remains elusive. Multiple ongoing and completed trials have evaluated continuing the FDA-approved CDK4/6 inhibitors, palbociclib, abemaciclib, and ribociclib, after progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). MAINTAIN and postMONARCH trials reported significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) with continued CDK4/6i plus ET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Retrospective analyses likewise suggest that second-line CDK4/6i plus ET can outperform chemotherapy or ET alone in several settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Safety appears comparable or better than first-line trials, with no new toxicities and grade 3–4 events largely confined to expected hematologic adverse effects. In contrast, the PACE and PALMIRA trials did not demonstrate a PFS benefit for continuing CDK4/6i plus ET after progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Overall, the evidence for CDK4/6i continuation beyond progression is encouraging but mixed, underscoring the need for mechanistic studies of CDK4/6i-resistant proliferation to guide post-progression treatment strategies for HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup> breast cancer.</p>
<p>Like CDK4/6, CDK2 also phosphorylates Rb before the G1/S transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). The relevance of CDK2 activation in CDK4/6i-resistant tumors highlights the potential of targeting CDK2 to overcome CDK4/6i resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Several clinical trials are currently evaluating CDK2 inhibitors (CDK2i) in patients who have progressed on CDK4/6i-based therapy, either as monotherapy or in combination with CDK4/6i, with or without ET (NCT05252416, NCT05735080). Determining the optimal strategy for incorporating CDK2i in treating HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup>breast cancer that has developed drug resistance remains a critical question.</p>
<p>This study shows that, even in drug-resistant cells that remain proliferative, continued CDK4/6 inhibition results in ineffective Rb inactivation, thereby slowing E2F activation kinetics and prolonging the G1 phase. These data suggest that overall survival, rather than PFS, may serve as a more appropriate clinical trial endpoint. Moreover, our work highlights the therapeutic potential of combining CDK2i with CDK4/6i as an effective second-line strategy. Finally, we identify cyclin E overexpression as a key driver of resistance to this combination, offering mechanistic guidance for overcoming therapy resistance.</p>

<title>Maintaining CDK4/6i treatment attenuates the growth of drug-resistant cells by extending G1-phase progression</title>
<p>To evaluate the impact of continued CDK4/6i treatment in drug-resistant settings, we employed HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup> breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, T47D, and CAMA-1) and a triple-negative breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231), all of which have an intact Rb/E2F pathway. These cells were chronically exposed to palbociclib for over a month to induce drug resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We confirmed increased half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for palbociclib in drug-resistant cells compared to parental cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1A</xref>). We maintained or withdrew CDK4/6i treatment in drug-resistant cells and monitored their cumulative proliferation alongside that of parental cells. Drug-resistant cells maintained on CDK4/6i exhibited significantly slower growth than those under other conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast, resistant cells withdrawn from treatment grew at rates comparable to parental cells. Thus, despite the emergence of resistance, continued CDK4/6i treatment markedly suppresses the growth rate of drug-resistant cells.</p>

<p>To investigate how continued CDK4/6i treatment impedes the growth of drug-resistant cells, we monitored cell-cycle progression at the single-cell level. We established MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells expressing live-cell sensors for CDK4/6 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>), CDK2 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>), and cell-cycle phase (Cdt1 degron) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>), as well as a nucleus marker (histone 2B) for individual cell tracking. The CDK sensors dynamically shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm depending on phosphorylation by their respective kinases (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> top). The Cdt1 degron is degraded during the S phase, allowing for the visualization of the G1/S and S/G2 transitions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, bottom). In parental cells, CDK4/6 was continuously activated after mitosis, followed by a gradual activation of CDK2, leading to S-phase entry (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). In contrast, drug-resistant cells entered S phase through CDK2 activation with minimal CDK4/6 activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). When evaluating thousands of cells, about 98% of parental cells exhibited sustained CDK4/6 and CDK2 activation to enter the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">S1D</xref>). While drug withdrawal reactivated CDK4/6, over 90% of drug-resistant cells continued to proliferate regardless of the presence of CDK4/6i (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>, 1G, S1E, and S1F). To further assess cell-cycle dynamics, we aligned cells at cytokinesis and classified them as proliferating or quiescent based on CDK2 activity. In the absence of CDK4/6i, drug-resistant cells displayed CDK2/46 and CDK2 activity dynamics and S-phase entry kinetics comparable to those of parental cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref> and S2A–S2D). By contrast, continued CDK4/6i treatment in resistant cells resulted in persistently low CDK4/6 activity, delayed CDK2 activation kinetics, and greater heterogeneity in the timing of S-phase entry, as indicated by Cdt1 degradation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>, S2E, and S2F). These results demonstrate that despite active proliferation, continuous CDK4/6i treatment markedly decelerates and destabilizes cell-cycle progression in resistant cells, thereby limiting their growth rates.</p>
<p>CDK6 overexpression has emerged as a key driver of CDK4/6i resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). In line with these findings, we observed elevated CDK6 levels in CDK4/6i-resistant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3A</xref>). To investigate the role of CDK6 in modulating CDK4/6 activity under resistance, we established CDK6 knockout (KO) MCF-7 cells using CRISPR-Cas9 and induced resistance to CDK4/6i (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3B</xref>). Despite CDK6 depletion, CDK4/6 activity remained comparable between wild-type and CDK6-KO cells under continuous CDK4/6i treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3C</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">S3F</xref>). These results suggest a potential non-canonical role for CDK6 in mediating resistance to CDK4/6i therapy.</p>
<p>To assess the impact of continuous CDK4/6i treatment on cell-cycle progression, we measured the intermitotic time and the duration of each cell-cycle phase in MCF-7 and CAMA-1 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The intermitotic time was comparable between parental and drug-resistant cells without ongoing CDK4/6i treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). However, in drug-resistant cells that were continuously treated with CDK4/6i, the intermitotic time was extended by 30–50% compared to other conditions. Moreover, continuous CDK4/6i treatment prolonged the G1 phase by approximately 200–300% without affecting the duration of the S and G2/M phases (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>–<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). Our data indicate that maintaining CDK4/6i treatment in drug-resistant cells significantly extends the G1 phase, thereby decelerating the overall growth rate.</p>

<title>Maintaining CDK4/6i treatment triggers ineffective Rb inactivation</title>
<p>We sought to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the extended G1 phase and slow CDK2 activation kinetics in drug-resistant cells under continuous CDK4/6i treatment. Our recent studies demonstrated that CDK4/6 inhibition initially halts proliferation via Rb activation but ultimately reduces Rb protein due to decreased stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Consistent with this, we found that drug-resistant cells maintained on CDK4/6i exhibited reduced levels of both total and phosphorylated Rb compared to parental cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Importantly, CDK4/6i withdrawal restored both total and phosphorylated Rb levels, confirming that the effect was reversible. However, Rb loss in resistant cells was incomplete, as demonstrated by comparisons with Rb-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4A</xref>). To directly test the role of Rb, we used Rb-KO cells resistant to CDK4/6i. Remarkably, Rb KO rescued the prolonged G1 duration and restored rapid CDK2 activation kinetics without affecting CDK4/6 activity, even under continuous CDK4/6 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figures S4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">S4C</xref>). These findings led us to hypothesize that maintaining CDK4/6i induces a non-canonical pathway of Rb inactivation via post-translational degradation. This passive inactivation may result in inefficient E2F activation and delayed CDK2 engagement, thereby slowing G1-phase progression.</p>

<p>To test this hypothesis, we tracked CDK2 activity in individual cells and aligned proliferative events with fixed-cell measurements from the end of mitosis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and S5A). Using 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation, we quantified the kinetics of S-phase entry. Parental and drug-resistant cells without CDK4/6i transitioned sharply into S phase approximately 6 hr after mitosis and completed DNA replication within 12 hr (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3C</xref>, 3D, and S5B). In contrast, drug-resistant cells under sustained CDK4/6 inhibition exhibited markedly delayed and heterogeneous G1/S transitions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3D</xref> and S5C). Quiescent cells, as expected, showed no EdU incorporation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). We next assessed the dynamics of Rb phosphorylation and E2F activity using immunostaining and mRNA FISH (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Rb hyperphosphorylation was classified by phosphorylation at Ser807/811, a well-characterized marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). E2F1 mRNA levels, which are autoregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>), serve as a proxy for E2F transcriptional output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). In the absence of CDK4/6i, both parental and drug-resistant cells robustly induced Rb phosphorylation before S-phase entry (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). Conversely, under continuous CDK4/6 inhibition, resistant cells initiated CDK2 activation and G1 progression without Rb hyperphosphorylation, resulting in slower and weaker E2F1 mRNA induction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3H</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3I</xref>). When comparing CDK2 activity with E2F1 mRNA levels or EdU incorporation, resistant cells under CDK4/6i maintenance required higher CDK2 activity to reach equivalent E2F1 mRNA levels or S-phase entry (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>, 3K, S5D, and S5E). The reduced E2F1 mRNA levels during S phase likely result from suppression by atypical E2Fs, E2F7 and E2F8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Finally, mitotic synchronization with nocodazole confirmed that CDK4/6i maintenance prolongs G1 and delays S-phase entry in resistant cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3L</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3M</xref>). Together, these findings indicate that continuous CDK4/6 inhibition in drug-resistant cells triggers inefficient Rb inactivation, attenuated E2F induction, and delayed CDK2-driven G1/S transition, leading to prolonged and heterogeneous G1-phase progression.</p>

<title>Maintenance of CDK4/6i suppresses the growth of drug-resistant tumors</title>
<p>We investigated the therapeutic benefits of maintaining CDK4/6i treatment after the onset of drug resistance in vivo. To this end, we established an MCF-7 xenograft model by orthotopically inoculating MCF-7 cells into the mammary fat pad of immunodeficient mice. Palbociclib was initially administered when tumors reached 100 mm<sup>3</sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Following an initial period of tumor stasis/regression of variable duration, tumors resumed growth, indicating the development of acquired resistance (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Upon regrowth to 145–155 mm<sup>3</sup>, mice were randomized to one of four secondary regimens: treatment discontinuation, continued palbociclib, or a switch to ribociclib or abemaciclib. To mirror clinical practice, ribociclib was administered at a fourfold higher dose than the other CDK4/6i. Consistent with our in vitro findings, continuation of any CDK4/6i significantly attenuated overall tumor growth relative to treatment discontinuation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C–E</xref>). Additionally, we observed that switching to ribociclib or abemaciclib resulted in significantly greater tumor control compared to continuing palbociclib. These observations align with clinical studies reporting agent-specific differences in second-line PFS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Notably, analysis of tumor tissues after secondary treatment showed restoration of total Rb expression only in the drug-discontinued cohort (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Together, these data support maintaining CDK4/6 inhibition to restrain the overall growth of drug-resistant tumors.</p>

<title>Addition of ET augments the efficacy of CDK4/6i maintenance</title>
<p>Our recent studies have highlighted the pivotal role of c-Myc in amplifying E2F activity and fostering CDK4/6i resistance following alternative Rb inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). Using a doxycycline-inducible system, we found that induction of c-Myc significantly facilitated the growth of drug-resistant cells under ongoing CDK4/6i treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Figure S6A</xref>). Furthermore, despite similar low CDK4/6 activity, c-Myc induction facilitated cell-cycle progression in CDK4/6i-resistant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Figure S6B–D</xref>). These data demonstrated that c-Myc promotes CDK4/6i resistance by facilitating cell-cycle progression in drug-resistant cells.</p>
<p>Given the estrogen responsiveness of c-Myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>), we hypothesized that the continued addition of ET could further suppress the growth of CDK4/6i-resistant cells by downregulating c-Myc expression. We employed the estrogen receptor antagonist fulvestrant to evaluate the therapeutic benefit of maintaining the combination of CDK4/6i and ET. While MCF-7 cells exhibited primary resistance to fulvestrant, CAMA-1 and T47D cells displayed sensitivity to this drug (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). We used these MCF-7 and CAMA-1 cells to examine whether primary ET resistance contributes to the benefit of maintaining CDK4/6i and ET in drug-resistant cells. To establish drug resistance, CDK4/6i-resistant cell lines were chronically treated with a combination of palbociclib and fulvestrant for over two months. Subsequently, these resistant cell lines were subjected to continuous treatment with either palbociclib or fulvestrant alone or in combination, and their cumulative proliferation rate was monitored. We observed a significantly slower growth rate in drug-resistant cells continuously exposed to the combination therapy compared to other treatment conditions, not only in CAMA-1 but also in MCF-7 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, S7A, and S7B). Continued treatment with fulvestrant, either alone or combined with palbociclib, reduced c-Myc levels compared to palbociclib maintenance alone (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Our data indicate distinct resistance mechanisms between CDK4/6i and ET. Therefore, regardless of primary resistance to ET, the continued addition of ET to CDK4/6i treatment is beneficial in suppressing the growth of drug-resistant cells by inhibiting c-Myc.</p>

<p>To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the attenuation of growth resulting from continued treatment with the drug combination, we assessed CDK4/6 and CDK2 activities along with cell-cycle progression (Cdt1 degron) in drug-resistant MCF-7 cells. Cells were continuously treated with palbociclib or fulvestrant alone or in combination. By classifying cells into proliferation and quiescence based on CDK2 activation, we found over 80% of cells were proliferating in all conditions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>, 5E, and S7C). Furthermore, we observed reactivation of CDK4/6 in drug-resistant cells continuously treated with fulvestrant alone. However, when we monitored cell-cycle dynamics by aligning cells to mitosis, the maintenance of the drug combination caused slower CDK2 activation kinetics and greater heterogeneity in S-phase entry, as indicated by Cdt1 degradation, compared to single-drug treatment conditions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>, 5G, S7D, and S7E). By analyzing each cell-cycle duration, we observed a significant increase in intermitotic time and G1-phase duration, while S- or G2-phase lengths remained relatively unchanged (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>, 5I, S7F, and S7G). This emphasizes the role of the drug combination in altering cell-cycle kinetics in the G1 phase. Our findings showed the therapeutic benefits of maintaining a combination of CDK4/6i and ET in attenuating the growth of drug-resistant cells.</p>

<title>The benefit of combining CDK2i with CDK4/6i as a second-line therapy</title>
<p>We next evaluated the therapeutic potential of adding the CDK2i INX-315 as a second-line strategy. Palbociclib/fulvestrant-resistant MCF-7 and CAMA-1 cells were treated under five regimens: treatment discontinuation, fulvestrant alone, fulvestrant + palbociclib, fulvestrant + INX-315, or fulvestrant + palbociclib + INX-315. Continuous palbociclib + fulvestrant treatment significantly reduced resistant-cell growth compared to discontinuation, fulvestrant alone, or fulvestrant + INX-315 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>–<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>). Notably, the triple combination provided the most robust suppression of growth. To dissect cell-cycle dynamics, we assessed CDK activities and Cdt1 degron levels one week after treatment. Consistent with earlier results, palbociclib withdrawal triggered CDK4/6 reactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Figure S8A</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">S8D</xref>). Furthermore, we found CDK2 reactivation even in the presence of INX-315 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref> and S8D). While CDK2 reactivation was also observed, the triple combination produced the longest intermitotic intervals and G1-phase duration without affecting the S and G2 phases (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref> and S8E). Analysis of cells synchronized by mitosis further confirmed that the triple-drug regimen most strongly delayed CDK2 activation kinetics (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). Moreover, dose titration studies revealed a synergistic interaction between CDK4/6i and CDK2i (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref> and S8F). To explore transcriptomic consequences, we performed RNA sequencing 20 days post-treatment. Continued palbociclib + fulvestrant suppressed E2F target genes more effectively than INX-315, and the triple combination achieved the most potent inhibition of both E2F and Myc target gene programs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref> and S8G). Together, these findings demonstrate that, despite partial CDK2 reactivation, adding CDK2i to ongoing CDK4/6i + ET further attenuates E2F activity, delays CDK2 engagement, and suppresses resistant-cell growth. These results support a therapeutic rationale for maintaining CDK4/6 blockade while strategically incorporating CDK2 inhibition after progression.</p>

<title>Role of cyclin E/A in CDK2 reactivation under combined CDK4/6 and CDK2 inhibition</title>
<p>A recent study identifies the cyclin A-CDK complex as a key driver of rapid adaptation to CDK2 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). To investigate the mechanism of CDK2 reactivation during CDK2i treatment, we explored the role of the CDK2 activators, cyclins E and A. Using a doxycycline-inducible system, we induced the overexpression of cyclin E1 or A2 in drug-naïve MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Figure S9A</xref>). While treatment with INX-315 (100 nM–1 µM) initially inhibited CDK2 activity, CDK2 reactivation occurred within 1–2 hr after drug treatment, regardless of cyclin E1 or A2 overexpression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref> and S9B–S9D). The combination of CDK2i and CDK4/6i blocked this rapid CDK2 reactivation, but the overexpression of cyclin E1 or A2 hindered complete suppression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref> and S9E–S9G). These findings suggest that CDK4/6 inhibition is necessary for effectively suppressing CDK2 activity by CDK2i, and that cyclin E1 and A2 overexpression may contribute to CDK2 reactivation.</p>

<p>We next examined the impact of cyclin E and A overexpression in the development of persister cells, which are implicated in residual tumor growth and eventual resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). We used drug-naïve MCF-7 cells expressing live-cell sensors for CDK2, CDK4/6, and anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) (Geminin degron) activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). APC/C is a multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase typically inactivated near the G1/S transition, leading to Geminin-degron accumulation. Treatment with CDK4/6i and CDK2i induced near-complete cell-cycle arrest within 24 hr (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). However, approximately 10% of cells developed a persister phenotype through CDK2 reactivation. Overexpression of cyclin E1 increased the percentage of persister cells, while cyclin A2 had no obvious impact (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref> and S10). Further kinetic analysis revealed that cyclin E1 overexpression accelerated CDK2 reactivation and APC/C inactivation in persister cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). These findings indicate that cyclin E1, but not cyclin A2, facilitates CDK2 reactivation and persister development, promoting resistance to the CDK4/6i and CDK2i combination.</p>
<p>Since cyclin A is a substrate of APC/C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>), the lack of effect from cyclin A2 induction could be due to its degradation by APC/C. Thus, this degradation may reduce cyclin A to insufficient levels, preventing its impact on persister cell development. To further evaluate the impact of cyclin E and A overexpression on resistance development, we exposed palbociclib-resistant MCF-7 cells to the combination of palbociclib and INX-315. Both cyclin E1 and A2 overexpression significantly accelerated the development of resistance to the drug combination, with cyclin E1 having a more significant effect than cyclin A2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>). These results indicate that although CDK2 activity is targeted by CDK2i, the overexpression of cyclin E and A promotes resistance to the combination of CDK4/6i and CDK2i. Due to cyclin A degradation by APC/C in quiescent cells, cyclin E may play a more critical role in driving resistance to this drug combination.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The combination of CDK4/6i and ET has reshaped treatment for HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup> breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). However, resistance commonly emerges, and no consensus second-line standard is established. Our data show that continued CDK4/6i treatment in drug-resistant cells engages a non-canonical, proteolysis-driven route of Rb inactivation, yielding attenuated E2F output and a pronounced delay in G1 progression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>). Concurrent ET further deepens this blockade by suppressing c-Myc-mediated E2F amplification, thereby prolonging G1 and slowing population growth. Importantly, CDK2 inhibition alone was insufficient to control resistant cells. Robust suppression of both CDK2 activity and resistant-cell growth required CDK2i in combination with CDK4/6i, consistent with prior reports supporting dual CDK targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Moreover, cyclin E blunted the efficacy of the CDK4/6i + CDK2i combination by reactivating CDK2. Together, these findings provide a mechanistic rationale for maintaining CDK4/6i beyond progression and support testing the combination of CDK4/6i and CDK2i, as evidenced by concordant in vitro and in vivo results.</p>
<p>Our data indicate that maintaining both CDK4/6i and ET synergistically decelerates cell-cycle progression in drug-resistant cells by further delaying CDK2 activation kinetics and the G1/S transition without affecting the S and G2 phases. This dual effect stems from CDK4/6i causing suboptimal Rb inactivation while ET suppresses the global transcription amplifier c-Myc, collectively leading to diminished E2F transcriptional activity. As a result, this reduced E2F activity lowers the expression of critical cell-cycle genes, such as cyclin E and A, extending the time needed for CDK2 activation. Given that CDK2 plays an essential role in initiating and advancing DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>), its delayed activation significantly prolongs the G1/S transition. Moreover, CDK2 activation also contributes to Rb phosphorylation and inactivation. High CDK2 activity is required to phosphorylate Rb, and CDK2-mediated Rb phosphorylation is tightly coupled with DNA replication timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). Thus, upon Rb phosphorylation by CDK2 at the G1/S transition, drug-resistant cells may effectively proceed through the cell cycle even under continued CDK4/6i treatment.</p>
<p>Clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of sustained CDK4/6i therapy predominantly use PFS as the primary endpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). However, our findings suggest that drug-resistant tumors continue to proliferate despite CDK4/6i maintenance. Consequently, maintaining CDK4/6i appears to slow tumor growth rather than completely arrest it. This underscores the need for clinical trials to consider overall survival and tumor progression rates as more appropriate endpoints for assessing the true benefits of sustained CDK4/6i therapy. Furthermore, the distinct polypharmacology profiles among CDK4/6i (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>), with ribociclib being the most specific and abemaciclib the least, may explain the varying therapeutic outcomes observed among these inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>).</p>
<p>Maintaining CDK4/6i treatment beyond progression may be particularly beneficial for about 70% of patients who do not acquire new genetic mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>). However, it is important to recognize that resistance to CDK4/6i often arises from mutations in genes associated with mitogenic or hormone-signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>). These include mutations in <italic>PIK3CA</italic>, <italic>ESR1</italic>, <italic>FGFR1</italic>–<italic>3</italic>, and <italic>HER2</italic>, which have been linked to increased c-Myc expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>). Additionally, previous studies have identified <italic>FAT1</italic> mutations as a driver of CDK4/6i resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>). These resistance mutations may reduce the efficacy of maintaining CDK4/6i and ET therapy. Moreover, about 4.7% of HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup> breast cancer patients exhibit <italic>Rb</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>), making CDK4/6i treatment unlikely to be effective, thus making its continuation inadvisable in these cases.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study provides mechanistic rationale for maintaining CDK4/6i together with ET after disease progression in HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup> breast cancers that retain an intact Rb/E2F pathway. The combination of CDK4/6i and CDK2i can further provide durable growth suppression, consistent with prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). However, it is essential to acknowledge that CDK2/4/6 inhibition may promote whole-genome duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>), potentially fueling more aggressive tumor evolution. Finally, we identify cyclin E overexpression as a key driver of resistance to dual CDK4/6i and CDK2i therapy, providing a basis for biomarker-guided patient selection and the development of strategies to overcome therapeutic resistance.</p>

<p>Cells were seeded in glass-bottom 96 well plates (Cellvis, P96-1.5H-N) at least 16 hr before experiments. S-phase fraction was assessed by EdU incorporation. Cells were pulsed with EdU (10 µM) for 15 min at 37°C, fixed in 4% formaldehyde (Thermo Scientific, 28906) in PBS supplemented with 10 mM HEPES (Sigma-Aldrich, H3537) for 15 min at room temperature (RT), and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS (PBS-T; Sigma-Aldrich, T8787) for 15 min. EdU was detected by click chemistry (15 min at RT) in 2 mM CuSO4 (Sigma-Aldrich, C1297), 20 mg/ml sodium ascorbate (Sigma-Aldrich, A4034), and 3 µM Alexa Fluor Dye 647 picolyl azide (Click Chemistry Tool, 1300) prepared in TBS (pH 8.3; Sigma-Aldrich, T6066).</p>
<p>For immunofluorescence (IF), cells were blocked (1 hr, RT) in PBS containing 10% FBS, 1% BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.01% NaN3. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer: anti-phospho-Rb (Ser807/811; Cell Signaling Technology, 8516), anti-Rb (BD Biosciences, 554136), and anti-c-Myc (Cell Signaling Technology, 5605). The next day, Alexa Fluor 488- or 568-conjugated secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were applied for 1 hr at RT (1:2,000 in blocking buffer). Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 62249; 10 mg/mL stock diluted 1:10,000 in PBS, 15 min, RT). Cells were washed with PBS between steps and stored in PBS until imaging. For mRNA FISH, the ViewRNA ISH Cell Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, QVC0001) and an E2F1 probe set (Thermo Fisher Scientific, VA1-12108-VC) were used according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
<p>For experiments in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, we used a live–fixed pipeline. Asynchronously proliferating cells were imaged live for ≥48 h (37 °C, 5% CO₂; acquisition parameters detailed in “Live and fixed cell image acquisition”). Histone H2B fluorescence was used to segment/track nuclei and define time since mitosis (t = 0 at anaphase), and a CDK2 KTR provided CDK2 activity in the last live frame. Immediately after the live acquisition, the same wells were pulsed with EdU (10 µM, 15 min) and fixed/permeabilized as above. To prevent interference from fluorescent proteins during fixed assays, we photobleached residual fluorescence with 3% H₂O₂ + 20 mM HCl in PBS for 2 hr at RT.

<title>Image processing and analysis</title>
<p>Live- and fixed-cell images were processed using custom MATLAB scripts (MathWorks, R2021a). Flat-field correction was applied to reduce illumination bias. For fixed-cell analysis, nuclei were segmented on Hoechst using a histogram-curvature threshold. For live-cell analysis, nuclei were segmented using H2B-iRFP670 with a Laplacian-of-Gaussian blob detector; adjacent nuclei were separated by marker-based watershed. Background was corrected by subtracting the 50th percentile of non-nuclear pixels. For live-to-fixed alignment, cells were segmented in the final live frame and matched to the corresponding fixed-cell field. Cell tracks were generated with a deflection-bridging algorithm. Mitoses were identified by the appearance of two daughter nuclei adjacent to a prior nucleus and by H2B intensity (each daughter about 45–55% of the mother). Cytoplasmic signal was quantified as the median intensity within a ring 0.65–3.25 µm outside the nuclear boundary; cells with overlapping rings were excluded. For RNA FISH, whole-cell areas were estimated by dilating nuclear masks by 50 µm; cells overlapping neighbors were excluded. Raw FISH images were processed with a top-hat filter (4 µm circular kernel) to generate puncta masks. Tissue images were analyzed in ImageJ.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In their manuscript, Armand and colleagues investigate the potential of continuing CDK4/6 inhibitors or combining them with CDK2 inhibitors in the treatment of breast cancer that has developed resistance to initial therapy. Utilizing cellular and animal models, the research examines whether maintaining CDK4/6 inhibition or adding CDK2 inhibitors can effectively control tumor growth after resistance has set in. The key findings from the study indicate that the sustained use of CDK4/6 inhibitors can slow down the proliferation of cancer cells that have become resistant, and the combination of CDK2 inhibitors with CDK4/6 inhibitors can further enhance the suppression of tumor growth. Additionally, the study identifies that high levels of Cyclin E play a significant role in resistance to the combined therapy. These results suggest that continuing CDK4/6 inhibitors along with the strategic use of CDK2 inhibitors could be an effective strategy to overcome treatment resistance in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. However, several issues need to be addressed before considering its publication.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Continuous CDK4/6 Inhibitor Treatment Significantly Suppresses the Growth of Drug-Resistant HR+ Breast Cancer: The study demonstrates that the continued use of CDK4/6 inhibitors, even after disease progression, can significantly inhibit the growth of drug-resistant breast cancer.</p>
<p>(2) Potential of Combined Use of CDK2 Inhibitors with CDK4/6 Inhibitors: The research highlights the potential of combining CDK2 inhibitors with CDK4/6 inhibitors to effectively suppress CDK2 activity and overcome drug resistance.</p>
<p>(3) Discovery of Cyclin E Overexpression as a Key Driver: The study identifies overexpression of cyclin E as a key driver of resistance to the combination of CDK4/6 and CDK2 inhibitors, providing insights for future cancer treatments.</p>
<p>(4) Consistency of In Vitro and In Vivo Experimental Results: The study obtained supportive results from both in vitro cell experiments and in vivo tumor models, enhancing the reliability of the research.</p>
<p>(5) Validation with Multiple Cell Lines: The research utilized multiple HR+/HER2- breast cancer cell lines (such as MCF-7, T47D, CAMA-1) and triple-negative breast cancer cell lines (such as MDA-MB-231), validating the broad applicability of the results.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The authors made a significant effort to improve the manuscript. My comments were sufficiently addressed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study elucidated the mechanism underlying drug resistance induced by CDK4/6i as a single agent and proposed a novel and efficacious second-line therapeutic strategy. It highlighted the potential of combining CDK2i with CDK4/6i for the treatment of HR+/HER2- breast cancer.</p>

It suggests that the synergistic use of CDK2i and CDK4/6i may represent a promising second-line treatment approach. Addressing critical clinical challenges, this study holds substantial practical implications.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Drug-resistant cell lines: Was a drug concentration gradient treatment employed to establish drug-resistant cell lines? If affirmative, this methodology should be detailed in the materials and methods section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate the reviewer for raising this important question. In the revised manuscript, we have updated the methods section (“Drug-resistant cell lines”) to more precisely describe how the drug-resistant cell lines were established.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) What rationale informed the selection of MCF-7 cells for the generation of CDK6 knockout cell lines? Supplementary Figure 3. A indicates that CDK6 expression levels in MCF-7 cells are not notably elevated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful question about the rationale for selecting MCF-7 cells to generate CDK6 knockout cell lines. This choice was guided by prior studies highlighting the significant role of CDK6 in mediating resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors (21-24). Moreover, we observed a 4.6-fold increase in CDK6 expression in CDK4/6i resistant MCF-7 cells compared to their drug-naïve counterparts (Supplementary Figure 3A). While we did not detect notable differences in CDK4/6 activity between wild-type and CDK6 knockout cells under CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment, these findings point to a potential non-canonical function of CDK6 in conferring resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) For each experiment, particularly those involving mice, the author must specify the number of individuals utilized and the number of replicates conducted, as detailed in the materials and methods section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention. In the revised manuscript, we have explicitly stated the number of replicates and mice used for each experiment as appropriate in figure legends and relevant text to ensure transparency and clarity.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Could this treatment approach be extended to triple-negative breast cancer?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate the reviewer’s inquiry about extending our findings to triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Based on the data presented in Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 2, which include the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231, we expect that the benefits of maintaining CDK4/6 inhibitors could indeed be applicable to TNBC with an intact Rb/E2F pathway. Additionally, our recent paper (25) indicates a similar mechanism in TNBC.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript presents intriguing findings on the sustained use of CDK4/6 inhibitors and the potential incorporation of CDK2 inhibitors in breast cancer treatment. However, I would appreciate a more detailed discussion of how these findings could be translated into clinical practice, particularly regarding the management of patients with drug-resistant breast cancer.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you to the reviewer for this crucial comment. In the revised Discussion, we've broadened our exploration of clinical translation. Specifically, we emphasize that ongoing CDK4/6 inhibition, although not fully stopping resistant tumors, significantly slows their growth and may offer a therapeutic window when combined with ET and CDK2 inhibition. We also note that these approaches may work best for patients without Rb loss or newly acquired resistance-driving mutations, and that cyclin E overexpression could be a biomarker to inform patient selection. These points together highlight that our findings provide a mechanistic understanding and potential framework for clinical trials testing maintenance CDK4/6i with selective addition of CDK2i as a secondline strategy in drug-resistant HR+/HER2- breast cancer.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) While the emergence of resistance is acknowledged, the manuscript could benefit from a deeper exploration of the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance development. A more thorough understanding of how CDK2 inhibitors may overcome this resistance would be valuable.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable suggestion. In the revised manuscript, we have expanded our Discussion to more explicitly synthesize the molecular mechanisms of resistance and how CDK2 inhibitors counteract them. Specifically, we describe how sustained CDK4/6 inhibition drives a non-canonical route of Rb degradation, resulting in inefficient E2F activation and prolonged G1 phase progression. We also highlight the role of c-Myc in amplifying E2F activity and promoting resistance, and we show that continued ET mitigates this effect by suppressing c-Myc. Importantly, we demonstrate that CDK2 inhibition alone cannot fully suppress the growth of resistant cells, but when combined with CDK4/6 inhibition, it produces durable repression of E2F and Myc target gene programs and significantly delays the G1/S transition. Finally, we identify cyclin E overexpression as a key mechanism of escape from dual CDK4/6i + CDK2i therapy, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for patient stratification . Together, these findings provide a detailed mechanistic rationale for how CDK2 inhibition can overcome specific pathways of resistance in HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup> breast cancer.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The manuscript supports the continued use of CDK4/6 inhibitors, but it lacks a discussion on the long-term efficacy and safety of this approach. Additional studies or data to support the safety profile of prolonged CDK4/6 inhibitor use would strengthen the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comment. In the revised manuscript, we emphasize the longterm efficacy and safety considerations of sustained CDK4/6 inhibition. Clinical trial and retrospective data have shown that continued CDK4/6i therapy can extend progression-free survival in selected patients, while maintaining a favorable safety profile (26-28). We have updated the Discussion to highlight these findings more explicitly, underscoring that while prolonged CDK4/6 inhibition slows but does not fully arrest tumor growth, it remains a clinically viable strategy when balanced against its manageable toxicity profile.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>It is well known that the combination therapy of CDK4/6i and ET has therapeutic benefits in ER(+) HER2(-) advanced breast cancer. However, drug resistance is a problem, and second-line therapy to solve this problem has not been established. Although some parts of the research results are already reported, the authors confirmed them by employing live cell markers, and further proved and suggested how to overcome this resistance in detail. This part is considered novel.</p>
<p>Overall, this research manuscript is eligible to be accepted with the appropriate addressing of questions.</p>
<p>(1)The effects and biochemical changes of combination therapy of CDK4/6i and CDK2i are already known in several papers. The author needs to highlight the differences between the author's research and that of otherresearchers.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the opportunity to clarify the novelty of our findings in the context of prior studies on CDK4/6i and CDK2i combination therapy. In the revised manuscript, we have updated the Discussion section to more clearly delineate how our work extends and differs from existing research.</p>
<p>Specifically, we now state:</p>
<p>Page 12: The combination of CDK4/6i and ET has reshaped treatment for HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup> breast cancer (1-8). However, resistance commonly emerges, and no consensus second-line standard is established. Our data show that continued CDK4/6i treatment in drug-resistant cells engages a non-canonical, proteolysis-driven route of Rb inactivation, yielding attenuated E2F output and a pronounced delay in G1 progression (Figure 7G). Concurrent ET further deepens this blockade by suppressing c-Myc-mediated E2F amplification, thereby prolonging G1 and slowing population growth. Importantly, CDK2 inhibition alone was insufficient to control resistant cells. Robust suppression of CDK2 activity and resistant-cell growth required CDK2i in combination with CDK4/6i, consistent with prior reports supporting dual CDK targeting (9-16). Moreover, cyclin E, and in some contexts cyclin A, blunted the efficacy of the CDK4/6i and CDK2i combination by reactivating CDK2. Together, these findings provide a mechanistic rationale for maintaining CDK4/6i beyond progression and support testing ET plus CDK4/6i with the strategic addition of CDK2i, as evidenced by concordant in vitro and in vivo results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Regarding Figures 3H and 3I, I wonder if it is live cell imaging results or if the authors counter each signal via timed IF staining slides? If live cell imaging is used, the authors need to present the methods.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s question. Figures 3H and 3I derive from a live–fixed correlative pipeline rather than purely live imaging or independently timed IF slides. We first imaged asynchronously proliferating cells live for ≥48 h to (i) segment/track nuclei with H2B fluorescence, (ii) define mitotic exit (t = 0 at anaphase), and (iii) record CDK2 activity using a CDK2 KTR in the last live frame. Immediately after the live acquisition, we pulsed EdU (10 µM, 15 min) and fixed the same wells, photobleached fluorescent proteins (3% H₂O₂ + 20 mM HCl, 2 h, RT) to prevent crosstalk, and then performed click-chemistry EdU detection, IF for phospho-Rb (Ser807/811) and total Rb, and RNA FISH for E2F1. Fixed-cell readouts (p-Rb positivity, EdU incorporation, E2F1 mRNA puncta) were mapped back to each single cell’s live-derived time since mitosis and/or CDK2 activity, enabling the kinetic plots shown in Fig. 3H–I.</p>
<p>To ensure transparency and reproducibility, we added detailed methods describing this workflow in the “Immunofluorescence and mRNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)” section under a dedicated “live– fixed pipeline” paragraph, and we cross-referenced acquisition and analysis parameters in “Live- and fixed-cell image acquisition” and “Image processing and analysis.” These updates specify: EdU pulse/fix conditions, photobleaching, antibodies/probes, imaging hardware and channels, segmentation/tracking, mitosis alignment, background correction, and how fixed readouts were binned/quantified as functions of time after mitosis and CDK2 activity.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Regarding Figure 3F, seven images were obtained in same fields? The author needs to describe the meaning of the white image and the yellow and blue image of the bottom in detail.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising this point. All seven panels in Fig. 3F are from the same field of view. The top row shows the raw channels (Hoechst, p-Rb, total Rb, and E2F1 RNA FISH). The bottom row shows the corresponding processed outputs from that field: (i) nuclear segmentation, (ii) phosphorylated Rb-status classification, and (iii) cell boundaries used for single-cell RNA-FISH quantification. We have revised the figure legend to make this explicit.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The author showed E2F mRNA by ISH, but in fact, RB does not suppress E2F mRNA but suppresses protein, so the author needs to confirm E2F at the protein level.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely appreciate the reviewer’s thoughtful suggestion to examine E2F1 at the protein level. In our study, we focused on E2F1 mRNA expression because it is a well-established and biologically meaningful readout of E2F1 transcriptional activity. Due to its autoregulatory nature (17), the release of active E2F1 protein from Rb induces the transcription of E2F1 itself, creating a positive feedback loop. As a result, E2F1 mRNA abundance serves as a direct and reliable proxy for E2F1 protein activity (18-20). Thus, quantifying E2F1 mRNA provides a biologically relevant and mechanistic indicator of Rb-E2F pathway status. To clarify this rationale, we have updated the Results section and added references supporting our use of E2F1 mRNA as a readout for E2F1 activity.</p>

<p>(5) Is it possible to synchronize cells (nocodazole shake-off, Double thymidine block) under the presence of cdk4/6i? If so, then the authors need to demonstrate the delay of G1 progression via immunoblotting.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this constructive suggestion. To address it, we performed nocodazole synchronization followed by release and monitored cell-cycle progression in the presence or absence of CDK4/6 inhibition.</p>
<p>Specifically, we added the following new datasets to the revised manuscript:</p>
<p>Fig. 3L: Live single-cell trajectories of CDK4/6 and CDK2 activities alongside the Cdt1-degron reporter after 14 hours of nocodazole (250 nM) treatment and release. We compared the averaged traces of CDK4/6 and CDK2 activities and Cdt1 intensity in parental cells (gray) and resistant cells with (red) and without (blue) CDK4/6i maintenance. These data show suppressed and delayed CDK2 activation, as well as a right-shifted S-phase entry, particularly under continuous CDK4/6 inhibition.</p>
<p>Fig. 3M: Fixed-cell EdU pulse-labeling at 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, and 24 h post-release further confirms a significant delay in S-phase entry and prolonged G1 duration in CDK4/6i-maintained cells compared with naïve and withdrawn conditions.</p>
<p>Together, these results directly demonstrate the delay in G1 progression following synchronized mitotic exit under CDK4/6 inhibition.</p>

<p>(6) In Figure 5C the authors showed a violin plot of c-Myc level. Is this Immunohistochemical staining? The authors need to clarify the methods.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for flagging this. The c-Myc measurements in Fig. 5C are from immunofluorescence (IF), not IHC. We now state this explicitly in the legend.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Regarding Live cell immunofluorescence tracing of live-cell reporters, the author needs to clarify the methods (excitation, emission), name of instruments, and software used.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To address this, we have expanded the “Live-cell, fixed-cell, and tumor tissue image acquisition” section in the Materials and Methods.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) While the manuscript discusses the selection of doses for CDK4/6 inhibitors and CDK2 inhibitors, there is a lack of detailed data on the dose-response relationship. Additional data on the effects of different doses would be beneficial.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s important comment. To address it, we performed additional dose– response experiments testing a range of CDK4/6i and CDK2i concentrations. These analyses revealed a clear synergistic interaction between the two inhibitors. The new data are now presented in Figure 6G and Supplementary Figure 8F of the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In clinical trials, the criteria for patient selection are crucial for interpreting study outcomes. A detailed description of the patient selection criteria should be provided.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this important point to our attention. In the revised manuscript, we have clarified the patient selection criteria relevant to the interpretation of clinical outcomes. Specifically, we note that retrospective analyses suggest patients with indolent disease and no prior chemotherapy may benefit most from continued CDK4/6i plus ET. Moreover, our data and others’ indicate that clinical benefit is expected in tumors retaining an intact Rb/E2F axis, while resistance-driving alterations (e.g., Rb loss, PIK3CA, ESR1, FGFR1–3, HER2, FAT1 mutations) are likely to limit efficacy. Finally, we highlight cyclin E overexpression as a potential biomarker of resistance to combined CDK4/6i and CDK2i, underscoring the need for biomarker-guided patient stratification. These additions provide a more detailed framework for patient selection in future clinical applications.</p>
