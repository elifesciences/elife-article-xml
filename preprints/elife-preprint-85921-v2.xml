<title>Abstract</title>
<p>TDP-43 proteinopathies including frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are neurodegenerative disorders characterized by aggregation and mislocalization of the nucleic-acid binding protein TDP-43 and subsequent neuronal dysfunction. Here, we developed endogenous models of sporadic TDP-43 proteinopathy based on the principle that disease-associated TDP-43 acetylation at lysine 145 (K145) alters TDP-43 conformation, impairs RNA-binding capacity, and induces downstream mis-regulation of target genes. Expression of acetylation-mimic TDP-43<sup>K145Q</sup> resulted in stress-induced nuclear TDP-43 foci and loss of TDP-43 function in primary mouse and human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cortical neurons. Mice harboring the TDP-43<sup>K145Q</sup> mutation recapitulated key hallmarks of FTLD, including progressive TDP-43 phosphorylation and insolubility, TDP-43 mis-localization, transcriptomic and splicing alterations, and cognitive dysfunction. Our study supports a model in which TDP-43 acetylation drives neuronal dysfunction and cognitive decline through aberrant splicing and transcription of critical genes that regulate synaptic plasticity and stress response signaling. The neurodegenerative cascade initiated by TDP-43 acetylation recapitulates many aspects of human FTLD and provides a new paradigm to further interrogate TDP-43 proteinopathies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>TDP-43 proteinopathies are characterized by the dysfunction and aggregation of Transactivation response element DNA-binding Protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43), with ~ 95% of all amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and ~ 50-60% of all frontotemporal lobar dementia (FTLD-TDP) cases harboring TDP-43 pathology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> There is significant neuropathologic and clinical overlap between FTLD and ALS with many individuals developing a mixed phenotype, providing strong evidence for a common FTLD/ALS spectrum of disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> It is also notable that TDP-43 pathology is abundant in other sporadic neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer disease (AD),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> Limbic-Predominant Age-related TDP-43 Encephalopathy (LATE),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> and Parkinsonâs disease (PD).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> The clinical and neuropathological overlap suggests that common pathogenic mechanisms may link TDP-43 to neurodegeneration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> However, modeling sporadic TDP-43 pathogenesis has been challenging since its expression levels are tightly regulated,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> which has precluded a clear separation of TDP-43 disease-related dysfunction from general toxicity resulting from TDP-43 over- or under-expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> Current knock-in models of TDP-43 disease-causing mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> provide valuable insights but may be limited in their application to sporadic disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Under normal physiological conditions, TDP-43 resides in the nucleus to control RNA processing (RNA splicing, transport, and stability) and gene transcription.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> Structurally, nuclear retention is primarily mediated by an N-terminal nuclear localization sequence (NLS) through interactions with Î±1/Î²-importins,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> and association with nucleic acids is mediated by two tandem RNA recognition motifs (RRM1/RRM2),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> however there is interplay between nucleic acid binding and nuclear localization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> The C-terminal glycine-rich domain (also termed the intrinsically disordered or low complexity domain) mediates protein-protein interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> and harbors most, but not all, familial TARDBP mutations that are causative for FTLD/ALS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> In sporadic and most familial TDP-43 proteinopathies, TDP-43 undergoes nuclear depletion and concomitant nuclear or cytoplasmic accumulation and aggregation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> Both TDP-43 loss-of-function (e.g., aberrant cryptic splicing) and gain-of-function (e.g., aggregate-induced toxicity) mechanisms have been proposed as drivers of TDP-43 pathogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>How TDP-43 becomes dysfunctional in sporadic disease remains unresolved, however, aberrant TDP-43 post-translational modifications (PTMs), such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination may play a role. PTMs modulate TDP-43âs biochemical properties leading to conformational changes, modulation of nucleic acid binding affinity, regulation of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), and propensity to form insoluble TDP-43 aggregates, all of which are disease-associated phenomena.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> Among the various PTMs, TDP-43 acetylation at lysine residue 145 (K145) within RRM1 has emerged as a critical regulator of both loss and gain of function toxicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> Acetylated TDP-43 is found within TDP-43 inclusions of sporadic ALS (sALS) spinal cord motor neurons but not age-matched control tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> Inclusions in FTLD cortex are largely composed of C-terminal fragmented TDP-43 lacking the K145 residue,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> precluding an assessment of Ac-K145 in FTLD patients. However, <italic>TARDBP</italic> mutations that disrupt RNA binding, and thereby may act in a similar manner to TDP-43 acetylation, have been identified in FTLD-TDP patients (e.g. P112H and K181E),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> supporting a pathogenic role for altered nucleic acid binding in disease. Mimicking TDP-43 acetylation with a lysine-to-glutamine substitution (TDP-43<sup>K145Q</sup>) is sufficient to neutralize the positive charge, disrupt RNA binding, and induce several hallmarks of TDP-43 pathology <italic>in vitro</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> supporting a model whereby TDP-43 acetylation drives both loss-of-function (e.g., RNA-binding deficiency) and gain-of-function (e.g., aggregation) toxicity.</p>
<p>Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to introduce a K145Q substitution into the endogenous mouse <italic>Tardbp</italic> gene, thereby generating acetylation-mimic TDP-43<sup>K145Q</sup> knock-in mice, which enabled us to investigate the pathophysiological impacts of an aberrant TDP-43 PTM while leaving native upstream and downstream genomic elements intact. Using mouse cortical neurons, human hiPSC-derived cortical neurons, and aged cohorts of TDP-43<sup>K145Q</sup> homozygous mice, we found that acetylation-mimic TDP-43<sup>K145Q</sup> induced nuclear TDP-43 foci and cytoplasmic TDP-43 accumulation, which coincided with several disease-associated and loss-of-function measures including widespread transcriptome and splicing alterations. Finally, we observed prominent FTLD-like cognitive and behavioral deficits in acetylation-mimic TDP-43 mice that correlated with biochemical and splicing alterations in affected brain regions. Our study supports lysine acetylation of TDP-43 as a driver of dysfunction in sporadic TDP-43 proteinopathies.</p>

<title>Mouse neurons expressing TDP-43<sup>K145Q</sup> undergo stress-dependent formation of nuclear TDP-43 foci and loss of TDP-43 splicing function</title>
<p>We originally showed that TDP-43 acetylation can promote RNA-binding deficiency, aggregation, and pathology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> We sought to expand these findings by exploring the behavior of acetylation-mimic TDP-43 variants in primary murine cortical neurons. We employed lentiviral vectors that encode either wild-type (TDP-43<sup>wt</sup>), acetylation-deficient (TDP-43<sup>K145R</sup>), and acetylation-mimic (TDP-43<sup>K145Q</sup>) variants to overexpress TDP-43 species in neurons, and then examined their subcellular localization by immunofluorescence microscopy. In the absence of acute cellular stress, most neurons over-expressing TDP-43<sup>K145Q</sup> showed distinct nuclear foci that were more prominent compared to TDP-43<sup>wt</sup> or TDP-43<sup>K145R</sup> constructs <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>)</bold>. When neurons were exposed to an acute oxidative stressor (200 Î¼M sodium arsenite), a sensitizing agent commonly used to enhance TDP-43 dysfunction,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup> there was a significant increase in TDP-43 foci formation with all variants <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, C</xref>)</bold>. The response in neurons expressing TDP-43<sup>K145Q</sup> was very robust, resulting in the formation of numerous large, bright TDP-43-positive foci, as well as smaller TDP-43-positive nuclear foci. These aberrant TDP-43 structures were absent from cells expressing TDP-43<sup>wt</sup> or acetylation-null TDP-43<sup>K145R</sup>, indicating that acetylation-mimic TDP-43<sup>K145Q</sup> alters TDP-43 conformation within the nucleus and sensitizes neurons to oxidative stress-induced foci formation. By coupling high content wide-field microscopy with quantitative image analysis, we observed a three-fold increase in TDP-43 foci formation in neurons expressing TDP-43<sup>K145Q</sup> <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>)</bold>.</p>

<p>TDP-43 overexpression can result in general toxicity and altered TDP-43 function, depending on the duration and the extent of over-expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup> To avoid confounding non-specific toxicity, we transitioned to a more physiologically relevant model to further elucidate the impact of RNA-binding deficient acetylation-mimic TDP-43. We employed CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis to introduce a single amino acid substitution at position 145 (K145Q) into the endogenous mouse <italic>Tardbp</italic> locus, thereby generating TDP-43<sup>K145Q</sup> knock-in mice <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S1">Figure 2 - Figure supplement 1B</xref>)</bold>. By targeting the native mouse gene, we avoided both TDP-43 overexpression and disruption of the <italic>Tardbp</italic> untranslated regions (UTRs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> A TDP-43<sup>K145Q</sup> founder line was propagated as heterozygotes and continually re-sequenced to confirm retention and propagation of the K145Q substitution <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S1">Figure 2 - Figure supplement 1C, D</xref>)</bold>. Both heterozygous and homozygous TDP-43<sup>K145Q</sup> mice were born at normal mendelian frequencies and showed no obvious developmental defects.</p>
<p>We first investigated the effects of TDP-43<sup>K145Q</sup> expression in neurons <italic>in vitro</italic> by isolating and culturing primary cortical neurons from homozygous TDP-43<sup>K145Q</sup> mice, hereafter referred to as TDP-43<sup>KQ/KQ</sup> mice and compared them to TDP-43<sup>wt</sup>-derived neurons. Exposing neurons to acute oxidative stress induced more abundant TDP-43-positive nuclear foci in acetylation-mimic TDP-43<sup>KQ/KQ</sup> neurons than in TDP-43<sup>wt</sup> neurons <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>)</bold>. Quantitative image analysis also revealed variable levels of nuclear clearing and cytoplasmic mislocalization of TDP-43 in TDP-43<sup>KQ/KQ</sup> neurons, however, no statistically significant differences in TDP-43 localization was found between acetylation-mimic and TDP-43<sup>wt</sup> neurons <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, C</xref>)</bold>. Because TDP-43 foci formation is associated with loss-of-function defects,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup> we next investigated if TDP-43 function was impaired by evaluating endogenous targets of TDP-43 activity.

<title>Acetylation-mimic TDP-43<sup>K145Q</sup> alters TDP-43 function in human neurons</title>
<p>To assess this modelâs relevance to human neurons, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate a panel of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines harboring homozygous acetylation-mimic TDP-43 (TDP-43<sup>K145Q.12</sup> and TDP-43<sup>K145Q.18</sup>), acetylation-deficient TDP-43 (TDP-43<sup>K145R.2</sup> and TDP-43<sup>K145R.12</sup>), or unmodified TDP-43 (isogenic control, TDP-43<sup>wt</sup>) <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3S1">Figure 3 - Figure supplement 1</xref>)</bold>. We confirmed appropriate editing of the <italic>TARDBP</italic> gene in each line via Sanger sequencing <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3S1">Figure 3 - Figure supplement 1B</xref>)</bold>, verified the pluripotency of the hiPSC clones <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3S1">Figure 3 - Figure supplement 1C-E</xref>)</bold>, and then differentiated each of the lines into mature cortical neurons <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3S2">Figure 3 - Figure supplement 2</xref>)</bold>. We then used immunofluorescent labelling and confocal microscopy to qualitatively assess the distribution and morphology of TDP-43 protein within neurons, both with and without an acute exposure to sodium arsenite. Untreated hiPSC-derived TDP-43<sup>K145Q</sup> cortical neurons were morphologically identical to TDP-43<sup>wt</sup> and TDP-43<sup>K145R</sup> neurons and showed similar patterns of TDP-43 localization <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>)</bold>. All hiPSC-derived lines showed a granular nuclear TDP-43 localization pattern under normal conditions, consistent with physiologic de-mixing of nuclear TDP-43.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> Following acute oxidative stress, however, TDP-43<sup>K145Q</sup> neurons showed apparent TDP-43 nuclear clearing and the formation of large, intensely labeled TDP-43-positive foci <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>)</bold>. In comparison, cortical neurons expressing TDP-43<sup>wt</sup> or TDP-43<sup>K145R</sup> maintained nuclear TDP-43 and formed small stippled TDP-43 puncta. We note that TDP-43 nuclear clearing and foci formation was more robust in hiPSC-derived neurons compared to mouse neurons, suggesting human neurons may be more sensitive to TDP-43 RNA-binding deficiency. Similar to mouse neurons, hiPSC-derived TDP-43<sup>K145R</sup> neurons were indistinguishable from TDP-43<sup>wt</sup> neurons, supporting acetylation-induced charge neutralization as a driver of TDP-43 loss of function rather than an inherent effect of mutation at the K145 locus.</p>

<p>We next asked whether hiPSC-derived TDP-43<sup>K145Q</sup> cortical neurons show more robust functional deficits compared to the mouse neuron data above. We again employed RT-qPCR to measure levels transcripts associated with TDP-43 loss of function, beginning with <italic>TARDBP</italic> as an indicator of impaired TDP-43 autoregulation. In contrast to mouse neurons, we observed an approximately 2-fold increase <italic>TARDBP</italic> mRNA in TDP-43<sup>K145Q.12</sup> and TDP-43<sup>K145Q.18</sup> neurons and a slight but significant reduction in <italic>TARDBP</italic> mRNA in TDP-43<sup>K145R.12</sup> neurons <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>)</bold>. We then assessed TDP-43-dependent splicing activity using primers specific for human <italic>SORT1</italic> splice variants, whose regulation by TDP-43 is conserved in mouse and humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup> The aberrant <italic>SORT1+ex17b</italic> splice variant was undetectable in TDP-43<sup>wt</sup> neurons, but was present in 60% of TDP-43<sup>K145Q.12</sup> and 100% of TDP-43<sup>K145Q.18</sup>, TDP-43<sup>K145R.2</sup>, and TDP-43<sup>K145R.12</sup> neurons <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>)</bold>. In samples confirmed to have detectable <italic>SORT1+ex17b</italic> transcript, levels were, on average, considerably higher levels in TDP-43<sup>K145Q</sup> compared to TDP-43<sup>K145R</sup> neurons. Appropriately spliced <italic>SORT1</italic>-WT and total <italic>SORT1</italic> transcript levels were comparable across all 5 lines, with only a slight increase in total <italic>SORT1</italic> transcript in TDP-43<sup>K145Q.12</sup> neurons <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D-E</xref>)</bold>. We conclude that <italic>SORT1+ex17b</italic> is a low-abundance transcript that accumulates in TDP-43<sup>K145Q</sup> neurons.</p>
<p>We also examined neurons for the presence of truncated <italic>STMN2</italic> and <italic>UNC13A</italic> cryptic exon mRNA, which are implicated as ALS-FTLD biomarkers and/or risk genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup> Strikingly, truncated <italic>STMN2</italic> mRNA was approximately 100-fold higher in both TDP-43<sup>K145Q.12</sup> and TDP-43<sup>K145Q.18</sup> neuron lines, respectively, compared to TDP-43<sup>wt</sup> neurons, while no difference from WT was found in TDP-43<sup>K145R</sup> neurons. <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>)</bold>. The unperturbed <italic>STMN2</italic> splice variant (<italic>STMN2</italic> WT) was reduced about 50% in both acetylation-mimic TDP-43<sup>K145Q</sup> lines but unchanged in TDP-43<sup>K145R.2</sup> neurons <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>)</bold>. We also noted a subtle increase in <italic>STMN2</italic> WT mRNA in TDP-43<sup>K145R</sup> neurons, suggesting the fully deacetylated state, achieved by acetylation-deficient mimics, may augment <italic>STMN2</italic> levels. RT-qPCR analysis of cryptic exon-included <italic>UNC13A</italic> splice variant (<italic>UNC13A</italic> cryptic exon) failed to detect the abnormal splice product in TDP-43<sup>wt</sup> and TDP-43<sup>K145R.2</sup> lines, with only low levels observed in some TDP-43<sup>K145R.12</sup> samples. In contrast, both TDP-43<sup>K145Q</sup> lines dramatically accumulated the <italic>UNC13A</italic> cryptic exon containing mRNA <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>)</bold>. The mRNA levels of the typical splice variant (<italic>UNC13A</italic> WT) were similar across all five lines <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>)</bold>, indicating that the lack of detectable <italic>UNC13A</italic> cryptic exon mRNA in WT and acetylation-deficient neuron lines was not a result of reduced <italic>UNC13A</italic> expression, but rather is likely specific to a lack of cryptic splicing events. Taken together, these results demonstrate that endogenously expressed acetylation-mimic TDP-43<sup>K145Q</sup> alters TDP-43 localization and conformation in response to stress and impairs splicing in a disease-relevant manner in human iPSC-derived neurons.</p>

<p>Here, we developed novel neuronal and mouse models of RNA binding-deficient acetylation-mimic TDP-43 (TDP-43<sup>K145Q</sup>). Using a combination of molecular, cellular, and transcriptomic readouts combined with <italic>in vivo</italic> behavioral assays, we provide evidence that aberrant TDP-43<sup>K145Q</sup> recapitulates key hallmarks of TDP-43 proteinopathies, including altered TDP-43 solubility and localization, impaired autoregulation, and abnormal splicing function. Taken together, our findings suggest that TDP-43 acetylation-induced dysfunction likely contributes to disease progression.</p>
<p>Our prior mass spectrometry analysis originally identified acetylated lysines K145 and K192,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> though a more recent study identified residues K84 (within the NLS) and K136 (within RRM1) as additional lysine residues of interest.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup> Any normal physiological or cellular role for TDP-43 acetylation remains unclear. However, given its impact on RNA binding, one can imagine TDP-43 acetylation may fine-tune TDP-43âs normal nuclear and cytoplasmic functions, but becomes corrupted due to aging and/or stress exposure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">110</xref></sup> It is likely that acetylation within the RRMs generally impairs TDP-43 RNA-binding function, as multiple studies have shown that acetylation mimic TDP-43<sup>K136Q</sup> or TDP-43<sup>K145Q</sup> variants phenocopy one another, with both showing nuclear foci formation and reduced affinity for target RNAs. Therefore, deficiency in RNA binding may explain why acetylation, or acetylation-mimic mutations within RRM1, alter TDP-43 dynamics and lead to pathology. Indeed, RNA-binding deficient TDP-43, including RRM mutations or deletions, showed increased TDP-43 phase separation, aggregation, nuclear egress, and neurotoxicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">111</xref></sup> Conversely, enhancing RNA binding was suggested to mitigate these phenotypes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">112</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">113</xref></sup> in part due to TDP-43 retention within the nucleus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> Thus, impaired RNA binding achieved by excessive lysine acetylation, or other RRM modifications, likely promotes TDP-43 pathogenesis in the form of mislocalization, aggregation, RNA dysregulation, and impaired autoregulation, as we observe with the TDP-43<sup>K145Q</sup> models described in this study.</p>
<p>Primary TDP-43<sup>KQ/KQ</sup> knock-in mouse and human iPSC-derived cortical neurons formed nuclear TDP-43+ foci that were exacerbated by acute oxidative stress. The acetylation-induced loss of RNA binding likely destabilized TDP-43 thus creating a more aggregate-prone conformation that can be further modulated by stressors (e.g, sodium arsenite) and likely other factors. Based on our original description of these TDP-43 foci, and several recent studies of acetyl-mimic TDP-43 variants,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">114</xref></sup> the nuclear TDP-43+ foci observed in our neuronal models likely represent a spectrum of phase-separated structures, including anisosomes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup> and more immobile gel-like or solid aggregates. Future studies are needed to determine the molecular composition of these TDP-43+ foci, which could lead to a better understanding of their biogenesis, progression, and perhaps their dissolution. For example, it is conceivable that re-establishing TDP-43/RNA interactions could alleviate TDP-43 foci formation, suppress aggregation, and provide potential therapeutic avenues to consider.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">115</xref></sup></p>
<p>Homozygous TDP-43<sup>KQ/KQ</sup> knock-in mice showed impaired cognitive function, as well as behavioral disinhibition in the absence of overt motor deficits up to 18-months of age, supporting a FTLD-like phenotype in this model. The progressive behavioral defects and parallel increases in insoluble phosphorylated TDP-43 in the neocortex and hippocampus are also consistent with age as a driver of the FTLD-TDP phenotype. Even heterozygous TDP-43<sup>wt/KQ</sup> mice showed intermediate levels of both cognitive impairment and biochemical perturbations when compared to wild-type and homozygous littermates, suggesting a dose-dependent effect of TDP-43 acetylation. We were surprised to find no overt motor deficits at 18-months-old despite the presence of mislocalized and phosphorylated TDP-43 in the spinal cord of TDP-43<sup>KQ/KQ</sup> mice. We speculate this could be due to any of the following non-mutually exclusive possibilities. 1) The levels of insoluble phosphorylated TDP-43 in the spinal cord have not crossed a critical threshold required for functional decline. 2) There is a time-dependent delay in the accumulation of TDP-43 and the onset of motor symptoms that could emerge beyond 18 months, which will require additional studies in aged cohorts of mice. 3) Spinal motor neurons in mice may possess some intrinsic resilience that suppresses functional decline. 4) It is possible that TDP-43<sup>KQ/KQ</sup> mice do indeed show subtle motor deficits that could be detected by more sensitive measures, such as electromyography-based techniques,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">116</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">117</xref></sup> for which future studies are warranted. 5) Finally, it remains plausible that phosphorylated TDP-43 is not inherently toxic or associated with functional decline in the spinal cord or other tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">118</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">119</xref></sup></p>
<p>TDP-43<sup>KQ/KQ</sup> mice show striking similarities to other TDP-43 depletion models. For example, the RNA profiles in TDP-43<sup>KQ/KQ</sup> brain, particularly the hippocampus, were similar to a mouse model of striatal TDP-43 knock down <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>)</bold>, including upregulation of immune response genes (<italic>Serpine1, Serping1</italic>) and altered splicing of TDP-43 targets (<italic>Kcnip2, Sort1, Dnajc5, Pdp1, Poldip3</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref></sup> Similar splicing deficits were found in conditional CAMKIIa-driven <italic>Tardbp</italic> knockout mice, accompanied by an FTLD-like phenotype with disinhibitory behavior and spatial learning deficits resembling those seen in TDP-43<sup>KQ/KQ</sup> mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">120</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c121">121</xref></sup> Hippocampal knockdown of TDP-43 in adult mice impaired learning and memory, likely due to synaptic loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">122</xref></sup> This aligns with our finding of cognitive decline without overt cortical neuron loss or neurodegeneration. We suspect that TDP-43 loss of function causes synaptic dysfunction that may eventually lead to neurodegeneration beyond 18 months. In contrast to the lethality associated with complete TDP-43 depletion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, the K145Q substitution creates a powerful yet viable partial loss of function model, which lacks developmental defects and ALS-like motor phenotypes. In addition, transcript profiles in TDP-43<sup>KQ/KQ</sup> mice do not entirely align with striatal TDP-43 knockdown.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref></sup> This is likely in part because the K145Q mutation retains some level of RNA binding capacity, leaving some TDP-43-dependent processes unperturbed. Acetylated TDP-43 could also lead to gain-of-function toxicity due to altered RNA binding patterns and conformational instability, leading to nuclear export, enhanced phosphorylation and aggregation, and a dysregulated transcriptome, as we observe in TDP-43<sup>KQ/KQ</sup> mice. Both loss and gain of function effects have been proposed for familial disease-causing <italic>TARDBP</italic> mutations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">123</xref></sup> and TDP-43 acetylation may act in a similar manner.</p>
<p>RNA sequencing revealed profound transcriptomic alterations within aged TDP-43<sup>KQ/KQ</sup> mouse brains. Many up- and down-regulated transcripts identified in acetylation-mimic mice were also differentially expressed in FTLD-TDP human tissue <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>)</bold>, particularly genes associated with cellular stress response, synaptic regulation, apoptotic signaling, and cellular adhesion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">124</xref></sup> Disease-related alternative splicing events were also common in TDP-43<sup>KQ/KQ</sup> neurons and mouse brain. For example, the altered splicing of <italic>Sort1</italic> and subsequent generation of <italic>Sort1+ex17b</italic> observed in TDP-43 acetylation-mimic mice <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>)</bold> are also observed in FTLD-TDP brain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">106</xref></sup> Moreover, SORT1 facilitates the endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of PGRN,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">106</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">108</xref></sup> a protein whose deficiency is causative of 10-30% familial FTLD cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">125</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c127">127</xref></sup> In humans, SORT1+ex17b contains an additional proteolytic site, resulting in the production of a soluble toxic variant that impairs the function of SORT1, prevents binding to PGRN and impacts neuronal survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">105</xref></sup> A recent study showed that TDP-43 depletion increased SORT1+ex17b, impaired brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling, and reduced synaptic plasticity in mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup> Importantly, hiPSC-derived cortical neurons expressing acetylation-mimic TDP-43<sup>K145Q</sup> showed impaired splicing of putative FTLD-ALS spectrum disease biomarkers <italic>UNC13A</italic> and <italic>STMN2</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup> We speculate that acetylated TDP-43 alters SORT1/PGRN signaling, as well as other pathways critical to neurotransmission, contributing to the synaptic dysregulation that is so evident in our transcriptome data. Future mechanistic studies are aimed at interrogating SORT1-PGRN, UNC13A, and STMN2-related signaling pathways in TDP-43<sup>KQ/KQ</sup> mice and hiPSC-derived neurons.</p>
<p>Other aberrantly spliced transcripts in TDP-43<sup>KQ/KQ</sup> mice provide additional insight into pathogenic mechanisms. The synaptic regulators <italic>Arfgef2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c128">128</xref></sup> and <italic>Arhgap10</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">129</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c130">130</xref></sup> were among the most affected transcripts. Concurrently, <italic>Sema5b</italic> which regulates synaptic connections and axon guidance,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c131">131</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c134">134</xref></sup> was strongly downregulated in TDP-43<sup>KQ/KQ</sup> hippocampus and cortex, as were other genes involved in synapse homeostasis and signaling. Furthermore, splicing of LRP8 (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 8) was significantly altered in TDP-43<sup>KQ/KQ</sup> mice, and abnormalities in LRP8 can cause learning and memory defects, likely by disrupting Reelin-mediated synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation (LTP).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c135">135</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c138">138</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>Nos1</italic>, encoding the neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) protein that regulates LTP and synaptic plasticity via the production of nitric oxide,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c139">139</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c140">140</xref></sup> showed aberrant splicing patterns in TDP-43<sup>KQ/KQ</sup> mice. Importantly, all of these synaptic regulators (<italic>Nos1, Lrp8, Argef2, Sema5b</italic>) and other significantly altered splice variants (e.g., <italic>Adipor2, Mapk14, Smarca4, Sort1, Mapt</italic>) have been linked to AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c138">138</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c140">140</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c148">148</xref></sup> Our transcriptome data strongly suggests that splicing and transcriptional abnormalities due to TDP-43 acetylation impacts synaptic plasticity, neurotransmission, and neuronal survival pathways in the TDP-43<sup>KQ/KQ</sup> model, which overlaps with abnormalities found in human FTLD-TDP patients. We suspect that this prominent RNA signature may underlie the cognitive decline in TDP-43<sup>KQ/KQ</sup> neocortex and hippocampus.</p>
<p>Given the correlation between TDP-43 acetylation and FTLD-TDP presented in this study, it is perhaps surprising that acetylated TDP-43 (detected with an acetylation-specific ac-K145 antibody) is found within ALS spinal cord inclusions but has not yet been detected in FTLD-TDP cortex.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> However, TDP-43 pathology in FTLD-TDP cases is dominated by the presence of C-terminal fragments lacking RRM1 thereby precluding detection of the acetylated K145 site.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c149">149</xref></sup> It remains possible that TDP-43 acetylation still occurs in FTLD-TDP at one or more additional lysine residues, and thus future mass spectrometry studies will be needed to determine whether a TDP-43 acetylation profile occurs earlier in the progression of FTLD-TDP.</p>
<p>In conclusion, disrupting RNA-binding with an acetylation mimic TDP-43<sup>K145Q</sup> mutation results in an age-dependent, dementia-like phenotype characterized by many signatures of FTLD, including progressive cognitive deficits, TDP-43 mislocalization and phosphorylation, impaired autoregulation, and prominent RNA dysregulation. Interrogation of the affected genes linked TDP-43 acetylation to many known FTLD-associated pathways, including STMN2, SORT1, and stress response signaling, while also pinpointing new putative factors as mediators of disease pathogenesis. By developing new human and mouse models of TDP-43 acetylation, we expand our understanding of sporadic TDP-43 proteinopathies and provide valuable approaches to identify and test new avenues for therapeutics that target pathogenic mechanisms underlying TDP-43 proteinopathy.</p>

<p>Murine primary cortical neurons were performed using wild-type C57Bl/6 mice (Charles River) or TDP-43<sup>wt/KQ</sup> breeding pairs.

<title>CRISPR/Cas9 Reagents</title>
<p>Cas9 guide RNAs targeting the mouse <italic>Tardbp</italic> K145 codon were identified using Benchling software (Benchling, San Francisco, CA, USA). Three guide RNAs were selected for activity testing. Guide RNAs were cloned into a T7 promoter vector followed by in vitro transcription and spin column purification (RNeasy, Qiagen). Guide RNAs were tested for cleavage activity by in vitro cleavage assay. Each guide RNA was incubated with Cas9 protein (UNC Protein Expression and Purification Core Facility) and PCR-amplified guide RNA target site. The products were run on an agarose gel for analysis of target site cleavage. Based on this assay, the guide RNA selected for genome editing in embryos was Tardbp-g79T (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data3">Supplementary File 3</xref>). The donor oligonucleotide for insertion of the K145Q and silent genotyping mutations was Tardbp-K145Q-T (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data3">Supplementary File 3</xref>). Two silent mutations were induced to create a unique HinfI restriction enzyme digestion site and permit genotyping by PCR and gel electrophoresis.</p>
<p>C57BL/6J zygotes were microinjected with microinjection buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EDTA) containing 1) 20 ng/ul Cas9 mRNA, 10 ng/ul g79T guide RNA and 50 ng/ul donor oligonucleotide (founder #9) or 2) 20 ng/ul Cas9 mRNA, 400 nM Cas9 protein, 10 ng/ul g79T guide RNA and 50 ng/ul donor oligonucleotide (founders #23, 26, 39, 44, 53). Injected embryos were implanted in recipient pseudopregnant females and resulting pups were screened by PCR and sequencing for the presence of the desired mutant allele. Founder lines were propagated as heterozygotes and regularly sequenced to confirm retention of the K145Q and silent mutations.</p>
<p>We assessed the likelihood of off-target mutations using prediction algorithms to ensure low likelihood of off-target effects. The Benchling MIT off-target score for Tardbp-g79T is 72<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c158">158</xref></sup>, and the CRISPOR-generated MIT off-target score is 86.

<title>Mouse Behavior</title>
<p>All testing was performed by experimenters blinded to mouse genotype.</p>
<p><bold>Open field.</bold> Exploratory activity in a novel environment was assessed by a one-hour trial in an open field chamber (41 cm x 41 cm x 30 cm) crossed by a grid of photobeams (VersaMax system, AccuScan Instruments). Counts were taken of the number of photobeams broken during the trial in five-minute intervals, with separate measures for locomotor activity (total distance traveled) and vertical rearing movements. Time spent in the center region was used as an index of anxiety-like behavior.</p>
<p><bold>Conditioned fear.</bold> Mice were evaluated for conditioned fear using the Near-Infrared image tracking system (MED Associates, Burlington, VT). The procedure had the following phases: training on Day 1, a test for context-dependent learning on Day 2, and a test for cue-dependent learning on Day 3.</p>
<p><underline>Training.</underline> On Day 1, mice were placed in the test chambers, contained in sound-attenuating boxes. The mice were allowed to explore the novel chambers for 2 minutes before presentation of a 30-sec tone (80 dB), which co-terminated with a 2-sec scrambled foot shock (0.4 mA). Mice received 2 additional shock-tone pairings, with 80 sec between each pairing, and were removed from the test chambers 80 sec following the third shock.</p>
<p><underline>Context- and cue- dependent learning.</underline> On Day 2, mice were placed back into the original conditioning chambers for a test of contextual learning. Levels of freezing (immobility) were determined across a 5-min session. On Day 3, mice were evaluated for associative learning to the auditory cue in another 5-min session. The conditioning chambers were modified using a Plexiglas insert to change the wall and floor surface, and a novel odor (dilute vanilla flavoring) was added to the sound-attenuating box. Mice were placed in the modified chamber and allowed to explore. After 2 min, the acoustic stimulus (an 80 dB tone) was presented for a 3-min period. Levels of freezing before and during the stimulus were obtained by the image tracking system.</p>
<p><bold>Grip strength.</bold> Grip strength was evaluated using precision force gauges. Measures were based on paw grasp of a metal grid by a mouse gently pulled by the tail. Digital force meters (Chatillon DFIS-10; Largo, FL) were mounted on an acrylic platform (San Diego Instruments), with two different grids: a left-hand grid for the front paws, and a right-hand grid for all-four paws. Each grid connected to a force transducer, which provided measures of peak force (newtons). Each mouse was given 3 trials, with at least one minute between each trial. Each trial had 2 components: front-paw measures from the left-hand grid, immediately followed by all-four-paw measures from the right-hand grid.</p>
<p><bold>Rotarod.</bold> Subjects were tested for motor coordination and motor learning on an accelerating rotarod (Ugo Basile, Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL). For the first test, mice were given three trials, with 45 seconds between each trial. Two additional trials were given 48 hours later. Rpm (revolutions per minute) was set at an initial value of 3, with a progressive increase to a maximum of 30 rpm. across five minutes (the maximum trial length). Measures were taken for latency to fall from the top of the rotating barrel.</p>
<p><bold>Morris water maze.</bold> The water maze was used to assess spatial and reversal learning, swimming ability, and vision. The water maze consisted of a large circular pool (diameter = 122 cm) partially filled with water (45 cm deep, 24-26o C), located in a room with numerous visual cues. The procedure involved three separate phases: a visible platform test, acquisition in the hidden platform task, and a test for reversal learning (an index of cognitive flexibility).</p>
<p><bold>Visible platform test.</bold> Each mouse was given 4 trials per day, across 2 days, to swim to an escape platform cued by a patterned cylinder extending above the surface of the water. For each trial, the mouse was placed in the pool at 1 of 4 possible locations (randomly ordered), and then given 60 sec to find the visible platform. If the mouse found the platform, the trial ended, and the animal was allowed to remain 10 sec on the platform before the next trial began. If the platform was not found, the mouse was placed on the platform for 10 sec, and then given the next trial. Measures were taken of latency to find the platform and swimming speed via an automated tracking system (Noldus Ethovision).</p>
<p><bold>Acquisition and reversal learning in a hidden platform task.</bold> Following the visible platform task, mice were tested for their ability to find a submerged, hidden escape platform (diameter = 12 cm). Each mouse was given 4 trials per day, with 1 min per trial, to swim to the hidden platform. The criterion for learning was an average group latency of 15 sec or less to locate the platform. Mice were tested until the group reached criterion, with a maximum of 9 days of testing. When the group reached criterion (on day 5 in the present study), mice were given a 1-min probe trial in the pool with the platform removed. Selective quadrant search was evaluated by measuring the number of crosses over the location where the platform (the target) had been placed during training, versus the corresponding area in the opposite quadrant. Following the acquisition phase, mice were tested for reversal learning, using the same procedure as described above. In this phase, the hidden platform was re-located to the opposite quadrant in the pool.</p>
<p>As before, measures were taken of latency to find the platform. On day 5 of testing, the platform was removed from the pool, and the group was given a probe trial to evaluate reversal learning.</p>
<p><bold>Acoustic startle test.</bold> This procedure was used to assess auditory function, reactivity to environmental stimuli, and sensorimotor gating. The test was based on the reflexive whole-body flinch, or startle response, that follows exposure to a sudden noise. Measures were taken of startle magnitude and prepulse inhibition, which occurs when a weak prestimulus leads to a reduced startle in response to a subsequent louder noise.</p>
<p>Mice were placed into individual small Plexiglas cylinders within larger, sound-attenuating chambers. Each cylinder was seated upon a piezoelectric transducer, which allowed vibrations to be quantified and displayed on a computer (San Diego Instruments SR-Lab system). The chambers included a ceiling light, fan, and a loudspeaker for the acoustic stimuli. Background sound levels (70 dB) and calibration of the acoustic stimuli were confirmed with a digital sound level meter (San Diego Instruments). Each session began with a 5-min habituation period, followed by 42 trials of 7 different types: no-stimulus (NoS) trials, trials with the acoustic startle stimulus (AS; 40 msec, 120 dB) alone, and trials in which a prepulse stimulus (20 msec; either 74, 78, 82, 86, or 90 dB) occurred 100 msec before the onset of the startle stimulus. Measures were taken of the startle amplitude for each trial across a 65-msec sampling window, and an overall analysis was performed for each subjectâs data for levels of prepulse inhibition at each prepulse sound level (calculated as 100 - [(response amplitude for prepulse stimulus and startle stimulus together / response amplitude for startle stimulus alone) x 100].</p>

The solution was homogenized by sonication and centrifuged at 4Â°C for 45min at 18000xrcf. The supernatant was removed and saved as the RIPA-soluble (âsolubleâ) protein fraction. The pellet was resuspended in RIPA buffer with inhibitor mixture, sonicated, and centrifuged as described above, and the supernatant discarded. The resulting pellet of RIPA-insoluble material was resuspended in approximately 1Î¼L/Î¼g of Urea buffer (7M urea, 2M Thiourea, 4%CHAPS, 30mM Tris, pH 8.5) with the inhibitor mixture (as above), sonicated to homogenize, and centrifuged at room temperature (RT) for 45min at 21000xrcf. The resulting supernatant of RIPA-insoluble, urea-soluble protein fraction was saved as the âinsolubleâ protein fraction.</p>

<title>Mouse brain RNA isolation, RNA sequencing, and data analysis</title>
<p>Mouse brain tissue was isolated, flash frozen, and pulverized as described above. Approximately 20mg of pulverized brain tissue per sample was used to isolate RNA. 1mL of TRIzol (Invitrogen 15596018) was added to each nuclease-free eppendorf tube containing pulverized tissue, and tissues were lysed via trituration with a P1000 pipette tip, followed by trituration with a 21G and then a 25G needle on a 1mL syringe. Samples were centrifuged at 4Â°C for 5min at 10,000rcf to remove tissue debris. The supernatant was removed and added to a new tube containing 200uL of chloroform, which were mixed by inversion and cooled on ice for 5min.

Only samples with an estimated RNA integrity number (RIN) â¥7.0 were sent to the New York Genome Center (NYGC) for bulk total RNA sequencing. Upon receipt at NYGC, RNA samples were re-evaluated for quantification and integrity, using Ribogreen and Fragment Analyzer 5300, respectively. Total RNA libraries were prepped using Kapa Total library prep with Ribo-Erase, in accordance with manufacturer recommendations. Briefly, 500ng of total RNA was used for ribosomal depletion and fragmentation of total RNA. Depleted RNA underwent first and second strand cDNA synthesis. cDNA was then adenylated, ligated to Illumina sequencing adapters, and amplified by PCR (using 9 cycles).

For data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">figures 1B-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4E-F</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4H-I</xref>, we used Linear Mixed Effects (LME) Models with random intercept to allow for an animal or a well specific effect. Restricted Maximum likelihood (REML) approach was used for parameter estimation. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1B-C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B-C</xref>, wells were used as a âby-subjectâ random effect. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4B-C</xref>, animals were used as a âby-subjectâ random effect. For 4E-F and 4H-I, animal ID and image ID were included as nested random effects. Either genotype or treatment group were included as fixed effects in each LME model. Results are presented as fixed effect estimates, standard errors and 95% confidence intervals (CI) <bold>(See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data2">Supplementary File 2</xref>)</bold>. All statistical analyses were performed in R version 4.2.1 (R Core Team, 2022). Complete case analysis was considered, with P &lt; .05 determining statistical significance. All other data was analyzed in GraphPad Prism Version 9.4.1 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego, California USA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.graphpad.com">www.graphpad.com</ext-link>. For data sets with n&gt;10, outliers were identified and removed (if any) using the ROUT method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c184">184</xref></sup> at Q=1%. Details regarding the statistical test performed, sample sizes, and what the data points and error bars represent can be found in the appropriate figure legends. All statistical tests were two-sided. Statistical significance was determined as p&lt;0.05. Supplementary statistical information about data presented in main and supplemental figures can be found in the figureâs accompanying source data files.</p>

<p>Necarsulmer et al describe an interesting new mouse model of TDP-43 proteinopathy in which gene editing was used to introduce a K145Q acetylation-mimic mutation previously shown to impair RNA-binding capacity and induce downstream misregulation of target genes. Mice homozygous for this mutation are <bold>convincingly</bold> shown to display cognitive/behavioral impairment, TDP-43 phosphorylation and insolubility, and changes in gene expression and splicing. This novel mouse model replicates some key hallmarks of human frontotemporal lobar degeneration and will be an <bold>important</bold> contribution to the field.</p>

<p>With this work, the authors address a central question regarding the potential consequences of post-translational modifications for the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Phosphorylation and mislocalization of the RNA binding protein TDP43 are characteristic of ~50% of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), as well as &gt;95% of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). To determine if acetylation is a primary, disease-driving event, they generated a TDP-43 mutant harboring an acetylation-mimicking mutation (K145Q). Animals carrying the acetylation-mimic mutation (K145Q) displayed key pathological features of disease, including more cytoplasmic TDP43 and impaired TDP43 splicing activity, together with behavioral phenotypes reminiscent of FTLD.</p>
<p>This is a well-written and well-illustrated manuscript, with clear and convincing findings. The observations are significant and emphasize the importance of post-translational modifications to TDP-43 function and disease phenotypes. In addition, the TDP43(K145Q) mice may prove to be a valuable model for studying TDP-43-related mechanisms of neurodegeneration and therapeutic strategies.</p>
<p>Comments on the latest version:</p>
<p>The authors have addressed most concerns. The additional analysis demonstrating a lack of neuron loss is quite different from the original study -- it is good that the authors pursued this question. In addition, new data focusing on native TDP-43 splice targets, rather than the splicing reporter, are excellent.</p>

<p>This paper extends prior work demonstrating the importance of K145 acetylation of TDP-43 as a post-translational modification that impacts its RNA-binding capacity and may contribute to pathology in FTLD-ALS. The main strengths of this paper are the generation of a novel mouse model, using CRISPR gene editing, in which an acetylation-mimetic mutation (K to Q) is introduced at position 145. Behavioral, biochemical, and genetic analyses indicate that these mice display phenotypes relevant to TDP-43-associated disease and will be a valuable contribution to the field.</p>

<p>Numerous experimental models are phenotyped in this manuscript including mouse neurons, iPSC-derived human neurons, knock-in mice, and knock-in iPSCs. Expression of acetylation-mimic or acetylation-null TDP-43 protein is achieved either with overexpression or CRISPR-Cas9-based knock-in. A complex phenotype is observed including loss of TDP-43 function (reduced autoregulation, increased cryptic splicing) and a gain of TDP-43 (increased insoluble TDP-43 protein). These correlate with downstream neurobehavioral changes which are most consistent with a cortical/hippocampal phenotype without a motor phenotype. Post-translational modifications of disease-associated proteins are thought to contribute to neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis, and this study succeeds in demonstrating that TDP-43 acetylation results in downstream molecular and behavioral phenotypes.</p>
<p>TDP-43 acetylation is a post-translational modification that is known to be associated with TDP-43 inclusions that are characteristic of human diseases. An important strength is the rigorous use of multiple different experimental models (rodent cells, iPSC-derived neurons, mice, overexpression, knock-in) with overall consistent results. Moreover, multiple orthogonal endpoints are presented including histology/cytology/immunostaining, biochemistry, molecular biology, and neurobehavioral assays. As TDP-43 acetylation is known to block RNA binding, these novel cellular and mouse models represent interesting albeit complex tools to study the functional consequences of a partial loss of function. As TDP-43 regulates its own expression (i.e. autoregulation), the complexity lies at least in part due to the loss of RNA binding leading to a functional loss of TDP-43 function which includes the increased expression of the TARDBP transcript and TDP-43 protein.</p>
<p>Conceptually, there is a disconnect in that the mouse model exhibits primarily a cortical/hippocampal phenotype more akin to frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP), while TDP-43 acetylation is only seen in ALS tissues and not in FTLD-TDP tissues because most of the pathologic protein in the latter is N-terminally truncated (i.e. the acetylation site is not present). That being said, there is no mouse model which completely and faithfully recapitulates the human disease, and this mouse model avoids overt overexpression (increased TDP-43 protein expression stemming from altered autoregulation) and avoids the use of synthetic/artificial mutation (such as mutation of the TDP-43 nuclear localization signal).</p>
<p>This revision addresses most of my prior comments including documenting the lack of neurodegeneration in this model, the use of more appropriate statistical methods, and the use of more robust/quantitative aberrant splicing measures. The one thing which would still be helpful is sequencing the top predicted off target genomic loci for their various CRISPR'd models irrespective of whether these loci are exonic or noncoding. Having actual sequencing verification of the lack of mutations at these loci is preferable over relying only on computational likelihood estimates.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1</bold></p>
<p>1.1 Fig. 1: A good control for these studies would be a TDP-43 variant with an RRM1 mutation that impairs RNA binding, but not an acetylation mimic (i.e. mutations affecting W113, R151, F147, or F149)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our original paper (Cohen et al, Nat Commun. 2015 Jan 5; 6:5845), we already characterized TDP-43 acetylation and employed a complete RNA-deficient mutant (F147/149L), as the reviewer suggested. In that original study, this mutant showed maximal RNA binding-deficiency, and therefore we proposed that acetylation mimic mutations represent a comparable RNA-binding deficient variant.</p>

<p>1.2 Fig. 1: time and expression level can influence nuclear TDP-43 puncta formation. It is important that the authors take these into account when measuring puncta number/frequency.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>All expression levels and transfection/transduction times were identical across samples. We chose the optimal times to express TDP-43 constructs yet minimize toxicity and found that neuronal transduction at DIV10 and arsenite exposure on DIV14 in mature neurons was optimal.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1.3 Fig. 2: to accurately refer to the nuclear foci as anisosomes, the authors will need to conduct higher-resolution imaging.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer and since anisosomes are not well characterized in terms of their relationship to TDP-43 nuclear foci (and may represent only a subset of foci), we have now omitted any mention of anisosomes but instead refer to them in the discussion, where we suggest that TDP-43 K145Q foci may partially represent anisosomes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1.4 Fig. 2D: it seems as though the splicing reporter should have a fluorescence-based readout (red/green ratio, for instance). Is this the case, and is the ratio informative?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now removed the splicing reporter data and replaced this with much more robust data showing RT-qPCR of downstream TDP-43 targets including Sortilin-1 (see the new revised Figure 2E and 3B-I).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1.5 Line 145: &quot;Overall, these results indicate that a single endogenously expressed acetylation-mimic TDP-43(K145Q) mutation is sufficient to alter TDP-43 localization, induce TDP-43 phase separation, and impair splicing in a murine primary neuron culture model.&quot; The authors did not assess phase separation in this study. Moreover, it would be more convincing to assess native splice targets of TDP-43 in K145Q primary neurons, rather than an exogenous splicing reporter.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>See comment 1.1 above.  We have now avoided mentioning phase separation in the main text but mention this as a potential mechanism in the discussion. In addition, we have now evaluated native TDP-43 splice targeted in primary neurons.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1.6 Fig. 4A: is the loss of neurons selective for a specific layer or region of the cortex?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Since we did not observe any gliosis, we have gone back and completely re-evaluated neuronal loss since the concept of neurodegeneration is a critical question in the TDP-43KQ/KQ mice. We do not find any significant neuronal loss in the homozygous TDP-43KQ/KQ mice (see Figure 5).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1.7 Fig. 6: The authors suggest that the large majority of splicing changes are direct results of the TDP43(K145Q) mutation and impaired RNA binding by TDP-43. However, without a direct assessment of TDP43(K145Q) target RNAs in comparison to those of TDP-43(WT), this is only an assumption. Moreover, given the fact that RNA-seq was performed in aged animals, the potential for indirect gene expression changes is very high.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our original study (Cohen et al, Nat Commun. 2015 Jan 5;6:5845), we showed that the K145Q is severely deficient in RNA binding. In this study, we now show strong evidence that many known targets of direct TDP-43 binding are dysregulated, supporting the expected loss of function if TDP-43 K145Q mutation abrogated RNA binding. Although we have not performed direct RNA binding studies to the Sort1 transcript, for example, other studies have clearly indicated that wild-type TDP-43 binds these targets. We infer that loss of function mutations (i.e., K145Q) impact direct targets of TDP-43. Future studies employing RNA-immunoprecipitation followed by RNA sequencing (RIP-seq) could be useful in this regard and will be required to mechanistically address this point.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1.8 Sup Fig. 8 is very interesting and suggests that any TDP-43 variant that is unable to bind RNA may lead to upregulation of TDP43 RNA and phenotypes similar to those observed n K145Q animals. This is alluded to in the discussion but never specifically tested.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, we agree with this reviewerâs comment. Loss of RNA binding, whether due to acetylation (e.g., K145Q) or otherwise is expected to cause autoregulatory up-regulation of the TARDBP transcript and impact other targets, potentially yielding phenotypes similar to the TDP-43KQ/KQ mice. However, new in vivo models would be needed to prove this point. For example, in the future, we will consider this possibility by characterizing recently identified RNA-binding deficient familial TARDBP mutants (e.g., P112H or K181E).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1.9 The authors should also provide some comment or potential explanation for why TDP43(K145Q) animals show no signs of motor neuron disease.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now show a moderate level of TDP-43 aggregation and hyper-phosphorylation in spinal cord of mutant mice in Figure 6 â Figure Supplement 3. We also speculate in the discussion why we observe aspects of TDP-43 dysfunction in spinal cord without overt motor phenotypes up until 18 months old.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1.10 Line 79: &quot;However, TARDBP mutations that disrupt RNA binding, and thereby may act in a similar manner to TDP-43 acetylation, have been identified in FTLD-TDP patients.&quot; Evidence suggests that the D169G mutation does not interfere with RNA binding. See Furukawa et al., 2016.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have now removed the D169G mutation from the discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1.11 It is unclear why the authors focused solely on homozygous K145Q animals, rather than heterozygous mice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We focused initially on homozygous mutant mice to provide better statistical power to detect small effect sizes. However, we have now included a thorough analysis of heterozygous mice including molecular analysis of brain tissue and mouse behavior, as shown in Figure 4 â Figure Supplements 1-2 and Figure 6 â Figure Supplements 1-3.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2</bold></p>
<p>2.1 A strength of this paper is the generation of a new mouse model to study the effects of K145 acetylation in TDP-43 proteinopathy. While the authors note an absence of a behavioral phenotype on neuromuscular testing in aged animals, it would be appropriate to include some analysis of spinal cord and skeletal muscle in this initial description of their model. At a minimum, I wonder if there is pathology in the cord (neuron loss, gliosis) or muscle (fiber atrophy) if insoluble p-TDP-43 is detectable in these tissues, and whether dysregulated splicing of TDP-43 target genes (such as shown in Fig 7) occurs at these sites.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>See comment 1.9 above. We analyzed TDP-43 aggregation, localization, and splicing in the spinal cord of TDP-43KQ/KQ mice and found mild loss of TDP-43 function that was comparable, though not to same extent, as that seen in hippocampus and cortex.  We discussed these findings in the discussion and provide several possibilities for why there are no overt motor phenotypes in these mice. We note that TDP-43 Q331K knock-in mice also have cognitive but no motor deficits, suggesting TDP-43 dysfunction may preferentially (or at least initially) impact cognitive function (White et al, Nat Neurosci. 2018 Apr;21(4):552-563).</p>

<p>2.2 Fig 2: Differences in the splicing reporter are hard to appreciate from the images shown in panel E. Is the quantification shown in panel F corroborated by an analysis of green vs yellow fluorescence or by another method? Quantification of results shown in panel 2G (from 3 biological replicates) should be included.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now removed the splicing reporter data in lieu of the more robust RT-qPCR data shown in Figure 2E and 3B-I.  We have also now included more biological replicates from our iPSC neuron imaging, as shown in Figure 3A. Due to time and resource constraints, we were not able to quantify the images shown in figure 3A, and reinforce in the text that our statements are qualitative. However, we were able to add quantitative analysis of TDP-43 dysfunction, by detecting genotype-dependent splicing changes in hiPSC neurons, as mentioned above, which strengthens our claim that TDP-43 dysfunction is prominent in this culture modee.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>2.3 Fig 4: Differences in NeuN quantification without changes in cresyl violet staining or gliosis are surprising and a bit difficult to understand. Is there confirmation of neuron loss through another metric? Is it possible that NeuN expression is lower in mutants without frank neuron loss? Also, although no significant differences were seen by IF for TDP-43 staining, did IF for phospho TDP-43 show differences? One might expect this to be the case given the biochemical findings in Fig 5.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>See comment 1.6 above. After a much more in-depth and rigorous assessment, we find little evidence for neurodegeneration. Given the transcriptome data showing that TDP-43 regulates a subset of synaptic genes, we suggest that synaptic deficits underlie the behavioral phenotype rather than neuronal loss.</p>
<p>Regarding phospho-TDP-43 pathology by immunofluorescence (IF) staining, after much effort, we have not been able to detect phospho-TDP-43 pathology by IF in TDP-43KQ/KQ mice. Currently available phospho-TDP-43 antibodies (including those acquired from collaborators) do not work well to detect endogenous mouse TDP-43 by histology or IF staining, and therefore we are somewhat limited technically. Nonetheless, given the increase in phospho-TDP-43 in the insoluble fractions by western blotting combined with the increase in cytoplasmic TDP-43 via biochemical fractionation, our data suggest that phospho-TDP-43 is the relevant species accumulating in the cytoplasm of TDP-43KQ/KQ mice.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>2.4 Fig 5: Probing the NC fractions for phospho TDP-43 would be an interesting addition to support the conclusion that increased cytoplasmic localization of the KQ mutant occurs prior to its phosphorylation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that this would be an excellent addition to our data. Unfortunately, after rigorous antibody validation experiments, we were not able to find a phospho-TDP-43 antibody that specifically detected phosphorylated TDP-43 and did not cross-react with unphosphorylated TDP-43 in the buffers used for N-C fractionations. We tested phospho-TDP antibodies in RIPA (soluble), Urea (detergent-insoluble), and the N-C fractionation buffers, using samples treated or untreated with lambda phosphatase (to de-phosphorylate TDP-43). Only one antibody reliably detected the phosphorylated TDP-43 and not the lambda phosphatase-treated TDP-43 samples, and only did so in the Urea buffer, which is shown by straight westerns in our manuscript. Because of these technical difficulties with the phospho-TDP-43 antibodies, this was a challenging point to address at the moment. As better phospho-TDP antibodies become available, we hope to be able to address this. We therefore cannot definitively conclude that cytoplasmic phospho-TDP-43 pathology is present in these mice, but nonetheless the total phospho-TDP-43 levels are significantly elevated in urea (insoluble) fractions.</p>

<p>2.5 Fig 1: What quantitative criteria were used to distinguish between puncta and foci, as highlighted in panel A? What is the biological significance of this distinction? From the images in panel A, it is difficult to see the TDP-43 foci in wt and K145R expressing cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Although the size of nuclear TDP-43 foci can be quite variable, and we are certainly interested in the biological significance of this parameter, we did not focus this study on size profiles of K145Q-induced foci, only their accelerated formation and abundance. Therefore, in the revised manuscript we chose not to explicitly state any differences in âfociâ vs. âpunctaâ and now refer to all nuclear TDP-43 structures as âfociâ (removed the word âpunctaâ throughout).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>2.6 Fig 3: In describing the results of context-dependent fear testing, it is more appropriate to state that significant deficits appeared at 18 months, deleting the word &quot;more&quot; on line 186.</p>

<p>We have deleted the work âmoreâ.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3</bold></p>
<p>3.1 Multiple figures (1b, 1c, 2b, 2c, 4b, 4d, 4f, 4g, 4i, 4j) include data with multiple measurements per field of view and multiple fields of view per condition. It appears that each measurement was considered an &quot;n&quot; for ANOVA or t-tests, but the data structure violates the requirement that data points are independent. More rigorous statistical methods such as mixed effect models should be considered (see DOI: 10.1016/j.neuron.2021.10.030) which in many cases provide more statistical power. Mixed effects models are the more appropriate statistical method for much of their data. Should the authors want to reanalyze their data with this method, they can reach out to me for an introduction to this statistical model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now re-evaluated the figures mentioned using linear mixed effects models, similar to what the reviewer has mentioned. The new statistical measurements have been incorporated into the revised Figures 1, 2, and 5 (formerly Figure 4). A description of the statistical methods used is now provided in the revised methods section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>3.2 In the introduction, the authors write &quot;we avoid both TDP-43 overexpression and disruption of autoregulatory genomic elements of the endogenous Tardbp transcript&quot; but they show that autoregulation is altered. So shouldn't the acetylation sites be considered a genomic element that regulates autoregulation?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree and have now stated that our knock-in approach avoids disrupting surrounding genomic elements (as could occur with transgenic or gene replacement strategies, for example) in order to retain the native Tardbp gene in its unaltered form.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>3.3 Suggest editing the language regarding potential neurodegeneration/neuron loss as the same results could be obtained with tissue volume and/or developmental effects independent of progressive neurodegeneration.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>See comments 1.6 and 2.3 above. The language has been edited to reflect no apparent neurodegeneration.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>3.4 Sequencing the top predicted off-target loci in CRISPR'd mice and iPSC cell lines would help show the absence of off-target mutations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We described in the methods how potential off-target effects were avoided. We assessed the likelihood of off-target mutations using prediction algorithms to ensure low likelihood. All of the predicted exonic off-target sites have 4 mismatches, making them extremely unlikely to be mutated.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>3.5 The authors describe a subtle shift in electrophoretic mobility of the SORT1 protein band in figure 7d/e, but it is unclear why the entire SORT1 band should be shifted up in mutant mice given that the RNA analysis suggests that WT species (not the cryptically spliced +ex17b) is still the major RNA that is expressed. In addition, others have shown that the WT versus +ex17b bands can be resolved (see DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1211577110). Perhaps knockout/knockdown cells can facilitate by providing a positive control for sizing/separation of Sort1 by immunoblotting.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please refer to our RNA-seq data shown in Figure 8A. In WT mice, nearly 80% of Sort1 transcripts lack exon17b, while this number drops to 23% in the TDP-43KQ/KQ mice. Therefore, the abnormally spliced +ex17b becomes the dominant transcript in TDP-43KQ/KQ mice. Given the prominent +ex17b inclusion that we are observing at the transcript level, it is not surprising that we mostly observe the up-shifted ex17b-containing Sort1 protein band. We have been unable to resolve two distinct bands by immunoblotting in mouse tissues using multiple Sort1 antibodies, including those used in Prudencio et al Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Dec 26;109(52):21510-5. Nonetheless, the up-shifted Sort1 protein is clearly the abnormal variant, as it becomes destabilized in our mice. Another possibility is that partial loss of TDP-43 function, as we suspect occurs in the TDP-43KQ/KQ mice, may magnify (or enhance) the effects on Sort1 such that the dominant Sort1 variant observed is the +ex17b containing variant. We suspect this to be true since this phenomenon was also observed in the Prudencio et al study (see Figures 1-2 in that study).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>3.6 The authors may try to corroborate their CFTR splicing results by examining fluorescence as it appears that the construct allows for analysis of splicing differences using GFP vs mCherry expression. This is a minor point as RNA-seq analysis demonstrates abundant splicing changes in acetylation-mimic expression models.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now removed the CFTR splicing data entirely and replaced it with more robust readouts of endogenous TDP-43 splicing targets both in vitro (Figure 2E, 3B-I) and in vivo (Figure 8B-C).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>3.7 Should the bars in figure 3d for 1 and 2 min be colored in grey/pink? It is unclear why they are clear and only outlined in color.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This point is clarified in the revised Figure 4D legend. In our cue-dependent conditioned fear testing, the filled bars beyond 2 min represents the presence of the auditory cue (tone) and the period of statistical analysis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>3.8 The statistical test used (Fisher's exact test?) for determining overlap between transcriptome datasets should be stated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We clarified our comment in the results section to reflect the use of over-enrichment analysis. In the methods section, it reads âPreviously published differentially expressed genes from Hasan et al95 and Polymenidou et al96 were retrieved from the respective publications; significant over-enrichments as well as human gene symbol mappings to mouse orthologs were performed using gprofiler2 (g:Orth).â</p>
