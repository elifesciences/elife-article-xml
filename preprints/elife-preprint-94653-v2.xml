<title>Abstract</title><p>PHOX2B is a transcription factor essential for the development of different classes of neurons in the central and peripheral nervous system. Heterozygous mutations in the PHOX2B coding region are responsible for the occurrence of Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS), a rare neurological disorder characterised by inadequate chemosensitivity and life-threatening sleep- related hypoventilation. Animal studies suggest that chemoreflex defects are caused in part by the improper development or function of PHOX2B expressing neurons in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN), a central hub for CO<sub>2</sub> chemosensitivity.</p>
<p>Although the function of PHOX2B in rodents during development is well established, its role in the adult respiratory network remains unknown. In this study, we investigated whether reduction in PHOX2B expression in chemosensitive neuromedin-B (NMB) expressing neurons in the RTN altered respiratory function. Four weeks following local RTN injection of a lentiviral vector expressing the short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting <italic>Phox2b</italic> mRNA, a reduction of PHOX2B expression was observed in <italic>Nmb</italic> neurons compared to both naïve rats and rats injected with the non-target shRNA. PHOX2B knockdown did not affect breathing in room air or under hypoxia, but ventilation was significantly impaired during hypercapnia. PHOX2B knockdown did not alter <italic>Nmb</italic> expression but it was associated with reduced the expression of both <italic>Task2</italic> and <italic>Gpr4</italic>, two CO<sub>2</sub> sensors in the RTN. We conclude that PHOX2B in the adult brain has an important role in CO<sub>2</sub> chemoreception and reduced PHOX2B expression in CCHS beyond the developmental period may contribute to the impaired central chemoreflex function.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Paired Like Homeobox 2B (PHOX2B) is a transcription factor essential for embryonic differentiation and for the maintenance of the neuronal phenotype of different classes of neurons in both the central and peripheral nervous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brunet &amp; Pattyn, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Pattyn et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Stanke et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Tiveron et al., 1996</xref>). In recent years, the PHOX2B gene has been extensively investigated, not only for its neurodevelopmental role, but also because its heterozygous mutation leads to Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS, OMIM 209880; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Amiel et al., 2003</xref>), Hirschsprung’s disease (HSCR; OMIM 142623; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Berry-Kravis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Trochet et al., 2005</xref>), and neuroblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bourdeaut et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Van Limpt et al., 2004</xref>). CCHS is a rare (1:200,000 births in France (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Trang et al., 2005</xref>) and 1:148,000 births in Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Shimokaze et al., 2015</xref>) disorder characterised by a failure to respond to both hypercapnia and hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Amiel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Di Lascio et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Weese-Mayer et al., 2017</xref>). The most frequent PHOX2B mutation is an expansion of a polyalanine repeat, ranging from +5 to +13 residues on the C-terminal of PHOX2B, an area that regulates DNA binding affinity and protein solubility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Amiel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Di Lascio et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Weese-Mayer et al., 2003</xref>). CCHS symptoms present with varying degrees of severity depending on the expansion of the mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Berry-Kravis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Di Lascio et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Matera, 2004</xref>). In most mild cases, patients display normal ventilation during wakefulness, hypoventilation during sleep leading to hypercarbia and hypoxemia, as well as a lack of sensitivity and discomfort to these challenges. In the most severe of cases, hypoventilation may also be present while awake.</p>
<p>Respiratory disturbances resulting from the PHOX2B mutations appear to stem from its widespread expression in respiratory-related neurons both during development and into adulthood. Although PHOX2B is absent in respiratory rhythmogenic neurons of the preBötzinger complex, it is highly expressed in adult neurons that are responsible for CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> chemoreflexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kang et al., 2007</xref>). Among those are the neurons of the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN), the locus coeruleus, the carotid bodies and the nucleus of the solitary tract that, together with the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve and the area postrema, make up to the dorsal vagal complex, a structure that provides the major integrative centre for the mammalian autonomic nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cutsforth-Gregory &amp; Benarroch, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Guyenet et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zoccal et al., 2014</xref>). Previous work by our group and others specifically investigated the role of PHOX2B- expressing RTN neurons by either selective lesions or inactivation of neuronal activity of these neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abbott et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Basting et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Marina et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Nattie &amp; Li, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Souza et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">2023</xref>; Janes et al., 2024) and showed that RTN neurons have a key role in central CO<sub>2</sub> chemoreception.</p>
<p>Defects observed in the CO<sub>2</sub>-chemoreflex of CCHS transgenic rodent models are primarily caused by the improper development or function of PHOX2B-expressing neurons in the RTN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dubreuil et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Ramanantsoa et al., 2011</xref>), although anatomo-pathological studies in CCHS patients suggest that the respiratory impairment may be caused by a more widespread brain dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Harper et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Nobuta et al., 2015</xref>). Transgenic mice born with PHOX2B knockout fail to develop the RTN, the locus coeruleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Pattyn et al., 1999</xref>) and catecholaminergic groups in A1, A2, A5 and A7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Pattyn et al., 2000</xref>), as well as neurons of the nucleus of the solitary tract and the carotid bodies. Mice harbouring heterozygous PHOX2B knockout develop apparently normal but have depressed responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dauger, 2003</xref>) and sleep disordered breathing in the perinatal period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Durand et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, the expression of the most common heterozygous PHOX2B mutation found in CCHS patients (PHOX2B +7Ala expansion) in mice results in a near complete loss of RTN neurons, impaired CO<sub>2</sub> response and consequent death in the newborn period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dubreuil et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Madani et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Ramanantsoa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Takakura et al., 2008</xref>). More selective expression of the mutant PHOX2B in the RTN neurons allowed for survival in the neonatal period and partial recovery of the CO<sub>2</sub> response in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Ramanantsoa et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Multiple potential cellular mechanisms have been implicated in the aetiology of CCHS, from loss of PHOX2B function in development due to heterozygous mutant PHOX2B expression, to gain of function of the mutated protein that may alter transcriptional activity in neurons, as well as aggregate formation and premature cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bachetti et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Di Lascio et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dubreuil et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Durand et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Goridis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Trochet et al., 2005</xref>). While its role during embryonic neurodevelopment is established, PHOX2B is still expressed in selected neuronal populations in the adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Stornetta et al., 2006</xref>) and its function, with the exception of the contribution to the maintenance of the noradrenergic phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fan et al., 2011</xref>), is not yet fully understood. Considering the fundamental role of PHOX2B in CCHS pathogenesis and its expression in key structures for CO<sub>2</sub> chemoreflex responses, it is essential to understand how both wild-type and mutant PHOX2B proteins impact CO<sub>2</sub> homeostasis and ventilation not only across development, but also in adulthood.</p>
<p>In order to have a better understanding of the role of PHOX2B in the CO<sub>2</sub> homeostatic processes we used a non-replicating lentivirus vector of two short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) clones targeting selectively <italic>Phox2b</italic> mRNA to knockdown the expression of PHOX2B in the RTN of adult rats and tested ventilation and chemoreflex responses. In parallel, we also determined whether knockdown of PHOX2B in adult <italic>Nmb</italic> neurons of the RTN negatively affected their cell survival. Finally, we sought to provide a mechanistic link between PHOX2B expression and the chemosensitive properties of <italic>Nmb</italic> neurons of the RTN, which have been attributed to two proton sensors, the proton-activated G protein-coupled receptor (GPR4) and the proton-modulated potassium channel (TASK-2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gestreau et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Guyenet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kumar et al., 2015</xref>). The expression of these sensors is partially overlapping in <italic>Nmb</italic> neurons of the RTN and the genetic deletion of either one impairs the central respiratory chemoreflex with maximal impairment when both sensors are eliminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gestreau et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Guyenet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kumar et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Our results indicate that progressive knockdown of PHOX2B in RTN causes a reduction in the chemoreflex response that was proportional to the decrease in the fraction of <italic>Nmb</italic>/PHOX2B expressing RTN neurons. This effect was associated with a reduction in the expression of <italic>Gpr4</italic> and <italic>Task2</italic> mRNA in <italic>Nmb</italic> expressing cells of the RTN in which PHOX2B was knocked down, suggesting a role for PHOX2B in the transcription of the proton sensors in RTN neurons.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2">
<title>Results</title>
<p>To directly investigate the role of PHOX2B in RTN neurons, we performed selective knockdown of this protein in adult rats through local injection of a non-replicating lentiviral vector of two short- hairpin RNA (shRNA) clones targeting two different sequences of the <italic>Phox2b</italic> mRNA (n=25) or non- target shRNA as control (NT-shRNA; n=23). Initial experiments utilized 200 nl/injection at each of 4 stereotaxic coordinates (1x10<sup>9</sup> VP/ml; n=14). Four weeks post injection, we assessed ventilatory parameters in room air, hypercapnia, and hypoxia. Interestingly, a small but significant impairment in the CO<sub>2</sub> chemoreflex was observed not only in PHOX2B-shRNA but also in NT-shRNA rats compared to pre-surgical baseline (allometric V<sub>E</sub> in 7% CO<sub>2</sub>: -21% and -24%, respectively; Supp. Fig. 1A). Because histological analysis also showed significant reduction of <italic>Nmb</italic><sup>+</sup>/PHOX2B<sup>+</sup> RTN cells in NT-shRNA and PHOX2B-shRNA rats (33% and 19% cells remaining, respectively; Suppl. Fig. 1), we concluded that the volume and titre of the shRNA viral constructs triggered off-target effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mcbride et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Van Gestel et al., 2014</xref>) that cause cell death in RTN neurons.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>PHOX2B expression is modestly reduced two weeks following infection without respiratory impairment</title>
<p>Due to the off-target effects obtained with large volume injections, we reduced injection volume of both PHOX2B shRNA (n=17) and NT-shRNA viruses (n=17) (4x100nl/injection; 1x10<sup>9</sup> VP/ml).</p>
<p>Two weeks post-surgery we assessed respiratory function during exposure to room air, hypercapnia and hypoxia. Overall, we observed little change in respiration at this time point. During room air, as well as in 5% and 7.2% CO<sub>2</sub>, frequency (ƒ<sub>R</sub>), was reduced in every experimental group (naïve, NT-shRNA, PHOX2B-shRNA) compared to baseline (Air: p=0.014; 5% CO<sub>2</sub>: p&lt; 0.001; 7.2% CO<sub>2</sub> p&lt; 0.001; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) but no effect on treatment was observed, suggesting that these changes were likely due to the increase in age and body weight during the long-term experiment (naïve: +32.2%; NT-shRNA: +27.8%; PHOX2B-shRNA: +28.6% change in body weight). Tidal volume was reduced in the PHOX2B-shRNA rats at 7.2% CO<sub>2</sub> compared to both naïve rats (naive: 9.6 ± 1.2 ml·kg<sup>-1</sup>; PHOX2B-shRNA: 8.5 ± 0.9 ml·kg<sup>-1</sup>; -11%; p= 0.022) and baseline pre-surgery conditions (baseline: 9.6 ± 1.3 ml·kg<sup>-1</sup>; -11%; p&lt; 0.001; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) but it was not different from NT-shRNA.</p>

<p>Despite similar changes in body weight across treatment groups, allometric ventilation (V<sub>E</sub> ALLO) was higher in naïve rats compared to the other treatment groups in room air (naïve: 38.4 ± 4.5 ml·min<sup>-1</sup>; NT-shRNA: 34.7 ± 2.8 ml·min<sup>-1</sup>; PHOX2B-shRNA: 34.0 ± 4.5 ml·min<sup>-1</sup>; p=0.005; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>), but no changes in V<sub>E</sub> ALLO were observed in hypercapnia (7.2% CO<sub>2</sub>) across treatments (naïve : 91.5 ± 13.2 ml·min<sup>-1</sup>; NT-shRNA: 84.4 ± 13.7 ml·min<sup>-1</sup>; PHOX2B-shRNA: 80.5 ± 17.2 ml·min<sup>-1</sup>). Oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub> ALLO) was not different between experimental conditions or treatment groups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), and V<sub>E</sub>/VO<sub>2</sub> ALLO indicated that ventilation was matched with metabolism for each treatment across all gas compositions (naïve: 7.7 ± 1.3; NT-shRNA: 7.2 ± 1.3; PHOX2B-shRNA: 6.9 ± 2.0; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). These results suggest that despite a reduction in hypercapnic V<sub>T</sub> in the PHOX2B- shRNA rats, overall ventilation was not impaired. Since we observed differences in room air V<sub>E</sub> ALLO between treatment groups, we normalized these data to show the hypercapnic ventilatory response (HCVR, i.e., absolute change in V<sub>E</sub> from room air; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). The HCVR was also not affected by the PHOX2B shRNA treatment two weeks post-injection (naïve: 53.1 ± 13.4 ml·min<sup>-1</sup>; NT-shRNA: 49.6 ± 13.2 ml·min<sup>-1</sup>; PHOX2B-shRNA: 46.5 ± 14.8 ml·min<sup>-1</sup>).</p>
<p>To determine the extent of PHOX2B knockdown in RTN neurons we combined RNAScope<sup>®</sup> and immunohistochemistry assays to quantify RTN neurons expressing <italic>Nmb</italic> and PHOX2B (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). We reasoned that by assessing the fraction of RTN neurons that express only <italic>Nmb</italic> (compared to <italic>Nmb</italic><sup>+</sup>/PHOX2B<sup>+</sup>), we would be able to determine the level of PHOX2B knockdown in our experiments. Two weeks post viral injection, we observed a small decrease (15.2%) in the total number of <italic>Nmb</italic> RTN neurons (i.e., <italic>Nmb</italic><sup>+</sup>/PHOX2B<sup>+</sup> plus <italic>Nmb</italic><sup>+</sup>/ PHOX2B<sup>-</sup>) in NT-shRNA rats compared to naïve rats (naïve; 337.6 ± 11.95; n=4; NT-shRNA: 286.0 ± 10.44; n=4; p&lt;0.001; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). The total number of <italic>Nmb</italic> cells of the RTN in PHOX2B-shRNA rats was further reduced compared to both naïve rats (PHOX2B-ShRNA 218.8 ± 7.8 n=4; -35.2%; p&lt;0.001) and to NT-shRNA (-23.5%; p&lt;0.001).</p>

<p>Given that previous studies have proposed a role for the RTN in the hypoxic chemoreflex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barna et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Basting et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gourine et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Wickström et al., 2004</xref>), and we observed impairment of the CO<sub>2</sub>-chemoreflex at 4 weeks post-infection, we investigated whether PHOX2B knockdown would also affect respiratory response to hypoxia (10% O<sub>2</sub>). The 4 week V<sub>E</sub> ALLO was increased relative to baseline values in naïve (baseline: 62.3 ± 5.2 ml·min<sup>-1</sup>; naïve: 71.0 ± 10.1 ml·min<sup>-1</sup>; +14%), NT-shRNA (baseline: 71.8 ± 11.1 ml·min<sup>-1</sup>; NT-shRNA: 75.8 ± 12.8 ml·min<sup>-1</sup>; +6%) and PHOX2B-shRNA rats (baseline: 65.9 ± 9.8 ml·min<sup>-1</sup>; PHOX2B-shRNA: 79.3 ± 6.4 ml·min<sup>-1</sup>; +29%; p&lt;0.001). However, analysis of the convective requirement ratio (V<sub>E</sub>/VO<sub>2</sub> ALLO) indicates that changes in hypoxic ventilation were due to metabolic adjustments that occurred in all treatment groups (VE/VO<sub>2</sub> ALLO naive: 6.5 ± 1.3; NT-shRNA: 6.7 ± 1.7; PHOX2B-shRNA: 6.6 ± 0.6), suggesting that the hypoxic ventilatory response was not affected by PHOX2B knockdown.</p>

<p>Neuromedin B is currently considered the most selective anatomical marker for chemosensitive RTN neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Shi et al., 2017</xref>) and was used in this study to identify RTN location, cell numbers and relative PHOX2B expression. Since changes in the level of the transcription factor PHOX2B could regulate the expression of its target genes, we investigated whether <italic>Nmb</italic> is a target gene of PHOX2B and it is affected by PHOX2B knockdown. We assessed <italic>Nmb</italic> expression in individual RTN cells of PHOX2B-shRNA rats and compared its cellular expression to both naïve and NT-shRNA rats (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). Neuromedin B mRNA expression was calculated as total fluorescence intensity (CTCF) ratio in single cells of the RTN relative to the single cell <italic>Nmb</italic> expression measured at the level of NTS <italic>Nmb</italic> cells, which served as an internal control (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). We observed no changes in relative fluorescence of <italic>Nmb</italic> in RTN neurons across the 3 groups (p=0.608), suggesting that <italic>Nmb</italic> levels in RTN neurons are not affected by PHOX2B knockdown.</p>
<p>To better analyse the effect of PHOX2B knockdown on the attenuation of the HCVR, we evaluated the correlation between the number of <italic>Nmb</italic><sup>+</sup>/PHOX2B<sup>+</sup> or Nmb<sup>+</sup>/PHOX2B<sup>-</sup> cells in the RTN and the resulting HCVR using linear regression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E,F</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The role of the transcription factor PHOX2B in the adult brain is still not fully understood. In this study we reduced the expression of PHOX2B in the key chemosensory structure of the RTN with a selective viral shRNA approach to test whether a knockdown of PHOX2B expression in these neurons negatively impacts ventilation. Two weeks after viral infection we observed a modest reduction of PHOX2B/<italic>Nmb</italic> expressing neurons in the RTN but no significant changes in basal V<sub>E</sub> or in the CO<sub>2</sub> chemoreflex. Four weeks after shRNA infection we observed a further reduction in the expression of PHOX2B in <italic>Nmb</italic> neurons and a significant reduction of the CO<sub>2</sub> chemoreflex, while ventilation in normoxia or hypoxia was unaffected. Furthermore, the level of expression of <italic>Gpr4</italic> and <italic>Task2</italic> mRNAs, the two proton sensors responsible for the RTN neurons chemosensory properties were significantly reduced in RTN neurons that lacked PHOX2B protein expression, whereas <italic>Nmb</italic> mRNA expression level was unaffected by PHOX2B knockdown. These results suggest that PHOX2B reduction affects the transcriptional activity of <italic>Nmb</italic> neurons in the RTN and decreases the CO<sub>2</sub> response, possibly by reducing the expression of key proton sensors in the RTN.</p>

<title>The role of PHOX2B in development and in the adult brain</title>
<p>PHOX2B is a transcription factor with an important role in the development and differentiation of neuronal structures in both the central and peripheral nervous system. Genetic loss of <italic>Phox2b</italic> expression in mice shows that PHOX2B is essential for the correct development of all autonomic ganglia in sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric nervous system and the distal ganglia of the facial (VII), glossopharyngeal (IX), and vagus (X) cranial nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Pattyn et al., 1999</xref>), in addition to carotid bodies and the solitary tract nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dauger, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, PHOX2B is involved in the formation of all branchial and visceral hindbrain motor neurons and its absence during the embryonic period impairs the development of motoneurons of the facial, trigeminal, ambiguus and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagal nerve. PHOX2B is also necessary for the specification and differentiation of the noradrenergic phenotype in multiple centres in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brunet &amp; Pattyn, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Pattyn et al., 1999</xref>, 2000a).</p>
<p>Interestingly, the expression of PHOX2B persists into adulthood in selected neuronal populations, such as the ones involved in peripheral and central chemoreception, i.e., the carotid bodies, the solitary tract nucleus and the RTN, in addition to neurons in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, the area postrema, the nucleus ambiguus, C1 catecholaminergic neurons and other scattered neurons throughout the brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Stornetta et al., 2006</xref>). Such widespread expression within the adult brain suggests an important transcriptional role in neuronal survival and/or function. With the exception of its role in maintaining the noradrenergic phenotype, its function in the postnatal brain is unknown, in part because a full investigation of its transcriptional activity in neurons has not yet been performed.</p>
<p>Heterozygote polyalanine expansion mutations in the exon 3 of <italic>PHOX2B</italic> are responsible for the majority of cases of CCHS, a rare genetic disease that affect the autonomic nervous system and central CO<sub>2</sub> chemoreflexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Amiel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Di Lascio et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Weese-Mayer et al., 2017</xref>). While studies in transgenic mice expressing the mutated PHOX2B protein suggest that the RTN may not form or be severely impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dubreuil et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Ramanantsoa et al., 2011</xref>), the function of the wild-type protein in these neurons has never been tested beyond the post-natal period. Thus, in order to determine whether PHOX2B is necessary for the survival and/or chemosensory function of adult PHOX2B<sup>+</sup>/<italic>Nmb</italic><sup>+</sup> RTN neurons <italic>in vivo</italic>, we used a shRNA viral approach to progressively knockdown the PHOX2B protein in these neurons.</p>

<title>Modest reduction of PHOX2B in RTN does not impair ventilation</title>
<p>Although the PHOX2B shRNA approach was not selective for <italic>Nmb</italic> neurons, we used small volumes and localized injections to target the RTN. We identified RTN neurons by the mRNA expression of the neuropeptide NMB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Shi et al., 2017</xref>) and observed a reduced number in both total <italic>Nmb</italic> and <italic>Nmb</italic><sup>+</sup>/PHOX2B<sup>+</sup> neurons in PHOX2B shRNA treated rats compared to naïve and NT-shRNA rats two weeks after viral infection. Interestingly, despite the small reduction in total <italic>Nmb</italic> cells of the RTN in both NT-shRNA and PHOX2B-shRNA injected rats, possibly due to some off-target effects due to activation of innate immunity or saturation of the microRNA pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mcbride et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Van Gestel et al., 2014</xref>), no significant impairment in ventilation was observed. Even though PHOX2B may be critical for chemosensory function in RTN neurons, the lack of significant ventilatory impairment with a modest reduction of PHOX2B expressing neurons is not surprising. In our previous study (and the ones of others), in which RTN chemosensory neurons were lesioned with Substance P saporin toxin, CO<sub>2</sub>-chemoreflex impairment became significant (∼30% V<sub>E</sub> Allo reduction vs. pre-surgical baseline) only when <italic>Nmb</italic> neurons of the RTN (<italic>Nmb</italic><sup>+</sup>/PHOX2B<sup>+</sup> and <italic>Nmb</italic><sup>+</sup>/PHOX2B<sup>-</sup> neurons) were reduced by ∼63% compared to naïve controls (medium lesion range: 50%-81% loss of <italic>Nmb</italic> neurons; Janes et al., 2024; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Souza et al., 2023</xref>), therefore, even though loss of PHOX2B severely altered the chemosensitive function in a fraction of <italic>Nmb</italic> cells, we would not expect significant changes in ventilation only with a &lt;50% RTN cell impairment or loss.</p>

<title>Four weeks of PHOX2B knockdown impairs central CO<sub>2</sub> chemoreception</title>
<p>Four weeks post- shRNA viral injection, the fraction of <italic>Nmb</italic><sup>+</sup> cells expressing PHOX2B was further reduced by 67% compared to naïve and by 61% compared to NT-shRNA rats. PHOX2B knockdown was also restricted to RTN neurons, as adjacent C1 TH<sup>+</sup> neurons did not show any change in number of TH<sup>+</sup>/PHOX2B<sup>+</sup> expressing cells, although we can’t exclude that some C1 cells may have been infected, and their relative PHOX2B expression levels were slightly reduced. To support the lack of significant alterations associated with the possible loss of C1 function was the lack of significant changes in the hypoxic response that has been shown to be dependent on C1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Malheiros-Lima et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Although we did not specifically quantify the relative mRNA expression change in intracellular <italic>Phox2b</italic> levels within infected neurons, we measured the success of PHOX2B knockdown by assessing the overall change in the number of <italic>Nmb</italic> cells that had no detectable levels of PHOX2B protein in the nuclei. Thus, it is possible that this method led us to underestimate the success of the overall PHOX2B shRNA knockdown in the RTN, as some RTN neurons may still have detectable levels of PHOX2B, albeit decreased.</p>
<p>In PHOX2B-shRNA rats we did not observe any respiratory function changes in room air or in hypoxia, similar to RTN lesioning studies (Janes et al., 2024; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Souza et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Guyenet et al., 2019</xref>). When tested in hypercapnia though, PHOX2B-shRNA rats displayed a reduced HCVR compared to both baseline (i.e., pre-surgery), naïve and NT-shRNA rats. The impairment of V<sub>E</sub> Allo was primarily a result of blunted V<sub>T</sub>, and analysis of the convective exchange ratio (i.e. V<sub>E</sub>/VO<sub>2</sub> ALLO) confirmed hypoventilation in 5% and 7.2% CO<sub>2</sub> only for PHOX2B-shRNA rats, suggesting a specific impairment of chemosensitive properties in RTN neurons with PHOX2B knockdown. These results are in line with previous studies in which medium RTN lesions (i.e. loss of &gt;60 % <italic>Nmb</italic><sup>+</sup> cells) elicited by saporin toxin injection resulted in a significant CO<sub>2</sub>-chemoreflex impairment (Janes et al., 2024; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Souza et al.,2018</xref>). Hence, killing RTN neurons or knocking down PHOX2B in <italic>Nmb</italic> cells of the RTN gave comparable results.</p>
<p>Changes in the CO<sub>2</sub> response following 4 weeks of PHOX2B-shRNA treatment could occur because the reduced expression of the transcription factor PHOX2B causes changes in the transcriptional machinery of RTN neurons and alters transcription of CO<sub>2</sub>/pH sensing proteins or other key elements for their chemosensitive function. These transcriptional changes could also affect neuronal survival. In fact, a small but significant loss of NMB expressing RTN neurons may contribute to the reduction in the CO<sub>2</sub> response, although multiple studies have demonstrated that significant cell loss must occur in the RTN in order to show a respiratory function impairment (Janes et al., 2024; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Souza et al.,2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Nattie &amp; Li, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Takakura et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">2014</xref>).</p>
<p>In our experiments, we observed a 35% reduction in total <italic>Nmb</italic><sup>+</sup> cells compared to naïve rats and 23% compared to NT-shRNA, possibly due to cell death within the first 14 days post-infection. Interestingly the loss of <italic>Nmb</italic> cells did not increase with time (although the fraction of Nmb<sup>+</sup>/PHOX2B<sup>+</sup> neurons decreased) and the central chemoreflex at 2 weeks post-surgery was not impaired, suggesting that: i) the observed reduction in overall <italic>Nmb</italic> cell number in RTN occurring in the first 2 weeks is not responsible for the CO<sub>2</sub> chemoreflex impairment that emerges 4 weeks post-infection; ii) PHOX2B expression is most likely not necessary for neuronal survival of adult <italic>Nmb</italic> neurons of the RTN; iii) a large reduction in <italic>Nmb</italic> neurons expressing PHOX2B<sup>+</sup> is necessary to impair the HCVR (as we observed at 4 weeks). The interpretation that PHOX2B expression contributes positively to the chemoreflex is further supported by our linear regression analysis showing that <italic>Nmb</italic><sup>+</sup>/PHOX2B<sup>+</sup> cell number was the best predictor of the HCVR (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.739). The initial cell loss, which we observed also in NT-shRNA, and more prominently with larger injection volume of virus, may be attributed to some inherent cell death associated with the surgical procedure (although not observed in similar studies performed by the same investigators, Janes et al., 2024) or, more likely, with the potential off-target toxic effects associated with shRNA procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mcbride et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Van Gestel et al., 2014</xref>).</p>

<title>PHOX2B knockdown reduces mRNA expression of proton sensors in the Nmb cells of the RTN</title>
<p>Current theories on central respiratory chemosensitivity postulate that changes in CO<sub>2</sub>/pH in the RTN are detected through two pH sensors, the proton-activated receptor GPR4 and the pH- sensitive K<sup>+</sup> channel TASK2 that are expressed in partially overlapping populations of NMB expressing RTN neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kumar et al., 2015</xref>). Because it is not known whether PHOX2B has any influence on the expression of TASK2, GPR4 or even the expression of the neuropeptide NMB used to anatomically identify RTN neurons, we quantified their mRNA at cellular levels (calculated as CFTC) and observed no changes in relative fluorescence of <italic>Nmb</italic> mRNA in the RTN relative to <italic>Nmb</italic> levels in unrelated cells in the NTS, suggesting that <italic>Nmb</italic> expression is not affected by PHOX2B shRNA knockdown and that <italic>Nmb</italic> is most likely not a target gene of PHOX2B in adult RTN neurons. Furthermore, we determined the mRNA expression levels of <italic>Task2</italic> and <italic>Gpr4</italic> in both <italic>Nmb</italic><sup>+</sup>/PHOX2B<sup>+</sup> and Nmb<sup>+</sup>/PHOX2B<sup>-</sup> neurons in shRNA rats. Our results indicate that although the fraction of <italic>Nmb</italic> cells of the RTN expressing <italic>Gpr4</italic> and <italic>Task2</italic> did not change across treatment, the levels of <italic>Gpr4</italic> and <italic>Task2</italic> in <italic>Nmb</italic> neurons of PHOX2B-shRNA rats was reduced compared to the naïve and NT-shRNA groups. Furthermore, there was a significant reduction of both <italic>Gpr4</italic> and <italic>Task2</italic> levels within <italic>Nmb</italic><sup>+</sup>/PHOX2B<sup>-</sup> cells compared to <italic>Nmb</italic><sup>+</sup>/PHOX2B<sup>+</sup> cells. Because no good antibodies are currently available to detect protein levels of either NMB, GPR4 or TASK2, our results are only based on changes in mRNA levels, thus we can only speculate that a reduction in <italic>Gpr4</italic> and <italic>Task2</italic> mRNA would translate in a reduction in the protein levels and consequent reduction of RTN neurons chemosensitive properties. Direct electrophysiological recordings in RTN neurons will be able to address the changes in CO<sub>2</sub>/pH sensitivity of RTN neurons at cellular level.</p>

<title>PHOX2B knockdown may impair CO<sub>2</sub>-sensing through additional transcriptional targets</title>
<p>Since loss of PHOX2B reduces expression of TH and dopamine beta hydroxylase enzymes in catecholaminergic neurons <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fan et al., 2011</xref>), it is possible that in NMB cells of the RTN, reduction of PHOX2B alters the transcriptional machinery of other proteins (in addition to GPR4 and TASK2) and impairs their function in central chemoreception. For example, a change in the expression of enzymes, neurotransmitters, receptors, and ion channels in RTN neurons could affect the excitatory signal transmission to preBötzinger Complex and the respiratory network specifically during CO<sub>2</sub> challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Guyenet et al., 2016</xref>). Further studies will be needed to address and identify additional transcriptional changes induced by PHOX2B knockdown <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>An interesting observation from our histological data was the reduction in the overall number of <italic>Nmb</italic> cells at two- and four-weeks following PHOX2B shRNA viral injections. Although some cell death may be associated with either surgical procedures or off-target effects associated with the shRNA approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mcbride et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Van Gestel et al., 2014</xref>), it is intriguing to speculate that loss of PHOX2B expression may have some effects on viability of RTN neurons <italic>in vivo</italic>. Even though this is a possibility, especially with an even more severe knockdown, we did observe a large proportion of <italic>Nmb</italic> cells devoid of PHOX2B protein expression, suggesting that absence of PHOX2B is compatible with neuronal survival, at least in our experimental time frame.</p>

<title>Relevance to CCHS and its pathogenic mechanisms</title>
<p>Our results contribute to further our understanding on potential pathogenic mechanisms in CCHS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Di Lascio et al., 2018</xref>). Homozygous knockout mice for PHOX2B die during gestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Pattyn et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">2000</xref>) demonstrating a key role of this transcription factor in cellular proliferation, migration and differentiation during embryonic development, whereas heterozygotes for PHOX2B survive birth and live into adulthood, but display apneas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Durand et al., 2005</xref>) and impairment of the hypoxic and hypercapnic ventilatory responses in the neonatal period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dauger, 2003</xref>). Here we show that, independent of the PHOX2B role during development, PHOX2B is still required to maintain proper CO<sub>2</sub> chemoreflex responses in the adult brain.</p>
<p>Heterologous expression of the mutant PHOX2B alters development of RTN in mice and impairs their chemoreflex response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dubreuil et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">2009</xref>). The effects of the expression of the mutant PHOX2B on wild-type PHOX2B protein and its transcriptional activity is not known <italic>in vivo</italic> yet, although <italic>in vitro</italic> data indicates that the mutated PHOX2B protein alters wild-type PHOX2B conformation and its ability to form homo- and hetero-dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Di Lascio et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Trochet et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">2008</xref>), its affinity for DNA and coactivators, as well as its degradation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Nagashimada et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wu et al., 2009</xref>). It has also been shown that mutant PHOX2B causes the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bachetti et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Trochet et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">2008</xref>) and fibrils <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Pirone et al., 2019</xref>), and dysregulates the transcriptional function of wild-type PHOX2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Di Lascio et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Parodi et al., 2012</xref>), thus changing expression of important target genes such as DBH, PHOX2A and TLX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bachetti et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Di Lascio et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Trochet et al., 2005</xref>). Based on this evidence, different CCHS pathogenic mechanisms have been proposed (e.g., PHOX2B loss-of- function, dominant-negative or toxic function of the mutant protein) including gene and cell specific transcriptional dysregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Di Lascio et al., 2018</xref>, 2021). Interestingly, only a handful of PHOX2B target genes have been identified and the function of PHOX2B and its mutated forms in respiratory control and CCHS pathogenesis is still under investigation.</p>
<p>Our data suggest that, in addition to potential effect of mutated PHOX2B on development and cellular function in CCHS pathogenesis, the expression of wild type PHOX2B has an important role in respiratory control that extends the developmental period and its reduction in CCHS may contribute to the respiratory impairment in this disorder.</p>

<title>ShRNA viral injection in the retrotrapezoid nucleus</title>
<p>In order to knockdown Phox2b expression at the level of RTN neurons, we used a mix of two shRNA clones targeting two different sequences of the Phox2b mRNA carried by a non-replicating lentivirus vector (1x10<sup>9</sup> VP/ml; TRCN000041283: GCCTTAGTGAAGAGCAGTATG and TRCN0000096437: CCTCTGCCTACGAGTCCTGTA; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MA, USA).

<p>Metacam analgesic was administered 1 hour prior to surgery (2mg/kg) to reduce post-surgical pain. Rats were anesthetized with a ketamine/xylazine mixture (100mg/kg + 10mg/kg, respectively; i.p.); the anaesthetic level was assessed by lack of paw pinch reflex and maintenance of a regular breathing rate. Additional anaesthesia was administered as needed. The rat was positioned on a stereotactic apparatus (Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA, USA) and a total of four microinjections (200 or 100 nL per injection; two rostro-caudally aligned injections per side) were made lateral to the midline and ventral to the facial motor nucleus under aseptic conditions. Coordinates were as follows in mm from obex (medio-lateral/rostro-caudal/dorso-ventral): ±1.8, +2.0,-3.5; ±1.8,+2.4,-3.6. Injections were made using a glass microelectrode (30 μm diameter tip, Drummond Scientific, PA, USA). Twenty-five rats (8 rats 200nl/injection; 17 rats 100nl/injection) underwent shRNA viral injection (PHOX2B-shRNA) and 23 rats (6 rats 200nl/injection; 17 rats 100nl/injection) received a non-target shRNA viral injection (NT-shRNA; SHC016: MISSION<sup>®</sup> pLKO.1-puro non-Target shRNA Control Plasmid DNA; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MA, USA) to determine any effects of surgery and viral constructs on respiratory behaviour. Eight naïve rats, receiving no surgery and maintained in the same housing conditions, were used as additional controls for both respiratory function and anatomical experiments. Following each injection, the glass electrodes were left in place for 3-5 minutes to minimize backflow of virus up the electrode track. At the end of the surgery, the incision was sutured, and rats received local anaesthetic bupivacaine (0.1 mL, s.c.) and were treated with metacam analgesic for 72 hours.

<p>As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cardani et al., 2022</xref>; Janes et al., 2024) respiratory data were analysed from rats during quiet wakefulness in the last 5 min period of each gas composition using the barometric method (open-flow system; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cardani et al., 2022</xref>; Janes et al., 2024; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Mortola &amp; Frappell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Seifert et al., 2000</xref>). Raw pressure signals were acquired with a Validyne differential pressure transducer connected to a CD15 carrier demodulator (Validyne Engineering, Northridge, CA, USA) and digitized using a Powerlab 8/35 (AD Instruments, Sydney, Australia). Analysis was done using Labchart 8 (v8.1.19, AD Instruments, Colorado Springs, CO, USA) to determine tidal volume (V<sub>T</sub>) and breathing frequency (ƒ<sub>R</sub>). The amplitude of the pressure signal was converted to V<sub>T</sub> (ml·kg<sup>-1</sup>) using the equations of Drorbaug and Fenn 1955 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Drorbaugh &amp; Fenn, 1955</xref>) and calibrated against 1 mL of dry air injected into the empty chamber using a rodent ventilator (Harvard Rodent Ventilator Model 683, Holliston, MA, USA ƒ = 50, 75, 100, 150 beats·min<sup>-1</sup>). Humidity and chamber temperature were monitored using a RH-300 water vapour analyzer (Sable Systems, Las Vegas, NV, USA) and a HPR Plus Handheld PIT Tag reader (Biomark, Boise, ID, USA) respectively, depending on the setup. Rectal temperature was read through the temperature probes of a Homeothermic Monitor (507222F, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA). Minute ventilation (<sup>V̇</sup><sub>E</sub>) was calculated as ƒ<sub>R</sub> x V<sub>T</sub> and expressed as ml·min<sup>-1</sup>·kg<sup>-1</sup>. Rats gained, on average, 160 ± 4g over the experimental paradigm (naive: 158 ± 19g; NT-shRNA: 202 ± 25g; PHOX2B-shRNA: 133 ± 7g); we therefore applied an allometric correction to <sup>V̇</sup><sub>E</sub> to account for non-linear effects of weight gain (V<sub>E</sub> ALLO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Mortola et al., 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Metabolic parameters VO<sub>2</sub> and V<sub>E</sub>/VO<sub>2</sub> were calculated by pull-mode indirect calorimetry and allometrically scaled to be consistent with ventilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Mortola et al., 1994</xref>). The % composition of dry gas flowing into, and out of the recording chamber was measured by using an AD Instruments Gas Analyzer (Colorado Springs, CO) and applying the equations of Depocas and Hart (Depocas F, Hart JS, 1957) and Lighton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lighton, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Weight measurements were taken prior to every recording session. Rats breathing function was measured the week prior to surgery (baseline recording) and weekly following shRNA injections to determine the time course of ventilatory impairment.</p>
<p>Respiratory data were compared for naive, NT-shRNA and PHOX2B-shRNA pre- and post-injection using a mixed factor ANOVA (independent factor = treatment, repeated measures factor = pre- and post-lesion; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1</xref>,4). Post-hoc analysis used the Bonferroni correction factor, with p&lt;0.05 considered to be significant. Ventilatory data are reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD).</p>

<title>In Situ hybridization (RNAScope) and immunofluorescence</title>
<p>Either 2 or 4-weeks after viral injection, rats were transcardially perfused with saline 0.9% NaCl followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and the brains were post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in 1X Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS). Brains were then frozen in O.C.T compound (Fisher Scientific) and sectioned on a cryostat (MODEL CM1950, Leica Biosystems, Buffalo grove, IL, USA) at 30 µm and stored in cryoprotectant buffer at -20°C until processing. Sections were mounted on slides for combined RNAScope® in situ hybridization (Advanced Cell Diagnostics-ACD Bio, Newark CA, USA) and immunofluorescence assay and processed as previously detailed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Biancardi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cardani et al., 2022</xref>). The mRNA expression for <italic>Neuromedin B</italic> (<italic>Nmb)</italic> was used as marker of RTN CO<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Shi et al., 2017</xref>). Slides were incubated with probes for <italic>Nmb</italic> (Rn-NMB-C2 #494791-C2, ACDBio, Newark, CA, USA), <italic>Phox2b</italic> (Rn-Phox2b-O1-C1 #1064121-C1, ACDBio), G-protein-coupled receptor 4 (<italic>Gpr4</italic>) (Mm-Gpr4-C1, #427941, ACDBio), and potassium channel, subfamily K, member 5 (<italic>Kcnk5</italic> or <italic>Task- 2</italic>) (Mm-Kcnk5-C3, #427951-C3, ACDBio) for 2 hr at 40°C. Gpr4 and Kcnk5 probes are design against the mouse mRNA sequence (Ref Seq NM_175668.4 and NM_021542.4, respectively). However, the alignment of the mouse mRNA sequences with those of rat (GPR4: Ref Seq NM_001025680.1; TASK2: Ref Seq NM_1039516.2) showed an identity of 94% and 96%, respectively, at the level of the target region (Base Pairs 1030-150) (BLAST <sup>®</sup> program, National Library of Medicine, National Center for Biotechnology Information, NIH). In parallel, two sections/rat were treated with positive (low copy housekeeping gene), and negative (non-specific bacterial gene) control probes provided by ACDBio. Finally, slides were processed using the RNAScope Multiplex Fluorescent Assay kit V2 (ACDBio) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The probes were visualized using Opal 520 and Opal 570 reagent (1:500 and 1:1000, respectively; PerkinElmer, Woodbridge, ON, CA). PHOX2B immunoreactivity was detected using mouse monoclonal PHOX2B antibody (B-11: sc-376997, 1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) incubated overnight in 0.3% TritonX-100, 1%NDS in PBS followed by donkey CY5-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:200; Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories Inc) in PBS + 1% NDS for 2 hours. Slides were then washed in PBS and cover-slipped with Fluorosave mounting media (EMD Millipore).</p>
<p>We also performed staining for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) to identify and quantify C1 cells (TH<sup>+</sup>/PHOX2B<sup>+</sup>) following shRNA injection. Briefly, perfusion and tissue fixation/freezing were done as described above. Floating sections were stained with rabbit anti TH antibody (AB152,1:1000, Millipore SIGMA, USA), and mouse anti PHOX2B (B-11: sc-376997, 1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Antibodies were visualized using donkey CY3 (TH) and CY5 (PHOX2B) conjugated IgG (1:200; Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories Inc). The sections were washed in PBS and mounted on slides and cover-slipped with Fluorosave mounting media.</p>

<title>Cell counting, imaging and data analysis</title>
<p>To quantify <italic>Nmb</italic>+/PHOX2B- and <italic>Nmb</italic>+/PHOX2B+ neurons within the RTN region, we analysed one every seven sections (210 µm interval; 8 sections/rat in total) along the rostrocaudal distribution of the RTN on the ventral surface of the brainstem and compared total bilateral cell counts of PHOX2B-shRNA rats with non-target control (NT-shRNA) and naïve rats. Cells that expressed <italic>Nmb</italic> and <italic>Phox2b</italic> mRNAs but did not show co-localization with PHOX2B protein were considered <italic>Nmb</italic>+/PHOX2B-.</p>
<p>The Corrected Total Cell Fluorescence (CTCF) signal for <italic>Nmb, Gpr4</italic> and <italic>Task2</italic> mRNAs was quantified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cardani et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">McCloy et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, a Leica TCS SP5 (B-120G) Laser Scanning Confocal microscope was used to acquire images of the tissue. Exposure time and acquisition parameters were set for the naïve group and kept unchanged for the entire dataset acquisition. The collected images were then analysed by selecting a single cell at a time and measuring the area, integrated density and mean grey value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">McCloy et al., 2014</xref>). For each image, three background areas were used to normalize against autofluorescence. We used 4 sections/rat (210 µm interval) to count <italic>Nmb</italic>, <italic>Gpr4</italic> and <italic>Task2</italic> mRNA CTCF in the core of the RTN area where several <italic>Nmb</italic> cells could be identified. For each section, two images were acquired with a 20<italic>×</italic> objective, so that at least fifty cells per tissue sample were obtained for the mRNA quantification analysis. To evaluate changes in <italic>Nmb</italic> mRNA expression levels following PHOX2B knockdown at the level of the RTN, we compared, the fluorescence intensity of each RTN <italic>Nmb</italic> cell (223.2 ± 37.1 cells/animal) with the average fluorescent signal of <italic>Nmb</italic> cells located dorsally in the NTS (4.3 ± 1.2 cells/animal) (<italic>Nmb</italic> CTCF ratio RTN/NTS) as we reasoned that the latter would not be affected by the shRNA infection and knockdown.</p>
<p>To quantify <italic>Gpr4</italic> and <italic>Task2</italic> mRNA expression in <italic>Nmb</italic> cells of the RTN, we first quantified single cell CTCF for either <italic>Gpr4</italic> (200.7 ± 13.2 cells/rat) or <italic>Task2</italic> (169.6 ± 10.3 cells/rat) mRNA in <italic>Nmb</italic> cells of the RTN in the 3 experimental groups (naïve, NT shRNA and PHOX2B shRNA) independent of their PHOX2B expression. We then compared CTCF values of <italic>Gpr4</italic> and <italic>Task2</italic> mRNA between <italic>Nmb</italic><sup>+</sup>/PHOX2B<sup>+</sup> and <italic>Nmb</italic><sup>+</sup>/PHOX2B<sup>-</sup> RTN neurons in PHOX2B-shRNA rats to address changes in their mRNA expression induced by PHOX2B knockdown.</p>
<p>To assess whether shRNA knockdown affected either the number or the expression of PHOX2B in TH expressing C1 neurons, we counted the number of TH<sup>+</sup>/PHOX2B<sup>+</sup> and TH<sup>+</sup>/PHOX2B<sup>-</sup> cells along the ventrolateral medulla (8 sections/rat; 240 µm interval) using an EVOS fluorescent microscope (ThermoFisher Scientific).</p>
<p>Digital colour photomicrographs were acquired using a Leica TCS SP5 (B-120G) Laser Scanning Confocal microscope. Image J (version 1.54f; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) and Excel (Microsoft Office 365 for Windows) were used for cell counting and the measurements of fluorescence intensity. Statistical analysis of cell counts, and fluorescent signals was made using one- way ANOVA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>, S1B) and repeated-measures ANOVA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>, D and 6) with GraphPad Prism 8 Software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Linear regressions to determine the effect of cell counts (<italic>Nmb</italic><sup>+</sup>/PHOX2B<sup>+</sup>, <italic>Nmb</italic><sup>+</sup>/PHOX2B<sup>-</sup>, total cells) on chemoreflex magnitude were run using a combined dataset for naive, NT-shRNA and PHOX2B-shRNA rats (SPSS version 13.0; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5E</xref>-F). <italic>p</italic> values of &lt; 0.05 were considered significant and data are reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This important study investigated the role of the PHOX2B transcription factor in neurons in the key brainstem chemosensory structure, the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN), for maintaining proper CO2 chemoreflex responses of breathing in the adult rat in vivo. PHOX2B has an important transcriptional role in neuronal survival and/or function, and mutations of PHOX2B severely impair the development and function of the autonomic nervous system and RTN, resulting in the developmental genetic disease congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) in neonates, where the RTN may not form and is functionally impaired. The function of the wild-type PHOX2B protein in adult RTN neurons that continue to express PHOX2B is unknown. By utilizing a viral PHOX2B-shRNA approach for the knockdown of PHOX2B specifically in RTN neurons, the authors' solid results show impaired ventilatory responses to elevated inspired CO2, measured by whole-body plethysmography in freely behaving adult rats, that develop progressively over a four-week period in vivo, indicating effects on RTN neuron transcriptional activity and associated blunting of the CO2 ventilatory response. The RTN neuronal mRNA expression data presented suggests the impaired hypercapnic ventilatory response is possibly due to the decreased expression of key proton sensors in the RTN. This study will be of interest to neuroscientists studying respiratory neurobiology as well as the neurodevelopmental control of motor behavior.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The authors used a shRNA viral approach to progressively knock down the PHOX2B protein, specifically in RTN neurons, to determine whether PHOX2B is necessary for the survival and/or chemosensory function of adult RTN neurons in vivo.</p>
<p>(2) To determine the extent of PHOX2B knockdown in RTN neurons, the authors combined RNAScope® and immunohistochemistry assays to quantify the subpopulation of RTN neurons expressing PHOX2B and Neuromedin B (Nmb), which has been proposed to be key chemosensory neurons in the RTN.</p>
<p>(3) The authors demonstrate that knockdown efficiency is time-dependent, with a progressive decrease in the number of Nmb-expressing RTN neurons that co-express PHOX2B over a four-week period.</p>
<p>(4) Their results convincingly show hypoventilation, particularly in 7.2% CO2 only, for PHOX2B-shRNA RTN-injected rats after four weeks compared to naïve and non-PHOX2B-shRNA targeted (NT-shRNA) RTN-injected rats, suggesting a specific impairment of chemosensitive properties in RTN neurons with PHOX2B knockdown.</p>
<p>(5) Analysis of the association between PHOX2B knockdown in RTN neurons and the</p>
<p>
attenuation of the hypercapnic ventilatory response (HCVR), by evaluating the correlation between the number of Nmb+/PHOX2B+ or Nmb+/PHOX2B- cells in the RTN and the resulting HCVR, showed a significant correlation between HCVR and number of Nmb+/PHOX2B+ and Nmb+/PHOX2B- cells, suggesting that the number of PHOX2B-expressing cells in the RTN is a predictor of the chemoreflex response and the reduction of PHOX2B protein impairs the CO2-chemoreflex.</p>
<p>(6) The data presented indicate that PHOX2B knockdown reduces the HCVR and the expression of Gpr4 and Task2 mRNAs. This suggests that PHOX2B knockdown affects RTN neurons' transcriptional activity and decreases the CO2 response, possibly by reducing the expression of key proton sensors in the RTN.</p>
<p>(7) This study's results show that independent of its role during development, PHOX2B is still required to maintain proper CO2 chemoreflex responses in the adult brain, and its reduction in CCHS may contribute to the respiratory impairment in this disorder.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors found a significant decrease in the total number of Nmb+ RTN neurons (i.e., Nmb+/PHOX2B+ plus Nmb+/ PHOX2B-) in NT-shRNA rats at two weeks post viral injection, and also at the four-week period where the impairment of the chemosensory function of the RTN became significant, suggesting some inherent cell death possibly due to off-target toxic effects associated with shRNA procedures.</p>
<p>(2) The tissue sampling procedures for quantifying numbers of cells expressing proteins/mRNAs throughout the extended RTN region bilaterally have not been completely validated to accurately represent the full expression patterns in the RTN under the experimental conditions.</p>
<p>(3) The inferences about RTN neuronal expression of NMB, GPR4, or TASK2 are based on changes in mRNA levels, so it remains speculation that the observed reduction in Gpr4 and Task2 mRNA translates to a reduction in the protein levels and associated reduction of RTN neuronal chemosensitive properties.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This significant research explored how the PHOX2B transcription factor functions within neurons located in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN), a crucial brainstem chemosensory area, to sustain appropriate CO2 chemoreflex reactions related to breathing in adult rats when observed in a living state. By applying a viral shRNA technique to selectively suppress PHOX2B in RTN neurons, the authors present compelling evidence of deteriorating ventilatory reactions to increased CO2 levels. This impairment progresses over a four-week period in vivo, hinting at disruptions in RTN neuron transcriptional processes and a consequent dulling of CO2-induced breathing responses. The data on RTN neuronal mRNA expression indicates that the weakened hypercapnic ventilatory response may stem from reduced levels of crucial proton sensors within the RTN. This research holds relevance for neuroscientists focused on the neurobiology of respiration and the neurodevelopmental regulation of motor functions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors employed a shRNA viral strategy to systematically reduce PHOX2B protein levels, targeting RTN neurons specifically, to assess the importance of PHOX2B for the survival and chemosensory capabilities of adult RTN neurons in a living organism. The findings of this research underscore that beyond its developmental role, PHOX2B remains essential for sustaining accurate CO2 chemoreflex reactions in the adult brain. Furthermore, its diminished presence in Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS) could be a factor in the respiratory deficiencies observed in the condition. This study highlights the critical ongoing function of PHOX2B in adult physiology and its potential impact on respiratory health, offering valuable insights for the scientific and medical communities involved in treating and understanding respiratory disorders.</p>

<p>A brain region called the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) regulates breathing in response to changes in CO2/H+, a process termed central chemoreception. A transcription factor called PHOX2B is important for RTN development and mutations in the PHOX2B gene result in a severe type of sleep apnea called Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome. PHOX2B is also expressed throughout life, but its postmitotic functions remain unknown. This study shows that knockdown of PHOX2B in the RTN region in adult rats decreased expression of Task2 and Gpr4 in Nmb-expressing RTN chemoreceptors and this corresponded with a diminished ventilatory response to CO2 but did not impact baseline breathing or the hypoxic ventilatory response. These results provide novel insight regarding postmitotic functions of PHOX2B in RTN neurons.</p>
<p>I have two main concerns and several points of clarification.</p>

(1) The experimental approach was not targeted to Nmb+ neurons and since other cells in the area also express Phox2b, conclusions should be tempered to focus on Phox2b expressing parafacial neurons NOT specifically RTN neurons</p>
<p>(2) It's not clear whether PHOX2B is important for transcription of pH sensing machinery, cell health or both. If knockdown of PHOX2B knockdown results in loss of RTN neurons this is also expected to decrease Task2 and Gpr4 levels, albeit by a transcription-independent mechanism.</p>
<p>Other points:</p>
<p>(3) All individual data points should be visible in floating bar graphs in Figs 1 and 4. For example, I don't see any dots for naïve animals in any of the panels in Fig. 1.</p>
<p>(4) the C1 and facial partly overlap with the RTN at this level of the medulla and these cells should appear as Phox2b+/Nmb- cells so it is not clear to me why these cells are not evident in the control tissue in figs 2B and 3B. Also, some of the bregma levels shown in Fig. 5A overlap with Figs 2-3 so again it's not clear to me how this non-cell type specific viral approach was targeted to Nmb cells but not near by TH+ cells. Please clarify.</p>
<p>(5) How do you get a loss of Nmb+ neurons (Figs 2-3) with no change in Nmb fluorescence (Fig. 5B)? In the absence of representative images these results are not compelling and should be substantiated by more readily quantifiable approaches like qPCR.</p>

<p>This important study utilizes a virus-mediated short hairpin RNA (shRNA) approach to investigate in a novel way the role of the wild-type PHOX2B transcription factor in critical chemosensory neurons in the brainstem retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) region for maintaining normal CO2 chemoreflex control of breathing in adult rats. The solid results presented show blunted ventilation during elevated inhaled CO2 (hypercapnia) with knockdown of PHOX2B, accompanied by a reduction in expression of Gpr4 and Task2 mRNA for the proposed RTN neuron proton sensor proteins GPR4 and TASK2. These results suggest that maintained expression of wild-type PHOX2B affects respiratory control in adult animals, which complements previous studies showing that PHOX2B-expressing RTN neurons may be critical for chemosensory control throughout the lifespan and with implications for neurological disorders involving the RTN. When some methodological, data interpretation, and prior literature reference issues further highlighting novelty are adequately addressed, this study will be of interest to neuroscientists studying respiratory neurobiology as well as the neurodevelopmental control of motor behavior.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This important study investigated the role of the PHOX2B transcription factor in neurons in the key brainstem chemosensory structure, the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN), for maintaining proper CO2 chemoreflex responses of breathing in the adult rat in vivo. PHOX2B has an important transcriptional role in neuronal survival and/or function, and mutations of PHOX2B severely impair the development and function of the autonomic nervous system and RTN, resulting in the developmental genetic disease congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) in neonates, where the RTN may not form and is functionally impaired. The function of the wild-type PHOX2B protein in adult RTN neurons that continue to express PHOX2B is not fully understood. By utilizing a viral PHOX2B-shRNA approach for knockdown of PHOX2B specifically in RTN neurons, the authors' solid results show impaired ventilatory responses to elevated inspired CO2, measured by whole-body plethysmography in freely behaving adult rats, that develop progressively over a four-week period in vivo, indicating effects on RTN neuron transcriptional activity and associated blunting of the CO2 ventilatory response. The RTN neuronal mRNA expression data presented suggests the impaired hypercapnic ventilatory response is possibly due to the decreased expression of key proton sensors in the RTN. This study will be of interest to neuroscientists studying respiratory neurobiology as well as the neurodevelopmental control of motor behavior.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The authors used a shRNA viral approach to progressively knock down the PHOX2B protein, specifically in RTN neurons to determine whether PHOX2B is necessary for the survival and/or chemosensory function of adult RTN neurons in vivo.</p>
<p>(2) To determine the extent of PHOX2B knockdown in RTN neurons, the authors combined RNAScope® and immunohistochemistry assays to quantify the subpopulation of RTN neurons expressing PHOX2B and neuromedin B (Nmb), which has been proposed to be key chemosensory neurons in the RTN.</p>
<p>(3) The authors demonstrate that knockdown efficiency is time-dependent, with a progressive decrease in the number of Nmb-expressing RTN neurons that co-express PHOX2B over a four-week period.</p>
<p>(4) Their results convincingly show hypoventilation particularly in 7.2% CO2 only for PHOX2B-shRNA RTN-injected rats after four weeks as compared to naïve and non-PHOX2B-shRNA targeted (NT-shRNA) RTN injected rats, suggesting a specific impairment of chemosensitive properties in RTN neurons with PHOX2B knockdown.</p>
<p>(5) Analysis of the association between PHOX2B knockdown in RTN neurons and the attenuation of the hypercapnic ventilatory response (HCVR), by evaluating the correlation between the number of Nmb+/PHOX2B+ or Nmb+/PHOX2B- cells in the RTN and the resulting HCVR, showed a significant correlation between HCVR and number of Nmb+/PHOX2B+ and Nmb+/PHOX2B- cells, suggesting that the number of PHOX2B-expressing cells in the RTN is a predictor of the chemoreflex response and the reduction of PHOX2B protein impairs the CO2-chemoreflex.</p>
<p>(6) The data presented indicate that PHOX2B knockdown not only causes a reduction in the HCVR but also a reduction in the expression of Gpr4 and Task2 mRNAs, suggesting that PHOX2B knockdown affects RTN neurons transcriptional activity and decreases the CO2 response, possibly by reducing the expression of key proton sensors in the RTN.</p>
<p>(7) Results of this study show that independent of the role of PHOX2B during development, PHOX2B is still required to maintain proper CO2 chemoreflex responses in the adult brain, and its reduction in CCHS may contribute to the respiratory impairment in this disorder.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors found a significant decrease in the total number of Nmb+ RTN neurons (i.e., Nmb+/PHOX2B+ plus Nmb+/ PHOX2B-) in NT-shRNA rats at two weeks post viral injection, and also at the four-week period where the impairment of the chemosensory function of the RTN became significant, suggesting some inherent cell death possibly due to off-target toxic effects associated with shRNA procedures that may affect the experimental results.</p>
<p>(2) The tissue sampling procedures for quantifying numbers of cells expressing proteins/mRNAs throughout the extended RTN region bilaterally have not been completely validated to accurately represent the full expression patterns in the RTN under experimental conditions.</p>
<p>(3) The inferences about RTN neuronal expression of NMB, GPR4, or TASK2 are based on changes in mRNA levels, so it remains speculation that the observed reduction in Gpr4 and Task2 mRNA translates to a reduction in the protein levels and associated reduction of RTN neuronal chemosensitive properties.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for sharing the excitement for our study showing novel findings on the contribution of PHOX2B to the chemoreflex response and activity of adult RTN neurons. We believe that reporting the results on cell death following shRNA viral injections, potentially due to some off-target effects, are important to share with the scientific community to help plan experiments of similar kind in various fields of neuroscience.</p>
<p>Thanks for pointing out your concerns about cell quantification, we have edited the methods and results section to add clarity about our analytical procedure.</p>
<p>As we discussed in the manuscript, we were only able to assess mRNA levels of Nmb, Gpr4, Task2 as current available antibodies for the 3 targets are still unreliable. Future studies will benefit from the analysis of changes at protein levels and possibly electrophysiological recordings to verify that chemosensitive properties of RTN neurons are impaired due to reduction of PHOX2B expression. We discuss these limitations in the discussion.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors used a short hairpin RNA technique strategy to elucidate the functional activity of neurons in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN), a critical brainstem region for central chemoreception. Dysfunction in this area is associated with the neuropathology of congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS). The subsequent examination of these rats aimed to shed light on the intricate aspects of RTN and its implications for central chemoreception and disorders like CCHS in adults. They found that using the short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting Phox2b mRNA, a reduction of Phox2b expression was observed in Nmb neurons. In addition, Phox2b knockdown did not affect breathing in room air or under hypoxia, but the hypercapnia ventilatory response was significantly impaired. They concluded that Phox2b in the adult brain has an important role in CO2 chemoreception. They thought that their findings provided new evidence for mechanisms related to CCHS neuropathology. The conclusions of this paper are well supported by data, but careful discussion seems to be required for comparison with the results of various previous studies performed by different genetic strategies for the RTN neurons.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The most exciting aspect of this work is the modelling of the Phox2b knockdown in one element of the central neuronal circuit mediating respiratory reflexes, that is in the RTN. To date, mutations in the PHOX2B gene are commonly associated with most patients diagnosed with CCHS, a disease characterized by hypoventilation and absence of chemoreflexes, in the neonatal period, which in severe cases can lead to respiratory arrest during sleep. In the present study, the authors demonstrated that the role of Phox2b extends beyond the developmental period, and its reduction in CCHS may contribute to the respiratory impairment observed in this disorder.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Whereas the most exciting part of this work is the knockdown of the Phox2b in the RTN in adult rodents, the weakness of this study is the lack of a clear physiological, developmental, and anatomical distinction between this approach and similar studies already reported elsewhere (Ruffault et al., 2015, DOI: 10.7554/eLife.07051; Ramanantsoa et al., 2011, DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1721-11.2011; Huang et al., 2017, DOI: 10.1016/j.neuron.2012.06.027; Hernandez-Miranda et al., 2018, DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1813520115; Ferreira et al., 2022 DOI: 10.7554/eLife.73130; Takakura et al., 2008 DOI: 10.1113/jphysiol.2008.153163; Basting et al., 2015 DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2923-14.2015; Marina et al., 2010 DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3141-10.2010). In addition, several conclusions presented in this work are not directly supported by the provided data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the feedback on or manuscript. We have further highlighted in our discussion the previous developmental work aimed at determining the role of PHOX2B in embryonic development. Our study was triggered by the fascinating observations that despite its important role in development of the central and peripheral nervous system, PHOX2B is still present in the adult brain and its function in adult neurons is unknown, thus we aimed to investigate its role in the adult RTN by knocking down its expression with a shRNA approach. Therefore, in our model knockdown of PHOX2B does not affect development of the RTN. Previous studies (mentioned by the reviewer, as well as cited in the manuscript) have focused on investigating 1) the role of PHOX2B in the developmental period, 2) the physiological changes associated with the transgenic expression of mutant forms of PHOX2B in relation to CCHS, 3) the killing or the acute silencing/excitation of neuronal activity of PHOX2B+ RTN neurons. Our study had a different aim: to test whether the transcription factor PHOX2B had a physiologically relevant role in adult RTN neurons. In this experimental approach PHOX2B is not altered throughout embryonic or postnatal development. By knocking down PHOX2B in the Nmb+ cells of the RTN our results show a reduction in chemoreflex response and mRNA expression of protein sensors. Hence, we conclude that PHOX2B alters the function of Nmb+ RTN neurons, possibly through transcriptional changes including the reduction in Gpr4 and Task2 mRNA expression.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>A brain region called the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) regulates breathing in response to changes in CO2/H+, a process termed central chemoreception. A transcription factor called PHOX2B is important for RTN development and mutations in the PHOX2B gene result in a severe type of sleep apnea called Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome. PHOX2B is also expressed throughout life, but its postmitotic functions remain unknown. This study shows that knockdown of PHOX2B in the RTN region in adult rats decreased expression of Task2 and Gpr4 in Nmb-expressing RTN chemoreceptors and this corresponded with a diminished ventilatory response to CO2 but did not impact baseline breathing or the hypoxic ventilatory response. These results provide novel insight regarding the postmitotic functions of PHOX2B in RTN neurons.</p>
<p>Main issues:</p>
<p>(1) The experimental approach was not targeted to Nmb+ neurons and since other cells in the area also express Phox2b, conclusions should be tempered to focus on Phox2b expressing parafacial neurons NOT specifically RTN neurons.</p>
<p>(2) It is not clear whether PHOX2B is important for the transcription of pH sensing machinery, cell health, or both. If knockdown of PHOX2B knockdown results in loss of RTN neurons this is also expected to decrease Task2 and Gpr4 levels, albeit by a transcription-independent mechanism.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Although we did not specifically target Nmb+ neurons, we performed viral injections within the area where neurons expressing PHOX2B and Nmb are localized (i.e., the RTN region). We carefully quantified the impact of PHOX2B knockdown on Nmb expressing neurons, as well as the effects on the adjacent TH expressing C1 population and FN neurons (figure 5). As reported in the results section, significant changes in the numbers of PHOX2B expressing neurons was only observed at the site of injection in PHOX2B+/Nmb+ neurons. We did not observe changes in the total number of C1 cells (TH+/PHOX2B+), in the number of TH cells coexpressing PHOX2B, or in the hypoxic ventilatory response (which is dependent on the health status of C1 neuron). We have updated figure 5 to show representative expression of PHOX2B in TH+ neurons in the ventral medulla to complement our cell count analysis. To address potential effects on other cell populations we have edited our discussion as follows:</p>
<p>“PHOX2B knockdown was also restricted to RTN neurons, as adjacent C1 TH+ neurons did not show any change in number of TH+/PHOX2B+ expressing cells, although we cannot exclude that some C1 cells may have been infected and their relative PHOX2B expression levels were reduced. To support the lack of significant alterations associated with the possible loss of C1 function was the absence of significant changes in the hypoxic response that has been shown to be dependent on C1 neurons (Malheiros-Lima et al., 2017).”</p>
<p>Where appropriate, we have substituted “RTN” with “Nmb expressing neurons of the RTN” throughout the manuscript.</p>
<p>We have clarified in the methods and results section how we quantified Task2 and Gpr4 mRNA expression. The quantification was performed on a pool of single cells (200-250/rat) expressing Nmb. Hence, the overall reduction is not a result of general fluorescence loss in the RTN region, but specifically assessed in single cells expressing Nmb. This is therefore independent of the reduction of the total number of Nmb cells.</p>
<p>We propose that cell death is not a direct effect of PHOX2B knockdown, but rather it is associated with the injection of the viral constructs that have been already reported to promote some off-target effects (as reported in the manuscript). While modest cell death is observed only in the first two weeks post-infection, it does not increase further between 2 and 4 weeks post infection, when the reduction in PHOX2B (not associated with a further reduction in Nmb+ cells, hence no further cell death in RTN) is evident and the respiratory chemoreflex is impaired. These results suggest that 1) reduction of PHOX2B is not responsible for cell death; 2) it is the reduction of PHOX2B levels that promotes chemoreflex impairment. Given the observation that Nmb cells with no detectable PHOX2B protein show reduced expression of Task2 and Gpr4 mRNA, we propose that one of the possible mechanisms of chemoreflex impairment in PHOX2B shRNA rats is the reduction of Task2 and Gpr4. In the discussion we also suggest possible additional mechanisms that can be investigated in further studies.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold>.</p>
<p>In revising this manuscript, the authors should carefully address the issues raised by the reviewers to substantially improve the manuscript and solidify the reviewers' general assessment of the potential importance of this work.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Major concerns:</p>
<p>(1) The cell counts for Nmb+/PHOX2B+ and Nmb+/PHOX2B- RTN neurons are a critical component of the study, and it is unclear how the tissue sampling procedures (eight sections per animal) for quantifying numbers of cells expressing proteins/mRNAs throughout the extended RTN region bilaterally has been validated to accurately represent the full expression patterns in the RTN under the experimental conditions. It is possible that the sampling/quantification procedures used may be adequate, but validation is important. Also, quantification of the CTCF signal for Nmb, Gpr4, and Task2 mRNA is an important component of this study, but only four sections/rats were used.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing out your concern on our quantification method. We have clarified in the methods section the procedure for cell counting and quantification of the CTCF signal. We have sampled the area of the RTN in order to identify Nmb cells of RTN.</p>
<p>We have edited the methods section as follows:</p>
<p>“To quantify Nmb+/PHOX2B- and Nmb+/PHOX2B+ neurons within the RTN region, we analysed one in every seven sections (210 µm interval; 8 sections/rat in total) along the rostrocaudal distribution of the RTN on the ventral surface of the brainstem and compared total bilateral cell counts of PHOX2B-shRNA rats with non-target control (NT-shRNA) and naïve rats. Cells that expressed Nmb and Phox2b mRNAs but did not show co-localization with PHOX2B protein were considered Nmb+/PHOX2B-.</p>
<p>The Corrected Total Cell Fluorescence (CTCF) signal for Nmb, Gpr4 and Task2 mRNAs was quantified as previously described (Cardani et al., 2022; McCloy et al., 2014). Briefly, a Leica TCS SP5 (B-120G) Laser Scanning Confocal microscope was used to acquire images of the tissue. Exposure time and acquisition parameters were set for the naïve group and kept unchanged for the entire dataset acquisition. The collected images were then analysed by selecting a single cell at a time and measuring the area, integrated density and mean grey value (McCloy et al., 2014).  For each image, three background areas were used to normalize against autofluorescence.  We used 4 sections/rat (210 µm interval) to count Nmb, Gpr4 and Task2 mRNA CTCF in the core of the RTN area where several Nmb cells could be identified. For each section two images were acquired with a 20× objective, so that at least fifty cells per tissue sample were obtained for the mRNA quantification analysis. To evaluate changes in Nmb mRNA expression levels following PHOX2B knockdown at the level of the RTN, we compared, the fluorescence intensity of each RTN Nmb+ cell  (223.2 ± 37.1 cells/animal) with the average fluorescent signal of Nmb+ cells located dorsally in the NTS (4.3 ± 1.2 cells/animal) (Nmb CTCF ratio RTN/NTS) as we reasoned that the latter would not be affected by the shRNA infection and knockdown.</p>
<p>To quantify Gpr4 and Task2 mRNA expression in Nmb cells of the RTN, we first quantified single cell CTCF for either Gpr4 (200.7 ± 13.2 cells/animal) or Task2 (169.6 ± 10.3 cells/animal) mRNA in Nmb+ RTN neurons in the 3 experimental groups (naïve, NT shRNA and PHOX2B shRNA) independent of their PHOX2B expression. We then compared CTCF values of Gpr4 and Task2 mRNA between Nmb+/PHOX2B+ and Nmb+/PHOX2B- RTN neurons in PHOX2B-shRNA rats to address changes in their mRNA expression induced by PHOX2B knockdown.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Furthermore, to evaluate changes in Nmb mRNA expression following PHOX2B knockdown at the level of the RTN, it is stated in Materials and Methods &quot;we compared, on the same tissue section, the fluorescence intensity of RTN Nmb+ cells with the signal of Nmb+ cells in the NTS (Nmb CTCF ratio RTN/NTS)&quot;. How this was accomplished is unclear, considering the non-overlapping locations of the RTN and rostral NTS. Providing images would be helpful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The first sections containing Nmb cells in the ventral medulla also express few Nmb cells in the dorsal medulla. We used those cells as reference for fluorescence levels since they would not be affected by the viral infection. Similar cells are also present in the brains of mice and reported in the Allen Brain atlas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mouse.brain-map.org/experiment/show/71836874">https://mouse.brain-map.org/experiment/show/71836874</ext-link>). We have clarified our procedure in the methods section (see above) and included a sample image of Nmb in both ventral and dorsal regions in Figure 5.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>This manuscript by Cardani and colleagues attempts to address whether a reduction in Phox2b expression in chemosensitive neuromedin-B (NMB)-expressing neurons in the RTN alters respiratory function. The authors used a short hairpin RNA technique to silence RTN chemosensor neurons. The present study is very interesting, but there are several major concerns that need to be addressed, including the main hypothesis.</p>
<p>Major</p>
<p>(1) Page 6, lines 119-121: I did not grasp the mechanistic property described by the authors in this passage, nor did I understand the experiments they conducted to establish a mechanistic link between Phox2b and the chemosensitive property. Could the authors provide further clarification on these points?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We believe the reviewer refers to this paragraph: “In order to have a better understanding of the role of PHOX2B in the CO2 homeostatic processes we used a non-replicating lentivirus vector of two short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) clones targeting selectively Phox2b mRNA to knockdown the expression of PHOX2B in the RTN of adult rats and tested ventilation and chemoreflex responses. In parallel, we also determined whether knockdown of PHOX2B in adult RTN neurons negatively affected cell survival.  Finally, we sought to provide a mechanistic link between PHOX2B expression and the chemosensitive properties of RTN neurons, which have been attributed to two proton sensors, the proton-activated G protein-coupled receptor (GPR4) and the proton-modulated potassium channel (TASK-2).”</p>
<p>The rationale for running these experiments is based on the fact that it is well known in the literature that PHOX2B is an important transcription factor for the development of several neuronal populations. PHOX2B Knockout mice die before birth and heterozygous mice have some anatomical defects, but respiration is only impaired in the early post-natal period. While many developmental transcription factors are generally downregulated in the post-natal period, PHOX2B is still expressed in some neurons into adulthood. What is the function of PHOX2B in these fully developed neurons? We do not know as we do not yet know the entire set of target genes that PHOX2B regulates in the adult brain. Hence we decided to test what would happen if we knocked down the PHOX2B protein in the Nmb neurons of the RTN, an area that is critical for central chemoreception and involved in the presentation of CCHS. Our results show that reduction of PHOX2B blunts the CO2 chemoreflex response and reduces mRNA expression of Task2 and Gpr4, two pH sensors that have been shown to be key for RTN chemosensitive properties. We also show that the Nmb mRNA and cell survival are not affected by PHOX2B knockdown and we propose that the reduced CO2 chemoreflex may be attributed to a reduction of chemosensory function of Nmb neurons of the RTN due to partial loss of Gpr4 and Task2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) It is imperative for the authors to enhance the description of their hypothesis, as, from my perspective, the contribution of the data to the field is not clearly articulated. Numerous more selectively designed experiments were conducted to investigate the role of Phoxb-expressing neurons at the RTN level and their involvement in respiratory activity. In summary, the current study appears to lack novelty.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We respectfully disagree with this statement. We believe we have adequately summarized previous work, although we realize we can’t reference every single publication on this topic. As described above, the developmental role of PHOX2B has been elegantly investigated in mouse embryonic studies (extensively cited in the manuscript). Furthermore, very interesting studies have shown that when the CCHS defining mutant PHOX2B protein (+7Ala PHOX2B) and other mutations linked to CCHS have been transgenically expressed in mice through development, severe anatomical defects are observed and respiratory function is impaired (extensively cited in the manuscript). We have also cited papers relevant to this study that describe the role of PHOX2B/Nmb RTN neurons and the pH protein sensors in the CO2 chemoreflex. If we missed some papers that the reviewer deems essential in the context of this study we will be happy to include them.</p>
<p>We are not aware of other studies that have investigated the specific role of the PHOX2B protein in the adult RTN in the absence of confounding developmental pathogenesis (i.e. in an otherwise ‘healthy’ animal), and of no other studies that looked at the effects on the RTN proton sensors and Nmb expression following PHOX2B knockdown. Hence we believe that our results are novel and, in our opinion, very interesting.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) On pages 13 and 14 (Results section), I am seeking clarity on the novelty of the findings. Doug Bayliss's prior work has already demonstrated the role of Gpr4 and Task2 on Phox2b neurons in regulating ventilation in conscious rodents.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Bayliss’ group has elegantly demonstrated that Gpr4 and Task2 are the two proton sensors in the PHOX2B/Nmb neurons of the RTN that have a key role in chemoreception (cited in the manuscript). The novelty of our findings is that we show that a reduction in PHOX2B protein is associated with a reduction of mRNA levels of Gpr4 and Task2. This is a novel finding. Currently, we do not know what transcriptional activity PHOX2B has in adult RTN neurons (i.e., what gene targets PHOX2B has in this cell population and many others) and here we propose that Nmb is not a gene target of PHOX2B while Gpr4 and Task2 are.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors assert that the transcription factor Phox2b remains not fully understood. While I concur, the present study falls short of fully investigating the actual contribution of Phox2b to breathing regulation. In other words, the knockdown of Phox2b neurons did not add much to the knowledge of the field.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We respectfully disagree with the reviewer. With the exception of very few target genes, the transcriptional role of PHOX2B beyond the embryonic development is poorly understood. No mechanistic connection has been made before between the transcriptional activity of PHOX2B with the expression of proton sensors in the RTN. Other groups have investigated the role of stimulating or depressing the neuronal activity of PHOX2B/NMB neurons in the RTN showing a key role of RTN on respiratory control, but these prior studies did not test whether changing the expression of the PHOX2B protein in these neurons had a role on respiratory control and the central chemoreflex. No other study has investigated the role of the PHOX2B protein within the RTN cells, with the exception of PHOX2B knockout mice or transgenic expression of the mutated PHOX2B that are relevant for CCHS. Again, these previous studies were done on a background of developmental impairment and to the best of our knowledge did not seek to show any association between PHOX2B expression and expression of Gpr4 or Task2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) I recommend removing the entire section entitled &quot;The role of Phox2b in development and in the adult brain.&quot; The authors merely describe Phox2b expression without contextualizing it within the obtained data.</p>

<p>Because reviewers raised the issue about not including important information about the role of PHOX2B in development and respiratory control we prefer to keep the section.</p>

<p>(6) Are the authors aware of whether the shRNA in Phox2b/Nmb neurons truly induced cell death or solely depleted the expression of the transcription factor protein? Do the chemosensitive neurons persist?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an excellent question that we tried to address with our study. As we report in figures 2 and 3, we propose that some cell death is occurring as an off-target effect within the first 2 weeks post-infection, likely due to off-target action of the shRNA approach and not dependent on the reduction of PHOX2B expression (discussed in the manuscript). This is further evidenced by our Fig.S1 data in which higher concentrations of shRNA led to more cell death, indicative of off-target effects. We do not believe it is a consequence of our surgical procedure as we do not see similar cell loss when injecting vehicle or other control solutions (unpublished work; Janes et al., 2024).</p>
<p>During the first 2 weeks post-surgery the proportion of Nmb+/PHOX2B- cells does not change compared to control rats or non-target shRNA (knockdown is not yet visible at protein level). Four weeks post-injection, there is no further cell death (assessed by the total number of NMB cells), whereas the fraction of NMB cells that express PHOX2B is reduced (and the fraction of NMB not expressing PHOX2B is increased), suggesting that the reduction of PHOX2B protein in Nmb cells is not correlated with cell loss/survival whereas the impairment that we observe in terms of central chemoreception is possibly due to the progressive decrease of PHOX2B expression in these neurons.</p>

<p>(7) In Figures 2 and 3, it is noteworthy that the authors observe peak expression at a very caudal level. In rats, the RTN initiates at the caudal end of the facial, approximately 11.6 mm, and should exhibit a rostral direction of about 2 mm.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our experience the Nmb cells on the ventral surface of the medulla peak in number around the caudal tip of the facial nucleus in adult SD rats (Janes et al., 2024). To add clarity to the figure we reported cell count distribution data in relation to the distance from caudal tip of the facial.</p>

<p>(1) I would like to suggest that the authors correct the recurring statement throughout the manuscript that Phox2b is essential only for the development of the autonomic nervous system. In my view, it also plays a crucial role in certain sensory and respiratory systems.</p>

<p>(3) Page 7, lines 129-131: In my understanding, the sentence is quite clear; if we knock down the PHOX2B gene, we are expected to reduce or even eliminate the expression of Gpr4 or Task2. Am I right?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is what we propose from the results of this study. We would like to point out that the transcriptional activity of PHOX2B (i.e., what genes PHOX2B regulate) in adult neurons has not yet been fully investigated. With the exception of few target genes (e.g., TH, DBH) the transcriptional activity of PHOX2B in neurons is not yet known. Here we report novel findings that suggest that Gpr4 and Task2 are potential target genes of PHOX2B in RTN neurons.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors mentioned that NT-shRNA also impacts CO2 chemosensitivity. Could this effect be attributed to mechanical damage of the tissue resulting from the injection?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Just to clarify, we observe some impairment in chemosensitivity when NT-shRNA was injected in “larger” (2x 200ul/side) volume. No impairment was observed in NT-shRNA when we injected smaller volumes (2x 100ul/side). Physical damage could be a possibility although in our experience (unpublished work; Janes et al, 2024, Acta Physiologica) injections of similar volume of solution performed by the same investigator in the same brain area and experimental settings did not produce a physical lesion associated with respiratory impairment. Hence we attribute the unexpected results with larger volumes to toxic effects associated with the shRNA viral constructs.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We think that it is important to report off target effects of shRNA viral constructs as concentration and volumes of viruses injected in various studies vary considerably and other investigators may attempt to use larger volumes of viruses to obtain more considerable or faster knockdown but would obtain erroneous conclusions if appropriate tests are not performed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, because some readers could question whether we injected enough virus to knockdown the expression of PHOX2B, and may wonder if with a larger amount of virus we would increase knockdown efficiency, we wanted to show that, in our opinion, we used the maximum amount of virus to knockdown PHOX2B without causing toxic effects or physiological changes that are not dependent on PHOX2B knockdown.</p>

<list-item><p>The C1 and facial partly overlap with the RTN at this level of the medulla and these cells should appear as Phox2b+/Nmb- cells so it is not clear to me why these cells are not evident in the control tissue in Figures 2B and 3B.

</disp-quote>
<p>In our experience, C1 TH cells are located slightly medial to the Nmb cells and they spread much more caudally than Nmb cells of the RTN. We focused our small volume injection in the core of the RTN to target Nmb cells but we also assessed PHOX2B knockdown in TH C1 cells by counting the PHOX2B/TH cells across treatment groups. Although we can’t exclude subtle changes in the C1 population, we did not observe changes in the total number of C1 cells (TH+/PHOX2B+), in the number of TH cells expressing PHOX2B, or in the hypoxic ventilatory response (which is dependent on the health status of C1 neuron). We have updated figure 5 to show representative expression of PHOX2B in TH+ neurons in the ventral medulla to complement our cell count analysis. To address potential effects on other cell populations we have edited our discussion as follows:</p>
<p>“PHOX2B knockdown was also restricted to RTN neurons, as adjacent C1 TH+ neurons did not show any change in number of TH+/PHOX2B+ expressing cells, although we cannot exclude that some C1 cells may have been infected and their relative PHOX2B expression levels were reduced. To support the lack of significant alterations associated with the possible loss of C1 function was the absence of significant changes in the hypoxic response that has been shown to be dependent on C1 neurons (Malheiros-Lima et al., 2017).”</p>

<p>In order to systematically analyze Nmb mRNA expression we decided to use measurement of fluorescence relative to Nmb neurons present in the dorsal brainstem. Here cells are sparse but we used them as reference fluorescence since they would not be affected by the ventral shRNA injection. Similar cells are also present in the brains of mice and reported by the Allen Brain atlas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mouse.brain-map.org/experiment/show/71836874">https://mouse.brain-map.org/experiment/show/71836874</ext-link>).

<list-item><p>How do you get a loss of Nmb+ neurons (Figs 2-3) with no change in Nmb fluorescence (Fig. 5B)? In the absence of representative images these results are not compelling and should be substantiated by more readily quantifiable approaches like qPCR.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have clarified in the methods and results section our analytical procedure to assess PHOX2B and Nmb expression. Figure 2 and 3 display the results of counting numbers of Nmb+ cells in the RTN. Figure 5B reports the average of total cell fluorescence measured inside Nmb+ cells, not an average fluorescence measurement of the area of the ventral medulla. Basically, our results show that we have less Nmb cells that express PHOX2B but the overall Nmb mRNA fluorescence (expression) in Nmb cells relative to Nmb fluorescence in cells of the dorsal brainstem is the same.</p>
<p>We have edited the methods as follows:</p>
<p>“The Corrected Total Cell Fluorescence (CTCF) signal for Nmb, Gpr4 and Task2 mRNAs was quantified as previously described (Cardani et al., 2022; McCloy et al., 2014). Briefly, a Leica TCS SP5 (B-120G) Laser Scanning Confocal microscope was used to acquire images of the tissue. Exposure time and acquisition parameters were set for the naïve group and kept unchanged for the entire dataset acquisition. The collected images were then analysed by selecting a single cell at a time and measuring the area, integrated density and mean grey value (McCloy et al., 2014).  For each image, three background areas were used to normalize against autofluorescence.  We used 4 sections/rat (210 µm interval) to count Nmb, Gpr4 and Task2 mRNA CTCF in the core of the RTN area where several Nmb cells could be identified. For each section two images were acquired with a 20× objective, so that at least fifty cells per tissue sample were obtained for the mRNA quantification analysis. To evaluate changes in Nmb mRNA expression levels following PHOX2B knockdown at the level of the RTN, we compared the fluorescence intensity of each RTN Nmb+ cell  (223.2 ± 37.1 cells/animal) with the average fluorescent signal of Nmb+ cells located dorsally in the NTS ( 4.3 ± 1.2 cells/animal) (Nmb CTCF ratio RTN/NTS) as we reasoned that the latter would not be affected by the shRNA infection and knockdown. “</p>
<p>A single cell qPCR analysis would be definitely ideal but a qPCR from dissected tissue would not help us determine whether within a cell there was a reduction in Nmb mRNA levels.</p>

<p>Does the reviewer mean “cell migration” with relocalization? We do not expect that this would occur in our experiments. Although TUNEL in the first week post-infection could be useful to determine cell death in our tissue, we do not expect a cell migration of neurons within the brain as our viral shRNA injections are performed in adult rats when developmental processes are already concluded.</p>
