<title>Summary</title><p>Memories are stored as ensembles of engram neurons and their successful recall involves the reactivation of these cellular networks. However, significant gaps remain in connecting these cell ensembles with the process of forgetting. Here, we utilized a mouse model of object memory and investigated the conditions in which a memory could be preserved, retrieved, or forgotten. Direct modulation of engram activity via optogenetic stimulation or inhibition either facilitated or prevented the recall of an object memory. In addition, through behavioral and pharmacological interventions, we successfully prevented or accelerated forgetting of an object memory. Finally, we showed that these results can be explained by a computational model in which engrams that are subjectively less relevant for adaptive behavior are more likely to be forgotten. Together, these findings suggest that forgetting may be an adaptive form of engram plasticity which allows engrams to switch from an accessible state to an inaccessible state.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>For an organism to adapt to its environment there must be processes by which learned information is updated or replaced with new more relevant information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). For example, learning that a specific food source is no longer present in a previous location, or that a given action stops yielding the same outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Without a process to update or forget irrelevant information, adaptability would be impaired with frequent instances of correct but outdated memory recall, and a subsequently biased behavioral response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Forgetting, that is the loss of learned behavioral responses, may therefore function adaptively to improve learning, and promote survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>).</p>
<p>Memories are stored as ensembles of engram cells that undergo specific forms of plasticity during learning, and their successful recall involves the reactivation of these cellular networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). However, despite advancements in understanding the biology of engram cells, more work is still needed to fully elucidate how these cell ensembles contribute to the process of forgetting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Forgetting is often considered a deficit of memory function. The standard view in the field of memory is that this kind of active forgetting is due to the loss or dissipation of the engram/trace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). We argue that a new conceptualization is necessitated by recent behavioral and physiological findings that emphasize retrieval deficits as a key characteristic of memory impairment, supporting the idea that memory recall or accessibility may be driven by learning feedback from the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Little is understood about the role experience plays in altering forgetting rates. Recently it has been suggested that different forms of forgetting may exist along a gradient of engram activity or expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Indeed, numerous studies have suggested that memory recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>), and most recently forgetting, require engram activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Long-term memories of salient experiences can last a lifetime and must involve significant and specific changes to brain structure, while the successful recall of learned information requires the reactivation of these cell ensembles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). In contrast, forgetting may occur when engrams are not or cannot be reactivated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). In severe amnesic states, this may be due to the destruction of the engram itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). However, in other pathological and non-pathological states, forgetting may be due to reduced accessibility of engrams that otherwise endure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Altered engram accessibility may be caused by structural plasticity in the engram or indeed by competing engrams of similar or recent experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>).</p>
<p>We hypothesize that natural forgetting represents a reversible suppression of engram ensembles due to experience and perceptual feedback, prompting cellular plasticity processes that modulate memory access adaptively. To investigate this idea, we utilized a forgetting paradigm based on an object recognition task and interrogated the conditions in which a memory could be preserved, retrieved, or forgotten to elucidate how experience and learning govern engram reactivation and memory recall. Based on our experimental results, we developed a computational model that dynamically updates engram accessibility in response to perceptual feedback, where engrams that are subjectively less relevant for adaptive behavior are more likely to be forgotten.</p>

<title>Natural forgetting of an object memory</title>
<p>Natural forgetting was assessed using an object recognition task. This task utilizes the natural tendency of mice to explore novel stimuli to assess recognition memory over time (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). During object memory recall, mice tested 24 hours (h) after training spent significantly more time exploring the novel object compared to mice tested 2 weeks (wk) after training (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). This was further demonstrated by a significant difference between the discrimination index of the 24 h and 2 wk group (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). The discrimination index was calculated as the time spent exploring the novel object minus the time spent exploring the familiar object divided by the total time spent exploring both objects (novel – familiar / novel + familiar). Together, these data indicate that mice successfully recall an object memory 24 hours after acquisition, while at 2 weeks there was no preference for the novel object suggesting the original familiar object had been forgotten.</p>

<title>Engram reactivation is associated with object memory recall</title>
<p>In order to assess engram reactivation on object memory retrievability an AAV<sub>9</sub>-TRE-ChR2-EYFP virus was injected into the dentate gyrus of c-fos-tTA mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). The immediate early gene <italic>c-fos</italic> becomes upregulated following neural activity and as such the c-fos-tTA transgene selectively expresses tTA in active cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). The activity-dependent tTA induces expression of ChR2-EYFP following a learning event (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d, e</xref>). To restrict activity-dependent labelling to a single learning experience, mice were maintained on diet containing doxycycline (DOX) which prevents binding of tTA to the TRE elements of the TetO promoter, thus controlling the activity-dependent labelling to a specific time window of the object acquisition training (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d-f</xref>). Prior to training (36 h) doxycycline was removed from the animal’s diet, thereby allowing for activity-dependent labelling during the subsequent acquisition training (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1f</xref>). During the object recall test, c-fos-tTA mice tested 24 hours after acquisition training spent significantly more time exploring the novel object compared to mice tested 2 weeks later (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1g</xref>). This memory impairment was further demonstrated by a significant difference between the discrimination index of the 24 h tested and 2 wk tested mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1h</xref>). When comparing the engram ensemble between the two cohorts, we observed no significant difference in the number of engram cells between the 24 h and 2 wk tested groups (EYFP<sup>+</sup>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1j</xref>, k). Similarly, there was no significant difference in c-Fos activity within the dentate gyrus between the 24 h tested or 2 wk tested mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1l</xref>). However, when comparing engram reactivation, that is the number of engram cells (EYFP<sup>+</sup>) that also express c-Fos during the recall test, which indicates these cells were active during encoding and then became active again during the memory recall (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1j</xref>), there was a significant decrease in engram reactivation in mice that were tested 2 weeks after training and that had forgotten the object memory (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1m</xref>). Furthermore, the level of engram reactivation correlated with the performance in object discrimination (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1i</xref>). Together these data suggest that natural forgetting may be driven by a reduction in engram ensemble activity.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Engram spine density decreased following natural forgetting</title>
<p>In order to gain further insight into the changes that occur within the memory engram following natural forgetting we performed morphological analysis of engram dendritic spines following successful memory recall at 24 hours or forgetting at 2 weeks. Following natural forgetting mice displayed a significant reduction in spine density (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1n</xref>). Moreover, there was also a significant decrease in spine volume (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1o</xref>, p). Together, these findings suggest that in addition to the reduced engram activity, there was also a reduction in engram spine density.</p>

<title>Dentate gyrus engrams are necessary and sufficient for recall of an object memory</title>
<p>To test the hypothesis that the retrieval of an object memory requires the activity of engram cells within the dentate gyrus, we labelled engrams with the virus AAV<sub>9</sub>-TRE-ArchT-GFP and inhibited engram activity during memory retrieval 24 hours following acquisition training (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). During the object recall test the No Light control mice spent significantly more time with the novel object, indicating successful memory retrieval (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). Whereas mice in which the engram was inhibited spent equal time exploring both objects, indicating mice failed to distinguish the novel from the familiar object (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). This was further demonstrated by a significant difference between the discrimination index of the No Light control and Light-induced inhibition groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>). Together, these data demonstrate that the engram cells within the dentate gyrus are required for successful retrieval of an object memory.</p>

<p>Since the data suggested that forgetting correlated with a reduction in engram activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) and that inhibition of the ensemble was sufficient to impair successful recall of an object memory (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b, c</xref>), we next asked if the retrieval of an object memory could be induced via activation of the engram after natural forgetting. We labelled engrams cells within the dentate gyrus with the virus AAV<sub>9</sub>-TRE-ChR2-EYFP and optogenetically activated the ensemble after natural forgetting. Specifically, optogenetic stimulation was induced just prior to memory recall (3min), but not during the recall test itself (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>). During the object recall test the No Light control mice displayed equal exploration of both the novel and familiar objects suggesting mice had forgotten the familiar object (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2e</xref>). Whereas mice that underwent optogenetic activation spent more time exploring the novel object, suggesting the original object memory had been retrieved (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2e</xref>). This was further demonstrated by a significant difference between the discrimination index of the No Light control and Light-induced activation group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2f</xref>). These data suggest that artificial activation of the original engram was sufficient to induce recall of the forgotten object memory, and that the forgotten engram was still intact, otherwise activation of those cells would no longer trigger memory recall. Together, the results of <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> suggest that engram activity can modulate memory retrieval, where activation of the engram ensemble is both necessary for successful memory retrieval as well as sufficient to induced recall despite natural forgetting.</p>

<title>Environmental enrichment reduces the rate of forgetting by increasing engram activation</title>
<p>Environmental enrichment has been shown to enhance cognitive function and improve memory retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). A key component of enriched environments is the additional perceptual and tactile feedback provided by extra toys and objects within the home-cage for the mice to interact with and explore. We, therefore sought to investigate how enrichment might alter the rate of forgetting through changes in the engram given this increase in tactile and perceptual experience. First, we characterized the forgetting curve of mice housed under either standard or enriched conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). During object recall test both standard housed (Std) and Environmental Enrichment housed (EE) mice spent significantly more time with the novel object when tested 24 hours or 1 week after acquisition training, indicating intact memory recall (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>). Crucially though, when tested 2 or even 3 weeks after training the enriched housed mice were still able to recall the familiar object, whereas the standard housed mice displayed chance level performance (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>In order to assess the impact of environmental enrichment on engram activity we again injected an AAV<sub>9</sub>-TRE-ChR2-EYFP virus into c-fos-tTA mice to label engram cells within the dentate gyrus. Following surgery, mice were housed in either standard or enriched housing for 3 weeks before behavioral testing and remained in the housing condition for the duration of the experiment. Again, we observed that mice housed in enrichment maintained the object memory 2 weeks after training (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>). This was further demonstrated by a significant difference between the discrimination index of standard housed (Std) and enriched (EE) mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref>). When comparing the engram size between standard and enriched mice, we observed no significant difference in the number of engram cells following enrichment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">f</xref>). Similarly, there was also no significant difference in c-Fos activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3g</xref>). However, there was a significant increase in engram reactivation in mice that underwent enrichment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3h</xref>). These data suggest that environmental enrichment reduces the rate of forgetting, by increasing or maintaining engram reactivation. To confirm the effectiveness of the enrichment paradigm to enhance neural plasticity, we measured hippocampal neurogenesis following environmental enrichment. Enrichment increased hippocampal neurogenesis, with both the number of immature neurons (doublecortin<sup>+</sup> cells) (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S1a</xref> &amp; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">b</xref>) as well as neuronal survival (BrdU-NeuN positive cells) (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S1c</xref> &amp; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">d</xref>). Experiencing extra toys and objects during environmental enrichment that are reminiscent of the previously learned familiar object might help maintain or nudge mice to infer a higher engram relevancy that is more robust against forgetting, leading to higher engram expression.</p>

<sec id="s2f">
<title>Exposure to the original stimuli facilities memory recall</title>
<p>We next sought to investigate conditions in which more nuanced learning from experience may alter engram activity and subsequently switch a forgotten memory from an inaccessible state to an accessible state. Previous work from both human experimental psychology studies and rodent behavioral paradigms have shown that a brief exposure to reminder cues can aid memory recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). Here we modified our object-based paradigm to include a brief exposure to the original encoding environment and objects (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>). An AAV<sub>9</sub>-TRE-ChR2-EYFP virus was injected into c-fos-tTA mice to label engram cells in the dentate gyrus. During the object recall test, mice within the control group spent a similar amount of time exploring both the novel and familiar object, again suggesting the original object memory was forgotten (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>). However, mice given a brief reminder session 1 hour prior to the recall test spent significantly more time exploring the novel object (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>). This was further demonstrated by a significant difference between the discrimination index of the Control and Reminder group (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>). Furthermore, the mice that underwent the reminder session and displayed intact memory recall also exhibited an increase in original engram reactivation (Figure d &amp; g), while there was no difference in the engram size (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4e</xref>) or the level of neuronal activity within the dentate gyrus (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4f</xref>). A control experiment was performed to demonstrated that a brief reminder exposure of 5 mins on its own was insufficient to induce new learning that formed a lasting memory (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S2a</xref>). Mice given only a brief acquisition period of 5 mins, exhibited no preference for the novel object when tested 1 hour after training, suggesting the absence of a lasting object memory (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S2b</xref> &amp; <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">c</xref>). Together, these data indicate that a brief reminder of the original stimuli facilitates the transition of a forgotten memory to an accessible memory via modulating engram activity.</p>

<title>Repeated exposure to the training environment facilitates forgetting</title>
<p>Given that memory recall could be facilitated by optogenetic activation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), maintained by enrichment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), or even retrieved after forgetting by a brief exposure to natural “reminder” cues (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), we wanted to test that forgetting was driven by an adaptive process which updates memory engrams according to perceptual and environmental feedback. We therefore developed an altered version of the object memory task where mice were repeatedly reintroduced to the training context in the absence of objects (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>). We hypothesized that the repeated exposure to the training context without objects would update the original memory engram signaling that the objects were no longer relevant to the environment. During the recall test 1 week after training control mice spent significantly more time exploring the novel object, indicating a retrievable object memory (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref>). Whereas mice that had been repeatedly exposed to the training environment devoid of objects spent a similar amount of time exploring both objects, suggesting an updated and now inaccessible engram. This was further demonstrated by a significant difference in the discrimination index between the control and empty box exposed mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref>).</p>

<p>In order to confirm that the experience during the repeated exposure was indeed updating the original engram we ran a second cohort of c-fos-tTA mice which had been implanted with an optogenetic fiber and expressed the inhibitory opsin ArchT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5d</xref>). Following acquisition training the engram was optogenetically silenced during the repeated context-only exposures (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5d</xref>). During the recall test, the No Light control group spent a similar amount of time exploring both objects (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5e</xref>), while the Light-induced inhibition mice, in which the engram was silenced, spent significantly more time exploring the novel object (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5e</xref>). This effect was further demonstrated by a significant difference in discrimination index (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5f</xref>). Combined these data suggest that experience following the encoding of an object memory can update the original memory engram accelerating the rate at which the information is forgotten. Further, this adaptive process requires the activity of the original engram ensemble.</p>

<title>Rac1 mediates forgetting and engram reactivation</title>
<p>Rac1 has previously been shown to be involved in memory encoding and consolidation as well as active forgetting of contextual and social memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Rac1 has also recently been shown to be involved in memory retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). We therefore sought to investigate the role of Rac1 signaling in mediating natural forgetting within the object memory paradigm employed in this study. An AAV<sub>9</sub>-TRE-ChR2-EYFP virus was injected into c-fos-tTA mice to label engram cells within the dentate gyrus. Immediately after acquisition training, mice were administered a Rac1 inhibitor (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a</xref>). Mice that were administered saline displayed typical forgetting at 2 weeks, as indicated by similar object exploration (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6b</xref>), while mice treated with a Rac1 inhibitor displayed intact memory recall, spending significantly more time with the novel object (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6b</xref>).

<p>Given Rac1 inhibition prevented forgetting, it stands to reason that by activating Rac1 forgetting maybe accelerated. We next injected a Rac1 activator into a second cohort of c-fos-tTA mice following memory encoding and again daily for 6 days (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6h</xref>). During the object recall test, mice within the control group spent more time exploring the novel object, suggesting intact memory recall (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6i</xref>). Whereas mice with Rac1 activator spent a similar amount of time exploring both the novel and familiar object, suggesting the original object memory was forgotten (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6i</xref>). This was further demonstrated by a significant difference between the discrimination index of the Control and Rac1 activator group (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6j</xref>). Furthermore, the mice that received the Rac1 activator and reduced memory recall displayed no difference in the engram size (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6k</xref>) or the level of neuronal activity within the dentate gyrus (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6l</xref>). However, there was a decrease in engram reactivation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6m</xref> &amp; <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">n</xref>). We also conducted a control experiment which indicated a single dose of Rac1 activator was sufficient to promote forgetting (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S4a-f</xref>). Combined these data demonstrate the Rac1 signaling is involved in memory encoding and consolidation and may function as a plasticity enabling molecule to meditate retrievability. Rac1 may therefore be a signaling mechanism involved in adaptive forgetting.</p>

<title>Learning Model Explains Forgetting Dynamics</title>
<p>Utilizing a mouse model of object memory, we have investigated the conditions in which a memory could be preserved, retrieved, or forgotten. The data indicate that forgetting is a dynamic process that can be explained as a gradient of engram activity, where the level of memory expression is experience dependent and influenced by the animal’s rate at which it learns from new experiences (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7a-c</xref>). Based on these findings, we sought to develop a computational model that formalizes the idea that forgetting is a form of learning and to integrate the empirical findings into a coherent, mechanistic, and quantitative framework. This model updates engram accessibility in response to perceptual feedback, so that engrams that are subjectively less relevant for adaptive behavior are more likely to be forgotten. Our modeling analyses suggest that the “learning rate”, which is a key parameter of adaptive learning models, could also govern the speed of forgetting. Accordingly, faster forgetting is driven by higher rates at which mice learn from perceptual feedback.</p>
<fig id="fig7" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure">
<label>Figure 7:</label>
<caption><title>Forgetting as adaptive learning.</title>
<p>Our model assumes that animals create and update memory engrams to flexibly adjust their behavior to their environment. <bold>(a)</bold> Based on learned representations, animals constantly predict what happens in the environment (e.g., the occurrence of objects), and if predictions are violated (prediction errors), engrams are updated to improve the accuracy of future predictions. Here, established engram cells are shown in green; non-engram cells in gray. <bold>(b)</bold> Positive prediction errors signaling the occurrence of an unexpected event (e.g., new object) induce a learning process that increases the probability of remembering. This might rely on the recruitment of new engram cells (shown in yellow). In contrast, negative prediction errors signaling the absence of an expected event (e.g., predicted object did not appear) induce forgetting. This might rely on “forgetting” plasticity reducing access to engrams (light green cells). <bold>(c)</bold> Our model formalizes this perspective based on the notion of “engram relevancy”. Higher engram relevancy makes it more likely that an engram is behaviorally expressed, e.g., through exploration behavior. The presentation of a novel object (upper panel) leads to a high engram relevancy (middle panel) in response to a positive prediction error (lower panel). The absence of an expected object decreases engram relevancy through negative prediction errors. <bold>(d)</bold> Model simulations corroborate the behavioral effects of our data (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>).

</fig>
<p>We interpret forgetting as an adaptive learning process that helps the animal to prioritize relevant information in memory (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). In particular, we applied an error-driven learning model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>), where the learning rate and expectation of one’s environment can alter the efficiency of recall/forgetting plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Based on the current memory representations stored in engrams, the animal predicts what it will encounter in its environment (e.g., what objects) and adjusts these predictions as a function of its experiences (e.g., the presence or absence of objects). Within this conceptual framework, the animal learns what features of the environment are currently relevant and thus important for remembering.</p>
<p>Supporting the idea that forgetting can be cast as an adaptive learning process, model simulations showed similar forgetting curves as mice in our experiment. We first applied the model to exploration behavior of mice in the standard housing condition that included data across four test time points (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). To obtain an empirical estimate of the subjects’ learning rate governing the speed of forgetting, we fitted the model to the data using a maximum-likelihood approach (see Methods). Here, the learning rate indicating the weight given to negative prediction errors was <italic>α</italic><sup>−</sup> = 0.07, explaining the increase in forgetting across time (see <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref> for the other parameter estimates). Simulated forgetting curves that were based on the estimated parameters showed a close similarity to mice in the standard housing condition (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7d</xref>; see <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S5</xref> and S6 for a direct comparison of model predictions and empirical data).</p>
<p>The model also offers an explanation for the key results of the different experimental interventions. Experiencing objects during environmental enrichment that resemble the familiar objects in the memory test might nudge subjects to infer a higher engram relevancy that is more robust against prediction errors leading to higher engram expression (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8a</xref> &amp; <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">8b, d, f</xref>). Supporting the perspective of forgetting as learning, the estimated learning rate in response to negative errors driving forgetting <italic>α</italic><sup>−</sup> = 0. Thereby, negative prediction errors did not induce forgetting so that memory performance was constant across 4 weeks (see also <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). From a computational perspective, a low learning rate may also explain the high memory performance of the Rac1-inhibition group. For this group, model fitting revealed a similar learning rate to the enrichment group (learning rate for negative prediction errors <italic>α</italic><sup>−</sup> = 0.01), suggesting that the inhibition of Rac1 made subjects largely ignore negative prediction errors that would normally drive forgetting. In contrast to reduced learning preventing forgetting due to Rac1 inhibition, Rac1 activation might speed forgetting through a higher learning rate. Similarly, we found accelerated forgetting following repeated exposure to the context-only training environment. Model simulations (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8c</xref>) assuming a higher learning rate and, therefore, reduced engram expression, reproduced these findings (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).</p>

<p>A crucial assumption of our model is that seemingly forgotten engrams are not necessarily lost but rather inaccessible when the inferred object relevance is low. This is consistent with the experimental results above, where we presented evidence for the reinstatement of memory representations based on real or artificial reminder cues (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Here, we modeled memory reinstatement through reminder cues by inducing an artificial, positive prediction error in response to the reminder that boosted the inferred object relevance. Similar to the experimental data, the modeled reminder cues increased engram expression and yielded reduced forgetting rates (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8e</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, the model fits the data better than a baseline model predicting random forgetting rates, suggesting that it describes the data accurately and above chance-level (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>). We also performed a parameter-recovery analysis suggesting that parameters can sufficiently be estimated despite the limited data for model fitting (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>). Our modeling results support the perspective that natural forgetting is a form of adaptive learning that alters engram accessibility in response to environmental feedback. Accordingly, environmental, optogenetic, and pharmacological manipulations might change the learning rate, suggesting that miscalibrated learning rates could indeed give rise to pathological forgetting. In summary, this model provides a mechanistic interpretation of our own data, a parsimonious explanation for the dynamics of natural forgetting, and could inform future studies on pathological forgetting.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>For an organism to adapt to its environment, there must be processes by which learned information can be updated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). Thus forgetting, or the letting go of information when it is appropriate, may be a key characteristic underlying learning and memory. It is possible that forgetting may be an adaptive process that is driven by feedback from the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). This experience-dependent process could help an animal to prioritize relevant information in memory. Indeed, previous work has demonstrated that hippocampal engram cells can be differently modulated by experience. Here, we investigated the conditions in which a memory could be preserved, retrieved, or forgotten through changes in experience and learning. Altered memory recall was associated with corresponding changes in engram activation, indicating that altered memory engram expression is a reversible feature of natural forgetting. Under baseline conditions mice were able to recall an object memory 24 hour post-training but exhibited impaired recall after two weeks, indicating the initial memory was forgotten. The results demonstrated that engram activity correlated with the rate of forgetting. Moreover, these reactivated cells were shown to be a functional component of the initially encoded memory as the direct modulation of engram activity via optogenetic stimulation or inhibition either facilitated or prevented the recall of the object memory. These findings are in support of previous work which demonstrated hippocampal engram cells could be differently modulated by experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). These findings are also in agreement with the current literature which has shown that engram activation is associated with the level of memory recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). In addition, they also support a role for the hippocampus as a fundamental structure for object memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>).</p>
<p>It is important to consider that forgetting may also occur when an experience or an engram is not properly encoded during the learning phase, or not properly consolidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>). In the present study forgetting was also associated with a reduction in spine density relative to a 24 h recall timepoint. Where this spine density decreased over time. This observation suggests that the memory was properly consolidated one day post training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>). We also observed intact memory recall at 1 week post training, which further supports the idea that the initial object memory was indeed properly encoded and consolidated. Forgetting may encompass a broad spectrum of types of memory loss or apparent memory loss, some of which may involve the actual loss or damage of the engram, whilst others may reflect suppressed engram expression or simply altered conditions of engram expression.</p>
<p>Our data showing memory retrieval following optogenetic reactivation demonstrate that the forgotten engram is indeed still intact, otherwise activation of those cells would no longer trigger memory recall. Interestingly, previous work has shown that an engram remains intact even when memory consolidation is disrupted by protein synthesis inhibition or transgenic induction of Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>). In those studies, the engram persists in a latent state despite lower dendritic spine density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>). Optogenetic stimulation of amnesic engram cells was sufficient to restore access to the amnesic memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>). Therefore, the engram was intact, but was not properly retrieved due to the interrupted consolidation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous literature has shown the benefits of environmental enrichment in alleviating memory impairment in Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>). One potential mechanism by which enrichment or more generally, experience, may enhance memory is through the modification of memory engram activity. A key component of enriched environments is the increased perceptual and tactile feedback provided by extra toys, objects and running wheels, within the home-cage for the mice to interact with and explore. We hypothesized that experiencing objects during environmental enrichment that resemble the familiar objects from the memory test might nudge mice to infer a higher engram relevancy that is more robust against prediction errors leading to higher engram expression and subsequent memory recall. We showed that the rate of forgetting, and the level of engram activation could also be modulated through learned experience with enrichment, where memory recall was extended following environmental enrichment, up to 3 weeks post training. Furthermore, enrichment increased engram reactivation which facilitated the memory recall. This finding is supported by earlier work, which showed exposure to an enriched environment prior to learning improved engram reactivation and rescued memory recall in a mouse model of Fragile X syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>). The effects of environmental enrichment on learning and plasticity are well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>). We validated the effectiveness of the enrichment paradigm to enhance neural plasticity by measuring adult hippocampal neurogenesis. The contribution of adult born neurons to memory and cognition is an important topic within the memory and engram literature, but the specific contribution of these new neurons to the memory engram is not fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>). Our engram labelling strategy which utilized c-Fos-tTA transgenic mice combined with an AAV<sub>9</sub>-TRE-ChR2-eYFP virus did not capture immature neurons as the virus has a known tropism for mature neurons. Future work could utilize a different engram preparation, such as a genetic labelling strategy (TRAP2) or using a different immediate early gene promoter such as Arc to investigate the contribution of new-born neurons to the engram ensemble.</p>
<p>Our results showed that forgetting could be reversed following a brief reminder experience, which was associated with a corresponding increase in engram activity. Previous work from both human and rodent behavioral studies have shown that a brief exposure to reminder cues can aid memory recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). We further demonstrated that forgetting could be accelerated following repeated exposure to the training environment, therefore signaling the updated irrelevance of the object memory. This updating through experience was impaired when the original memory was inhibited. Our findings indicate that the degree of learning and memory specificity corresponded with engram activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>). The learning rate may therefore offer insight into the mechanism of forgetting. Here the learning rate was altered following environmental enrichment as well following repeated context exposure, which in turn affected the rate of forgetting. Together, this suggests the possibility of an ‘optimal’ learning rate that yields environmentally adaptive, natural forgetting and that learning rates that are too high may be linked to amnesia and learning rates that are too low to some sort of hypermnesia.</p>
<p>We proposed a parsimonious computational model that integrates our findings into a cognitively plausible framework in which memories more relevant for adaptive behavior are more likely to be accessible than memories representing irrelevant, outdated information. Our model formalizes forgetting as a learning mechanism in which perceptual feedback changes how accessible an engram is. As such, our modeling analyses suggest that the different experimental manipulations altered the learning rate determining how rapidly engrams switch from accessible to inaccessible states in response to environmental feedback, such as the presence or absence of objects. This model suggests that an emergent property underlying forgetting is the prediction error. Within this framework, forgetting is a form of learning that is a predictive process whereby experience drives changes in the learning rate of an organism and the expectation of one’s environment can alter the efficiency of recall through forgetting plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). It therefore follows that prediction errors may determine whether an engram is strengthened, leading to higher engram expression, or weakened, leading to lower engram expression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7b</xref>). Positive prediction errors indicate that an unexpected event has taken place (e.g., some unexpected object is present). We assume that positive errors induce plasticity processes that alter the engram and increase the likelihood of engram expression. In contrast, negative errors indicate that something that was expected has not taken place (e.g., object absent). Consequently, negative errors induce forgetting plasticity and yield decreased engram expression. Indeed, dopamine is known to play a role in prediction error and learning rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>). Moreover, dopamine has been shown to differently regulate Rac1 to modulate behavioral plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>). Here, we showed that the inhibition of Rac1 prevented forgetting, while its activation following memory encoding accelerated the rate of forgetting. This finding is in agreement with previous work where Rac1 impaired memory recall by driving forgetting-induced plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Rac1 has been shown to function during the memory encoding and consolidation phases, and thereby to contribute to active forgetting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Recently, Rac1 has also been shown to be involved in memory retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Lei et al., demonstrated that a social reward enabled latent engrams to switch to active engrams via suppression of Rac1 activity in CA1 neurons of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). It was further demonstrated that this effect was bidirectional as a social stressor switched latent memory engrams back to latent engrams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). This social stress-induced forgetting was modulated through the activation of Rac1 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Overall, the activation of Rac1 has further been shown to accelerate the rate of forgetting, while its inhibition prevented forgetting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Here, our work advanced this knowledge by demonstrating that Rac1-induced changes in memory recall alter engram reactivation. These works support our data suggesting that Rac1 is involved in altering the rate of forgetting at multiple time intervals after learning, not just immediately after learning. Our broader view is that Rac1 is likely a ubiquitous plasticity enabling molecule that is involved in memory encoding, consolidation, forgetting, and retrieval, depending on the experimental conditions and behavioral settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>).</p>
<p>Our model could be a starting point for more comprehensive models that account for forgetting across different experimental paradigms. Recent work suggests that retroactive interference emerges from the interplay of multiple engrams competing for accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Future models could explicitly incorporate multiple engrams and their competition, explaining a broader range of forgetting effects. Several approaches to modeling extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>), memory interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>), or the creation and updating of motor memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>) that more explicitly assumed multiple memory representations could inform such a generalized model of natural forgetting. Furthermore, future work could also include other variables in addition to predication errors to the model framework to better capture the dynamic conditions of memory recall.</p>
<p>Learning and memory allow humans and animals to maintain and update predictions about future outcomes. While having access to a large number of memories is adaptive in vast environments, it is equally important to prioritize the accessibility of the most relevant memories and to forget outdated information. Suppressing stored information through natural forgetting might therefore promote adaptive behavior. However, forgetting too much (e.g., amnesia) or too little (hypermnesia) under pathological conditions is maladaptive. Here, we utilized a mouse model of object memory and investigated the conditions in which a memory could be preserved, retrieved, or forgotten. Moreover, through pharmacological and behavioral interventions, we successfully prevented or accelerated forgetting. Based on these findings and our computational model in which memories subjectively less relevant to adaptive behavior are more likely to be forgotten we conclude that natural forgetting may be considered a form of adaptive learning where engrams that are subjectively less relevant for behavior are more likely to be forgotten.</p>

<p>All wild-type behavior was conducted with male C57BL/6J mice aged 7-12 weeks, bred in-house from Charles River breeding pairs. c-fos-tTA mice were generated in-house by breeding TetTag mice with C57BL/6J mice and selecting offspring carrying the c-fos-tTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). All mice used for the experiments were male between 8–12 weeks old at the time of surgery and had been raised on food containing 40 mg kg-1 doxycycline for at least five days prior to surgery. c-fos-tTA mice remained on doxycycline food for the duration of the experiments. Doxycycline was removed from the diet for 36 hours prior to object acquisition to allow for engram labelling, following completion of the object acquisition period c-fos-tTA mice were placed back on the doxycycline diet.</p>
<p>All mice were grouped housed in standard housing conditions, with temperature 22 ± 1°C, relative humidity 50% and a 12:12 hour light-dark cycle (lights on 0730h) and had ad libitum access to food and water. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the European Directive 2010/63/EU and under an authorization issued by the Health Products Regulatory Authority Ireland and approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Trinity College Dublin</p>

For engram labeling and activation studies (AAV<sub>9</sub>-TRE-ChR2-eYFP) or inhibition studies (AAV<sub>9</sub>-TRE-ArchT-GFP) (Volume; 300nl) virus was injected bilaterally into the DG using the coordinates AP: −2 mm, ML: ± 1.35 mm, DV: −2 mm relative to Bregma at a rate of 60nL/min. Followed by a 10 min diffusion period. For optogenetic experiments, a Doric optical fiber (200 μm core diameter; Doric Lenses) was implanted above the injection site (–2 mm AP; ± 1.35 mm ML; –1.85 mm DV). A layer of adhesive cement (C&amp;B Metabond) was applied followed by dental cement to secure the optic fiber implant to the skull. Mice were given 1.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> meloxicam as analgesic.

<title>Object Recognition</title>
<p>The novel object recognition task was as based on the protocol previously described by Bevins and Besheer (2006). Mice were first habituated to the testing arena (30cm L x 20cm W x 30cm H) for a 10-minute exploration period on two consecutive days. On day three, two identical objects were positioned on adjacent sides of the arena and each animal was introduced for a 10-minute exploration period. Mice were then placed directly back into their home cages. After a 24-hour or two-week inter-trial interval, one familiar object was replaced with a novel object, and each animal was introduced for a five-minute exploration period. Objects and locations were counterbalanced across groups. Object exploration was defined when the animal’s nose came in contact with the object. The testing arena and objects were cleaned with a disinfectant, TriGene, between each animal and training session. Video recordings were made to allow for manual scoring of object exploration. The object discrimination index was calculated as the time spent exploring the novel object minus the time spent exploring the familiar object divided by the total time spent exploring both objects (novel – familiar / novel + familiar).</p>

Coronal sections were immunostained for eYFP and c-Fos. Non-specific antibody binding was blocked using 10% normal goat serum (NGS) in a solution of PBS with 0.2% Triton–X100 and tissue sections were incubated with goat anti-eYFP (Anti-GFP chicken IgY fraction 1:1000, Invitrogen) and anti-c-Fos (Anti-c-Fos rabbit, 1:500, Synaptic System). Sections were then incubated in the appropriate AlexaFluor secondary antibody (AF488 for eYFP and AF596 for c-Fos) and then with Dapi (1:1000; Sigma) to stain nuclei. Lastly, sections were washed, mounted, and coverslipped with anti-fade mounting media (Vectashield-DAPI).

<title>Morphological Analysis</title>
<p>To obtain engram dendritic spine density, the dentate gyrus was imaged using the Leica SP8 gated STED confocal microscope and images were collected with the Leica Application Suite X (LasX) software. Z-stacks were taken bidirectional under a 40x lens. Dendritic spine analysis was carried out using the Imaris software (Oxford Instruments, Imaris v9.5). The dendrites of eYFP-positive cells were traced using a semiautomated neurofilament tracer tool and dendritic spines were individually highlighted and manually traced with the software. The image processing feature of Imaris was used to apply the Gaussian and Median filters to Z-stack images to remove background eYFP staining and allow for better resolution and visualisation of dendritic fragments and associated spines. Following the labelling of spines on traced dendritic fragments, parameters for spine volume, spine head volume and dendritic spine density (/10µm) were collected.</p>

<title>Computational Modelling</title>
<p>We used an error-driven learning rule inspired by the Rescorla-Wagner model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). The model offers a mechanistic explanation for the key behavioral results of our experiments (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). In line with the idea of the Rescorla-Wagner model that learning is an error-driven updating process, the model computes the relevancy of an engram <italic>e</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> on each day <italic>t</italic> of the experiment. The engram relevancy is updated as a function of the prediction error (<italic>o</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>– <italic>e</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>; where <italic>o</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> denotes the object observation). The degree to which the prediction error changes the computed engram relevancy is determined by the learning rate <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>. To update the engram relevancy, the model relies on a two-speeded mechanism through which the relevancy quickly increases when an object is present (higher learning rate) and slowly decays when the object is absent (lower learning rate). In particular, the appearance of an object yields a positive prediction error and triggers the fast-updating process, while the absence of an object is associated with negative prediction errors and slow decay in the engram relevancy.</p>
<p>Depending on the time between the acquisition phase and the retrieval test, the model predicts different levels of memory performance, where a longer time interval between acquisition and test is associated with less object recognition.</p>

<title>Learning Model</title>
<p>To formalize the learning and memory processes of mice in the object-based memory task, we developed a simple reinforcement learning model. Here,
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>e</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> ∈ [0,1] denotes relevancy of an engram, which is updated on each trial. Higher values indicate higher object relevancy.</p></list-item>
</list>
The key assumption of the model is that once engrams are formed, they endure but might be inaccessible when they cannot be reactivated following natural forgetting. The expressibility of the engram depends on the inferred relevancy of the respective object, where objects that are subjectively more likely to be encountered in the current environment (higher relevancy), are more easily accessible. The inferred relevancy of the (familiar) acquisition object <italic>x</italic> = 1 governing the accessibility of the engram was computed according to the delta rule
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="537013v2_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>e</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> denotes the relevancy of the engram, <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> the learning rate, and <italic>o</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> − <italic>e</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> =: <italic>δ</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> the prediction error. For clarity, we omit the dependency on <italic>x</italic> here. Moreover, we used separate learning rates for positive and negative prediction errors
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="537013v2_eqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
That is, positive prediction errors indicating the presence of an object lead to a rapid increase in the relevancy of the engram. Negative prediction errors indicating the absence of an object lead to a slower decrease in the relevancy (when <italic>α</italic><sup>−</sup> &lt; 1).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4n">
<title>Exploration model</title>
<p>To translate the modeled engram relevancy into exploration behavior, we used the softmax and beta functions. The softmax function was used to compute the average exploration probability for the familiar object
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="537013v2_eqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where the inverse-temperature parameter <italic>β</italic> determines the slope of the function. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="537013v2_inline3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> denotes the engram relevancy of the familiar object that is dynamically updated according to the delta rule (<xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">eq. 1</xref>). <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="537013v2_inline4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> corresponds to the relevancy of the novel object, where, since the object has not been experienced before, we assume an engram relevancy of 0. Subsequently, we utilized the beta distribution to model exploration variability across individuals. The beta distribution for <italic>μ</italic> ∈ [0,1] is defined by
<disp-formula id="eqn4">
<graphic xlink:href="537013v2_eqn4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
with the shape parameters <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic>. In order to compute the distribution over exploration probability conditional on the mean <italic>μ</italic>, we exploited that the sum of <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> indicates the concentration <italic>κ</italic> of the distribution. That is, when <italic>κ</italic> = <italic>a</italic> + <italic>b</italic> gets larger, the beta distribution is more concentrated, and the predicted exploration variability is lower. When <italic>κ</italic> is lower, the distribution is wider and the model predicts greater exploration variability (for more details, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>)).</p>
<p>Therefore, to compute the exploration probabilities for object <italic>x</italic> = 1 using the beta distribution conditional on the computed average exploration probability <italic>μ</italic> and concentration <italic>κ</italic>, we computed the shape parameters <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> in the following way:

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
O'Leary and colleagues present data identifying several procedures that alter discrimination between novel and familiar objects, including time, environmental enrichment, Rac-1, context reexposure, and brief reminders of the familiar object. This is complimented with an engram approach to quantify cells that are active during learning to examine how their activation is impacted following each of the above procedures at test. With this behavioral data, authors apply a modeling approach to understand the factors that contribute to good and poor object memory recall.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
• Authors systematically test several factors that contribute to poor discrimination between novel and familiar objects. These results are extremely interesting and outline essential boundaries of incidental, nonaversive memory.</p>
<p>
• These results are further supported by engram-focused approaches to examine engram cells that are reactivated in states with poor and good object recognition recall.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
• For the environmental enrichment, authors seem to suggest objects in the homecage are similar to (or reminiscent of) the familiar object. Thus, the effect of improved memory may not be related to enrichment per se as much as it may be related to the preservation of an object's memory through multiple retrievals, not the enriching experiences of the environment itself. This would be consistent with the brief retrieval figure. Authors should include a more thorough discussion of this.</p>
<p>• Authors should justify the marginally increased number of engram cells in the non-enrichment group that did not show object discrimination at test, especially relative to other figures. More specific cell counting criteria may be helpful for this. For example, was the DG region counted for engram and cfos cells or only a subsection?</p>
<p>• It is unclear why the authors chose a reactivation time point of 1hr prior to testing. While this may be outside of the effective time window for pharmacological interference with reconsolidation for most compounds, it is not necessarily outside of the structural and functional neuronal changes accompanied by reconsolidation-related manipulations.</p>
<p>• Figure 5: Levels of exploration at test are inconsistent between manipulations. This is problematic, as context-only reexposures seem to increase exploration for objects overall in a manner that I'm unsure resembles 'forgetting'. Instead, cross-group comparisons would likely reveal increased exploration time for familiar and novel objects. While I understand 'forgetting' may be accompanied by greater exploration towards objects, this is inconsistent across and within the same figure. Further, this effect is within the period of time that rodents should show intact recognition. Instead, context-only exposures may form a competing (empty context) memory for the familiar object in that particular context.</p>
<p>• I am concerned at the interpretation that a memory is 'forgotten' across figures, especially considering the brief reminder experiments. Typically, if a reminder session can trigger the original memory or there is rapid reacquisition, then this implies there is some savings for the original content of the memory. For instance, multiple context retrievals in the absence of an object reminder may be more consistent with procedures that create a distinct memory and subsequently recruit a distinct engram.</p>
<p>• Authors state that spine density decreases over time. While that may be generally true, there is no evidence that mature mushroom spines are altered or that this is consistent across figures. Additionally, it's unclear if spine volume is consistently reduced in reactivated and non-reactivated engram cells across groups. This would provide evidence that there is a functionally distinct aspect of engram cells that is altered consistently in procedures resulting in poor recognition memory (e.g. increased spine density relative to spine density of non-reactivated engram cells and non-engram cells)</p>
<p>• Authors should discuss how the enrichment-neurogenesis results here are compatible with other neurogenesis work that supports forgetting.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The manuscript examines an important question about how an inaccessible, natural forgotten memory can be retrieved through engram ensemble reactivation. It uses a variety of strategies including optogenetics, behavioral and pharmacological interventions to modulate engram accessibility. The data characterize the time course of natural forgetting using an object recognition task, in which animals can retrieve 1 day and 1 week after learning, but not 2 weeks later. Forgetting is correlated with lower levels of cell reactivation (c-fos expression during learning compared to retrieval) and reduction in spine density and volume in the engram cells. Artificial activation of the original engram was sufficient to induce recall of the forgotten object memory while artificial inhibition of the engram cells precluded memory retrieval. Mice housed in an enriched environment had a slower rate of forgetting, and a brief reminder before the retrieval session promoted retrieval of a forgotten memory. Repeated reintroduction to the training context in the absence of objects accelerated forgetting. Additionally, activation of Rac1-mediated plasticity mechanisms enhanced forgetting, while its inhibition prolonged memory retrieval. The authors also reproduce the behavioral findings using a computational model inspired by Rescorla-Wagner model. In essence, the model proposes that forgetting is a form of adaptive learning that can be updated based on prediction error rules in which engram relevancy is altered in response to environmental feedback.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>1. The data presented in the current paper are consistent with the authors claim that seemingly forgotten engrams sometimes remain accessible. This suggests that retrieval deficits can lead to memory impairments rather than a loss of the original engram (at least in some cases).</p>
<p>2. The experimental procedures and statistics are appropriate, and the behavioral effects appear to be very robust. Several key effects are replicated multiple times in the manuscript.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. My major issue with the paper is the forgetting model proposed in Figure 7. Prior work has shown that neutral stimuli become associated in a manner similar to conditioned and unconditioned stimuli. As a result, the Rescorla-Wagner model can be used to describe this learning (Todd &amp; Homes, 2022). In the current experiments, the neutral context will become associated with the unpredicted objects during training (due to a positive prediction error). Consequently, the context will activate a memory for the objects during the test, which should facilitate performance. Conversely, any manipulation that degrades the association between the context and object should disrupt performance. An example of this can be found in Figure 5A. Exposing the mice to the context in the absence of the objects should violate their expectations and create a negative prediction error. According to the Rescorla-Wagner model, this error will create an inhibitory association between the context and the objects, which should make it harder for the former to activate a memory of the latter (Rescorla &amp; Wagner, 1972). As a result, performance should be impaired, and this is what the authors find. However, if the cells encoding the context and objects were inhibited during the context-alone sessions (Figure 5D) then no prediction error should occur, and inhibitory associations would not be formed. As a result, performance should be intact, which is what the authors observe.</p>
<p>What about forgetting of the objects that occurs over time? Bouton and others have demonstrated that retrieval failure is often due to contextual changes that occur with the passage of time (Bouton, 1993; Rosas &amp; Bouton, 1997, Bouton, Nelson &amp; Rosas, 1999). That is, both internal (e.g. state of the animal) and external (e.g. testing room, chambers, experimenter) contextual cues change over time. This shift makes it difficult for the context to activate memories with which it was once associated (in the current paper, objects). To overcome this deficit, one can simply re-expose animals to the original context, which facilitates memory retrieval (Bouton, 1993). In Figure 2D, the authors do something similar. They activate the engram cells encoding the original context and objects, which enhances retrieval.</p>
<p>Therefore, the forgetting effects presented in the current paper can be explained by changes in the context and the associations it has formed with the objects (excitatory or inhibitory). The results are perfectly predicted by the Rescorla-Wagner model and the context-change findings of Bouton and others. As a result, the authors do not need to propose the existence of a new &quot;forgetting&quot; variable that is driven by negative prediction errors. This does not add anything novel to the paper as it is not necessary to explain the data (Figures 7 and 8).</p>
<p>1. I also have an issue with the conclusions drawn from the enriched environment experiment (Figure 3). The authors hypothesize that this manipulation alleviates forgetting because &quot;Experiencing extra toys and objects during environmental enrichment that are reminiscent of the previously learned familiar object might help maintain or nudge mice to infer a higher engram relevancy that is more robust against forgetting.&quot;. This statement is completely speculative. A much simpler explanation (based on the existing literature) is that enrichment enhances synaptic plasticity, spine growth, etc., which in turn reduces forgetting. If the authors want to make their claim, then they need to test it experimentally. For example, the enriched environment could be filled with objects that are similar or dissimilar to those used in the memory experiments. If their hypothesis is correct, only the similar condition should prevent forgetting.</p>
<p>2. It is well-known that updating can both weaken or strengthen memory. The authors suggest that memory is updated when animals are exposed to the context in the absence of the objects. If the engram is artificially inhibited (opto) during context-only re-exposures, memory cannot be updated. To further support this updating idea, it would be good to run experiments that investigate whether multiple short re-exposures to the training context (in the presence of the objects or during optogenetic activation of the engram) could prevent forgetting. It would also be good to know the levels of neuronal reactivation during multiple re-exposures to the context in the absence versus context in the presence of the objects.</p>
<p>3. There are a number of studies that show boundary conditions for memory destabilization/reconsolidation. Is there any evidence that similar boundary conditions exist to make an inaccessible engram accessible?</p>
<p>4. More details about how the quantification of immunohistochemistry (c-fos, BrdU, DAPI) was performed should be provided (which software and parameters were used to consider a fos positive neurons, for example).</p>
<p>5. Duration of the enrichment environment was not detailed.</p>

<p>Summary: The manuscript by Ryan and colleagues uses a well-established object recognition task to examine memory retrieval and forgetting. They show that memory retrieval requires activation of the acquisition engram in the dentate gyrus and failure to do so leads to forgetting. Using a variety of clever behavioural methods, the authors show that memories can be maintained and retrieval slowed when animals are reared in environmental enrichment and that normally retrieved memories can be forgotten if exposed to the environment in which the expected objects are no longer presented. Using a series of neural methods, the authors also show that activation or inhibition of the acquisition engram is key to memory expression and that forgetting is due to Rac1.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This is an exemplary examination of different conditions that affect successful retrieval vs forgetting of object memory. Furthermore, the computational modelling that captures in a formal way how certain parameters may influence memory provides an important and testable approach to understanding forgetting.</p>
<p>
The use of the Rescorla-Wagner model in the context of object recognition and the idea of relevance being captured in negative prediction error are novel (but see below).</p>
<p>
The use of gain and loss of function approaches are a considerable strength and the dissociable effects on behaviour eliminate the possibility of extraneous variables such as light artifacts as potential explanations for the effects.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Knowing what process (object retrieval vs familiarity) governed the behavioural effect in the present investigation would have been of even greater significance.</p>
<p>The impact of the paper is somewhat limited by the use of only one sex.</p>
<p>While relevance is an interesting concept that has been operationalized in the paper, it is unclear how distinct it is from extinction. Specifically, in the case where the animals are exposed to the context in the absence of the object, the paper currently expresses this as a process of relevance - the objects are no longer relevant in that context. Another way to think about this is in terms of extinction - the association between the context and the objects is reduced results in a disrupted ability of the context to activate the object engram.</p>
