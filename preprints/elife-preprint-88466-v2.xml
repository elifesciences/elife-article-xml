<title>Abstract</title><p>The Wnt/Wg pathway controls myriads of biological phenomena throughout the development and adult life of all organisms across the phyla. Thus, an aberrant Wnt signaling is associated with a wide range of pathologies in humans. Tight regulation of Wnt/Wg signaling is required to maintain proper cellular homeostasis. Here we report a novel role of E3 ubiquitin ligase Deltex in Wg signaling regulation. <italic>Drosophila dx</italic> genetically interacts with <italic>wg a</italic>nd its pathway components. Further, Dx LOF results in a reduced spreading of Wg while its over-expression expands the diffusion gradient of the morphogen. We attribute this change in Wg gradient to the endocytosis of Wg through Dx which directly affects the short and long-range Wg targets. We also demonstrate the role of Dx in regulating Wg effector Armadillo where Dx down-regulates Arm through proteasomal degradation. We also showed the conservation of Dx function in the mammalian system where DTX1 is shown to bind with β-catenin and facilitates its proteolytic degradation, spotlighting a novel step that potentially modulates Wnt/Wg signaling cascade.</p>

<label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Morphogens play a key role in cell fate determination in a concentration-dependent manner, and their functions are indispensable to tissue patterning during development. These molecules elicit long-range signaling by forming a concentration gradient and cells differentiate based on these positional cues. The roles of morphogens such as Wingless (Wg), Hedgehog (Hh), and Decapentaplegic (Dpp) during the development of <italic>Drosophila</italic> appendages have been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cadigan and Nusse, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lecuit et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Nellen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Tabata, 2001</xref>)</p>
<p>Wg signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway and has multiple roles in the regulation of a variety of developmental processes, including cell-fate specification, cell proliferation, cell survival, and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cadigan and Waterman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Logan and Nusse, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">MacDonald et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Valenta et al., 2012</xref>). Any aberration in the expression of candidates in the Wg signaling cascade often leads to human diseases including cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Clevers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Coombs et al., 2008</xref>)</p>
<p>In the developing wing disc, Wg is secreted from the Dorsal-Ventral (D/V) boundary, and a gradient of Wg is formed to elicit long-range Wg signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baena-Lopez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Diaz-Benjumea and Cohen, 1995</xref>). Secreted Wg, consecutively induces the expression of its target Senseless (Sens) and Distal-less (Dll). High threshold Wg target gene <italic>senseless</italic> is responsible for the formation of margin sensory bristles of adult wings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Couso et al., 1994</xref>), whereas the low threshold Wg target gene <italic>distal-less</italic> is required for proper wing growth and is expressed in a graded manner, declining towards the edges of the wing pouch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Couso et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Neumann and Cohen, 1997</xref>). Wg also induces the expression of Cut by activating Notch in the D/V boundary(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bray, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Wg exercises its effect by regulating the transcription of the target genes in the responding cells. Armadillo (vertebrate homolog β-catenin) plays a pivotal role in the transduction of Wg signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dierick and Bejsovec, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Städeli et al., 2006</xref>). In the absence of the Wg ligand, a protein complex comprising of APC (Adenomatous polyposis coli), Axin, GSK3-β (Shaggy), and Casein Kinase-I (Cki) mediates Armadillo (Arm) phosphorylation, and ubiquitination, followed byits degradation via the proteasome pathway. On the contrary, binding of the ligand Wg to its receptor Frizzled (Fz), at the cell surface, initiates a signaling cascade that inhibits the function of the destruction complex via adaptor protein Dishevelled (Dsh), leading to the stabilization of Arm. Arm then translocates to the nucleus thereby activating the transcription of the downstream target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Mosimann et al., 2009</xref>). In canonical Wg signaling, Arm plays a dual role. The cytosolic Arm, as mentioned, is used for the transduction of the Wg signals,whereas the Arm localized at the adherens junctions (AJs) together with α-catenin and cadherin homologs is required for cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Peifer et al., 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>We have earlier reported that <italic>deltex (dx),</italic> a known Notch signaling regulator, modulates Decapentaplegic morphogen gradient formation and affects Dpp signaling in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sharma et al., 2022</xref>). Here, in the present study, we report that <italic>deltex</italic> genetically interacts with the genes that encode Wg pathway components during wing development. Immuno-cytochemical analysis revealed that Dx facilitates the spreading of the morphogen, thereby directly affecting the expressionof the short and long-range target genes, Senseless and Vestigial. This change in the Wg gradient is attributed to the role of Dx in Wg trafficking. Here we speculate that Dx, like in the case of Dpp and Notch, aids in the vesicular trafficking of Wg to facilitate its gradient formation. Further, Dx was also seen to reduce the expression of the Wg effector Arm through proteasomal degradation. We also investigate the conservation of Dx function in β-catenin stability and degradation in cultured human cells. Here we show that human DTX1 binds with β-catenin and facilitates its degradation. This study thus presents a whole new avenue of Dx function in the regulation of Wg signaling.</p>

<label>2.1.</label><title><italic>dx</italic> genetically interacts with Wg pathway components</title>
<p>Wg controls the growth and patterning of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing and aberrant Wg signaling interferes with normal wing development. In order to ascertain the role of <italic>dx</italic> in Wg signaling, first, we tried to check if <italic>dx</italic> genetically interacts with <italic>wg</italic> alleles. It is interesting to note that both the wg loss-of-function alleles tested (<italic>wg<sup>CX3</sup>,</italic> and <italic>wg<sup>CX4</sup></italic>) showed lethality in homozygous condition; however, in heterozygous condition, they do not exhibit any phenotype (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>.B1, C1). The two mutant alleles of <italic>dx</italic> (a null allele <italic>dx<sup>152</sup></italic>and a loss-of-function allele <italic>dx)</italic> show wing vein thickening phenotype in hemizygous condition, however, <italic>dx<sup>152</sup></italic> and <italic>dx</italic> heterozygote female flies exhibit normal wings. When the loss-of-function allele of <italic>wg</italic> (<italic>wg<sup>CX3</sup></italic> and <italic>wg<sup>CX4</sup></italic>) was brought in heterozygous condition with either <italic>dx<sup>152</sup></italic> or <italic>dx</italic> mutant alleles, they showed wings that were indistinguishable from the wild type (data not shown). However, when the dosage of <italic>wg</italic> was reduced in <italic>dx<sup>152</sup></italic> and <italic>dx</italic> mutant alleles in the hemizygous background, an increased wing vein thickening phenotype was observed which is indicative of an enhanced phenotype relative to controls (n=100). Moreover, an appreciable number of flies show notching in the wing margin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>.B1-C3), suggesting that a complete absence of <italic>dx</italic> creates a sensitized background, which is more responsive to a lower dosage of <italic>wg</italic> during wing development. Further, the expression of Cut, a downstream target of Wg signaling activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Katanaev et al., 2008</xref>) at the D/V boundary of the wing disc, was found to be reduced in wing discs from these larvae. Third instar larval wing discs displayed an interrupted Cut expression at the intersection of anterior-posterior (A/P) and dorsal-ventral (D/V) boundary from individuals carrying heterozygous <italic>wg</italic> loss-of-function allele in <italic>dx</italic> hemizygous null background (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>.H1-H4). These results clearly indicate that <italic>dx</italic> may play a role in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Wg signaling activity.</p>

<p>Further, we tried to elucidate if the receptor of <italic>wg</italic>, <italic>frizzled</italic> (<italic>fz</italic>), does exhibit any interaction with <italic>dx</italic>. When the hypomorphic allele of <italic>fz</italic> (<italic>fz<sup>1</sup></italic>), was brought in heterozygous condition with <italic>dx<sup>152</sup></italic> null, the male flies displayed wing notching phenotype in addition to wingvein thickening (n=100) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>.D1-E3). <italic>senseless</italic> (<italic>sens</italic>), a short-range target of Wg signaling also displayed a strong genetic interaction with <italic>dx</italic>. A loss-of-function allele of <italic>sens (sens<sup>E58</sup></italic>) is recessive lethal in homozygous condition; however, in heterozygous condition, they do not display any phenotype. On the contrary, on reducing the dosage of <italic>sens</italic> in <italic>dx</italic> null and <italic>dx</italic> loss-of-function allele in hemizygous condition, an enhanced wing phenotype with marked serration in the wing margin was observed (n=100) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>1-F3). These results displayed a strong genetic interaction between <italic>dx</italic> and Wg pathway components, suggesting that Dx may have functional implications in <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing development.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<label>2.2.</label><title>Loss of <italic>dx</italic> reduces Wg signaling</title>
<p>To better understand the role of <italic>dx</italic> in Wg signaling regulation, we studied the expression of Wg and its target genes in <italic>dx</italic> null wing discs. It was found that in <italic>dx</italic> null third instar larval wing discs, the gradient of Wg at the D/V boundary was shortened. High-magnification pictures revealed a significant decrease in the amount of Wg emanating from the Wg-producing cells at the D/V boundary (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>.A2). Thus, Dx is required for the proper Wg gradient formation, as the range of Wg expression and the number of Wg puncta was significantly reduced in <italic>dx</italic> null condition. Similar interruption in Wg gradient was also observed by Hori et al, where <italic>dx<sup>24</sup></italic>allele showed a reduction in Wg expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hori et al., 2004</xref>), however, the study focuses on the indispensable role of <italic>dx</italic> in Notch signaling.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="543920v2_fig2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>We also analyzed the expression of Wg target genes in <italic>dx</italic> null discs. The domain of Vestigial, the long-range target of Wg was found to be significantly broadened in <italic>dx</italic> null discs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>.C2). This is in contrast to the reported partial suppression of Vg expression in <italic>ptc-GAL4</italic> expressed Dx dominant negative discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hori et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, in another set of experiments, we found that the expression of the short-range target Sens showed slight deformity in the expression pattern with a constricted expression at the D/V boundary (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>.B2).</p>
<p>Expression of the short-range target such as Sens needs a higher threshold of Wg morphogen gradient than the long-range target like Vestigial which often requires a less concentrated Wg gradient. Thus, our results show that a proper Wg gradient is not formed in the absence of Dx, and this supports that Dx may have a profound role in regulating Wg signaling through its gradient formation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<label>2.3.</label><title>Dx regulates Wg signaling</title>
<p>Based on the loss-of-function genetic interaction studies between <italic>dx</italic> and <italic>wg</italic> mutant alleles that suggest the role of Dx in Wg signaling, we further tried to investigate the gain-of-function effect of Dx on Wg signaling activity. For this, <italic>UAS-GAL4</italic> binary system was exploited. We over-expressed FLAG-tagged <italic>UAS-Dx,</italic> with <italic>engrailed-GAL4(en-GAL4)</italic> driver strain, that drives the expression of the transgene in the posterior compartment of the wing imaginal disc, and inturn in the adult wing. Over-expression of <italic>Dx</italic> with <italic>en-GAL4</italic> shows pupal lethality at 25°C, however, at 18°C, the flies emerge with massive morphological defects. The wing displayed blisters along with vein loss (Supplementary Fig. 1.A2). Besides, Dx over-expression with <italic>apterous-GAL4 (ap-GAL4)</italic> also resulted in abnormal wings that failed to appose properly and show large blisters (Supplementary Fig. 1.A3), and since Wg signaling modulates the expression of cell adhesion molecules in <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing imaginal disc cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bienz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wodarz et al., 2006</xref>) such phenotypes are often associated with impaired Wg signaling.</p>
<p>To check if Dx is involved in Wg pathway regulation in other developmental contexts, we over-expressed Dx in the primordia of the dorsal thorax using <italic>ap-GAL4</italic> and <italic>pnr-GAL4</italic>. Dx over-expression in the thorax leads to reduced and disoriented macrochaetae and reduction in scutellar bristles (Supplementary Fig. 1.B2-B3). A reduced tarsal segment along the proximodistal axis and dorsoventral shift of the sex combs was observed when Dx was over-expressed with <italic>distal-less-GAL4 (dll-GAL4)</italic> in the leg (Supplementary Fig. 1.C2). All these phenotypes are characteristics of reduced Wg signaling as also shown earlier for ectopic expression of another gene required for epithelial planar polarity (EPP), <italic>nemo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zeng and Verheyen, 2004</xref>). Dx shows a similar phenotype when overexpressed in flies suggesting that like <italic>nemo</italic>, Dx may antagonize the Wg signaling activity.</p>
<p>To further test whether Dx affects the Wg signaling output we tried to analyze the expression of the Wg target genes in the wing imaginal discs of the third instar larvae. Wg activates the expression of the proneural gene <italic>senseless (sens)</italic> in the sensory organ precursor, which later develops into bristles of the adult wing margin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Blair, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Couso et al., 1994</xref>). The expression of Senseless, a canonical target normally activated by high Wg levels in two discrete stripes at the D/V boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Nolo et al., 2000</xref>) was found to be significantly reduced in the posterior compartment where Dx was over-expressed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>.A2). It is known that Wg can also indirectly induce the expression of Cut. A positive feedback loop between Wg expressing cells along the D/V boundary and Serrate and Delta expressing cells in adjacent cells maintains the Notch signaling activity along the D/V boundary, which consecutively induces the expression of Cut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bray, 1997</xref>). Similar to Sens, we found that the expression of Cut was also drastically abolished upon Dx over-expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>.B2). Moreover, to the contrary, the expression of Vestigial (Vg), which is activated in response to low ligand concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Neumann and Cohen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Zecca et al., 1996</xref>) was found to be expanded in the posterior domain of the wing imaginal disc (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>.C2), indicating that Dx reduces the Wg gradient. These results strongly suggest that Dx modulates Wg signaling output.</p>

<p>Also, in our earlier reports, we demonstrated the role of Dx in inflicting apoptosis. Dx synergizes with JNK ligand Eiger and triggers caspase-dependent cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Dutta et al., 2018</xref>). Similarsynergistic action of Dx was also reported with TRAF6 where the association triggers JNK activation in an Eiger independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Sharma et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, we tried to dissect if the loss of these markers (Sens and Cut) is due to cell death. We inhibited apoptosis with caspase inhibitor protein p35 in Dx over-expression background and no rescue in the level of Sens and Cut expression was observed in the posterior compartment of the wing disc (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>.D1-E4)suggesting the loss of Sens and Cut is independent of cell death.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning here that similar to our findings, the expression of Sens was found to be down-regulated when Reggie-1, a component of the membrane micro-domainwas up-regulated. The reduction in Sens and Cut expression, in their studies, was attributed to an enhanced spreading of the morphogen, Wg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Katanaev et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Drosophila</italic> Dx interacts with the ankyrin-rich repeats of the Notch intracellular domain and regulates Notch signaling positively(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Matsuno et al., 1995</xref>). Moreover, negative regulation of Dx in association with non-visual β-arrestin, Kurtz was reported earlier, where polyubiquitination mediated degradation of Notch by Dx was attributed to this loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Mukherjee et al., 2005</xref>). A similar reduction of Notch and its targets was reported lately when Dx synergistically interacts with TRAF6, and Hrp48 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dutta et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Mishra et al., 2014</xref>). Human Deltex (DTX1) was also shown to regulate NOTCH1/HES1 signaling negatively in osteosarcoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). It was reported earlier that in D/V boundary of the wing disc, the regulation of Wg is Notch-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Neumann and Cohen, 1996</xref>), we tried to elucidate if the regulation of Wg via Dxis through Notch. Thus, we examined the status of Deadpan (Dpn) and NRE (Notch response element), a direct target of Notch(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Zacharioudaki and Bray, 2014</xref>). In contrast to reduced levels of Sens and Cut, the expression of Dpn was found to remain unaltered in Dx over-expressed conditions (Supplementary Fig. 2. A1-A4), suggesting that Dx can possibly regulate the two signaling cascades, viz. Notch and Wg independent of each other. Further, we also checked the status of the Notch response element (NRE-GFP) in Dx over-expression background and found a punctate NRE expression in the posterior domain (Supplementary Figure 2. B1-B4). The role of Dx in Notch regulation is evident however if Dx regulates Wg through Notch or if the two events are independent is still a crucial aspect to investigate. Our results however indicate an independent role of Dx in Wg signaling regulation. We however do not rule out the alternate possibility of Wg regulation through Dx via Notch.</p>

<label>2.4.</label><title>Over-expression of Dx expands the Wg diffusion gradient</title>
<p>In the third instar wild-type wing discs, Wg is secreted from the producing cells at the D/V boundary, which diffuses on either side to form a concentration gradient. Over-expression of Dx, by the A/P boundary-specific <italic>ptc-GAL4</italic>, results in an erosion of the Wg gradient (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>.A2 and B2). Wg expression can be visualized as spreading far into the disc from the site of production. A high magnification picture further revealed far-spreading punctate Wg expression more significantly in the ventral compartment. It is interesting to note that the number of Wg puncta and their apparent size is also significantly increased when Dx was over-expressed using <italic>ptc-GAL4</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>.B2, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hori et al.,2004</xref>).

</fig>
<p>We also observed a significant increase in the extracellular Wg expression upon Dx overexpression further corroborating our initial results (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>.D2). Earlier it was shown that Swim (Secreted Wg interacting molecule) promotes long-range Wg signaling by maintaining Wg solubility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Mulligan et al., 2012</xref>). The report postulates that Swim reduction results in an increase in extracellular Wg which consequently increases the expression of long range Wg target, Dll (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Mulligan et al., 2012</xref>).We have observed a very similar situation with another long range Wg target, Vg in increased Dx expression condition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>.C2). Here we do not rule out the possibility that Dx potentially aids in Wg mobilization from the adherens junction. Several models from studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic epidermis and wing disc have been put forward to explain Wg movement across the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cadigan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tabata and Takei, 2004</xref>). Our result indicates that Dx facilitates Wg spreading which flattens its gradient. This, in turn, results in the reduction of the short-range Wg targets (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>.A1-A3), which often require high levels of Wg. On the contrary, the long-range Wg target showed an expansion in their expression domain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>.C1-C3), suggesting that Dx affects the Wg gradient formation.</p>

<label>2.5.</label><title>Dx-mediated Wg signaling is regulated by endocytosis</title>
<p>Extensive evidence suggests that signaling and endocytosis are intricately linked. Classically, endocytosis has been thought to reduce the number of accessible receptors, either through its sequestration in the endosomal vesicles or degradation in lysosomes, which consecutively downregulates the signaling. However, some reports support the notion that endocytosis can also positively regulate the signaling cascade, its initiation, and propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hupalowska and Miaczynska, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Seto and Bellen, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Different mechanisms have been suggested for the role of endocytosis in various signaling cascades. Notch is continuously internalized into early endosomes and followed by its internalization, Notch is sorted to other endocytic compartments including multivesicular bodies/late endosomes, and lysosomes, or recycling endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Fortini and Bilder, 2009</xref>). Thus, this step helps to maintain a quantitative as well as a qualitative pool of Notch. Once endocytosed, Notch follows a vesicular trafficking pathway that determines its final fate. In the canonical pathway, Notch gets internalized after binding to its ligand. However, during the non-canonical pathway, Notch can be internalized in the absence of ligand interaction. Once internalized, the Notch protein faces almost the same pathway that begins with its incorporation into the early endosomal vesicles. From here, it is either recycled back to the cell membrane, or it becomes a part of late endosomal vesicles/mature endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Fortini and Bilder, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Vaccari et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Wilkin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Yamada et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In Notch trafficking and endocytosis, Dx plays a key role. Dx facilitates the trafficking of Notch receptors from the cell membrane into the early and then to the late endosomal vesicles in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hori et al., 2004</xref>). It was observed that Dx, directly or indirectly, increased the half-life of these accumulated Notch proteins in the endosomal vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hori et al., 2004</xref>). If the transport of Notch into the late endosome was blocked, it hampered Dx-mediated Notch signal activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hori et al., 2004</xref>). Further study, using a similar approach, showed that Dx genetically interacts with the components of HOPS and AP-3 endocytic complexes that, successively, have a significant influence on Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Wilkin et al., 2008</xref>). Dx has also been shown to play a critical role in Dpp endocytosis and trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sharma et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Like Notch and Dpp, evidence supporting Wg endocytosis has been reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Seto and Bellen, 2006</xref>). Wg is found to co-localize with Rab5 and Rab7 in the early and late endosomes respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Marois et al., 2006</xref>). We also observed a significant co-localization of Wg with Dx in Rab5-positive vesicles (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>.A1-A4). Rab5 is a smallGTPase that is necessary for endosome fusion to form early endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Clague and Urbé, 2001</xref>). Impaired endocytosis affects Wg trafficking and in turn the signaling. Expression of a Dominant-negative form of Rab5 (Rab5<sup>S43N</sup>) blocks the early steps of endocytosis, including internalization and early-endosome fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Entchev et al., 2000</xref>), and significantly affects the Wg signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Seto and Bellen, 2006</xref>). A more punctate Wg expression was observed when the endocytosis is blocked by over-expressing a GDP-bound Rab5 (Rab5DN or Rab5<sup>S43N</sup>) with a D/V boundary specific <italic>C96-GAL4</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>.C1). A further reduction in Wg puncta was observed when Dx was over-expressed in the same background, suggesting the role of Dx in Wg trafficking (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>.C2).</p>

</fig>
<p>Additionally, <italic>C96-GAL4</italic> mediated over-expression of Rab5DN, results in a loss of wing tissue similar to the loss of Wg, implying the role of endocytosis in Wg signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baker, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Couso et al., 1994</xref>). This loss of wing tissue was further aggravated when Dx was over-expressed along with Rab5DN suggesting a more diffused Wg expression at the D/V boundary, which further limits the threshold required to form the adult wing margin (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>.B2). This synergism bringsabout 90% lethality, further implicating the role of Dx in Wg regulation via endocytosis. In addition to Rab5, the late endosome protein Rab7, when over-expressed with Dx, showed a punctate Wg expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>.F2), suggesting an important role of Dx in Wg trafficking. Rab7 targets the endocytic cargo from the early endosome to the late endosome and then to the lysosome for degradation. Over-expression of a wild type Rab7 increases trafficking towards the lysosome. This is due to enhanced vesicle fusion, resulting in enlarged late endosomal structures, prone to lysosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Entchev et al., 2000</xref>). When UAS-Rab7 was co-expressed with Dx, a more punctate Wg expression was observed evincing that Dx might facilitate the functions of Rab7. Our study suggests the involvement of Dx in Wg endocytosis, however, further analysis is required to unravel the detailed mechanistic aspect in Wg endocytosis and trafficking via Dx.</p>

<label>2.6.</label><title>Dx modulates Wg signal transduction</title>
<p>Arm, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologue of mammalian β-catenin has a dual function. It acts as a nuclear transcription factor that transduces the Wg signaling on one hand and maintains the cell integrity on the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Coombs et al., 2008</xref>). Within the wing disc, Arm concentrates apically where it binds with the transmembrane cadherins to build up the adherens junction that connects the actin filaments across polarized epithelial cells, thereby acting as a bridge between E-cadherin and the actin cytoskeleton. To investigate the functional aspect of Dx in Wg signaling regulation, we analyzed the status of this key effector of Wg signaling. Upon Dx over-expression with <italic>en-GAL4,</italic> the accumulation of Arm was strongly reduced in the whole posterior compartment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>.A2), and most evidently at the D/V boundary. A similar reduction in Arm expression was observed in the eye disc in the GMR domain (Supplementary Fig. 3.B1.) indicating that Dx might disrupt the cell fate specification in the eye tissue. Moreover, confocal Z stack analysis revealed a reduction of apical Arm accumulation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>.B2). The reduction of the apical Arm is consistent with the decline of cell adhesion, leading to the structural reorganization of the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wodarz et al., 2006</xref>). Highermagnification pictures further revealed a disorganized cell morphology upon Dx over-expression. Moreover, it was also observed that Dx co-localizes with endogenous Arm(marked by arrow) and is in the same vesicle upon Dx over-expression, suggesting that the two proteins might physically interact (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>.C3 and C4).</p>

<p>Further, upon over-expressing activated Arm (Arm<sup>s10</sup>), with the wing margin specific <italic>C96-GAL4</italic>, ectopic hairs were observed throughout the wings, and this is more evident near the wing margin (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>.E1 and E2). This is a Wg gain-of-function phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Vuong et al., 2018</xref>). The ectopic hair phenotype, however, was significantly reduced when Dx was over-expressed in the samebackground (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>.E5 and E6), corroborating with our immuno-staining results. A similar reduction in Arm gain-of-function phenotype was observed when the activated Arm was over-expressed together with Dx in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye. Over-expressing Arm<sup>s10</sup> with eye-specific <italic>GMR-GAL4</italic> renders flies with reduced eye size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Freeman and Bienz, 2001</xref>) and severely diffused ommatidia (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>.F1 and F2). Moreover, upon over-expressing Dx in the same background, the Arm gain-of-function phenotype was found to be suppressed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>.F5 and F6).</p>
<p>Interestingly, it was also observed that Dx co-localizes with endogenous Arm and is in the same vesicle upon Dx over-expression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>.C3). Since Arm accumulation was reduced in the cytoplasm of Dx over-expressed cells in the disc, we also checked if there is any alteration of nuclear localization of Arm in these cells. To investigate this, we analyzed the nuclear versus cytoplasmic localization of Arm protein in the wing imaginal disc. High magnification pictures gave us a hint of Arm being exclusively in cytoplasm in Dx over-expressed condition. This inference was made since no localization of Arm in the nucleus (DAPI-stained area) was observed in the posterior compartment of the wing disc, though the anterior compartment showed significant localization of Arm with DAPI (marked by arrow) (Supplementary Fig. 4. A1-A10). The small size of cells in the wing disc made it difficult to draw a definite result and a more robust and facilitated assay system is required to visualize the changes i.e., cytoplasm versus nuclear localization.</p>
<p>Since Dx possesses an E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, so this down-regulation can be a consequence of ubiquitination-mediated degradation of Arm which needs to be determined.</p>

<sec id="s2g">
<label>2.7.</label><title>Dx degrades Armadillo by the proteasome-mediated mechanism</title>
<p>The stabilization of Arm/β-catenin is critical in Wg/Wnt signaling regulation and the ubiquitination-dependent proteasomal degradation is considered to be a major mechanism for controlling its stability. β-TrCP, Jade1, casitas B-lineage lymphoma (c-Cbl), and SIAH1 [(the human homolog of <italic>Drosophila</italic> seven in absentia (sina)], are known E3 ligases that mediate β-catenin ubiquitination in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Spiegelman et al., 2000</xref>). Moreover, β-catenin ubiquitination in the nucleus is mediated by c-Cbl and TRIM33 (tripartite-motif containing protein 33). C-Cbl is a RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase that binds to the non-phosphorylated nuclear β-catenin via the armadillo repeat region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chitalia et al., 2013</xref>). Though the ubiquitination of β-catenin is not always linked with its degradation and there are reports where E3 ubiquitin ligases enhanced the stability of β-catenin by ubiquitinating through Lys-29 or Lys-11 linked ubiquitin chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hay-Koren et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, to elucidate if Arm downregulation through Dx is a ubiquitination-dependent phenomenon, first, we tried to test if Dx physically interacts with Arm. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments using FLAG-tagged Dx revealed that FLAG-tagged Dx pulled down Arm when co-expressed in eye tissue (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>. A). Likewise, FLAG-tagged Dx was coimmunoprecipitated with Arm using an anti-Arm antibody when the two proteins were expressed together (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>. B).</p>

A rescue in Arm loss post MG132 treatment was observed in the posterior domainof the wing disc suggesting it to be a ubiquitination-dependent phenomenon (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>.C1-E4). Moreover, Western blot reconfirmed our immunofluorescence studies where a decline in Arm expression was observed in Dx over-expression which was significantly rescued after MG132 treatment (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>.

<label>2.8.</label><title>Conserved mechanism of β-catenin degradation by human DTX1</title>
<p>In order to elucidate the conserved role of Dx in Wg signaling regulation across the phyla, we examined the status of β-catenin in human DTX1over-expressed HEK-293 cells. In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> system we have observed that Arm physically interacts with Dx and proteasome inhibitor, MG132, treatment resulted in stabilization of Arm in Dx-overexpressed wing imaginal discs. Thus, to determine the functional conservation of human homolog of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Dx, DTX1 in the β-catenin degradation, first we checked the binding of human DTX1 with β-catenin in HEK-293 cells through co-immunoprecipitation experiment. Consistent with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> studies, the results here undoubtedly reveal the fact that DTX1 binds to β-catenin (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>.A). In addition, as in the case of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, β-catenin also gets stabilized in the presence of MG132 in human HEK-293 cells overexpressing DTX1. Post MG132 treatment, the HEK-293 cell lines transfected with HA-tagged DTX1 showed a rescue in β-catenin expression (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>.B) These results clearly indicate that there is aconserved mechanism through which DTX1 degrades β-catenin and in turn regulates Wnt signaling.</p>

<label>3.</label><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The diverse role of Wg in different developmental contexts depends on the Wg signaling activity. Endocytosis and intracellular trafficking regulate Wg signaling levels. Internalization and endosomal transport of Wg not only affect levels and distribution of Wg ligand but also regulates signal transduction through Arm stabilization. Regulation of Wg pathway is tightly monitored at multiple steps. Canonically, Wg exerts its effects by regulating the transcription of the target genes through the effector molecule, Arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dierick and Bejsovec, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Städeli et al., 2006</xref>). In theabsence of the Wg signaling the multi-protein destruction complex (APC, Axin, GSK3-β, andCki) phosphorylates and degrades Arm. However, in the presence of the ligand Wg, the cell surface primes a signaling cascade with the aid of the scaffold protein, Axin, which in turn inhibits the destruction complex through the adaptor molecule Dishevelled leading to the stabilization of Arm. The stabilized Arm thereby enters the nucleus to activate the transcription of the target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bilic et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Mosimann et al., 2009</xref>). The stabilization of Arm is therefore a critical step where Wg regulation can take place. An activated Wg signaling also can relocate Axin from intracellular vesicles to the plasma membrane, thereby inactivating the destruction complex and stabilizing Arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Cliffe et al., 2003</xref>). Relocation of Axin through intracellular trafficking strengthens the fact that Wg signaling is equally regulated through a non-canonical mechanism. Intracellular trafficking affects the efficiency of Wg signaling significantly. For instance, Wg accumulates on the cell surface of Dynamin mutant clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Strigini and Cohen., 2000</xref>). A Rab5 knockdown further down-regulates Wg signaling suggesting that an internalization and endosomal transport of Wg is critical for its regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Seto and Bellen, 2006</xref>). Wg internalization is proposed to occur via two spatially distinct routes: one on the apical, and one on the basal, side of the disc. It is therefore thought that the subcellular localization of Wg along the apical-basal axis of receiving cells could play a crucial role in molding the Wg gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Marois et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Previously, Godzilla, a member of the RNF family of membrane-anchored E3 ligases is shown to be required for subsequent trafficking of Wg from early apical endosomes to the basolateral surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Yamazaki et al., 2016</xref>). Here we show that Dx plays an important role in the intracellular trafficking of Wg and consequently facilitates the spreading of the Wg gradient. Dx regulates Wg signaling activity both at the level of spreading of Wg ligand as well as directly at the level of Arm stabilization. We hypothesize that since Dx has an E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, it can directly degrade Arm through ubiquitination followed by proteasomal degradation and thus diminish Wg signaling. Dx is a cytoplasmic protein and is best known for its regulation of Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hori et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Matsuno et al., 1995</xref>). Dx regulates Notch signaling in a non-canonical manner and in an over-expressed condition Dx depletes Notch from the cell surface and accumulates it in the endocytic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hori et al., 2004</xref>). Involvement of Dx in signaling cascade other than Notch has been reported from our earlier studies, where we show that Dx interacts with the TNF ligand Eiger, and regulates JNK signaling by facilitating the re-localization of Eiger from the cell membrane to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Dutta et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, we have also reported that Dx synergizes with TRAF6, the adaptor molecule in the JNK cascade, and activates JNK signaling at a level downstream of the ligand-receptor interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sharma et al., 2021</xref>). A novel function of Dx in Toll pathway activation has also been reported lately, where we have reported a JNK-independent Toll pathway activation through Dx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Sharma et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we present evidence for the first time that <italic>dx</italic> genetically interacts with <italic>wg</italic> and other components of the Wg signaling cascade in particular the transcription factor, <italic>arm.</italic> Our loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies show that Dx is involved in the regulation of Wg signaling. We show that over-expression of Dx plays an important role in promoting the spreading of the morphogen Wg. This leads to an erosion of the Wg gradient which consecutively results in a loss of the short-range targets, Sens and Cut. We also observed that the loss of Wg downstream targets upon Dx over-expression is independent of Notch. On the contrary, reducing the dosage of Dx narrows the gradient of Wg expression, supporting further the direct role of Dx in Wg spreading. Moreover, on knocking down Rab5, the small GTPase required for early endosome formation, along with Dx over-expression, a reduction in wing size was observed with a reduction in the Wg expression. A similar reduction in Wg expression was observed when Rab7 was over-expressed along with Dx. Rab7 facilitates the late endosome formation, and along with Dx it might facilitate Wg trafficking and in turn, maintains its proper gradient.</p>
<p>It has been shown previously that Arm associates with Notch near the adherens junctions and that it is rapidly endocytosed promoting the traffic of an activated form of Armadillo into endosomal compartments, where it may be degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Sanders et al., 2009</xref>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Acar et al., 2021</xref>). Notch signaling regulates the activity and the amount of active/oncogenic form of Arm/β-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hayward et al., 2005</xref>). More specifically, in colon cancer cells Notch physically interacts with unphosphorylated β-catenin and negatively regulates the translational accumulation of active β-catenin (Kwon et al., 2011). These studies contemplate the diverse range of mechanisms through which Arm and consequently, Wg signaling may be intricately controlled. Here, we propose a model of Wg regulation through Dx via down-regulation of Arm. Dx down-regulates Arm when it was over-expressed in the wing and eye tissue. Since Dx has an E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and therefore this down-regulation of Arm can be attributed to being a ubiquitination-dependent phenomenon. Indeed, our results support this hypothesis since post MG132 treatment rescues the loss of Arm when Dx is over-expressed in the background. In addition, we have also shown that human Deltex (DTX1) also displays a conserved function ofproteasomal degradation of β-catenin.</p>
<p>The importance of Wnt/Wg signaling is acknowledged by its implicit role in myriads of biological phenomena throughout development. Wnt/Wg signaling has been implicated in many physiological processes, including development, tissue homeostasis, and tissue regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Wodarz et al., 1998</xref>). Thus, it is no surprise that mutations in the Wnt pathway components are associated with many hereditary disorders and cancers such as colorectal cancer, Wilms tumor, Familiar Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP), leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kinzler et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Nishisho et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Polakis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zhan et al., 2017</xref>).Thus, understanding the mechanism of Wnt/Wg signal regulation is a potent area of investigation. Increased expression of DTX and its involvement in cell migration and invasiveness in differentcancers such as follicular lymphomas, osteosarcoma, glioblastoma, melanoma have also been reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gupta-Rossi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Huber et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bachmann et al., 2014</xref>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Thang et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we have uncovered an important functionof the cytoplasmic protein Dx in the gradient formation of the morphogen Wg. These results strengthen the role of Dx in the trafficking of morphogens, thereby allowing the proper activation of the short-range and long-range target genes. In addition, the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of Dx further opens a new avenue of Wg signaling regulation by maintaining the critical concentration of the effector molecule Arm. A clear understanding of Dx-mediated regulation of Wg signaling will be very useful for future research in the field of therapeutic intervention of diseases involved in aberrant Wg signaling.</p>

<p>This is a <bold>useful</bold> study of the connection between the ubiquitin ligase protein deltex and the wingless signaling pathway. Two different links are inferred from genetic interactions in vivo between loss-of-function mutations and overexpression. While the genetic data are <bold>solid</bold>, the precise mechanism underlying either effect remains to be established.</p>

<p>This study presents a genetic and molecular analysis of the role of the cytoplasmic ub ligase Deltex (Dx) in regulating the Drosophila Wingless (Wg) pathway in the larval wing disc. The study exploits the strength of the fly system to uncover a series of genetic interactions between dx and wg and fz allele that support a role for Dx upstream of the Wg pathway. These are paired with molecular evidence that dx lof alleles lower Wg protein in 'source' cells at the DV margin, and that Dx associates with Arm and lowers its levels in a manner that can be rescued by pharmacological inhibition of the proteasome. The genetic data are solid but subject to alternative explanations based on the authors' model that Dx both inhibits and activates the pathway. The molecular data are suggestive, but need follow up tests of how Dx affects Wg spread, and how Dx mediates poly-ub of Arm, and the degree to which Dx shares this role with the validated Arm E3 ligase Slmb. Overall, the story is very interesting but has mechanistic gaps that lead to speculative models that require more rigorous study to clarify mechanism. Dx sharing a role in Arm degradation with the Slmb/APC destruction would have important implications for the many Wg/Wnt regulated processes in development and disease.</p>

<p>The manuscript investigates the connections between the ubiquitin ligase protein deltex and the wingless pathway. Two different connections are proposed, one is function of deltex to modulate the gradient of wingless diffusion and hence modulate the spatial patter of wingless pathway targets, which regulate at different thresholds of wingless concentration. The second is a direct interaction between deltex and armadillo, a downstream component of the wingless pathway. Deltex is proposed to cause the degradation of armadillo resulting in suppression of wingless pathway activity. The results and conclusions of the manuscript are interesting and for the most part novel, although previously published work linking Notch and deltex to wingless signal regulation, and endocytosis to wingless gradient formation could be more extensively discussed. However neither of the two parts to the manuscript seem, in themselves sufficiently complete, and combining both parts together therefore seems to lack focus.</p>
<p>The main issue with the manuscript is that much of the conclusions are inferred from genetic interactions in vivo between loss of function mutants and overexpression. While providing useful in vivo physiological context, this type of approach struggles to be able to make definitive conclusions on whether an interaction is due to direct or indirect mechanism, as the authors themselves conclude at the end of section 2.3. The problem is confounded by the fact that there is already documented much cross talk between the Notch signaling pathway and wingless at the transcriptional level, and deltex is already a Notch modulator that can alter wingless mRNA expression (See Hori et al 2004). Deltex in addition to promoting a ligand-independent Notch signal can also induce expression of Notch ligand, allowing further non-autonomous Notch activation and subsequent cell autonomous cis-inhibition of the initial deltex-induced signal. The dynamics and outcomes of the Notch signal response to deltex in vivo is therefore already very complicated to interpret before even considering to unravel indirect (via Notch) and direct interactions with wingless, although the two possibilities are not mutually exclusive. Whilst the revised manuscript does not completely overcome these limitations, further data and quantification have improved the support for the conclusions and there is a wider discussion of the relevant literature. The conclusions are interesting and add significantly to our understanding of the intersections between Wingless, Notch and trafficking regulators in an in vivo context.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The description of the wing phenotype that results from combinations of wingless and delex alleles at the bottom of page 4 (figure 1) is quite confusing. Are the trans-hets suppressed to wt or enhanced? The images in the Fig look enhanced.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this thoughtful observation regarding the wing phenotype description in combination with wg and dx alleles. We understand the confusion and appreciate the opportunity to clarify.</p>
<p>In response to the concern raised, the trans-heterozygous indeed enhanced rather than suppressed to wild type. We acknowledge that the description would have been clearer. We have revised the relevant section to explicitly state that trans-heterozygous exhibit an enhanced wing phenotype in the updated version of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Use of Cut as a Wg readout in Fig1 is problematic since it is also a Notch target. Perhaps a more direct measure of Arm activity would be a better choice here, e.g., naked-lacZ.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comment regarding the use of Cut as a Wg readout. The point about being Cut as a Notch target raises a valid concern. To address this issue and provide a more direct measurement of Arm activity, we agree that incorporating a specific Arm readout, such as naked lacZ, would be a more suitable choice.</p>
<p>We will incorporate this valuable feedback into our future research endeavors to augment the comprehensiveness of our study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The dx allele effects on Sens and Vg in Fig 2C appear greater at two points along the DV margin (arrows). Do these match the expression pattern of dx mRNA?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this thoughtful observation. We understand that the effect of the dx LOF allele on Sens and Vg seems more pronounced at two specific points along the D/V margin. As far as our understanding Dx shows a homogeneous expression pattern throughout the Wg disc which has been reported earlier (Busseau et al., 1994., Mukherjee et al., 2005).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) It really looks to my eye that dx loss lowers Wg expression in source cells in Fig 2. To confirm the model that Dx controls the spread of Wg protein, it would be ideal to rule out txnal effects with a wg-lacZ reporter.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for raising this important point. In the revised version of the manuscript, we have introduced Wg-lacZ staining for both Wg-lacZ/+ and dx152/Y; Wg-lacZ/+ combination in Figure 2. This additional information eliminates the possibility of Deltex influencing Wg transcriptional regulation in source cells, thus reinforcing our hypothesis that the reduction of Deltex leads to a decline in Wg protein levels in the source cells, given Dx essential role in wingless gradient formation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The drop in DV Wg and expansion of Vg domain in dx mutants seem paradoxical but could be explained by accelerated Wg spread and uptake. This could be tested by depleting the dally-like glypican that promotes long-range Wg diffusion in dx mutants, and seeing if this restores Wg levels at the DV margin.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is indeed a very thoughtful comment and we thank the reviewer for this insightful suggestion for further exploration. We believe that depleting dally-like glypican in dx mutants could possibly restore Wg levels at the DV margin.</p>
<p>We recognize the importance of this experiment in providing a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms, and we will give major emphasis on incorporating this suggestion in our future research.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The authors describe the effect of Dx over-expression as &quot;reducing&quot; the Wg gradient when they actually mean &quot;flattening&quot;. Please be careful with this word choice as they mean different things.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the insightful feedback. The suggested modifications have been incorporated into the revised version of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) The combined effects of Rab5dn and Dx o/e on Wg protein loc/levels are interesting but need to be followed up by testing whether the endogenous Dx/Rab5 show genetic interactions in control of Wg protein levels/localization.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the reviewer's comment and in addressing it, we wish to highlight that the over-expression of Dx with endogenous Rab5 or Rab7 does not affect Wg protein levels or localization. We have mentioned the supporting data for this control in Figure 5(G, H).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) The ability of MG132 to restore Arm levels in en-Dx discs is very promising. However, MG132 will also block Arm degradation by the Slmb-APC destruction complex, so this result could be non-specific. Tests of whether Dx drives poly-ub of Arm, and how much Dx is redundant to Slmb in this role, would be needed to solidify the authors' conclusion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment. We understand that the concern about MG132 blocking Arm degradation by Slmb-APC destruction complex adds an important layer of complexity to the interpretation of the results. We agree with the reviewer's comment that conducting these experiments will indeed offer valuable insight into the specificity of MG132 effects and further strengthen our conclusion.</p>
<p>We are interested to see how future experiments addressing the points raised by the reviewer will shape our understanding of the intricate mechanisms involved in Wg signaling and Arm/-catenin degradation. Once again, we thank the reviewer for the thoughtful engagement with the research, and the comments will undoubtedly stimulate further investigation and discussion in this area.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The work really needs more experiments to further provide a mechanistic understanding and distinguish between direct and indirect action (via Notch signaling) on Wingless, but instead switches in the second half to a second interaction with β-catenin, leaving the conclusions of the first part hanging. More mechanistic information on the cell biology of how Deltex might affect wingless endocytic trafficking directly would be beneficial, for example involving some cell culture experiments where the action of deltex on Notch and wingless could be more clearly separated and a more detailed study of the consequences on wingless trafficking could be explored.</p>
<p>Wingless is secreted into an extracellular compartment and so won't be accessible for a direct interaction with cytoplasmic deltex. Therefore are the authors proposing Deltex interacts with a membrane-bound wingless receptor such as frizzled in order to mediate its effects? These avenues could be explored further experimentally to derive a more mechanistic conclusion.</p>
<p>The colocalisation images are not high resolution and colocalisation is not quantified, and no differences ( +/- Deltex) in wingless subcellular localisation, which would aid mechanistic interpretation, are shown.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the insightful feedback on our work. We appreciate the suggestion for more experiments to provide a mechanistic understanding and to distinguish between direct and indirect actions of Notch on Wingless signaling. We acknowledge the importance of clarifying these aspects and agree that further experiments could help separate the effects of Deltex on Notch and Wingless signaling, allowing for a more detailed examination of their respective trafficking and ubiquitination mechanisms.</p>
<p>We will consider your valuable input in our future research efforts to enhance the comprehensiveness of our study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Other specific points</p>
<p>Figure 2: Narrowing and broadening of different marker gene expression patterns in dx mutants needs to be quantified so that variation is taken into account and the numbers of wings imaged should be clearly stated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate this valuable suggestion from the reviewer. As a response, we have incorporated quantification data to address the observed variations. We have also provided information regarding the number of wing discs that were imaged for the purpose of quantification.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 3: The number of discs imaged in total should be mentioned</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We express our appreciation to the reviewer for the input. We have taken their comment into account and have subsequently included details regarding the number of discs imaged in the figure legend section of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 6: There is no description of (E5-E6) in the figure legend. F1 to F5 eye size phenotypes require quantification.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful to the reviewers for bringing this to our attention. In response, we have included a description of E5-E6 in the figure legend. Also, as per the reviewer’s suggestions, we have incorporated the quantification data of the eye size phenotype.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Discussion</p>
<p>Links between Notch and wingless pathway should be more comprehensively discussed, including previous work that has previously linked Notch/Deltex to β-catenin degradation e.g.</p>
