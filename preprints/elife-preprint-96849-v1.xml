<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Genetic variants can alter the profile of heritable molecules such as small RNAs in sperm and oocytes, and in this manner ancestral genetic variants can have a significant effect on offspring phenotypes even if they are not themselves inherited. Here we show that wild type female mice descended from ancestors with a mutation in the mammalian germ cell gene <italic>Khdc3</italic> have hepatic metabolic defects that persist over multiple generations. We find that genetically wild type females descended from <italic>Khdc3</italic> mutants have transcriptional dysregulation of critical hepatic metabolic genes, which persist over multiple generations and pass through both female and male lineages. This was associated with dysregulation of hepatically-metabolized molecules in the blood of these wild type mice with mutational ancestry. The oocytes of <italic>Khdc3</italic>-null females, as well as their wild type descendants, had dysregulation of multiple small RNAs, suggesting that these epigenetic changes in the gametes transmit the phenotype between generations. Our results demonstrate that ancestral mutation in <italic>Khdc3</italic> can produce transgenerational inherited phenotypes, potentially indefinitely.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It is becoming increasingly apparent that non-DNA molecules inherited from germ cells contribute significantly to the transmission of traits and diseases across generations. This has been demonstrated in response to a variety of exposures such as diet or stress in model organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) and has been confirmed in human epidemiological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). The mechanisms driving this process remain poorly defined and are complicated by the erasure of acquired epigenetic molecules such as DNA methylation early in embryonic development. Expression of germ cell small RNAs such as microRNA (miRNA) and tRNA fragments (tsRNA) are responsive to exposures and inherited at fertilization, making them potential candidates for passage of phenotypic information across generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Microinjection of these small RNAs from the germ cells of an exposed mouse into an unexposed embryo is sufficient to recapitulate the descendant’s phenotypes, demonstrating causality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). However, the absence of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in mammals implies that small RNAs by themselves cannot propagate phenotypes across multiple generations.</p>
<p>Non-inherited ancestral genetic variants can also affect descendants’ risk of disease, as has been demonstrated in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>), thyroid hormone metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>), body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), type I diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>), and folate metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). This phenomenon is often referred to as “genetic nurture” based on the effect of non-inherited DNA variants nurturing phenotypes in the next generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). In all described cases, the observed phenotypes disappear after a few generations. The molecular mechanisms driving these cross-generational traits, in the absence of inheritance of the causal variant, remains largely undescribed, with the exception of paramutation effects that are driven by inherited RNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Some of the genes associated with this phenomenon are thought to directly alter the molecular profile of the gamete, for example with testicular germ cell tumors and RNA-modifying genes that are expressed in sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Other reported examples involve genes that do not have any known function in the germ cells, and likely alter descendants’ phenotypes indirectly, by changing underlying physiology in a manner that subsequently alters germ cell heritable molecules, not dissimilar from the mechanisms of exposure-based changes to heritable germ cell molecules.</p>
<p><italic>Khdc3</italic> is a mammalian gene expressed in the male and female germ cells that encodes a protein containing an RNA-binding KH domain that localizes to a multi-protein complex at the oocyte periphery known as the subcortical maternal complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). <italic>Khdc3</italic>-null female mice have decreased fertility caused by defects in maintaining euploidy during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Human females with homozygous mutations in the ortholog <italic>KHDC3L</italic> are infertile, which has been associated with abnormal DNA methylation in oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). <italic>KHDC3L</italic> (and <italic>Khdc3)</italic> does not localize to the nucleus and does not contain a DNA methyltransferase domain, suggesting that the DNA methylation defects are secondary outcome and not the main function of this gene.</p>
<p>We demonstrate that wild type female descendants of <italic>Khdc3</italic>-null mice have dysfunctional expression of hepatic metabolic genes that persists over multiple generations, and that this effect is transmitted from both male and female mutant ancestors. This corresponds with abnormal levels of hepatic metabolites in the serum of these wild type mice with mutant ancestors. The persistence of these abnormalities in genetically wild type mice suggests that altered epigenetic information in the germ cells is transmitting the inherited metabolic phenotypes. Accordingly, we observed that the oocytes of <italic>Khdc3</italic>-null females and their wild type descendants have multiple dysregulated miRNAs and tsRNAs, suggesting a mechanism of inheritance.</p>

<title>Wild type females descended from Khdc3-null ancestors display hepatic transcriptional dysregulation</title>
<p>Global transcriptome analysis of <italic>Khdc3</italic>-null oocytes revealed significant dysregulation of genes important in metabolic processes regulated by the liver, especially the metabolism of lipids (atherosclerosis, PPAR signaling, and pantothenate and CoA metabolism) and of carbohydrates (glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and fructose and mannose metabolism) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Despite the abnormal expression of metabolic genes in the <italic>Khdc3</italic>-null oocyte, this gene is only expressed in female reproductive tissue, with no detectable expression in the liver and minimal expression in other metabolic tissues such as adipose or pancreas (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>Expression of <italic>Cyp17a1</italic>, a gene central to lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>), was increased in the livers of <italic>Khdc3</italic>-null (knockout, or “KO”) females, despite a lack of expression or any known function of <italic>Khdc3</italic> in wild type livers. Elevated expression of <italic>Cyp17a1</italic> was observed in KO females generated from KO parents (referred to as “KO<sup>KO</sup>”) as well as KO females generated by mating <italic>Khdc3</italic> heterozygote parents (referred to as “KO*”) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). <italic>Cyp17a1</italic> expression was also significantly increased, to the same extent as KO<sup>KO</sup> and KO* females, in genetically wild type females descended from heterozygous parents (referred to as “WT*” to indicate genetically wild type mice that have descended from <italic>Khdc3</italic> heterozygous mutant parents and a combination of wild type and <italic>Khdc3</italic>-null grandparents). Thus, having an ancestor that carried a <italic>Khdc3</italic> mutation was associated with elevated <italic>Cyp17a1</italic> expression, and the <italic>Khdc3</italic> genotype had no effect on <italic>Cyp17a1</italic> expression, revealing a DNA-independent form of inheritance (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Increased <italic>Cyp17a1</italic> mRNA expression occurred in WT* females generated from all possible combinations of male and female KO grandparents (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). In addition to conventional genotyping, the wild type genotype of these mice was confirmed with RNA-Seq of ovaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>RNA-Seq of female WT* livers revealed a pattern of global transcriptional dysregulation that overlapped significantly with KO* and KO<sup>KO</sup> females (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E-F</xref>), demonstrating that shared ancestry rather than genotype accounts for the transcriptional abnormalities in WT* mice. This is supported by the observation that most significantly dysregulated genes in WT* livers were similarly dysregulated in KO* livers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). Gene ontology of the common dysregulated genes in livers of WT* and KO* mice revealed enrichment in metabolic processes in which the liver plays a central role, especially lipid and glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>).</p>

<title>WT* defects persist over multiple generations</title>
<p>When WT* male and female mice were mated with each other to generate the next generation (referred to as WT**, signifying the 2<sup>nd</sup> generation of genetically wild type mice), hepatic transcriptional dysregulation of metabolic genes persisted. There was a similar pattern of dysregulation in WT** females derived from either male or female <italic>Khdc3</italic>-null ancestors (denoted WT**(P) and WT**(M), respectively, denoting <underline>P</underline>aternal or <underline>M</underline>aternal ancestral mutant history) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Comparison of dysregulated genes between WT**(P) and WT**(M) females showed significant overlap (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) revealing that the same pattern of abnormal gene expression is observed in wild type females descended from both male and female mutant ancestors.</p>

<p>WT(P) male and female mice were mated with each other in order to examine passage these defects over successive generations. Descendants of male mutants were examined to avoid potential confounding from non-germ cell mechanisms of inheritance such as mitochondrial inheritance, fetal-maternal communication across the placenta, or transmission of molecules via breastmilk. Expression of <italic>Cyp17a1</italic> and <italic>2610507I01Rik</italic>, two genes dysregulated in WT*, KO*, KO<sup>KO</sup>, and WT**(P) female mice, demonstrated persistent and worsening dysregulated expression in the 2<sup>nd</sup> through 6<sup>th</sup> generation of females (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). In a minority of mice, expression reverted back to WT levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Importantly, those mice that reverted to WT levels of <italic>Cyp17a1</italic> maintained elevated expression of <italic>2610507I01Rik</italic>, and vice-versa, suggesting that the abnormal expression of these genes is driven by independent units of inheritance.</p>
<p><italic>Khdc3</italic>-null females were outcrossed with a true wild type male without any ancestral history of <italic>Khdc3</italic> mutation, in order to examine the persistence of the observed defects through only the maternal line without any contribution from males that descended from mutants. 100% of the F2 outcrossed females, descended from a maternal grandmother mutant, had persistent transcriptional dysregulation of metabolism-related genes in the liver (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Many of these dysregulated genes overlapped with WT** females descended from both male (WT**(P)) and female (WT**(M)) homozygous-null ancestors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>). In this mating scheme, persistence of hepatic transcriptional dysregulation in all 7 examined females is not consistent with mechanisms of inheritance involving in-cis transmission, including an unaccounted DNA polymorphism/mutation, DNA methylation, or histone protein modification, in which any chromosome from the <italic>Khdc3</italic>-null grandmother would have been inherited by ∼50% of the F2 outcross generation.</p>

<title>WT* females have abnormal levels of serum hepatic metabolites</title>
<p>Global serum metabolomic analysis was performed to examine the metabolic consequences of the observed transcriptional dysregulation. Both WT**(P) and WT****(P) female mice had abnormal levels of multiple bile acids, which are synthesized in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>)(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). The magnitude of dysregulation was similar to that observed in KO<sup>KO</sup> females (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), suggesting that mutational ancestry was more important than the organism’s genotype. These females also had abnormal concentrations of various xenobiotics (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>) and metabolic cofactors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>), both of which are associated with hepatic metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>).</p>

<p>WT****(P) mice were metabolically challenged with 8 weeks of a high fat diet (HFD). When compared with true wild type mice exposed to a HFD, WT****(P) females exposed to a HFD showed significant increase in multiple lipid molecules that were not dysregulated in WT****(P) females that consumed a conventional diet, or in WT mice consuming a HFD (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Thus, there were latent metabolic abnormalities that could not be detected unless stressed with a high fat diet. The HFD WT****(P) serum also had decreased levels of multiple other hepatic metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>)(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>), some of which were also decreased in WT HFD females although at a much lesser magnitude (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). These findings demonstrate that the hepatic transcriptional dysregulation observed in these mice has significant effects on multiple metabolites found in the blood.</p>

<p>Livers of WT**(P) females had dysfunctional expression of multiple small RNA-processing genes, especially genes that regulate tRNA (<italic>Trmt9b</italic> (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></italic>), <italic>Ang</italic> (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></italic>), <italic>Nsun6</italic> (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></italic>), <italic>Elac1</italic> (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></italic>)) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>) and miRNA processing (<italic>Mettl1</italic> (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></italic>), <italic>Ago2</italic> (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></italic>), <italic>Exosc10</italic>, <italic>Syncrip</italic> (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></italic>)) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Based on this observation, in combination with the fact that gamete small RNAs can transmit non-genetically inherited phenotypes in mice, we hypothesized that the observed phenotypes were driven by the defective inheritance of small RNAs from the germ cells of <italic>Khdc3</italic> mutant ancestors. Small RNA-Seq of KO<sup>KO</sup> oocytes revealed dysregulation of multiple miRNAs and tRNA fragments, with minimal piRNA dysregulation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). In WT**(P) oocytes, there was also abnormal expression of tRNA fragments and miRNA, most of which were different small RNAs than the ones dysregulated in KO<sup>KO</sup> oocytes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Of note, the WT**(P) oocytes had downregulation of the tRNA fragment Gly-GCC, for which expression in sperm has been associated with inherited metabolic and hepatic gluconeogenesis phenotypes in offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). There were 3 tRNA fragments and 18 miRNAs that were commonly dysregulated in both KO<sup>KO</sup> and WT**(P) oocytes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>), suggesting that their abnormal expression is established in KO<sup>KO</sup> oocytes and is not normalized with reintroduction of a wild type <italic>Khdc3</italic> allele. The function of most of these commonly dysregulated tsRNAs and miRNAs remains undescribed, however miR-107, which was upregulated in both KO<sup>KO</sup> and WT**(P) oocytes, is involved in hepatic lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The presence of abnormal phenotypes in wild type organisms descended from mutant-carrying ancestors has been described in mice and humans, however all previously observed defects disappear after one or two generations. This can occur from mutations that affect epigenetic phenomenon in the germ cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>), but in other cases the mutation affects a process that has no clear connection with heritable molecules in the germ cell, such as with thyroid metabolism or type I diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>).</p>
<p>We find that loss-of-function mutation in <italic>Khdc3</italic> alters the hepatic metabolism of female wild type descendants over at least 6 generations in a manner that cannot be rescued with re-introduction of the <italic>Khdc3</italic> allele. This is paralleled by abnormal levels of multiple metabolites in the serum of these mice. Because there is no detectable <italic>Khdc3</italic> expression in the liver, we suspect that the defects in WT* mice are caused by inherited molecules that affect hepatic metabolism independent of the inheritance of a functional <italic>Khdc3</italic> gene. We expect that other metabolic tissues such as the pancreas and adipose will also demonstrate evidence of metabolic dysregulation.</p>
<p>We have demonstrated that <italic>Khdc3</italic>-null oocytes have abnormal expression of multiple miRNAs and tsRNAs, some of which persist over multiple generations in WT* mice, providing a potential mechanism of inheritance. Microinjection experiments using sperm RNA have demonstrated that small RNAs are sufficient to drive metabolic derangements in offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>), however the maintenance of defects to the successive generation remains unexplained. The amount of RNA needed for these experiments currently prevents using oocyte RNA in such an experimental paradigm, because of the low total RNA yield obtained from the oocytes of a single mouse.</p>
<p>We propose that the metabolic phenotype is at least partially driven by abnormal oocyte small RNAs, however the persistence of a phenotype over multiple generations requires maintenance of small RNAs via a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which mammals do not possess. It is possible that small RNAs inherited from the oocyte drive abnormal metabolic profiles in offspring, and oocyte small RNA defects are re-established in the germ cells of the following generation in response to the abnormal metabolism. A recent study demonstrated that transfer of serum from a stress-exposed mouse into a non-exposed mouse can recapitulate the effects observed in the exposed’s offspring, suggesting serum factors can modify the composition of heritable molecules in the germ cells and affect offspring traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>).</p>
<p>We utilized an outcrossing scheme to demonstrate that the observed defects persisted when passed only through the maternal line. In this mating scheme, 100% of the observed F2 outcrossed female mice had evidence of hepatic metabolic dysregulation. This pattern of inheritance is not consistent with in-cis mechanisms such as an unaccounted DNA variant, DNA methylation, or histone protein modification, because in these scenarios the alleles in the <italic>Khdc3</italic>-null maternal grandmother would be present in ∼50% of the F2 outcrossed females.</p>
<p>We chose to examine females because of the reported fertility phenotypes in <italic>KHDC3</italic> human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>) and <italic>Khdc3</italic> mouse female mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Human <italic>KHDC3</italic>-null females are infertile, while mouse <italic>Khdc3</italic>-null females are subfertile. The fertility defects are associated with oocyte DNA methylation abnormalities that we suspect are sequelae of a more primary defect in mutant organisms. There are no reports of abnormal phenotypes in <italic>Khdc3</italic>-null males, however our detected metabolic abnormalities could affect males as well, which will be an important future investigation. Furthermore, it will be important to examine how <italic>Khdc3</italic>-null mice transmit exposure-based information across generations to affect phenotypes in non-exposed offspring, as has been observed in numerous studies, most thoroughly with a high fat diet or stress.</p>
<p>One important conclusion from studies on genetic nurture is that wild type mice descended from mutant ancestors should be used thoughtfully and with caution, because phenotypes can be obscured that would be apparent with the use of wild type mice without any ancestral history of mutation. In sum, the effect of non-inherited genetic variants on offspring phenotypes remains a relatively unexplored and potentially significant contributor to traits and disease risk.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods Mice</title>
<p>FVB/N WT (Jax 001800) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory and bred in-house. Frozen <italic>Khdc3-null</italic> sperm was obtained from the Mutant Mouse Resource and Research Center (MMRRC, North Carolina) and the <italic>Khdc</italic>3 KO mouse was rederived. Female mice were used at 8 weeks of age. In individual experiments, all animals were age-matched. All mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions on a 12-hour light/dark cycle, and provided food and water ad libitum. All mouse experiments were approved by, and performed in accordance with, the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines at Weill Cornell Medicine.</p>

<title>Mouse Genotyping</title>
<p>As described in this study, WT mice were generated from WT parents. WT* and KO* mice were generated from the mating of <italic>Khdc3</italic> heterozygote parents that were themselves generated from mating of WT and KO<sup>KO</sup> mice. KO<sup>KO</sup> mice were generated from <italic>Khdc3</italic> KO parents. DNA was extracted from tail biopsies by incubating the tails biopsies in an alkaline lysis buffer (24mM NaOH and 0.2mM disodium EDTA) for 30 minutes at 95°C and then on ice for 10 minutes. A neutralization buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl) was added to the samples and diluted 1:10 with water. PCR to detect <italic>Khdc3</italic> deletion was performed with 50–200 ng of DNA using the Phire Green Hot Start II DNA Polymerase Master Mix (Thermo Scientific) in the Bio-Rad T100 Thermal Cycler. PCR for <italic>Khdc3</italic> deletion was performed using a forward primer for the wild type allele F1, a separate forward primer that incorporates the deletion allele F2, and a common reverse primer R1. The primers were as follows: P1: 5’-TGCCTGGGCAGGTTATTTAG-3’, P2: 5’-CGAGCGTCTGAAACCTCTTC-3’ and P3: 5’-AGCTAGCTTGGCTGGACGTA-3’. P1 and P2 amplified the wild type allele and P1 and P3 amplified the <italic>Khdc3</italic> mutant allele (KO). The PCR products were separated on a 1% agarose gel with SYBR safe DNA gel stain. Because of the different sizes of the PCR products, the genotypes can be easily determined from the band patterns on DNA gels.</p>

<title>Oocyte RNA Isolation</title>
<p>The oocytes were dissected following a published protocol with some modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Briefly, the ovaries were first dissected from unstimulated 8-week-old WT and <italic>Khdc3</italic>-null mice and placed in PBS. The ovary was dissected from surrounding para-ovarian fat and subsequently placed in a 35-mm culture dish with 2mL PBS and 20μl collagenase and 20μl DNase in a 37°C incubator for 20 minutes. Using a dissecting microscope, the oocytes were separated from granulosa cells, theca cells, and stromal cells, and transferred to a petri dish with PBS using a mouth-controlled micropipette. RNA was extracted from the oocytes using the PicoPure RNA Isolation kit (Thermo Fisher) following the manufacturer’s instructions and eluted in 20 µL of the provided elution buffer.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> mouse study shows that wild-type female progeny of Khdc3 mutants have abnormal gene expression relating to hepatic metabolism, which persists over multiple generations and passes through both female and male lineages. Information about litter size and a full phenotypic description of the phenotype of each progeny should be included to evaluate the impact of KHDC3 mutation on the progeny; in its current state, the evidence for the authors' claims is <bold>incomplete</bold>. A role for small RNAs on this phenomenon is proposed but has not been functionally validated. The work will be of interest to researchers in the field of DNA-independent mechanism of inheritance. Mentioning the experimental organism in title and abstract would ensure that it targets the appropriate audience.</p>

<p>The key discovery of the manuscript is that the authors found that genetically wild type females descended from Khdc3 mutants shows abnormal gene expression relating to hepatic metabolism, which persist over multiple generations and pass through both female and male lineages. They also find dysregulation of hepatically-metabolized molecules in the blood of these wild type mice with Khdc3 mutant ancestry. These data provide solid evidence further support that phenotype can be transmitted to multiple generations without altering DNA sequence, supporting the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms. The authors further performed exploratory studies on the small RNA profiles in the oocytes of Khdc3-null females, and their wild type descendants, suggesting that altered small RNA expression could be a contributor of the observed phenotype transmission, although this has not been functionally validated.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript aimed to investigate the non-genetic impact of KHDC3 mutation on the liver metabolism. To do that they analyzed the female liver transcriptome of genetically wild type mice descended from female ancestors with a mutation in the Khdc3 gene. They found that genetically wild type females descended from Khdc3 mutants have hepatic transcriptional dysregulation which persist over multiple generations in the progenies descended from female ancestors with a mutation in the Khdc3 gene. This transcriptomic deregulation was associated with dysregulation of hepatically-metabolized molecules in the blood of these wild type mice with female mutational ancestry. Furthermore, to determine whether small non-coding RNA could be involved in the maternal non-genetic transmission of the hepatic transcriptomic deregulation, they performed small RNA-seq of oocytes from Khdc3-/- mice and genetically wild type female mice descended from female ancestors with a Khdc3 mutation and claimed that oocytes of wild type female offspring from Khdc3-null females has dysregulation of multiple small RNAs.</p>
<p>Finally, they claimed that their data demonstrates that ancestral mutation in Khdc3 can produce transgenerational inherited phenotypes.</p>
<p>However, at this stage and considering the information provided in the paper, I think that these conclusions are too preliminary. Indeed, several controls/experiments need to be added to reach those conclusions.</p>
<p>Additional context you think would help readers interpret or understand the significance of the work</p>
