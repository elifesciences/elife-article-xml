<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in cells begins with the opening of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in either the plasma membrane (PM) or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and results in a dramatic increase in the physiologically low (&lt;100 nM) cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> level. The temporal and spatial Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels are well regulated to enable precise and specific activation of critical biological processes. Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling regulates pathogenic features of apicomplexan parasites like <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> which infects approximately one-third of the world’s population. <italic>T. gondii</italic> relies on Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals to stimulate traits of its infection cycle and several Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling elements play essential roles in its parasitic cycle. Active egress, an essential step for the infection cycle of <italic>T. gondii</italic> is preceded by a large increase in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> most likely by release from intracellular stores. Intracellular parasites take up Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the host cell during host Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling events to replenish intracellular stores. In this work, we investigated the mechanism by which intracellular stores are replenished with Ca<sup>2+</sup> and demonstrated a central role for the SERCA-Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase to keep not only the ER filled with Ca<sup>2+</sup> but also acidic stores. We also show mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake, by transfer of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER most likely through membrane contact sites. We propose a central role for the ER in tunneling of calcium from the extracellular milieu through the ER to other organelles.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> is an intracellular parasite from the Apicomplexan Phylum that infects approximately one third of the world population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Weiss and Dubey, 2009</xref>). During the initial infection with <italic>T. gondii</italic>, the parasite engages in multiple rounds of a lytic cycle, which consists of invasion of host cells, replication inside a parasitophorous vacuole (PV), exit from the host cell causing its lysis followed by invasion of a new host cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Black and Boothroyd, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blader <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). Cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub>) fluctuations precede the activation of several key steps of the <italic>T. gondii</italic> lytic cycle like motility, attachment, invasion, and egress ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lourido and Moreno, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hortua Triana <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). Egress from the host cell is an essential step for the infection cycle of <italic>T. gondii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bisio and Soldati-Favre, 2019</xref>) and it was shown that it is preceded by a cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Endo <italic>et al</italic>., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Borges-Pereira <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). Extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry was demonstrated in extracellular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Pace <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hortua Triana <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>) and intracellular replicating tachyzoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Vella <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). This activity was highly regulated and recent work from our lab showed that a TRP-like activity was involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Marquez-Nogueras <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is part of the signaling pathways that regulate a large number of cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Clapham, 2007</xref>). All cells express a variety of channels, transporters, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> pumps, located at the plasma membrane (PM) and/or intracellular organelles (endoplasmic reticulum (ER), acidic stores, and mitochondria) that regulate/control the concentration of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub>). A high cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration for sustained lengths of time, is toxic to cells and may result in their death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bootman and Bultynck, 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>In <italic>T. gondii</italic>, both Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through the plasma membrane and influx from intracellular stores like the ER may initiate a cascade of signaling events important for the stimulation of the biological steps of the parasite lytic cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lourido and Moreno, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hortua Triana <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations were observed in motile parasites loaded with fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lovett and Sibley, 2003</xref>) as well as expressing Genetically Encoded Calcium Indicators (GECIs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Borges-Pereira <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). The significance of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals during all stages of the lytic cycle has been demonstrated, but little is known about the mechanism by which intracellular stores contribute to cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and downstream regulation.</p>
<p>The ER, an exclusive organellar feature of eukaryotic cells, is the main store for Ca<sup>2+</sup> in most eukaryotic cells and it is widely accepted that: the ER is functionally heterogeneous with Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding proteins and Ca<sup>2+</sup> pumps and channels having a nonuniform distribution resulting in the presence of distinct subdomains within the organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Papp <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>); the ER facilitates Ca<sup>2+</sup> tunneling through its lumen as a mechanism of delivering Ca<sup>2+</sup> to targeted sites without activating inappropriate processes in the cell cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Petersen <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>); and the ER is ubiquitously distributed and is in close contact with all cellular organelles and the plasma membrane (PM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Spang, 2018</xref>). Over the past decade a new paradigm has emerged that seeks to decipher how subcellular organelles communicate with each other in order to coordinate activities and efficiently distribute ions and lipids within the cell. Numerous observations have highlighted the presence of tight, stable and yet non-fusogenic associations between organellar membranes which have since become known as membrane contact sites (MCSs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Phillips and Voeltz, 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>The secretory pathway of <italic>T. gondii</italic> is organized in a highly polarized manner with the ER being an extension of the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hager <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Tomavo <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). The ER at the apical surface of the nuclear envelope continues with the Golgi stacks and then the secretory organelles, micronemes and rhoptries, which are unique to the apicomplexan phylum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hager <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). These organelles perform important functions relevant to a successful lytic cycle like host cell attachment, invasion, and establishment of the parasitophorous vacuole (PV). Cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases, due to efflux from the ER, have been reported to initiate responses like microneme secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Carruthers and Sibley, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Nagamune <italic>et al</italic>., 2007b</xref>), conoid extrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Del Carmen <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>), invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Vieira and Moreno, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lovett and Sibley, 2003</xref>) and egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arrizabalaga and Boothroyd, 2004</xref>). These responses require precise spatiotemporal control of diverse targets and suggests the presence of distinct systems to deliver Ca<sup>2+</sup> to specific locations rather than allowing global increases, which would activate unnecessary and potentially detrimental signaling events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Huet and Moreno, 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to concentrate Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, the ER utilizes a SERCA-Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase, a transmembrane P-type ATPase, that couples ATP hydrolysis to the transport of ions across biological membranes and against a concentration gradient. SERCA pumps can be inhibited by various inhibitors including the very potent and highly specific thapsigargin (TG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Thastrup <italic>et al</italic>., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Sagara and Inesi, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>T. gondii</italic> expresses a SERCA Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase (TgSERCA), which possess SERCA conserved domains and Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites and ATPase residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Nagamune <italic>et al</italic>., 2007a</xref>). The function of TgSERCA was determined by rescue experiments of yeast cells defective in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPases and by its specific inhibition by TG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Nagamune <italic>et al</italic>., 2007a</xref>). TgSERCA was mainly localized to the ER of <italic>T. gondii</italic> but also showed a distinct distribution in extracellular parasites, where the protein was partially found in ER vesicles in the apical region near micronemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Nagamune <italic>et al</italic>., 2007a</xref>). This distribution pattern was different to the one obtained with the transient transfection of GFP-HDEL (an ER marker), which was retained near the nuclear envelope, suggesting an uneven distribution of ER markers in extracellular parasites. The authors suggested that this distribution to the apical end may be important for rapid release and effective recovery of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, events that likely govern both motility and microneme secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Nagamune <italic>et al</italic>., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Nagamune <italic>et al</italic>., 2007b</xref>). In this work we characterize the mechanism by which the ER efficiently takes up Ca<sup>2+</sup> promptly after the ion enters the cytosol from the extracellular milieu. We also characterize the role of the ER in transferring Ca<sup>2+</sup> to other stores. We propose a model in which the ER is the distribution center for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and due to the high Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity of the SERCA Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase the ER is highly efficient at storing Ca<sup>2+</sup> and transferring it to other compartments.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> predominantly fills the endoplasmic reticulum and acidic stores</title>
<p>We first set up experiments to follow the destination of Ca<sup>2+</sup> taken up by extracellular tachyzoites from the extracellular milieu into their cytosol. Tachyzoites were loaded with the ratiometric Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator Fura-2 and incubated in Ringer buffer containing 100 µM EGTA to chelate extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, preventing its uptake, and investigated the release of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> pools by different inhibitors.</p>
<p>When thapsigargin (TG), which inhibits the activity of SERCA, was added, it prevented the re-uptake of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the ER and unmasked the leakage of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER into the cytosol, causing a Ca<sup>2+</sup> cytosolic increase of approximately 160 nM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and S1A). We compared this with the effect of ionomycin (IO), a Ca<sup>2+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> ionophore which acts on neutral intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores, inducing depletion of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, mainly from the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Smith <italic>et al</italic>., 1989</xref>). Exposure of <italic>T. gondii</italic> to 1 µM ionomycin caused a cytosolic increase of approximately 700-1100 nM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Fig. S1A-B). We next tested another SERCA inhibitor, cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), with a different mode of action than TG. CPA caused a lower Ca<sup>2+</sup> cytosolic increase than the one caused by TG, possibly implying less specificity toward TgSERCA (Fig. S1B). Exposure of parasites to TG before CPA ablated CPA’s effect, but this did not occur when adding CPA prior to TG (Fig. S1C-D). Although TG does a better job at depleting the ER of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the increase of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> after adding TG is un-impressive when compared to the effect of IO (Fig. S1A). This result could indicate the presence of other calcium stores not inhibited by TG or simply that TG was not very efficient at blocking TgSERCA.</p>

</fig>
<p>Next, we tested the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in the filling of intracellular stores by measuring the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases in response to inhibitors after pre-exposing the parasite suspension to extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C-F</xref>, <italic>dark traces</italic>). Addition of 1.8 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> caused a cytosolic increase due to influx through a partially characterized plasma membrane pathway (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, <italic>dark blue trace</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Pace <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). This Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx appeared to be immediately taken up by the ER as the response to TG was much greater in parasites previously exposed to extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (compare light and dark blue traces) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). We next tested the lysosomotropic agent glycyl-L-phenylalanine-naphthylamide (GPN), which mobilizes Ca<sup>2+</sup> from acidic organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Haller <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lloyd-Evans <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Miranda <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Yuan <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>) and observed a similar pattern (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). The cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase upon addition to GPN in parasites previously exposed to extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> was much greater than in cells not exposed to extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>, <italic>compare light and dark blue traces</italic>). A similar phenomenon was observed when adding nigericin (acting on acidic stores) or CCCP (most likely acting on mitochondria) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs 1E-F</xref>, <italic>dark purple and orange traces, respectively</italic>). These data indicate that the ER, mitochondrion, and PLVAC and other acidic stores, all appear to have the ability to access extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The ER displayed the highest capacity to access a large portion of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, with TG inducing close to ∼500-900 nM of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release after pre-exposure to Ca<sup>2+</sup> and only 210 nM Ca<sup>2+</sup> without Ca<sup>2+</sup> pre-exposure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, upon pre-exposure of <italic>T. gondii</italic> to physiological levels of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the ER, mitochondria, and acidic stores exhibited the capacity to release many times more Ca<sup>2+</sup> than without pre-exposure, with the ER and GPN-sensitive stores displaying the greatest response (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G</xref>).</p>
<p>We next hypothesized that if the ER is the most efficient organelle to access extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and pass it to the other organelles, it should be possible to see an increased response to agonists like GPN and nigericin after inhibiting SERCA with TG permitting the buildup of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane. For the next experiment we added Ca<sup>2+</sup> to fill the stores, followed by TG to cause Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux from the ER, and then GPN (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). We compared the response to GPN between plus and minus the addition of TG and observed that the cytosolic increase caused by GPN when preceded by TG was significantly larger (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). We followed the same approach with nigericin and observed that the response increased after the addition of TG (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>). These experiments support our hypothesis that extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> is used to fill the ER and from the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> can be distributed to other organelles.</p>

<title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake by the SERCA-Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase in permeabilized tachyzoites</title>
<p>The previous results highlighted an important role for the ER in taking up Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the cytoplasm after an increase due to influx from the extracellular milieu. We believe that this ER uptake, essential for keeping stores filled with Ca<sup>2+</sup>, is due to the high Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity of TgSERCA. The SERCA functions as an essential mechanism for the ER to maintain its Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, an especially important function considering the leakage of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER into the cytosol which occurs constitutively and passively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Camello <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>We developed a protocol that allowed us to measure directly Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake by the store where the SERCA is localized (ER), based in the compartmentation of a fluorescent dye in permeabilized cells. We used the low affinity indicator MagFluo4 which has a Kd for Ca<sup>2+</sup> of 22 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Rossi and Taylor, 2020</xref>). The cytosolic concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in <italic>T. gondii</italic> is around ∼70 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Moreno and Zhong, 1996</xref>), which is considerably below the detection limit of MagFluo4. We loaded parasites for an extended length of time and using high concentrations of MagFluo4-AM as the intention was for the indicator to compartmentalize. At the end of the incubation, parasites were washed and exposed to low concentration of digitonin, which permeabilized the plasma membrane leaving the organellar membranes intact. Under these conditions we had parasites loaded with a Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator inside organelles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). We next determined the capacity of these permeabilized parasites to take up Ca<sup>2+</sup>. SERCA activity is dependent on the presence of Mg-ATP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>) and we added this substrate under defined concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (determined using the MaxChelator program). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bers <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>). We observed that under these conditions a consistent and reproducible Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake was measured that was optimal at 220 nM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and 500 µM MgATP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs 2B-C</xref>). Validation that this activity was due to SERCA is shown in the experiment in which we added TG highlighting the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> leakage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Note that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> released by TG appears to be modest but the Kd of the indicator is 22 µM so a small decrease is highly significant when considering the amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> that it represents. Ionomycin can be more effective and larger amounts of Ca<sup>2+</sup> were released from the ER and other stores as the minimum reached is lower than the starting level of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>).</p>

<p>In summary, these results showed that we can measure SERCA activity <italic>in situ</italic> in permeabilized parasites with the low affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator MagFluo4. This activity is dependent on MgATP and TG causes release of the accumulated Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The better effect of IO could be due to Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from other compartments driven by other ATPases (TgA1).</p>

<title>TgSERCA and the <italic>T. gondii</italic> lytic cycle</title>
<p>To investigate the role of TgSERCA (TGGT1_230420) in the biology of <italic>T. gondii</italic> we created conditional KOs (<italic>iΔTgserca</italic>) by inserting a tetracycline regulatable element at the 5’ end of the gene to control the expression of the gene with ATc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Sheiner <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). In addition, we endogenously tagged TgSERCA with HA. We isolated clonal cell lines of <italic>iΔTgserca</italic> and clones expressing <italic>iΔTgserca-HA</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Western blots (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>) and immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. S2) showed that the expression of TgSERCA is tightly regulated by ATc and it is absent after 1.5 days in culture. The growth of the <italic>iΔTgserca</italic> was severely retarded when cultured in the presence of ATc as evaluated by plaque assays (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C-D</xref>). In this assay, parasites engage in repetitive cycles of invasion, replication, and egress causing host cell lysis and formation of plaques in confluent monolayers infected with <italic>T. gondii</italic>. Replication was severely impacted after down regulation of SERCA, and parasites were unable to proceed after one or two replication cycles (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E-F</xref>). All (100%) PVs of the ATc cultured mutant contained 4 parasites or less (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>, <italic>bar graph on the right</italic>). Invasion of host cells was also reduced in the <italic>iΔTgserca</italic> (+ATc) mutant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>) and egress stimulated by ionomycin, or natural egress followed pre-incubation with Compound 1, was significantly decreased. Interestingly, when testing egress after the addition of saponin in the presence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, we observed that the tachyzoites egressed sooner (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>, <italic>saponin egress</italic>). This could be because as the SERCA is not active, the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase due to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx from the extracellular milieu after saponin permeabilization cannot be compensated. In addition, the natural efflux from the ER would result in a higher cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase that would cause a faster egress.</p>

<title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake by the SERCA-ATPase is essential for filling acidic Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores</title>
<p>The <italic>iΔTgserca</italic> mutant showed a low response to TG (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), when measuring cytosolic calcium (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) which was also the case when adding TG after extracellular calcium to fill the store (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). This was most likely the result of the lower activity of TgSERCA. Note that the change in Ca<sup>2+</sup> in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> (<italic>TatiΔku80</italic> cells) is larger than in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> (RH strain) and we believe that the difference is related to the characteristics of each cell line (RH vs TatiΔku80). In addition, Mg-ATP-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake by permeabilized cells measured with MagFluo4 showed no TgSERCA activity after 48 h of culture with ATc (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). This experiment validated the MagFluo4 approach for determination of SERCA activity. At 24 hours after culturing the parasites with ATc there was still some SERCA activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry measured in Fura2 loaded <italic>iΔTgserca</italic> (±ATc) parasites was not affected by the downregulation of TgSERCA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Interestingly, the cytosolic resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration was not affected in the <italic>iΔTgserca</italic> (+ATc) mutant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A,B, D-H</xref>) pointing to a critical role of the plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> pump in the homeostasis of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The response to Zaprinast was diminished but was still present (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>) indicating that Zaprinast acts by releasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER and from an additional compartment. Adding Zaprinast after calcium also resulted in a reduced response in the mutant pre-incubated with ATc (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>). We next tested GPN, which acts mostly on acidic stores and the response was also decreased (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). Adding GPN after replenishing the cells with Ca<sup>2+</sup> resulted in an increased response as we showed in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, but this response was also reduced when the mutant was grown with ATc (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). These results support a link between the stores on which GPN is acting upon and the ER. Considering that downregulation of SERCA impacted the ER storage of Ca<sup>2+</sup> but did not affect cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake, the diminished response to GPN, supports that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> released/leaked from the ER plays an important role in filling the GPN’s targeted store.</p>

<title>The mitochondrion takes up Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER</title>
<p>In mammalian cells, the high concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the ER is important for the production of mitochondrial ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wenzel <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). This is because of the close proximity between the ER and mitochondria which allows for the directional flow of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER to the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gincel <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Rapizzi <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>).

<p>We reasoned that the mitochondrion could be taking up Ca<sup>2+</sup> through close membrane contacts with the ER as it is possible that the concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in those microdomains could reach much higher levels than in the cytosol and would allow for mitochondrial uptake. We next loaded the <italic>Tgsod2gcamp6</italic> mutant with Fura2 and measured, first, if adding extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> to the parasite suspension led to an increase in GCaMP6 fluorescence. Parallel experiments looking at cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> showed that adding extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> does result in an increase in the cytosol, however mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> was not affected (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D-E</xref>). We next added TG followed by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and this led to an increase in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> but only TG resulted in a measurable increase in fluorescence of the mitochondrial indicator (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5G</xref>). Our interpretation is that after adding TG, there was accumulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> at the outer side of the ER membrane leading to an increased concentration of the ion which activated mitochondrial uptake.</p>
<p>We next inserted the <italic>SOD2GCaMP6</italic> chimeric gene in the <italic>iΔTgserca</italic> mutant and isolated the clonal mutant <italic>iΔTgserca</italic>-<italic>sod2gcamp6.</italic> We first looked at mitochondrial uptake after adding TG and as shown previously, the parasites cultured without ATc showed a measurable and consistent increase in GCaMP fluorescence after adding TG (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>, <italic>blue trace</italic>). This was abolished in cells cultured in the presence of ATc as the low expression of TgSERCA would result in the ER depletion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>, <italic>pink trace</italic>). Interestingly, we observed an increase in the GCaMP fluorescence after adding GPN, ionomycin or Zaprinast (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H-J</xref>, <italic>blue traces</italic>). In all cases the fluorescence increase was muted in the <italic>iΔTgserca</italic> (+ATc) and the difference in the response was always significant (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H-J</xref>, <italic>pink traces</italic>).</p>
<p>In summary, we demonstrated that the mitochondrion of <italic>T. gondii</italic> can take up Ca<sup>2+</sup> through its transfer from the ER, a phenomenon that becomes evident after blocking the ER uptake with TG as the concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> needed to activate the uptake is very high and only reachable at membrane contact sites between the ER and mitochondria. The <italic>iΔTgserca</italic> (+ATc) mutant, is unable to keep the ER filled with Ca<sup>2+</sup> and this impacts the capacity of the mitochondria to take up Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The mitochondria could be also taking up Ca<sup>2+</sup> directly from acidic stores, which became depleted when TgSERCA was downregulated.</p>

<title>Interaction between the ER and the mitochondrion and acidic compartments</title>
<p>We next investigated if it was possible to see interaction between the ER with other organelles by IFA and/or EM. We performed IFAs with ER and mitochondria markers and ER and PLVAC markers (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). We observed that in intracellular parasites the mitochondrion surrounds the ER and multiple potential points of interaction are seen (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref> and supplemental video 1). The mitochondrion of intracellular <italic>T. gondii</italic> tachyzoites surrounds the periphery of the cell in a lasso-shape morphology. In extracellular parasites the mitochondrion changes drastically its shape adopting either a sperm-like or a collapsed conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Ovciarikova <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref> and supplemental video 2). Our hypothesis is that this retraction of the mitochondrion allows the ER to expand in extracellular parasites into ER tubules, which extend toward the apical domain of the parasite where Ca<sup>2+</sup> is needed for secretion of micronemes and conoid extrusion.</p>

</fig>
<p>The PLVAC also showed points of contact with the ER (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref> and supplemental video 3). Multiple points of contact were also observed by EM between the ER and the PLVAC, the ER and the apicoplast and the ER and the mitochondrion (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly these contacts were still present in the <italic>iΔTgserca</italic> (+ATc) mutant (Fig. S3, A-D), as most likely TgSERCA would not be directly involved in the establishment of contacts. We quantified the length of the limiting membrane of the organelle in contact with ER tubules at a distance of less than 30 nM and found that after knockdown of TgSERCA, the contact was not altered. However, Calcium transported from the ER into the mitochondrion after thapsigargin treatment was significantly decreased which means that this phenotype is due to reduced ER Calcium and not to lack of contacts (Fig. S3E). A similar result was seen when measuring contacts between the ER and the apicoplast (Fig. S3F) and between the ER and the PLVAC (Fig. S3G).</p>
<p>In summary, this data showed that the ER form contacts with other organelles like the mitochondrion, the PLVAC and the apicoplast and these contacts could be the ones allowing the transfer of Calcium from the ER, the store with the highest amount of Calcium, to the other organelles. The SERCA high affinity for Calcium is critical for the filling of the ER. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the uptake by the other organelles is less clear. Very little is known about the structure and composition of Membrane Contact Sites in <italic>T. gondii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Huet and Moreno, 2023</xref>). However, functional evidence for the transfer of Calcium has been demonstrated for the ER-apicoplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>) and in this work we presented evidence for the transfer of Calcium between the ER and the mitochondrion and the ER and the PLVAC.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this work we showed that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of <italic>T. gondii</italic> has an impressive capacity for capturing Ca<sup>2+</sup> that enters the cytosol from the extracellular milieu, and it accomplishes this with a minimal increase in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. This is the result of a highly efficient SERCA Ca<sup>2+-</sup>ATPase (TgSERCA) which also showed high affinity for Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The TgSERCA activity combined with the plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> pump (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Luo <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Luo <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>) would not allow the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> to increase above 200 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hortua Triana <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>We also provide evidence of the ER’s capacity for sharing Ca<sup>2+</sup> with other organelles, which originates from the ER unique ability to capture a sizable portion of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. We showed that extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> can be efficiently taken up into the ER through the activity of SERCA and from the ER it can be transferred to other compartments like the mitochondria and acidic stores. These activities would ensure that Ca<sup>2+</sup> is released at specific locations without flooding the whole cell with Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which may trigger unnecessary signals. Although initial data suggested a less important role for the mitochondria and PLVAC in Ca<sup>2+</sup> storage, our results showed that these organelles may become more relevant Ca<sup>2+</sup> reservoirs during ER calcium overload The SERCA Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase is a P-type ATPase found in the membranes of the ER and the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kuhlbrandt, 2004</xref>). The mammalian genome encodes for three SERCA pumps: SERCA1, SERCA2, and SERCA3, and seven different isoforms expressed from these genes, SERCA1a/1b, SERCA2a/2b, and SERCA3a/3b/3c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Periasamy and Kalyanasundaram, 2007</xref>). SERCA2b is the most widespread of all isoforms and phylogenetically likely the oldest and considered the house-keeping isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Wuytack <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). SERCA pumps translocate two Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions and hydrolyze one ATP for each catalytic turnover. This pumping activity serves several roles. By translocating Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the cytosol into the lumen of the ER, it restores the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration to its low resting level (&lt;100 nM). The stored Ca<sup>2+</sup> can be released and activate many cellular activities. In addition, SERCA maintains a sufficiently high (∼500 mM) luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration that is necessary for enzyme activities important for proliferation, growth, and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Wuytack <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>T. gondii</italic> appears to express a single SERCA protein (TgSERCA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Nagamune and Sibley, 2006</xref>), most likely playing a housekeeping role like the mammalian SERCA2. This was evident from the strong phenotype of the <italic>iΔTgserca</italic> (+ATc) mutant, which could not replicate after 24 h and was defective for all the steps of the tachyzoite lytic cycle. The activity of TgSERCA was highly dependent on the presence of its substrate MgATP and it showed high affinity for Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Considering the low affinity of the indicator Magfluo4 (Kd: 22 µM), the measured uptake activity and the accumulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> was impressive as it was evident even at 55 nM free calcium. This result signified that TgSERCA is highly efficient at keeping the cytosol at the low 60-100 nM level as well as efficiently filling the ER with Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p>
<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are specifically contingent on their spatial, temporal and amplitude features. Movement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the cytosol of cells is severely limited due to the presence of high affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers. The concept of Ca<sup>2+</sup> tunneling through the ER proposed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> would move more easily within the lumen of the ER as its binding capacity is almost 100 lower than the binding capacity of the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Mogami <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>) and the high mobility of Ca<sup>2+</sup> through the lumen of the ER was directly demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Park <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>), and especially important in polarized cells. In addition, the ER facilitates Ca<sup>2+</sup> tunneling through its lumen as a mechanism of delivering Ca<sup>2+</sup> to targeted sites without activating inappropriate processes in the cell cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Petersen <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). In <italic>T. gondii</italic>, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding capacity of the cytosol compared to the ER is less known as the localization of all its predicted Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding proteins have not been completely determined and several calmodulin-like proteins showed localization to the conoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Long <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>In <italic>T. gondii</italic> cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases, due to efflux from the ER, have been reported to initiate essential parasite traits like microneme secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Carruthers and Sibley, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Nagamune <italic>et al</italic>., 2007b</xref>), conoid extrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Del Carmen <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>), invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Vieira and Moreno, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lovett and Sibley, 2003</xref>) and egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arrizabalaga <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). These responses require precise spatiotemporal control of diverse targets and suggests the presence of distinct systems to deliver Ca<sup>2+</sup> to specific locations. Our hypothesis is that the ER plays a central role by distributing Ca<sup>2+</sup> to those locations at specific times for the initiation of parasite functions. The strong invasion, replication and egress phenotypes of the <italic>iΔTgserca</italic> (+ATc) supports this hypothesis.</p>
<p>In mammalian cells Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion is transferred from the ER to the mitochondrion through the outer membrane voltage-dependent anion channel1 (VDAC1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gincel <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Rapizzi <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>) and the inner membrane calcium uniporter (MCU1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">De Stefani <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). A VDAC homologue is present in <italic>T. gondii</italic>, which was shown to be essential for growth and for mitochondrial and ER morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Mallo <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). However, the molecular evidence for the presence of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter in the inner mitochondrial membrane driven by the electrochemical gradient generated by the electron transport is not supported by the genome database. Calcium transport into the <italic>T. gondii</italic> mitochondrion had not been previously shown and our data represents the first experimental evidence showing this event although the mechanism is less clear. We showed that it has very low affinity for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and it was only possible to observe it in intact parasites after inhibiting SERCA, which allowed the increase of the concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> at the local ER membrane. Over the past decade a new concept about the communication between subcellular organelles through tight, stable, and yet non-fusogenic associations known as membrane contact sites (MCSs) has emerged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Phillips and Voeltz, 2016</xref>). The ER forms an extensive network of MCSs with the PM, mitochondria and endocytic vesicles for the exchange of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Burgoyne <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>In <italic>T. gondii</italic> the characterization of MCSs is only in its beginnings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Huet and Moreno, 2023</xref>) with only a few evidences for their presence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Tomova <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Mallo <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Ovciarikova <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>) and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Oliveira Souza <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). When <italic>T. gondii</italic> is intracellular, microscopy observations showed that its mitochondrion surrounds the periphery of the cell in a lasso-shape conformation. On the other hand, in extracellular parasites the mitochondrion changes its morphology and adopts a sperm-like or collapsed conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Ovciarikova <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). Our IFA analysis with ER and mitochondrial markers showed that the lasso-shaped mitochondrion surrounds the ER with plenty of opportunities for contact between both organelles. We speculate that at this stage the mitochondrion is buffering any leakage of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER to prevent premature egress as a cytosolic increase would stimulate motility and possibly egress.</p>
<p>In this work, we showed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> can be transferred from the ER to the mitochondrion, most likely through MCSs as the low affinity of the mitochondrion would not permit uptake directly from the cytosol. Down regulation of TgSERCA resulted in diminished response to acidic stores triggers, which supported that the ER may also be responsible for their filling. The mitochondrion may also be able to take up Ca<sup>2+</sup> from acidic stores like the PLVAC as GPN was also able to stimulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and the response was diminished in the <italic>iΔTgserca</italic> (+ATc) mutant. Transfer of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from acidic stores to the mitochondrion was impacted by the ER depletion (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>).</p>

The mitochondria take up Calcium from the ER through an unknown mechanism. VDAC could be involved in the transfer through the outer mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Mallo <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>).

<p>In conclusion, this study showed how the ER of <italic>T. gondii</italic> replenish itself with calcium and how it supplies Ca<sup>2+</sup> to the cytosol for signaling and to acidic stores and the mitochondrion. <italic>T. gondii</italic> is a protozoan parasite that causes disease by reiterating a lytic cycle that is driven by calcium signaling. This work contributes to the understanding of how extracellular and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores work together to sustain the pathologic features of <italic>T. gondii</italic>. Future studies would aim at finding more about the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in mitochondrial and acidic stores functions.</p>

<title>Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
<p>For ultrastructural observations of intracellular <italic>T. gondii</italic> by thin-section transmission electron microscopy (EM), infected human foreskin fibroblast cells were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 mM sodium cacodylate (EMS) and processed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Coppens and Joiner, 2003</xref>). Ultrathin sections of infected host cells were stained before examination with a Hitachi 7600 EM under 80 kV. For quantitative measurement of distance between organelles, the closest point between <italic>T. gondii’s</italic> organelles and ER membrane was measured using ImageJ and was performed on 47 representative electron micrographs at the same magnification for accurate comparison between organelles</p>

<p>Li et al. investigate Ca2+ signaling in T. gondii and argue that Ca2+ tunnels through the ER to other organelles to fuel multiple aspects of T. gondii biology. They focus in particular on TgSERCA as the presumed primary mechanism for ER Ca2+ filling. Although, when TgSERCA was knocked out there was still a Ca2+ release in response to TG present. Overall the Ca2+ signaling data do not support the conclusion of Ca2+ tunneling through the ER to other organelles in fact they argue for direct Ca2+ uptake from the cytosol into the organelles as outlined in the specific points below. The authors show EM membrane contact sites between the ER and other organelles, so Ca2+ released by the ER could presumably be taken up by other organelles but that is not ER Ca2+ tunneling. They clearly show that SERCA is required for T. gondii function. Overall, the data presented to not fully support the conclusions reached.</p>

<p>The present study focuses on calcium pools and fluxes in the unicellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii, and in particular on the role of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium pump TgSERCA in sequestering and redistributing calcium to other intracellular organelles following influx at the plasma membrane. Calcium sequestration by the ER and its interactions with other intracellular organelles, including the concept of tunneling through the ER, have been extensively characterized in mammalian cells and a number of other higher eukaryotes. However, these pathways are still not well understood in many organisms, including protist pathogens such as Toxoplasma. In addition, T. gondii has unique organelles not found in most other organisms, including the apicoplast and the plant-like vacuolar compartment (PLVAC). Moreover, the fact that T. gondii transitions through life cycle stages within and exterior to the host cells, with very different exposures to calcium, adds significance to the current investigation of the role of the ER in redistributing calcium following exposure to physiological levels of extracellular calcium.</p>
<p>The authors have provided significant new information on the T. gondii SERCA, including its ATP- and calcium-dependence, subcellular localization, and role in taking up calcium from the cytosol when cells are exposed to high extracellular calcium. They also use a conditional knockout of TgSERCA to investigate its role in ER calcium store-filling and the ability of other subcellular organelles to sequester and release calcium. These knockout experiments provide important evidence that ER calcium uptake plays a significant role in maintaining the filling state of other intracellular compartments.</p>
<p>While it is clearly demonstrated, and not surprising, that the addition of 1.8 mM extracellular CaCl2 to intact T. gondii parasites preincubated with EGTA leads to an increase in cytosolic calcium and subsequent enhanced loading of the ER and other intracellular compartments, there is a caveat to the quantitation of these increases in calcium loading. The authors rely on the amplitude of cytosolic free calcium increases in response to thapsigargin, GPN, nigericin, and CCCP, all measured with fura2. This likely overestimates the changes in calcium pool sizes because the buffering of free calcium in the cytosol is nonlinear, and fura2 (with a Kd of 100-200 nM) is a substantial, if not predominant, cytosolic calcium buffer. Indeed, the increases in signal noise at higher cytosolic calcium levels (e.g. peak calcium in Figure 1C) are indicative of fura2 ratio calculations approaching saturation of the indicator dye.</p>
<p>Another caveat, not addressed, is that loading of fura2/AM can result in compartmentalized fura2, which might modify free calcium levels and calcium storage capacity in intracellular organelles.</p>
<p>The finding that the SERCA inhibitor cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) only mobilizes a fraction of the thapsigargin-sensitive calcium stores in T. gondii coincides with previously published work in another apicomplexan parasite, P. falciparum, showing that thapsigargin mobilizes calcium from both CPA-sensitive and CPA-insensitive calcium pools (Borges-Pereira et al., 2020, DOI: 10.1074/jbc.RA120.014906). It would be valuable to determine whether this reflects the off-target effects of thapsigargin or the differential sensitivity of TgSERCA to the two inhibitors.</p>
<p>The authors interpret the residual calcium mobilization response to Zaprinast observed after ATc knockdown of TgSERCA (Figures 4E, 4F) as indicative of a target calcium pool in addition to the ER. While this may well be correct, it appears from the description of this experiment that it was carried out using the same conditions as Figure 4A where TgSERCA activity was only reduced by about 50%.</p>
<p>The data in Figures 4A vs 4G and Figures 4B vs 4H indicate that the size of the response to GPN is similar to that with thapsigargin in both the presence and absence of extracellular calcium. This raises the question of whether GPN is only releasing calcium from acidic compartments or whether it acts on the ER calcium stores, as previously suggested by Atakpa et al. 2019 DOI: 10.1242/jcs.223883. Nonetheless, Figure 1H shows that there is a robust calcium response to GPN after the addition of thapsigargin.</p>
<p>An important advance in the current work is the use of state-of-the-art approaches with targeted genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) to monitor calcium in important subcellular compartments. The authors have previously done this with the apicoplast, but now add the mitochondria to their repertoire. Despite the absence of a canonical mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) in the Toxoplasma genome, the authors demonstrate the ability of T. gondii mitochondrial to accumulate calcium, albeit at high calcium concentrations. Although the calcium concentrations here are higher than needed for mammalian mitochondrial calcium uptake, there too calcium uptake requires calcium levels higher than those typically attained in the bulk cytosolic compartment. And just like in mammalian mitochondria, the current work shows that ER calcium release can elicit mitochondrial calcium loading even when other sources of elevated cytosolic calcium are ineffective, suggesting a role for ER-mitochondrial membrane contact sites. With these new tools in hand, it will be of great value to elucidate the bioenergetics and transport pathways associated with mitochondrial calcium accumulation in T. gondi.</p>
<p>The current studies of calcium pools and their interactions with the ER and dependence on SERCA activity in T. gondi are complemented by super-resolution microscopy and electron microscopy that do indeed demonstrate the presence of close appositions between the ER and other organelles (see also videos). Thus, the work presented provides good evidence for the ER acting as the orchestrating organelle delivering calcium to other subcellular compartments through contact sites in T. gondi, as has become increasingly clear from work in other organisms.</p>

<p>This manuscript describes an investigation of how intracellular calcium stores are regulated and provides evidence that is in line with the role of the SERCA-Ca2+-ATPase in this important homeostasis pathway. Calcium uptake by mitochondria is further investigated and the authors suggest that ER-mitochondria membrane contact sites may be involved in mediating this, as demonstrated in other organisms.</p>
<p>The significance of the findings is in shedding light on key elements within the mechanism of calcium storage and regulation/homeostasis in the medically important parasite Toxoplasma gondii whose ability to infect and cause disease critically relies on calcium signalling. An important strength is that despite its importance, calcium homeostasis in Toxoplasma is understudied and not well understood.</p>
<p>A difficulty in the field, and a weakness of the work, is that following calcium in the cell is technically challenging and thus requires reliance on artificial conditions. In this context, the main weakness of the manuscript is the extrapolation of data. The language used could be more careful, especially considering that the way to measure the ER calcium is highly artificial - for example utilising permeabilization and over-loading the experiment with calcium. Measures are also indirect - for example, when the response to ionomycin treatment was not fully in line with the suggested model the authors hypothesise that the result is likely affected by other storage, but there is no direct support for that.</p>
<p>Below we provide some suggestions to improve controls, however, even with those included, we would still be in favour of revising the language and trying to avoid making strong and definitive conclusions. For example, in the discussion perhaps replace &quot;showed&quot; with &quot;provide evidence that are consistent with...&quot;; replace or remove words like &quot;efficiently&quot; and &quot;impressive&quot;; revise the definitive language used in the last few lines of the abstract (lines 13-17); etc. Importantly we recommend reconsidering whether the data is sufficiently direct and unambiguous to justify the model proposed in Figure 7 (we are in favour of removing this figure at this early point of our understanding of the calcium dynamic between organelles in Toxoplasma).</p>
<p>Another important weakness is poor referencing of previous work in the field. Lines 248-250 read almost as if the authors originally hypothesised the idea that calcium is shuttled between ER and mitochondria via membrane contact sites (MCS) - but there is extensive literature on other eukaryotes which should be first cited and discussed in this context. Likewise, the discussion of MCS in Toxoplasma does not include the body of work already published on this parasite by several groups. It is informative to discuss observations in light of what is already known.</p>

<p>Note that we did not knockout SERCA as it is an essential gene so it would not be possible to isolate parasites that do not express SERCA. We created conditional mutants that downregulate the expression of SERCA and some activity is present in the mutant after 24 h of ATc treatment.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the data does not support Ca2+ tunneling as defined and characterized in mammalian cells. In response to this comment, we modified the title and the text accordingly.</p>
<p>However, we think that the study shows far more than just the role of SERCA in T. gondii functions. We argue that the study shows that the ER (through the activity of the SERCA pump) sequesters and re-distributes calcium to other organelles following influx through the PM. The experiments show that the ER is able to take calcium from the cytosol as it enters the parasite through SERCA activity, and this activity is important for the transition of the parasite between various extracellular calcium exposures. We believe that the role of the ER in redistributing calcium following exposure to physiological levels of extracellular calcium is demonstrated in the experiments shown in Figs 1H-I, 4G-H and 5G,H, I, J, K . There are no previous T. gondii studies that address the question of how intracellular stores are filled with calcium, which are essential for the continuation of the lytic cycle, meaning they are essential for the parasitism of T. gondii.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Data argue for direct Ca2+ uptake from the cytosol</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The ER most likely takes up calcium from the cytosol following its entry through the PM and redistributes it to the other organelles. We will delete the word “tunneling” and replace it with transfer and re-distribution as they represent our results.</p>
<p>What we think is re-distribution is shown in Figure 1H and I in which the calcium released after GPN and nigericin are enhanced after TG addition. Of note is that there is no experimental evidence that supports the regulation of calcium entry by store depletion (PMID: 24867952), and we do not think that the enhanced response is due to calcium entry.</p>
<p>Figure 4G and H show that knocking down SERCA reduces significantly the response to GPN. Fig 5I shows that the mitochondrial calcium uptake is reduced after the addition of GPN in the knockdown mutant. Fig 2B shows that SERCA can take up calcium at 55 nM calcium while mitochondrial uptake needs higher concentrations (Fig 5B-C). However, higher calcium concentrations could be reached at the microdomains formed around MCS between the ER and mitochondrion. Figure 5E shows that the mitochondrion is not responsive to an increase of cytosolic calcium. This is also shown for the apicoplast in Fig. 7 E and F of the Li et al, Nat Commun 2021 paper.</p>

<p>We agree about the limitations of using Fura2 but according to the literature (PMID:3838314, fig. 3) Fura2 is suitable for measurements between 100 nM and 1 mM calcium.  The responses in our experiments were within its linear range and the experiments with the SERCA mutant and mitochondrial GCaMPs supports the conclusions of our work.</p>
<p>We agree that the experiment shown in Fig 1C shows a response close to the limit of the linear range of Fura2 and we can provide a more representative trace in the final article. We can include new quantifications and comparisons.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Another caveat, not addressed, is that loading of fura2/AM can result in compartmentalized fura2, which might modify free calcium levels and calcium storage capacity in intracellular organelles.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are aware of this issue and because of that we have modified our protocol to minimize compartmentalization. We load cells for 26 min at room temperature and keep cells in ice and do not use them for longer that 2-3 hours because we do see evidence of compartmentalization. One evidence of compartmentalization is the increase in the resting calcium concentration.</p>

<p>The finding that the SERCA inhibitor cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) only mobilizes a fraction of the thapsigargin-sensitive calcium stores in T. gondii coincides with previously published work in another apicomplexan parasite, P. falciparum, showing that thapsigargin mobilizes calcium from both CPA-sensitive and CPA-insensitive calcium pools (Borges-Pereira et al., 2020, DOI: 10.1074/jbc.RA120.014906). It would be valuable to determine whether this reflects the off-target effects of thapsigargin or the differential sensitivity of TgSERCA to the two inhibitors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an interesting observation, and we will discuss the result considering the Plasmodium study and include the citation. We will add inhibition curves using the MagFluo protocol and compare CPA and TG.</p>
<p>Figure S1 suggests differential sensitivity, and it shows that thapsigargin mobilizes calcium from both CPA-sensitive and CPA-insensitive calcium pools in T. gondii. Also important is that we used 1 µM TG as we are aware that TG has shown off-target effects at higher concentrations.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors interpret the residual calcium mobilization response to Zaprinast observed after ATc knockdown of TgSERCA (Figures 4E, 4F) as indicative of a target calcium pool in addition to the ER. While this may well be correct, it appears from the description of this experiment that it was carried out using the same conditions as Figure 4A where TgSERCA activity was only reduced by about 50%.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We partially agree as pointed by the reviewer knock down of TgSERCA by only 50% means that the ER still could be targeted by zaprinast and no evidence of another target calcium pool. From the MagFLuo4 experiment (although we are aware that the fluorescence of mag Fluo4 is not linear to calcium), there is SERCA activity after 24 hr of ATc treatment.  However, when adding Zaprinast after TG we see a significant release of calcium which is true for both wild type and conditional knockdowns. Because of this result we proposed that there could be another large neutral calcium pool than the one mobilized by TG. We will address these possibilities in the discussion and interpretation of the result.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The data in Figures 4A vs 4G and Figures 4B vs 4H indicate that the size of the response to GPN is similar to that with thapsigargin in both the presence and absence of extracellular calcium. This raises the question of whether GPN is only releasing calcium from acidic compartments or whether it acts on the ER calcium stores, as previously suggested by Atakpa et al. 2019 DOI: 10.1242/jcs.223883. Nonetheless, Figure 1H shows that there is a robust calcium response to GPN after the addition of thapsigargin.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The results of the experiments did not exclude the possibility that GPN can also mobilize some calcium from the ER besides acidic organelles. We don’t have any evidence to support that GPN can mobilize calcium from the ER either. Based on our unpublished work, we think GPN mainly release calcium from the PLVAC. We will include the mentioned citation and discuss the result considering the possibility that GPN may be acting on the ER.</p>

<p>An important advance in the current work is the use of state-of-the-art approaches with targeted genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) to monitor calcium in important subcellular compartments. The authors have previously done this with the apicoplast, but now add the mitochondria to their repertoire. Despite the absence of a canonical mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) in the Toxoplasma genome, the authors demonstrate the ability of T. gondii mitochondrial to accumulate calcium, albeit at high calcium concentrations. Although the calcium concentrations here are higher than needed for mammalian mitochondrial calcium uptake, there too calcium uptake requires calcium levels higher than those typically attained in the bulk cytosolic compartment. And just like in mammalian mitochondria, the current work shows that ER calcium release can elicit mitochondrial calcium loading even when other sources of elevated cytosolic calcium are ineffective, suggesting a role for ER-mitochondrial membrane contact sites. With these new tools in hand, it will be of great value to elucidate the bioenergetics and transport pathways associated with mitochondrial calcium accumulation in T. gondii.</p>

<p>We thank this reviewer for his/her positive comment. Studies of bioenergetics and transport pathways associated with mitochondrial calcium accumulation is part of our future plans.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The current studies of calcium pools and their interactions with the ER and dependence on SERCA activity in T. gondi are complemented by super-resolution microscopy and electron microscopy that do indeed demonstrate the presence of close appositions between the ER and other organelles (see also videos). Thus, the work presented provides good evidence for the ER acting as the orchestrating organelle delivering calcium to other subcellular compartments through contact sites in T. gondi, as has become increasingly clear from work in other organisms.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>This manuscript describes an investigation of how intracellular calcium stores are regulated and provides evidence that is in line with the role of the SERCA-Ca2+-ATPase in this important homeostasis pathway. Calcium uptake by mitochondria is further investigated and the authors suggest that ER-mitochondria membrane contact sites may be involved in mediating this, as demonstrated in other organisms.</p>
<p>The significance of the findings is in shedding light on key elements within the mechanism of calcium storage and regulation/homeostasis in the medically important parasite Toxoplasma gondii whose ability to infect and cause disease critically relies on calcium signalling. An important strength is that despite its importance, calcium homeostasis in Toxoplasma is understudied and not well understood.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer. Thank you</p>

<p>A difficulty in the field, and a weakness of the work, is that following calcium in the cell is technically challenging and thus requires reliance on artificial conditions. In this context, the main weakness of the manuscript is the extrapolation of data. The language used could be more careful, especially considering that the way to measure the ER calcium is highly artificial - for example utilising permeabilization and over-loading the experiment with calcium. Measures are also indirect - for example, when the response to ionomycin treatment was not fully in line with the suggested model the authors hypothesise that the result is likely affected by other storage, but there is no direct support for that.</p>

<p>The MagFluo protocol has been amply used in mammalian cells, DT40 cells and other cells for the characterization of the IP3 receptor response to IP3. We will include and discuss more citations in the revised article. The scheme at the top of the figure shows the protocol used. There is no overloading with calcium because the cells are permeabilized and the concentrations of calcium used are physiological and all experiments were performed at 220 nm calcium which is within the cytosolic levels tolerated by cells. The experiment was done with permeabilized cells because permeabilization allows the indicator to become diluted, the substrate MgATP to reach the membrane of the ER and in addition allows for the exposure to precise concentrations of calcium. MagFluo4 loading is intended for its compartmentalization to all intracellular compartments and the uptake stimulated by MgATP exclusively occurs in the compartment occupied by SERCA. IO is an ionophore that causes calcium release from other stores in addition to the ER and it is expected that will result in a larger release. We must clarify that the experiment shown in Fig. 2 was done to characterize the activity of SERCA and was not aimed at the characterization of the role of SERCA in the parasite. We will explain this result better in the revised version of the article.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Below we provide some suggestions to improve controls, however, even with those included, we would still be in favour of revising the language and trying to avoid making strong and definitive conclusions. For example, in the discussion perhaps replace &quot;showed&quot; with &quot;provide evidence that are consistent with...&quot;; replace or remove words like &quot;efficiently&quot; and &quot;impressive&quot;; revise the definitive language used in the last few lines of the abstract (lines 13-17); etc. Importantly we recommend reconsidering whether the data is sufficiently direct and unambiguous to justify the model proposed in Figure 7 (we are in favour of removing this figure at this early point of our understanding of the calcium dynamic between organelles in Toxoplasma).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestions and will modify the language as suggested.</p>
<p>Fig 7 is only a model and as all models could be incorrect. However, considering this reviewer’s criticism we will replace the model for a simpler one that is less speculative.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Another important weakness is poor referencing of previous work in the field. Lines 248-250 read almost as if the authors originally hypothesised the idea that calcium is shuttled between ER and mitochondria via membrane contact sites (MCS) - but there is extensive literature on other eukaryotes which should be first cited and discussed in this context. Likewise, the discussion of MCS in Toxoplasma does not include the body of work already published on this parasite by several groups. It is informative to discuss observations in light of what is already known.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We added a citation following the sentence mentioned by the reviewer in lines 248-250 (corrected preprint) and will include more in the revised article. We cite several pertinent articles that describe MCS in Toxoplasma (lines 378-380, very few actually). We will make sure not to miss any new articles that could have been recently published. Note that our work is not about describing the presence of MCSs. We are showing transfer of calcium between the ER and mitochondria and we present evidence that supports that it happens through MCSs.</p>
