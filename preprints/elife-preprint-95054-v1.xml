<title>Abstract</title><p>The perinuclear theca (PT) is a dense cytoplasmic web encapsulating the sperm nucleus. The physiological roles of PT in sperm biology and the clinical relevance of variants of PT proteins to male infertility are still largely unknown. We reveal that cylicin-1, a major constituent of the PT, is vital for male fertility in both mice and humans. Loss of cylicin-1 in mice leads to a high incidence of malformed sperm heads with acrosome detachment from the nucleus. Cylicin-1 interacts with itself, several other PT proteins, the inner acrosomal membrane (IAM) protein SPACA1, and the nuclear envelope (NE) protein FAM209 to form an ‘IAM-cylicins-NE’ sandwich structure, anchoring the acrosome to the nucleus. WES of more than 500 Chinese infertile men with sperm head deformities was performed and a <italic>CYLC1</italic> variant was identified in 19 patients. <italic>Cylc1</italic>-mutant mice carrying this variant also exhibited sperm acrosome/head deformities and reduced fertility, indicating that this <italic>CYLC1</italic> variant most likely affects human male reproduction. Furthermore, the outcomes of assisted reproduction were reported for patients harbouring the <italic>CYLC1</italic> variant. Our findings demonstrate a critical role of cylicin-1 in the sperm acrosome-nucleus connection and suggest <italic>CYLC1</italic> variants as potential risk factors for human male fertility.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In mammalian sperm, the cytoskeletal element encapsulating the nuclei is a detergent- and high salt-resistant structure called the perinuclear theca (PT) (Oko et al., 2009). Apically, the PT resides between the inner acrosomal membrane (IAM) and the nuclear envelope (NE) making up the subacrosomal layer (PT-SAL, also known as the acroplaxome), while caudally, it resides between the cell membrane and the NE making up the postacrosomal part (PT-PAR, also known as the calyx). The PT is not composed of traditional cytoskeletal proteins but rather of a variety of spermatid-specific cytosolic and nuclear proteins. Longo et al. determined that two kinds of basic proteins are the major constituents of PT: calicin and cylicins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Longo et al., 1987</xref>). After that, more than twenty PT-enriched proteins, such as fatty acid-binding protein (FABP)9 (Oko et al., 1994), actin-capping protein (CP) α3/β3 (Bulow et al., 1997), transcription factor STAT4 (Herrada et al., 1997), actin-related proteins ACTRT1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Heid et al., 2002</xref>), histone H2B variant H2BL1 (Aul et al., 2002), sperm-born oocyte activating factors (PLCζ and PAWP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aarabi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hachem et al., 2017</xref>), and the glutathione S-transferase GSTO2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hamilton et al., 2017</xref>), have been identified from mammalian sperm.</p>
<p>The PT is speculated to function as 1) an architectural element involved in the shape changes of the nucleus during spermiogenesis, 2) a cement linking the acrosome with the nucleus, and 3) a candidate for sperm-borne oocyte activation. However, the physiological roles of PT in sperm are largely uncertain due to the lack of evidence from gene knockout animal models. Our recent studies of <italic>Ccin</italic>- and <italic>Actrt1</italic>-knockout mice indicate that PT, at least, physiologically functions to protect nuclear structure and anchor developing acrosomes to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Zhang et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Zhang et al., 2022b</xref>). Loss of calicin specifically leads to the surface subsidence of sperm heads in the nuclear condensation stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Zhang et al., 2022a</xref>). Importantly, we further report that three infertile men with sperm head deformities carry homozygous pathogenic mutations in <italic>CCIN</italic>, and the corresponding <italic>Ccin</italic>-mutant mice mimic the phenotype in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Fan et al., 2022</xref>). <italic>Actrt1</italic>-KO male mice are severely subfertile as a result of detached acrosomes and fertilization deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Zhang et al., 2022b</xref>). ACTRT1 anchors acrosomes to the nucleus by interacting with some IAM proteins and NE proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Zhang et al., 2022b</xref>).</p>
<p>Hess et al. cloned cDNAs encoding cylicin-1, named for the Greek word for ‘cup’ or ‘beaker’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hess et al., 1993</xref>). 74 kDa cylicin-1 contains numerous lysine dipeptides followed by a third variable amino acid (KKX). The C-terminal tail contains proline-rich segments and the central portion of the protein is arranged as a series of repeating units that are predicted to form short alpha helices. Northern blotting detects the cylicin-1 transcript only in the testis, and an antibody against cylicin-1 specifically stains the PT-PAR of human and bovine sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hess et al., 1993</xref>). Apart from the first expression study of calicin-1 published 30 years ago, the physiological role of cylicin-1 in sperm biology is still unknown.</p>
<p>In this study, we generated a <italic>Cylc1</italic>-KO mouse model and revealed that loss of cylicin-1 leads to severe male subfertility as a result of sperm head deformities and acrosome detachment. A <italic>CYLC1</italic> variant was identified from a WES study of infertile patients with sperm head deformities. The contribution of this variant to male subfertility with sperm acrosome detachment is further confirmed by animal evidence from <italic>Cylc1</italic>-mutant mice.</p>

<title>Generation of <italic>Cylc1</italic>-KO mice</title>
<p>Cylicin-1 is a major and specific constituent of the PT of mammalian sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Longo et al., 1987</xref>). According to the Expression Atlas database, cylicin-1 was specifically expressed in testis tissues, and restricted to early and late spermatid subpopulations (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref></bold>). Using our homemade rabbit anti-CYLC1 antibody (<bold><xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref></bold>), we showed that cylicin-1 was initially expressed at the subacrosomal layer (SAL) in round and elongating spermatids and then translocated to the postacrosomal region (PAR) in sperm (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>). The dynamic expression pattern of cylicin-1 is quite similar to that of CAPZA3 (Bulow et al., 1997), calicin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Zhang et al., 2022a</xref>), and ACTRT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Zhang et al., 2022b</xref>), all showing SAL-to-PAR translocation during spermiogenesis.</p>

<p>To explore the physiological role of cylicin-1, we disrupted its function in mice by applying CRISPR/Cas9 technology (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>). The <italic>Cylc1</italic> gene has only one transcript and a 3651 bp region containing exons 3 and 4 was selected as the knockout region (<bold><xref rid="fig1s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref></bold>). The <italic>Cylc1</italic> gene is located on the X-chromosome; accordingly, female <italic>Cylc1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> founder mice were crossed with WT males to generate <italic>Cylc1</italic><sup>-/Y</sup> (hereafter called <italic>Cylc1</italic>-KO) mice, which were tested by genotyping PCR of tail genomic DNA (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>). Western blotting analysis with anti-cylicin-1 antibody confirmed absence of the cylicin-1 in the testis protein lysates of <italic>Cylc1</italic>-KO mice (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Severe male subfertility of <italic>Cylc1</italic>-KO mice</title>
<p>Adult <italic>Cylc1</italic>-KO male mice were normal in appearance, healthy and developed with no identifiable abnormalities. Given that cylicin-1 is a sperm-specific protein, we studied the fertility of <italic>Cylc1</italic>-KO male mice by mating them with WT females. Although <italic>Cylc1</italic>-KO male mice were able to mate normally with females, they suffered from severe male subfertility. Both the pregnancy rates of mating females and pups that were born from <italic>Cylc1</italic>-KO males were significantly reduced compared with those from WT males (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></bold>). The testis size and weight were similar between <italic>Cylc1</italic>-KO mice and their littermate WT mice (<bold><xref rid="fig1s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref></bold>). Histological examination of <italic>Cylc1</italic>-KO testis and cauda epididymis revealed generally normal spermatogenesis and sperm production (<bold><xref rid="fig1s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref></bold>). Both the sperm count and the total motility were similar between <italic>Cylc1</italic>-KO mice and WT mice (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>We next examined whether <italic>Cylc1</italic>-KO mice suffer from sperm morphological abnormalities. Sperm were obtained from the cauda epididymis and analysed by Papanicolaou staining. The sperm of WT mice showed a typical ‘hook-shaped’ appearance with a streamlined dorsal part (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref></bold>), whereas the <italic>Cylc1</italic>-KO mice produced sperm with abnormal head morphologies, exhibiting varying degrees of ‘fan-shaped’ heads (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref></bold>). Mild ‘fan-shaped’ heads showed a roughly similar morphology to normal sperm heads but with an obvious corner curve at the dorsal side (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref></bold>, second row), while severe ‘fan-shaped’ heads exhibited a quite different morphology and looked like a ‘fan’ when observed from the head-tail connection (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref></bold>, third row). Sperm with mild and severe ‘fan-shaped’ heads accounted for approximately 60% and 40% of the total sperm in <italic>Cylc1</italic>-KO mice, respectively. The phenotype of ‘fan-shaped’ heads in sperm of <italic>Cylc1</italic>-KO mice was further identified by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Acrosome detachment in spermatids and sperm of <italic>Cylc1</italic>-KO mice</title>
<p>To explore the reason for the sperm head deformities, we examined the acrosome structure in <italic>Cylc1</italic>-KO mice by peanut agglutinin (PNA)-FITC staining. In spermatids of WT mice, the developing acrosome was tightly bound to the nuclear envelope (NE) of the sperm nucleus. Spermatids of <italic>Cylc1</italic>-KO mice, by contrast, exhibited varying degrees of acrosome detachment from the NE (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). Statistical analysis indicated that the ratio of acrosome detachment in spermatids of <italic>Cylc1</italic>-KO mice was significantly higher than that in WT mice (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>).

<title>Cylicin-1 interacts with itself and other PT proteins</title>
<p>To explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the acrosome-nucleus connection by calicin-1, the interacting partners of calicin-1 were studied using protein‒protein interaction technologies. First, we found that FLAG-tagged CYLC1 could be coimmunoprecipitated with Myc-tagged CYLC1 in HEK293T cells, demonstrating that cylicin-1 interacts with itself (<bold><xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref></bold>). The interactions between Myc-tagged CYLC1 and several other FLAG-tagged PT proteins, such as ACTRT1, ACTRT2, ACTL7A, CAPZA3, and CCIN, were further revealed by coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays in HEK293T cells (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref></bold>). The ACTL7A-CYLC1 interaction was further confirmed by endogenous co-IP assay using mouse testis extracts (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>). Moreover, microscale thermophoresis (MST) analysis indicated a binding affinity between GFP-labelled CYLC1 and purified ACTL7A in a dose-dependent manner (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>). The assembly of these PT proteins into a large protein complex suggests that they may play a coordinated role in acrosome attachment. The protein levels of PT proteins, such as ACTRT1, ACTRT2, ACTL7A, CCIN, CAPZA3, CAPZB, CYLC2, and PLCζ, were similar in the sperm sample between WT mice and <italic>Cylc1</italic>-KO mice, indicating that the sperm acrosome detachment in <italic>Cylc1</italic>-KO mice may not be due to altered PT protein contents (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig3s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref></bold>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we thoroughly reveal the physiological role of cylicin-1 and explore its clinical relevance to male infertility. Cylicin-1 is specifically expressed at the PT-SAL (between the IAM and the NE) in spermatids and is ultimately distributed to the PT-PAR in sperm. <italic>Cylc1</italic>-KO male mice are severely subfertile with acrosome detachment and aberrant head morphology. By recruiting a large cohort (&gt;500 infertile men with sperm head deformities), a <italic>CYLC1</italic> variant was identified in 19 individuals by WES. <italic>Cylc1</italic>-mutant mice equivalent to the variant in human <italic>CYLC1</italic> mimicked the phenomena of patients. Our experimental observations indicate that cylicin-1 mediates the acrosome-nucleus connection across species, and importantly, <italic>CYLC1</italic> variants are linked to male in/subfertility. PT is a cytoskeletal element encapsulating the sperm nucleus. Compared with other sperm structures, such as acrosome and axoneme-based flagella, our understanding of the PT is very limited. Although the morphological structures and protein compositions of PT are well studied, the physiological roles of sperm PT structure are still largely unknown. Our recent two studies using <italic>Ccin</italic>-KO and <italic>Actrt1</italic>-KO mice have explored two different physiological functions of sperm PT— protecting sperm nuclear structure and mediating acrosome-nuclear connection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Zhang et al., 2022a</xref>; Zhang et al., 2033b). Loss of calicin specifically causes ‘surface subsidence’ of the sperm nucleus at the nuclear condensation stage, and sperm from <italic>Ccin</italic>-KO mice exhibit DNA damage and fertilization failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Zhang et al., 2022a</xref>). ACTRT1 forms a large ARP complex with ACTL7A and ACTL9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Zhang et al., 2022b</xref>). <italic>Actrt1</italic>-, <italic>Actl7a</italic>-, and <italic>Actl9</italic>-deficient mice all exhibit acrosome detachment and partial/total fertilization failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Xin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Zhang et al., 2022b</xref>). Studies from <italic>Actrt1</italic>-, <italic>Actl7a</italic>-, <italic>Actl9</italic>-, and <italic>Cylc1</italic>-deficient mice unequivocally demonstrate the essential role of PT structure in mediating acrosome-nucleus connections. <italic>Actrt1</italic>-KO mice and <italic>Cylc1</italic>-KO mice are severely subfertile rather than completely infertile, indicating that acrosome-nucleus connections may require additive or synergistic effects of several PT proteins.</p>
<p>In spermatids, the acrosome is tightly bound to the PT-SAL plate, which in turn is anchored to the NE of the elongating spermatid nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Zhang et al., 2022a</xref>). The ‘IAM-SAL-NE’ sandwich structure plays a central role in acrosome attachment, and perturbations in this structure are conceivably the major causes of acrosome detachment from the sperm nucleus. The existing evidence is as follows: (i) no close association of the IAM with the NE is formed in spermatids of <italic>Spaca1</italic>-KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fujihara et al., 2012</xref>); (ii) SPACA1 interacts with PT-SAL proteins (e.g., CCIN, ACTRT1, and ACTL7A) to anchor the acrosome to the PA-SAL structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Xin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Zhang et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Zhang et al., 2022b</xref>); and (iii) PT-SAL proteins (e.g., CCIN and ACTRT1) could further connect with NE proteins (e.g., DPY19L2, FAM209, PARP11 and SPATA46) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Zhang et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Zhang et al., 2022b</xref>).</p>
<p>Cylicin-1 interacts with itself and other PT proteins (e.g., CCIN, ACTRT1, ACTRT2, ACTL7A, CAPZA3, and CAPZB) to form a PT-SAL plate. Cylicin-1 homopolymer further connects the acrosome to the NE, likely by interacting with IAM proteins (e.g., SPACA1) and NE proteins (e.g., FAM209). Disruption of the ‘IAM-SAL-NE’ sandwich structure is suggested to be the reason for acrosome detachment in <italic>Cylc1</italic>-deficient spermatids. Deficiency of cylicin-1 also partially affects the formation or stability of ACTRT1-ACTL7A and ACTL7A-SPACA1. However, the physiological organization of ‘IAM-SAL-NE’ protein complexes and how the CYLC1 variant will affect this structure at the molecular or even atomic level have not been clear until now.</p>
<p>Mutations in genes encoding PT proteins have been shown to be associated with male infertility with sperm head deformities. Xin et al. identified a homozygous missense mutation of <italic>ACTL7A</italic> in two infertile brothers presenting sperm acrosomal ultrastructural defects and early embryonic arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Xin et al., 2020</xref>). WES of 21 male individuals with fertilization failure identified homozygous pathogenic variants in <italic>ACTL9</italic> in three individuals, also showing sperm acrosome detachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dai et al., 2021</xref>). We report that three infertile men showing ‘surface subsidence’ of the sperm nucleus carry homozygous pathogenic mutations in <italic>CCIN</italic>, and the corresponding <italic>Ccin</italic>-mutant mice mimic the phenotype in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Fan et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Infertility is a very heterogeneous condition, with genetic causes involved in approximately half of cases. Taking the percentage of male in/subfertile may reach more than 20% of the population into consideration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Gnoth et al., 2005</xref>), the contribution of multiple genetic factors and common variants to male infertility should not be omitted. It has been suggest that mouse modelling data are critical to determine the pathogenicity of point mutations (Singh et al., 2015). Our mutant mouse results further proved that the identified CYLC1 variant is harmful for male fertility. Similar to <italic>Cylc1</italic>-KO mice, <italic>Cylc1</italic>-mutant mice showed severe male subfertility with sperm acrosome/head deformities. While our study was under preparation, another laboratory in parallel reported similar findings that <italic>Cylc1</italic>-KO mice showed sperm acrosome detachment and male subfertility as a reviewed preprint in eLife (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Schneider et al., 2023</xref>). This report and our current study unequivocally demonstrate the essential role of cylicin-1 in mediating sperm acrosome-nucleus connections and mouse male fertility. Intriguingly, Schneider et al. indicates that deficiency of <italic>Cylc2</italic> (even in heterozygous state) worsened the fertility of <italic>Cylc1</italic>-KO mice (from severe subfertility to infertility). Extending to humans, we suggest that CYLC1 variants contribute to male infertility, especially when combined with certain variants of other male infertility-associated genes. This notion may improve our multiperspective understanding of male in/subfertility, which is a very heterogeneous condition.</p>
<p>After analysing the ART outcomes of the patients harbouring CYLC1 variant, we suggest that ICSI but not IVF may serve as a promising treatment for in/subfertile men carrying <italic>CYLC1</italic> variants. The reduced rate of acrosome reaction may be one of the underlying reasons. The outcomes of ICSI together with AOA treatment seem to be better than those of ICSI alone, because good-quality embryos are obtained in the ICSI+AOA group but not in the ICSI group for patients AAW228 and AAX765. It is still not known whether a deficiency of cylicin-1 in sperm affects oocyte activation in humans.</p>
<p>Taken together, we provided solid animal and clinic evidence to indicate that cylicin-1 mediate the acrosome-nucleus connection of sperm and suggest <italic>CYLC1</italic> variants as potential risk factors for human male fertility.</p>

<p>The N-terminal of mouse CYLC1 was cloned into the pET-N-His-C-His vector (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) and then transfected into the ER2566 E. coli strain (Weidi Biotechnology, Shanghai, China). CYLC1 protein expression was induced by 1 mM IPTG (Beyotime) at 24°C for 6 hours. After centrifugation, the bacterial pellet was resuspended in buffer 1 (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl), and the proteins were released by sonication. After centrifugation, anti-His beads (Beyotime) were added to the supernatant and incubated for 2 hours. After washing five times with buffer 1, CYLC1-N protein was eluted with 250 mM imidazole (Beyotime). The protein was concentrated by centrifugation with ultrafiltration centrifuge tube (Millipore, Shanghai, China). One hundred micrograms of CYLC1-N protein was emulsified at a 1:1 ratio (v/v) with Freund’s complete adjuvant (Beyotime) and administered subcutaneously into New Zealand white rabbits (Charles River) at multiple points. For the subsequent three immunizations, 50 μg CYLC1-N protein was emulsified with incomplete Freund’s adjuvant (Beyotime) at an interval of 2 weeks.

First, the N-terminus of mouse CYLC1 was cloned into the pET-N-His-C-His vector and transfected into the ER2566 E. coli strain. CYLC1-N protein expression was induced by IPTG. Second, anti-His beads were added to the E.coli lysates. After incubation and washing, the CYLC1-N protein was eluted with imidazole. Third, recombinant CYLC1-N protein was emulsified with Freund’s complete adjuvant and administered subcutaneously into New Zealand white rabbits four times with an interval of 2 weeks. Fourth, one week after the last immunization, blood was collected, and the serum was separated. Fifth, the cylicin-1 antiserum was verified by Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. Cylicin-1 antiserum specifically recognized the cylicin-1 protein (∼72 kDa) in the protein lysates of CYLC1-overexpressing HEK293T cells and testis tissues. Immunofluorescence staining of mouse sperm indicated that cylicin-1 was specifically localized to the postacrosomal region (PAR) of heads and that its expression was absent in the sperm of <italic>Cylc1</italic>-KO mice. Scale bar, 5 μm.</p></caption>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study investigates the role of cylicin-1 (CYLC1) in sperm acrosome-nucleus connections and its clinical relevance to male infertility. Using mouse models, the researchers demonstrate that cylicin-1 is specifically expressed in the post acrosomal sheath-like region in spermatids and plays a crucial role in mediating acrosome-nucleus connections. Loss of CYLC1 results in severe male subfertility, characterized by acrosome detachment and aberrant head morphology in sperm. Further analysis of a large cohort of infertile men reveals CYLC1 variants in patients with sperm head deformities. The study provides valuable insights into the role of CYLC1 in male fertility and proposes CYLC1 variants as potential risk factors for human male infertility, emphasizing the importance of mouse models in understanding the pathogenicity of such variants.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This article demonstrates notable strengths in various aspects. Firstly, the clarity and excellent writing style contribute to the accessibility of the content. Secondly, the employed techniques are not only relevant but also complementary, enhancing the robustness of the study. The precision in their experimental design and the meticulous interpretation of results reflect the scientific rigor maintained throughout the study. Furthermore, the decision to create a second mouse model with the exact CYLC1 mutation found in humans adds significant qualitative value to the research. This approach not only validates the clinical relevance of the identified variant but also strengthens the translational impact of the findings.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are no obvious weaknesses. While a few minor refinements, as suggested in the recommendations to authors, could enhance the overall support for the data and the authors' messages, these suggested improvements in no way diminish the robustness of the already presented data.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>* To verify the function of PT-associated protein CYLC1, the authors generated a Cylc1-KO mouse model and revealed that loss of cylicin-1 leads to severe male subfertility as a result of sperm head deformities and acrosome detachment.</p>
<p>* Then they also identified a CYLC1 variant by WES analysis from 19 infertile males with sperm head deformities.</p>
<p>* To prove the pathogenicity of the identified mutation site, they further generated Cylc1-mutant mice that carried a single amino acid change equivalent to the variant in human CYLC1. The Cylc1-mutant mice also exhibited male subfertility with detached acrosomes of sperm cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>* The phenotypes observed in the Cylc1-KO mice provide strong evidence for the function of CYLC1 as a PT-associated protein in spermatogenesis and male infertility.</p>
<p>* Further mechanistic studies indicate that loss of cylicin-1 in mice may disrupt the connections between the inner acrosomal membrane and acroplaxome, leading to detached acrosomes of sperm cells.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>* The authors identified a missense mutation (c.1377G&gt;T/p. K459N) from 19 infertile males with sperm head deformities. The information for the variant in Table 1 is insufficient to determine the pathogenicity and reliability of the mutation site. More information should be added, including all individuals in gnomAD, East Asians in gnomAD, 1000 Genomes Project for allele frequency in the human population; MutationTaster, M-CAP, FATHMM, and more other tools for function prediction. Then, the expression of CYLC1 in the spermatozoa from men with CYLC1 mutation should be explored by qPCR, Western blot, or IF staining analyses.</p>
<p>* Although 19 infertile males were found carrying the same missense mutation (c.1377G&gt;T/p. K459N), their phenotypes are somewhat different. For example, sperm concentrations for individuals AAX765, BBA344, and 3086 are extremely low but this is not observed in other infertile males. Then, progressive motility for individuals AAT812, 3165, 3172, 3203, and 3209 are extremely low but this is also not observed in other infertile males. It is worth considering why different phenotypes are observed in probands carrying the same mutation.</p>

<p>In the recommendation for the authors, reviewer 1 mentioned a recent study (Schneider et al., eLife, 2023) showing that Cylc1-KO mice exhibits a reduced sperm count, an observation not noted in our current study. We would like to comment that that main and most important phenotype of Cylc1-KO mice in both studies is quite similar, including male subfertility and abnormal head morphology. We think the different targeting strategy and mouse strain may cause this discrepancy. In Schneider’s and our current studies, the total motility abnormality of Cylc1-KO mice are not observed. We appreciate the suggestion of reviewer 1 to further examine the detailed parameters of motility such as VCL, VSL, and ALH. Given that the head deformation is the most obvious phenotype of Cylc1-KO mice and the focus of our study, we feel sorry that this detailed analysis of sperm motility was not performed in the current stage. Reviewer 1 also asked whether Cylc1-KO female mice are fertile or not. Given that Cylc1 is an X chromosome gene and Cylc1-KO (Cylc1-/Y) mice are severely subfertile, we do not obtain enough Cylc1-KO female mice to examine their fecundity. We also would like to thank reviewer 1 to point out several inaccurate descriptions.</p>

<p>We appreciate the suggestion of reviewer 2. First, Table 1 shows the information of the variant identified in CYLC1 gene, including allele frequency in gnomAD and functional prediction by SIFT, PolyPhen-2, and CADD. Given that mutant mice is a gold standard to confirm the pathogenicity of a variant, we generate Cylc1-mutant mice and Cylc1-mutant mice exhibit male subfertility with sperm acrosome detachment. The animal evidence is much more solid than bioinformatics prediction to confirm the pathogenicity of the identified variant in the CYLC1 gene. Second, the expression of CYLC1 in the spermatozoa from patients have been examined by IF staining (Fig. 5B). Unfortunately, the patients declined to continue in the project to donate more semen for qPCR and Western blot analyses. Third, the reviewer 2 asks why not all patients with CYLC1 gene mutation show the identical phenotype. Although some patients exhibit low sperm count or reduced motility, sperm head deformities are the shared phenotype of 19 patients. Many factors, such as way of life, may affect sperm quality. Perfectly identical phenotype of all 19 patients carrying the CYLC1 mutation is idealistic and will not always happen in clinical diagnosis. We also appreciate other suggestions from reviewer 2.</p>
