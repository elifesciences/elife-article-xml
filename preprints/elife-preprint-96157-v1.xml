<title>Abstract</title><p>Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) has emerged as a major organizing principle in cells. Recent work showed that multiple components of integrin-mediated focal adhesions including p130Cas can form LLPS, which govern adhesion dynamics and related cell behaviors. In this study, we found that the focal adhesion protein p130Cas drives formation of structures with the characteristics of LLPS that bud from focal adhesions into the cytoplasm. Condensing concentrated cytoplasm around p130Cas-coated beads allowed their isolation, which were enriched in a subset of focal adhesion proteins, mRNAs and RNA binding proteins, including those implicated in inhibiting mRNA translation. Plating cells on very high concentrations of fibronectin to induce large focal adhesions inhibited message translation which required p130Cas and correlated with droplet formation. Photo-induction of p130Cas condensates using the Cry2 system also reduced translation. These results identify a novel regulatory mechanism in which high adhesion limits message translation via induction of p130Cas-dependent cytoplasmic LLPS. This mechanism may contribute to the quiescent state of very strongly adhesive myofibroblasts and senescent cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Integrin-mediated adhesions are dynamic structures comprising the integrins themselves plus a complex array of intracellular cytoskeletal linkers, adapters and signaling proteins through which cell adhesion regulates a vast range of cellular functions, including cell survival and growth, differentiation, motility, and gene expression. Under conditions of high adhesion and contractility, integrins drive assembly of large focal adhesions that anchor contractile actomyosin stress fibers, whereas under conditions of lower adhesion or extracellular matrix stiffness, cells form smaller more dynamic adhesions. Large adhesions generally promote contractility and cellular quiescence, while small dynamic adhesions are associated with cell motility and growth.</p>
<p>Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) has emerged over the past decade as a major principle of intracellular organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hyman et al., 2014</xref>). LLPS is driven by highly multivalent, weak interactions between proteins or proteins and RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alberti et al., 2019</xref>). These domains, also termed ‘condensates”, exhibit highly dynamic behaviors, including rapid exchange of components between the droplets and the bulk phase, fusion and splitting. LLPS can organize biochemical reactions and regulate a wide array of cell functions including gene expression, organelle structure and function, protein synthesis and mechanotransduction to name a few.</p>
<p>Integrin-mediated adhesions share multiple features with LLPS. They can assemble, grow, split, fuse and disassemble in live cells, which often correlate with cell functions such as migration and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Burridge and Chrzanowska-Wodnicka, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Geiger et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Wehrle-Haller, 2012</xref>). Adhesion components exchange rapidly with the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hoffmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Parsons et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Stutchbury et al., 2017</xref>). These features prompted us to hypothesize that focal adhesions may contain phase separated cytoplasmic proteins that mediate these behaviors. p130Cas (BCAR1) is an attractive candidate as it participates in multivalent interactions and contains extended disordered regions that often mediate condensate formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Case et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Defilippi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Harte et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Polte and Hanks, 1995</xref>). We therefore began examining the behavior of GFP-tagged p130Cas in cells.</p>
<p>While these experiments were underway, Case et al reported that purified focal adhesion kinase (FAK) forms LLPS in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Case et al., 2022</xref>). They further reported that addition of paxillin enhances FAK condensates; that phosphorylated 130cas, Nck and N-Wasp also form condensates; and that FAK condensates and p130Cas-Nck-NWasp condensates synergistically recruit paxillin and kindlin-integrin complexes. Mutations in FAK and p130Cas that reduce LLPS also reduce adhesion formation in cells. Tensin1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lee et al., 2023</xref>), LIMD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Wang et al., 2021</xref>), and βPIX and GIT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>) have also been reported to form condensates in vitro and in cells that localize to focal adhesions, the cytoplasm and other compartments such as dentritic spines. Experiments using integrin cytoplasmic domains bound to supported lipid bilayers generated two dimensional LLPS with focal adhesion proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hsu et al., 2023</xref>). Mutations in LIMD1 and βPIX or GIT1 that interfere with domain formation perturbed focal adhesion functions including migration and durotaxis. These biochemical and cellular experiments thus established a strong connection between integrin mediated adhesions and LLPS.</p>
<p>Our examination of p130Cas in cells unexpected revealed that this protein drove formation of condensates that traffic in and out of focal adhesions, contains numerous proteins and RNAs involved in mRNA translation and are distinct from known cytoplasmic structures. Functional analysis revealed that formation of these condensates is regulated by cell adhesion and suppresses protein translation under conditions of high adhesion.</p>

<title>p130Cas phase separation</title>
<p>Examination of the p130Cas amino acid sequence revealed two intrinsically disordered regions of the type often associated with LLPS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). The substrate domain, which contains 15 tyrosines potentially phosphorylated by src family kinases, forms the largest unstructured region, while a segment of the C-terminal domain is also disordered. These features are highly conserved in mouse p130Cas (Supplementary Fig S1A and comments in figure legend). This finding prompted us to express p130Cas N-terminally tagged with EGFP and visualize its dynamic behavior in mouse embryo fibroblasts recently plated on fibronectin-coated coverslips (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). Western blotting cell lysates for p130Cas and correcting for transfection efficiency showed that the transfected protein was ∼4-5x endogenous (Supplementary Fig S1B). Live imaging revealed that, in addition to its localization to focal adhesions, small spots of p130Cas emerged from focal adhesions and moved into the cytoplasm and sometimes back to focal adhesions (Supplementary Movie S1-3 and Supplementary Fig S1B). CHO, HeLa and HEK293T cells showed similar behavior (Supplementary Fig S1D-F). Staining for endogenous p130Cas did not show obvious cytoplasmic droplets in untransfected MEFs, however, MCF7 cells, which have ∼2-2.5x higher endogenous p130Cas than NIH3T3, showed cytoplasmic spots without overexpression (Supplementary Fig S1G&amp;H). Spots were observed merging to form a single circular droplet (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>), a behavior typical of LLPS. Droplets increase over 24h after cell plating (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>).</p>

<p>To further characterize these cytoplasmic structures, we next measured dynamics of EGFP-p130Cas in cytoplasmic droplets outside focal adhesions using Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP). At 6h after plating, photobleached EGFP-p130Cas droplets recovered rapidly (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 9.4±1.9 s, mobile fraction ∼72%; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E, G, H</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">I</xref>). FRAP at 24 after plating showed markedly slower recovery (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 26.4±3.7 s, mobile fraction∼26%; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F-I</xref>). Both the rapid molecular exchange at 6h and the decreased exchange over time support p130Cas LLPS in cells.</p>
<p>Phase separations can be modulated by reagents that alter the environmental polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alberti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Elbaum-Garfinkle, 2019</xref>). We observed disruption of droplets after addition of hexanediol (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1J</xref>&amp;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">K</xref>) and enhanced droplet assembly after addition of ammonium acetate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1L</xref>&amp;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">M</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jain and Vale, 2017</xref>), again, behaviors typical of phase separations. We conclude that p130Cas forms cytoplasmic condensates outside focal adhesions.</p>
<p>We next addressed the presence of other focal adhesion proteins in the p130Cas droplets. We stained EGFP-p130Cas-expressing cells for paxillin and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Imaging at a focal plane through the nucleus and above the basal surface revealed strong co-localization of these proteins with p130Cas in cytoplasmic spots (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A-D</xref>). To assess dynamic behavior, we expressed EGFP-p130Cas with either tagRFP-paxillin or mcherry-FAK. These tagged constructs also co-localized in both focal adhesions and cytoplasmic droplets (Supplementary Fig S2A-C).</p>

</fig>
<p>Further, addition of ammonium acetate increased colocalization of p130Cas with paxillin and FAK in cytoplasmic spots (Supplementary Fig S2D&amp;E). Paxillin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>, movie S4) and FAK (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>, movie S5) co-emerged from focal adhesions along with p130Cas, indicating correlated dynamics. To test whether paxillin or FAK were required for assembly of p130Cas droplets, we expressed EGFP-p130Cas in paxillin-null and in FAK-null MEFs. Cytoplasmic p130Cas droplets formed normally in both of these cell lines (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2G</xref>&amp;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">H</xref>), indicating that neither was required for p130Cas phase separation. By contrast, when tagged paxillin or FAK were expressed in p130Cas-null MEFs, cytoplasmic droplets were not evident (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2I</xref>&amp;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">J</xref>). These data argue that p130Cas is the main driver of phase separation outside focal adhesions.</p>
<p>We next addressed whether p130Cas within droplets was phosphorylated on its substrate domain tyrosines. Cells expressing EGFP-p130Cas stained for pY-Cas using a specific antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Yaginuma et al., 2020</xref>) revealed strong staining of condensates as well as focal adhesions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2K-M</xref>). We noticed, however, that pY-Cas staining relative to total p130Cas intensity was drastically higher in focal adhesions compared to droplets (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2N</xref>). This result suggests that p130Cas is much less phosphorylated in droplets than in focal adhesions. We therefore considered whether phosphorylation of substrate domain tyrosines was required for phase separation. We examined mutants, including mutation of the 15 substrate domain tyrosines to phenylalanine, deletion of the substrate domain, and deletion of the disordered segment in the C-terminal domain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2O</xref>). Mutation of substrate domain tyrosines modestly decreased, deletion of the substrate domain strongly decreased, and deletion of the C-terminal disordered sequence had no effect on droplet formation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2P</xref>&amp;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Q</xref>). Thus, while the substrate domain is the main driver of phase separation its tyrosine phosphorylation contributes to this effect to a lesser extent. The Y to F mutant substrate domain showed no change in intrinsic disorder (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2R</xref>), consistent with roles for both phosphorylation-dependent and -independent interactions.</p>

<title>Phase separation <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>We next considered whether p130Cas LLPS could be isolated and their composition determined. Due to the high protein exchange rates, isolation of droplets from cells is impractical. We therefore attempted to induce phase separation in concentrated cell lysates prepared from suspended cells. We began by expressing EGFP or EGFP-p130Cas in HEK293T cells and isolating the transfected proteins on GFP-Trap beads. We then prepared lysate from cells expressing RFP-paxillin. Beads and lysates were mixed and left untreated, treated with ammonium acetate to induce phase separation, or with hexanediol to limit phase separation. Beads were then imaged without washing to avoid disassembly of condensed phases. We observed low but detectable RFP-paxillin signal around EGFP-p130Cas beads under control conditions, a large increase after addition of ammonium acetate and a decrease after addition of hexanediol (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>&amp;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">B</xref>). Paxillin was rapidly lost upon washing, indicating rapid dissociation. No paxillin fluorescence was observed around EGFP-only beads under any of these conditions. These results suggest specific assembly of condensed phases on the bead-bound p130Cas. To capture bound components, 4% paraformaldehyde was added to the bead suspensions under these conditions, which were then washed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). Imaging showed paxillin intensity increased on EGFP-p130Cas beads after ammonium acetate treatment and no paxillin fluorescence was detected after hexanediol treatment, similar to the treatments in live cells. This protocol thus allows capture of cytoplasmic components that specifically associate with p130Cas condensates.</p>

Comparing EGFP-p130Cas to EGFP-only as a control, peptides with at least 2 counts and 2-fold enrichment relative to control beads were considered specific (supplementary Table S1). Out of the 78 proteins reported to interact directly with p130Cas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Evans et al., 2017</xref>), 30 were enriched in the condensates (Supplementary Fig S3). For the proteins specifically isolated on EGFP-p130Cas beads, the most prominent Gene ontology (GO) terms for biological processes identified protein translation, RNA splicing and RNA processing (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>).</p>

<title>p130Cas condensates and RNA interactors</title>
<p>The connection to RNA metabolism led us to consider the relationship of p130Cas LLPS to stress granules and p-bodies that are well known to regulate mRNA functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Freibaum et al., 2021</xref>). p130Cas showed little correlation with the stress granule marker G3BP2, either without or with arsenite treatment to induce their assembly (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A-D</xref>). We also saw that of the six major stress granule constituents CAPRIN1, PRRC2C, USP10, UBAP2L, and CSDE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Yang et al., 2020</xref>) and PABPC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kedersha et al., 2000</xref>) only PABPC1 was detected in p130Cas condensates (Supplemental Table S1). Poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), which can be present in stress granules, did not colocalized with p130Cas droplets immediately after induction of stress granules (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>&amp;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">F</xref>). However, argonaute 2 (Ago2), which is critical for miRNA-dependent mRNA regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ender and Meister, 2010</xref>) and is a constituent of stress granules (and p-bodies), partially overlapped with p130Cas-positive LLPS after arsenite treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4G</xref>&amp;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">H</xref>). Dcp1A, a critical component of p-bodies, showed no overlap with p130Cas droplets (Fig I-L &amp; Supplementary Fig S4A&amp;B). We conclude that p130Cas condensates share some constituents but are distinct from both stress granules and p-bodies.</p>

<p>We next explored the localization of RNA binding and processing proteins in p130Cas droplets. Ago2 is concentrated in the center of the droplets (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>&amp;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">B</xref>). GW182, which, like Ago2 is a component of the RISC complex that mediates miRNA-directed mRNA cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Ding and Han, 2007</xref>), was present in the outer rim of p130Cas structures (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>&amp;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">D</xref>). Staining of the LLPS around EGFP-p130Cas beads in cell lysates confirmed the presence of Ago2 and GW182 (Supplementary Fig S5A&amp;C with Fig S5B&amp;D as corresponding negative controls). Interestingly, Ago2 and GW182 appear to occupy subdomains within the p130Cas-positive zones around the beads, mimicking their localizations in cells. Messenger RNAs, which were localized by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using poly-T probes, yielded strong positive signals within a subset of p130Cas droplets in cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>&amp;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">F</xref>). To test the relationship between protein translation and p130Cas droplets, cells expressing GFP-p130Cas were treated with cycloheximide (CHX), which blocks translational elongation and arrests mRNAs on the ribosomes, thereby depleting mRNAs from other pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ivanov et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kedersha et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lui et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Riggs et al., 2020</xref>). CHX decreased p130Cas LLPS (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5G</xref>&amp;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">H</xref>).

<title>p130Cas LLPS modulates protein translation</title>
<p>Given these findings, we next considered whether cytoplasmic p130Cas phase separation might affect mRNA translation. With this in mind, we examined the breast cancer cell line MCF7, which, like many cancer cell lines, expresses higher levels of p130Cas than mouse embryo fibroblasts. We plated MCF7 cells on coverslips coated with low, medium or high fibronectin (FN). To identify cytoplasmic phase separations, we stained cells for paxillin, due to higher quality of antibodies to this protein compared to p130Cas. Again, focusing at a plane above the basal surface, we observed more cytoplasmic droplets on higher FN, as well as the expected increase in focal adhesions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A-C</xref>). Next, we measured rates of protein translation using the puromycin assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Forester et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Puromycin interrupts translation by adding onto the growing peptide chain, thus, its incorporation is proportional to the number of mRNAs undergoing translation. Staining cells for puromycin and quantifying integrated signal per cell showed that translation decreased as a function of FN coating density (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7D</xref>&amp;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">E</xref> and Supplementary Fig S6A- cycloheximide treatment as a negative control for puromycin labeling). We then asked if this effect required p130Cas. MCF7 cells were transfected with siRNA against p130Cas (knockdown confirmed in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7G</xref> and Supplementary Fig S6B) plated on low, medium and high FN and subject to the puromycin assay (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7F-H</xref>). Knockdown of p130Cas completely abrogated inhibition of translation on high FN, indeed, after p130Cas knockdown, high FN modestly increased translation. To test if this behavior is specific to this cancer line, we examined human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) that express moderately high levels of p130Cas (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7I-K</xref> and Supplementary Fig S6C&amp;D). In these cells, translation also decreased on high FN, which was again converted to an increase after p130Cas depletion. By contrast, NIH3T3 cells that have lower levels of p130Cas (Supplementary Fig S6E-G) showed increased translation on high FN, with no effect of p130Cas knock-down. The differentiated breast epithelial line MCF10A, where p130Cas expression is low, also showed little change in puromycin labeling on low vs high FN (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7L</xref>&amp;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">M</xref>). Together, these results show that high p130Cas expression is required for a reduction in protein translation on high FN, an effect that correlates with droplet formation.</p>

<p>While these experiments implicate p130Cas in regulating translation, they do not address whether cytoplasmic phase separation is required. To address this issue, we expressed p130Cas fused to the light-inducible dimerizer Cry2, which is commonly used to drive phase separation by increasing the valency of protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Courchaine et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Shin et al., 2017</xref>).

<p>Some cells were then incubated in the dark for the indicated times (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8G</xref>). LLPS formed immediately after illumination (0 min) followed by disassembly over time in the dark (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8H</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Src family kinases, FAK or its homolog Pyk2, and/or paxillin have been localized to perinuclear or nuclear spots that traffic to and from focal adhesions in multiple systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aoto et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Day et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fincham et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Seko et al., 1999</xref>), though their characteristics and mechanisms were not further investigated. Recent work provides strong evidence for LLPS behaviors of the focal adhesion proteins FAK and p130Cas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Case et al., 2022</xref>). Purified FAK undergoes LLPS in vitro, mediated mainly by its disordered N-terminus. They also observed LLPS of purified p130Cas phosphorylated on its substrate domain tyrosines via SH2 and SH3 domain interactions with Nck and N-WASP. Additional studies showed LLPS of focal adhesion components with evidence for regulation of focal adhesion dynamics and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hsu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lee et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Our current results show that focal adhesions also give rise to p130Cas-FAK-paxillin LLPS in the cytoplasm. These structures show typical LLPS behaviors including fusion and fission, and rapid exchange of subunits with the cytoplasm that slows as condensates mature. Phase separation was also modulated by reagents that alter polarity and affect LLPS in other systems. Cytoplasmic condensates contain little or no talin or vinculin but are enriched in RNA binding proteins and mRNAs. However, p130Cas LLPS appear distinct from stress granules and P granules that contain RNAs and RNA-binding proteins. Formation of condensates was strongly reduced by deletion of the p130Cas substrate domain, with more modest reduction by mutation of the 15 substrate domain tyrosines, indicating that, within cells, p130Cas LLPS involves both phosphotyrosine-dependent and -independent interactions.</p>
<p>LLPS are difficult to isolate due to fast dissociation of their constituents. We therefore developed a method to induce condensation around magnetic beads coated with GFP-p130Cas vs. GFP alone, which could then be reversibly fixed, isolated and components analyzed. While this method is no doubt imperfect, we saw large differences between p130Cas and control beads, and several components seen in vitro were confirmed in cells. We also noted that in some p130Cas droplets, different proteins localized preferentially to the outer vs inner regions. This behavior is common among LLPS and likely reflects functional domains, though further work will be required to understanding these aspects.</p>
<p>The presence of RNA binding proteins and mRNAs in p130Cas condensates led us to investigate a possible link to mRNA translation. We found that in MCF7 cells and HUVECs, which express abundant p130Cas, adhesion to high levels of FN reduced total translation as measured by the puromycin incorporation assay. However, knockdown of p130Cas converted this reduction into an increase. These results indicate that p130Cas is required for translational inhibition by high adhesion, and that in its absence, an underlying stimulation is evident. This latter effect is consistent with conventional integrin signaling where cell adhesion increases protein translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pabla et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Pola et al., 2013</xref>). To our knowledge, inhibition of protein synthesis at high adhesion has not been reported. However, it is consistent with the correlation between very high adhesion and cellular quiescence in several systems, including vascular smooth muscle cells, senescent cells and myofibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cho et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dimitrijevic-Bussod et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Drobic et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gadbois et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Koyama et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Vivar et al., 2016</xref>). Excessive integrin-mediated adhesion can thus exert inhibitory effects on cells.</p>
<p>Lastly, a role for LLPS formation in inhibition of translation was investigated through use of a Cry2-p130Cas fusion protein, whose irradiation triggers dimerization of the Cry2 moiety to increase valency and promote phase separation. Illumination of cells expressing Cry2-p130Cas triggered formation of condensates and a decrease in translation, both of which reversed when illumination was terminated.</p>
<p>Together, these results identify a novel LLPS organelle that mediates a functional connection between integrin mediated adhesion and regulation of protein translation. Major questions for future work include-elucidation of the composition and structure of these condensates in greater detail; determining the mechanisms that govern trafficking between the cytoplasm and focal adhesions; elucidating the molecular mechanisms of translational regulation; and determining the role these structures play in biology and medicine.</p>

<title>Immunostaining, antibodies and RNA FISH</title>
<p>Cells were fixed in 4% for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min at RT. Cells were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 1 hour at RT and then incubated with primary antibody at 4°C overnight. The following primary antibodies were used with 1:500 dilution in 1% BSA in PBS: rabbit polyclonal anti-p130Cas (GeneTex, GTX100605), mouse monoclonal anti-FAK (Sigma-Aldrich, clone 4.47, 05-537), mouse monoclonal anti Paxillin (BD Biosciences, clone 349, 610051), rabbit polyclonal anti-Phospho Tyr165 p130Cas (GeneTex, GTX132160), rabbit polyclonal anti-G3BP2 (Sigma Aldrich, HPA018425), mouse monoclonal anti-PABP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, clone 10E10, sc-32318), rabbit monoclonal anti-Argonaute-2 ( Abcam, ab156870), rabbit polyclonal anti-DCP1A (Sigma, D5444) and mouse monoclonal anti-Puromycin (Sigma Aldrich, clone 12D10, MABE343). Cells were washed in PBS thrice and then incubated with Alexa Fluor 647–conjugated secondary antibody diluted in PBS (1:1,000; Invitrogen) at RT for 1 hour. Nuclei were labeled using Hoechst 33342 (1:1,000 in PBS; Molecular Probes). RNA FISH was performed according to the manufacturer’s (Stellaris RNA FISH, Biosearch Technologies) protocol for adherent cells using custom Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated at 3’ end of Poly-T (30 repeats) probes (IDT-Integrated DNA technologies) (a gift from Prof. Stefania Nicoli, CVRC, Yale University).</p>

<title>Knock down and Western blot</title>
<p>p130cas knockdown in MCF7 and HUVECs used RNAimax (Invitrogen) transfection of 50nM human BCAR1 siRNA (9564; ON-TARGETplus, SMARTpool, L-020465-02-0005, Horizon Discovery/ Dharmacon) siRNA; in NIH 3T3 cells, we used mouse BCAR1 siRNA (12927; ON-TARGETplus, SMARTpool, L-041961-00-0005, Horizon Discovery/ Dharmacon) or scrambled control siRNA (AM4636; Ambion). Knockdown efficiency and p130Cas over-expression levels were confirmed by Western blotting of cell lysates in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 [Sigma-Aldrich], 150 mM NaCl [JT Baker], 1% NP-40 [Sigma-Aldrich], 1% sodium deoxycholate [Sigma-Aldrich], and 0.1% SDS [American Bioanalytical] in milliQ water); protease and phosphatase inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added just before extraction. Protein was resolved using SDS-PAGE and transferred to the nitrocellulose membrane using a transfer system (Trans-Blot Turbo; Bio-Rad Laboratories). The membrane was blocked using 5% skimmed milk (American Bioanalytical) in TBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST; Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated in TBST overnight at 4°C with the following primary antibodies diluted 1:2000: rabbit polyclonal anti-p130Cas (GeneTex, GTX100605), rabbit monoclonal anti-GAPDH (2118, clone 14C10, Cell Signaling Technology) and mouse tubulin (05-829, clone DM1a; Sigma-Aldrich). Membranes were washed with TBST for 5 min 3× at RT on a shaker. The membrane was then incubated with the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) diluted in TBST (1:5,000) and visualized using chemiluminescence detection method with Supersignal West Pico (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on the G:Box system (Syngene).</p>

<title>Imaging and analysis</title>
<p>Imaging and analyses were done essentially as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, imaging was done on an Eclipse Ti microscope (Nikon) equipped with a spinning disk confocal imaging system (Ultraview Vox; PerkinElmer) and an electron-multiplying charged-coupled device camera (C9100-50; Hamamatsu Photonics), using 60× oil objectives for high resolution images and 20× air objective for low magnification imaging capturing multiple fields of view. During imaging, live cells were maintained at 37°C with humidity and CO2 control. Images were acquired using Velocity 6.6.1 software. For FRAP, a prebleach image was acquired and then a laser pulse at 100% power of the 488-nm line were used to bleach the entire droplet. Time-lapse images were then acquired every 2 s for 2 min. Images were corrected for photobleaching during image acquisition, and normalized FRAP curves were plotted. Individual recovery curves were in Origin 2018 (64 Bit) (OriginLab Corporation) using single component exponential fit to obtain mobile fraction and timescale of recovery. For imaging droplets, the focal plane through the center of the nucleus, ∼2-3µm above the FAs, was chosen. Planes were combined for representation. The number of droplets were determined by thresholding the image based on intensity and circularity and particles counted using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). Graphs were plotted in Origin 2018-2022 (64 bit).</p>

<title>Light Induced p130Cas droplets</title>
<p>To estimate p130Cas droplet lifetime, MCF7 cell stably expressing cry2-tagRFP-p130cas were cultured in the dark on glass bottom dishes and imaged on the confocal microscope. After the first frame, a single cell was irradiated using 488nm laser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Courchaine et al., 2021</xref>) for 0.5 second then time lapse images using 568nm laser excitation taken every 15 seconds for ∼45min. For fixed cell imaging, blue LED (470nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Che et al., 2015</xref>) light array pulsed induction protocol- schematic shown in supplementary Fig S7E was followed - exposure with 5 sec LED ON followed by 60 sec OFF time was determined to produce minimal heating and or decreases in cell viability. The LED light array was controlled using a custom-programmable switch (Arduino).</p>

<title>Isolation of p130Cas droplets and characterization</title>
<p>HEK293T cells were plated overnight in six 150mm plastic bottom dishes in culture media without antibiotic. Two dishes each were transfected using the manufacturer’s protocol with either EGFP-p130cas (25µg plasmid DNA, 75µl Lipfectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)) or tagRFP-paxillin (25µg plasmid DNA, 75µl Lipfectamine 2000) or control-EGFP (5µg plasmid DNA, 15µl Lipfectamine 2000). At 6hr, media were changed to culture media without antibiotic. After 48 hours, cells were trypsinized and pelleted. Cell pellets were washed twice with 1x PBS and pellets frozen at -80°C, then thawed on ice and lysed in ice cold 200µl lysis buffer (1% NP-40 (Sigma Aldrich) in DPBS (Thermo Fischer Scientific)), 4µl protease and phosphatase inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 10µl RNAseout (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 30min on ice with intermittent vortexing. Lysates were spun at 5000g for 30 min at 4°C to remove cellular debris. To further clarify, supernatant was transferred to a new Eppendorf tube and spun again at 5000g for 10min at 4°C.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, 80 µl GFP trap Dynabeads (Chromotek) were washed with ice cold lysis buffer 3x and collected by spinning at 2000g for min at 4°C. Buffer was carefully removed using a pipette to avoid loss of beads. Beads were then blocked using 1ml lysis buffer with 5µl RNAseOUT and 50µg yeast tRNA (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 hour at 4°C with slow rotation. Beads were divided equally into two Eppendorf tubes and blocking buffer removed. 400µl clarified cell lysate containing EGFP-p130cas or EGFP were added to each tubes containing beads along with 200µl clarified cell lysate containing tagRFP-paxillin and slowly rotated for 2 hours at 4°C.</p>
<p>100µl bead suspension was transferred to a new Eppendorf tube for imaging, another 100µl washed 3× with 1ml lysis buffer for Western blotting, and the remaining 400 µl fixed using 5mM reversible cross linker DSP (dithiobis[succinimidylpropionate]) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 30 minutes at 4°C with slow rotation. After fixation, beads were washed four times using 1 ml lysis buffer with 1 µl RNAseout and 2µl protease and phosphatase inhibitor. 200µl bead samples were eluted in 1× Laemlli buffer (Bio-Rad) with β-Mercaptoethanol (Sigma Aldrich) and boiled at 95°C for 5 min. The samples were loaded on a 4-20% SDS Tris-Glycine gradient gels (Bio-Rad). When samples entered the gel by ∼1 cm, the run was halted. The entered sample was excised out of the whole gel, put in an Eppendorf, and fixed using 45% methanol (Sigma Aldrich) and 10% Acetic Acid (Sigma Aldrich) in water. The gel plug was washed 3x with ultra clean water (Sigma) before submitting to the Keck MS &amp; Proteomics Resource at Yale School of Medicine for LC MS/MS mass spectrometric analysis. Peptides with at least 2 counts and 2-fold enrichment relative to control beads were considered specific and was used for further gene ontology analysis.</p>
<p>To the other 200µl bead sample, 700µl Qiazol along with 7µl β-Mercaptoethanol (Sigma Aldrich) was added and kept at -80⁰C. Sample was thawed on ice and RNA was isolated using miRNeasy Kits (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and the sample was submitted to Yale Center for Genome Analysis (YCGA) for RNA sequencing.</p>
<p>100µl bead sample was divided equally into 4 Eppendorf tubes. One sample was left untreated one treated with- 100mM ammonium acetate solution, one with 5% 1,6-Hexanediol and one washed 3-4× with ice cold lysis buffer. 1-2µl of these samples were imaged under the microscope. Then, all these samples were fixed with 4% PFA, washed 3-4× with ice cold PBS and imaged.</p>

<title>RNA sequence Analysis</title>
<p>Bulk RNA-seq analysis was carried out as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kosyakova et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, for each read, the first 6 and the last nucleotides were trimmed with the Phred score of &lt; 20. If, after trimming, the read was shorter than 45 bp, the whole read was discarded. Trimmed reads were mapped to the human reference genome (hg38) with HISAT2 v2.1.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). Alignments with quality score below 20 were excluded from further analysis. Gene counts were produced with StringTie v1.3.3b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pertea et al., 2015</xref>). Differential expression analysis was conducted and normalized counts were produced using DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Love et al., 2014</xref>). P-values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Benjamini et al., 2001</xref>). We used miRDeep2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Friedlander et al., 2012</xref>) for the miRNA/smRNA-seq analysis. RNAs that were enriched by &gt;2-fold with p values &lt;0.05 were considered positives. Gene ontology analysis was carried out using the online webtool -Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). Number of proteins versus corresponding GO term is plotted with fold enrichment depicted by the size of the circle and -log10(P-value) by the color of the circle.</p>
<p>To determine the likelihood of mRNAs present in p130cas droplet being differentially regulated in cell having the droplet, 46 mRNA were randomly chosen from the pool of differentially regulated genes in HEK293T cells over-expressing mEGFP-p130Cas using the rand function in Microsoft Excel. This was iterated 10-times and between 0-3 genes of these randomly chosen gene overlapped with the 46 mRNAs determined to be present in p130Cas droplet (&lt;5 %).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this article, Kumar et al., report on a previously unappreciated mechanism of translational regulation whereby p130Cas induces LLPS condensates that then traffic out from focal adhesion into the cytoplasm to modulate mRNA translation. Specifically, the authors employed EGFP-tagged p130Cas constructs, endogenous p130Cas, and p130Cas knockouts and mutants in cell-based systems. These experiments in conjunction with various imaging techniques revealed that p130Cas drives assembly of LLPS condensates in a manner that is largely independent of tyrosine phosphorylation. This was followed by in vitro EGFP-tagged p130Cas-dependent induction of LLPS condensates and determination of their composition by mass spectrometry, which revealed enrichment of proteins involved in RNA metabolism in the condensates. The authors excluded the plausibility that p130Cas-containing condensates co-localize with stress granules or p-bodies. Next, the authors determined mRNA compendium of p130Cas-containing condensates which revealed that they are enriched in transcripts encoding proteins implicated in cell cycle progression, survival, and cell-cell communication. These findings were followed by the authors demonstrating that p130Cas-containing condensates may be implicated in the suppression of protein synthesis using puromycylation assay. Altogether, it was found that this study significantly advances the knowledge pertinent to the understanding of molecular underpinnings of the role of p130Cas and more broadly focal adhesions on cellular function, and to this end, it is likely that this report will be of interest to a broad range of scientists from a wide spectrum of biomedical disciplines including cell, molecular, developmental and cancer biologists.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Altogether, this study was found to be of potentially broad interest inasmuch as it delineates a hitherto unappreciated link between p130Cas, LLPS, and regulation of mRNA translation. More broadly, this report provides unique molecular insights into the previously unappreciated mechanisms of the role of focal adhesions in regulating protein synthesis. Overall, it was thought that the provided data sufficiently supported most of the authors' conclusions. It was also thought that this study incorporates an appropriate balance of imaging, cell and molecular biology, and biochemical techniques, whereby the methodology was found to be largely appropriate.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Two major weaknesses of the study were noted. The first issue is related to the experiments establishing the role of p130Cas-driven condensates in translational suppression, whereby it remained unclear whether these effects are affecting global mRNA translation or are specific to the mRNAs contained in the condensates. Moreover, some of the results in this section (e.g., experiments using cycloheximide) may be open to alternative interpretation. The second issue is the apparent lack of functional studies, and although the authors speculate that the described mechanism is likely to mediate the effects of focal adhesions on e.g., quiescence, experimental testing of this tenet was lacking.</p>

<p>We thank the Elife editorial team for their positive assessment of the broad significance of our manuscript. We fully agree that the functional consequences need to be explored in more detail. We feel that many of the criticisms are valid points that are not easily addressed via available tools, thus, should be considered limitations of present approaches. We hope that readers appreciate that identification of a new class of liquid-liquid phase separations calls for much more work to fully explore their characteristics, regulation and function, which will likely advance many areas of cell biology and perhaps even medicine.</p>

<p>We agree, the isolation from cell lysates does not distinguish between focal adhesions and cytoplasmic LLPS. We note that p130Cas in focal adhesions also appears to be in LLPS. But there are no methods available to isolate them separately. We acknowledge this is a limitation of the study.</p>

<p>Ammonium acetate, which works by promoting hydrophobic interactions and weak Van der Waals forces, has been widely used in phase separation studies to change ionic strength without altering intracellular pH. Conversely, hexanediol weakens hydrophobic/ Van der Walls interactions that commonly mediate phase separation of IDRs. In the case of p130Cas, the multiple tyrosines and within the scaffolding domain are obvious targets. If the reviewer is asking us to resolve the detailed hydrophobic interactions within the scaffolding domain, this is far beyond the scope of the current paper.</p>
<p>Protein aggregates are defined by their characteristics (e.g irreversibility, departure from spherical) not by size. Older, larger droplets remain circular and show slower but still measurable rates of exchange.  Moreover, droplets are essentially absent after trypsinizing and replating cells.  All these results argue against aggregates.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>The optogenetic experiment shows that triggering LLPS by dimerizing p130Cas results in inhibition of translation. This is a causal not a correlative experiment.  The reviewer may be thinking that dimerizing p130Cas could stimulate focal adhesion signaling, activating FAK or a src family kinase or other signals.  However, none of these signals has been linked to inhibition of cell growth or migration. Thus, we agree that this is a limitation but consider it a low probability mechanism.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insights.  Assessing translational inhibition for specific genes rather than global measurement of translation is an important direction for future work.</p>
<p>Regarding the cycloheximide experiments, we are unsure what the reviewer means.   We used it as a control for puromycin labeling but this is a very standard approach. It seems more likely that the question concerns Fig 5G, where we used it to sequester mRNAs on ribosomes to deplete from other pools.  In this case, p130cas condensates decrease after 2 minutes. The reviewer may be suggesting that this effect could be due to blocked translation per se and loss of short-lived proteins. We acknowledge that this is possible but given the very rapid effect (2 min), we think it unlikely.</p>
<p>Lastly, we agree with the reviewer that further functional studies in quiescence or senescence are warranted; however, these are extensive, open-ended studies and we will not be able to include them as part of the current paper.</p>
