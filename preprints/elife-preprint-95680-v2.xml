<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Resting-state brain networks (RSNs) have been widely applied in health and disease, but the
                    interpretation of RSNs in terms of the underlying neural activity is unclear. To
                    address this fundamental question, we conducted simultaneous recordings of
                    whole-brain resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) and
                    electrophysiology signals in two separate brain regions of rats. Our data reveal
                    that for both recording sites, spatial maps derived from band-specific local
                    field potential (LFP) power can account for up to 90% of the spatial
                    variability in RSNs derived from rsfMRI signals. Surprisingly, the time series
                    of LFP band power can only explain to a maximum of 35% of the temporal
                    variance of the local rsfMRI time course from the same site. In addition,
                    regressing out time series of LFP power from rsfMRI signals has minimal impact
                    on the spatial patterns of rsfMRI-based RSNs. This disparity in the spatial and
                    temporal relationships between resting-state electrophysiology and rsfMRI
                    signals suggests that electrophysiological activity alone does not fully explain
                    the effects observed in the rsfMRI signal, implying the existence of an rsfMRI
                    component contributed by “electrophysiology-invisible” signals.
                    These findings offer a novel perspective on our understanding of RSN
                    interpretation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sophisticated brain function requires coordinated activities from separate brain regions, collectively forming functional brain networks. Functional brain networks in humans and animals are predominantly studied using the method of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI), which measures the synchronization of brain-wide spontaneous blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signals. These networks are commonly referred to as resting-state brain networks (RSNs).</p>
<p>Despite the widespread application of BOLD-derived RSNs in both health and disease contexts, their relationship to the underlying neural activity remains incompletely understood. This is a fundamental issue, as the BOLD signal is known to indirectly reflect neural activity through accompanying hemodynamic and metabolic changes, a mechanism known as neurovascular coupling (NVC). While tight NVC has been repeatedly demonstrated when neural activities are evoked by explicit external stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Goense and Logothetis, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Logothetis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Nemoto et al., 2004</xref>), this relationship in the resting state remains elusive. There is considerable evidence indicating that the spatial patterns of most RSNs effectively mirror established functional systems and activation patterns observed during various tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Biswal et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Glasser et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Hampson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Lowe et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Smith et al., 2009</xref>), as well as patterns of brain structural networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Andrews-Hanna et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Greicius et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Lowe et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, alterations in RSNs have been documented in several brain disorders, aligning with neuropathophysiological changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Buckner et al., 2009</xref>). This collective body of evidence suggests a robust neural basis for RSNs. However, it is notable that despite these findings, the predictive power of resting-state electrophysiological signals for corresponding rsfMRI time series is often relatively low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Mateo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Scholvinck et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Winder et al., 2017</xref>), and some studies have even demonstrated a disconnection between neural activity and hemodynamic signals under specific conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Maier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, various studies have reported divergent electrophysiological correlates of the rsfMRI signal across a broad spectrum of LFP bands, spanning from infraslow signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hiltunen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Pan et al., 2013</xref>) and low-frequency delta/sub-delta band signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">He et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Lu et al., 2007</xref>) to high-frequency gamma band signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bastos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Foster et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Keller et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Mukamel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Nir et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Magri et al., 2012</xref>), as well as spiking activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Mukamel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). These findings suggest that the rsfMRI signal may reflect diverse aspects of neural activity. Taken together, how RSNs and rsfMRI relate to spontaneous neural activity remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Laufs et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Mantini et al., 2007</xref>), highlighting a significant gap in our understanding of functional brain networks.</p>
<p>To address this critical issue, we systematically investigated the role of electrophysiological activity in determining specific spatiotemporal patterns of BOLD-based RSNs. In conjunction with whole-brain rsfMRI, we simultaneously recorded electrophysiology signals in the primary motor cortex (M1) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in rats under light sedation and wakefulness. These brain regions were chosen due to their distinct roles in sensorimotor function and integrative cognition, respectively. Our data show that in both light-sedation and awake states, the spatial patterns of RSNs derived from gamma band power closely resemble BOLD-derived RSNs for both the M1 and ACC, and lower frequency band-derived RSNs exhibit inversed spatial patterns, both indicating strong neural underpinning of RSNs. However, the temporal profiles of band-limited LFP powers at both recording sites exhibit considerably lower temporal correlations with the corresponding local BOLD time courses. Moreover, regressing out the gamma band power or powers of all LFP bands has only limited effects on the spatial patterns of BOLD-derived RSNs, collectively suggesting LFP powers contribute only partially to the local rsfMRI signal. This disparity in spatial and temporal relationships between resting-state BOLD and electrophysiology signals implies that there might be an electrophysiology-invisible component of brain activity that significantly influences the rsfMRI signal and RSNs.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>To systematically analyze the spatiotemporal relationship between resting-state electrophysiology and fMRI signals, we conducted simultaneous recordings of whole-brain rsfMRI and electrophysiology signals in the M1 and ACC in rats under both light-sedation and awake states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The accuracy of electrode placement in the M1 and ACC was confirmed using T2-weighted structural images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. S1</xref>). Raw electrophysiology data were initially preprocessed to remove MR artifacts using a template regression approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Tu and Zhang, 2022</xref>). Subsequently, the LFP was extracted by bandpass filtering preprocessed electrophysiology data within the frequency range of 0.1 - 300 Hz. An illustration of denoised LFP is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. S2</xref>. Band-specific LFP power was computed using a conventional LFP band definition (delta: 1–4 Hz, theta: 4–7 Hz, alpha: 7–13 Hz, beta: 13–30 Hz, gamma: 40–100 Hz). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1B-C</xref> illustrate the cross correlations between LFP power and BOLD signal in the M1 across the LFP spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>, 1-Hz band interval) and for individual LFP bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>). These data demonstrate that gamma band power is positively correlated with the BOLD signal, while lower-frequency bands display negative peak correlations with the BOLD signal. Additionally, the lag of the BOLD signal is approximately 2 sec for all bands, consistent with the hemodynamic response function (HRF) delay previously reported in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Scholvinck <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Winder <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>).</p>

<title>LFP and rsfMRI signals derive consistent RSN spatial patterns in lightly sedated rats.</title>
<p>We first examined the spatial relationship between brain-wide rsfMRI signals and frequency band-specific LFP powers in lightly sedated rats. For each recording site, its BOLD-derived RSN was obtained as the seedmap, calculated by voxel-wise correlating the regionally averaged BOLD time series of the seed (M1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1F</xref> and ACC in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>) with BOLD time series of individual brain voxels. This seedmap conventionally represents the resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) pattern for the seed region. To assess the extent to which this RSN could be obtained using the LFP signal recorded from the same location (M1 or ACC), we convolved the power of each LFP band with a rodent-specific HRF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1D</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Tong et al., 2019</xref>)) to generate the LFP band-predicted BOLD signal. Subsequently, we voxel-wise correlated this signal with the brain-wide rsfMRI signal, producing the LFP band-derived RSN map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Our findings revealed that the gamma band power-derived RSN map exhibited high spatial consistency with the corresponding BOLD-derived RSN map (i.e. seedmap). Specifically, for M1, the voxel-to-voxel Pearson correlation coefficient (CC) between the mean gamma-derived RSN map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1E</xref>) and mean BOLD-derived RSN map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1F</xref>) was 0.95 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1K</xref>, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.90), indicating 90% of the variance in the M1 BOLD-derived RSN map could be explained by the gamma-derived map. Conversely, spatial maps generated by lower-frequency bands displayed inverse correlations with the M1 BOLD-derived RSN map, with a trend of increasingly negative spatial CC in lower-frequency bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1E-J</xref>, delta: CC = -0.78; theta: CC = -0.78; alpha: CC = -0.5; beta: CC = -0.34), consistent with the LFP-BOLD cross correlations for these bands shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B-C</xref>. These relationships are repeatable in the ACC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs. 2A-G</xref>, delta: CC = -0.62; theta: CC = -0.3; alpha: CC = -0.12; beta: CC = 0.12; gamma: CC = 0.85). These results suggest that the spatial patterns of BOLD-based RSNs can be reliably obtained using band-specific LFP signals.</p>

</fig>
<p>To confirm that these findings were not an artifact of specific frequency cutoffs we adopted for any LFP band, we repeated the analysis for all individual 1-Hz bands across the full LFP spectrum. Once again, we observed a gradual transition from negative to positive spatial correlations in LFP-derived RSN maps with the corresponding BOLD-derived RSN maps as the LFP signal changed from low to high frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1L</xref> for M1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2H</xref> for ACC). Additionally, as a control analysis, we temporally shuffled the gamma band power in the ACC, convolved it with the HRF and recalculated the correlation map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. S3</xref>). As a result of this manipulation, the spatial pattern observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref> disappeared, suggesting that the observed LFP-derived spatial patterns were specifically related to the LFP signal, rather than an artifact of the HRF. We also confirmed that all our results are not sensitive to the rsfMRI data preprocessing step of global signal regression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figs. S4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">S5</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, our data collectively indicate that BOLD-derived RSNs can be reliably replicated using LFP power from the same site in lightly sedated rats, underscoring the critical involvement of neural activity in RSN spatial patterns.</p>

<title>Temporal correlation between LFP power and local rsfMRI signal is significant but considerably weaker.</title>
<p>Given the high reliability of the gamma power in determining spatial patterns of BOLD based RSNs, it is logical to expect the HRF-convolved gamma power should reliably predict the rsfMRI time series from the same location. To test this hypothesis, we calculated temporal correlations between local rsfMRI time series and HRF-convolved LFP powers for individual scans at each recording site, and then averaged the resulting correlation values across scans. Surprisingly, we found that the local rsfMRI signal exhibited considerably weaker temporal correlations with LFP powers. In the M1, the LFP-BOLD temporal correlations gradually shifted from negative to positive as the LFP signal transitioned from low to high frequencies, mirroring the trend observed in spatial correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1E-K</xref>). However, the absolute magnitude of these correlation coefficients was considerably lower, despite that they were all statistically significant (one sample t-tests, delta: CC = -0.20, p = 2.1 × 10<sup>-57</sup>; theta: CC = -0.19, p = 7.1 × 10<sup>-62</sup>; alpha: CC = -0.11, p = 1.2 × 10<sup>-42</sup>; beta: CC = -0.06, p = 8.4 × 10<sup>-15</sup>; gamma: CC = 0.37; p = 2.1 × 10<sup>-58</sup>; number of scans = 159). Similar results were observed in the ACC (one sample t-tests; delta: CC = -0.13, p = 1.9 × 10<sup>-28</sup>; theta: CC = -0.04, p = 8.4 × 10<sup>-7</sup>; alpha: CC = -0.03, p = 6.0 × 10<sup>-5</sup>; beta: CC = -0.01, p = 0.1; gamma: CC = 0.18, p = 6.7 × 10<sup>-42</sup>; number of scans = 172). Additionally, we confirmed that lower temporal correlations are not due to the HRF used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Fig. S6</xref>).</p>
<p>A notable difference in our calculation of spatial and temporal correlations may contribute to the disparity in their CC values. When computing spatial correlations, we first generated LFP- and BOLD-derived RSN maps for each scan, and then averaged these maps within each group before calculating spatial correlations using the averaged maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Conversely, for temporal correlations, we initially computed for correlation coefficients for individual scans, and then averaged the resulting correlation values across scans. This approach was chosen as averaging time courses first would diminish the actual signal due to the semi-random nature of spontaneous brain activities. Consequently, the variance in averaged RSN spatial maps might be lower than the variance in time series of individual scans, which can result in higher apparent spatial correlations than temporal correlations. To control this factor, we also computed spatial correlations between LFP- and BOLD-derived RSN maps for individual scans, and then averaged the corresponding correlations across scans. Similar to scan-wise temporal correlations, scanwise spatial correlations were significant for all LFP bands (one sample t-tests; in the M1, delta: CC = -0.37, p = 4.9 × 10–52; theta: CC = -0.39, p = 3.9 × 10—62; alpha: CC = -0.24, p = 5.8 × 10<sup>-37</sup>; beta: CC = -0.15, p = 3.9 × 10<sup>-15</sup>; gamma: CC = 0.58, p= 1.0 × 10<sup>-56</sup>; in the ACC, delta: CC = - 0.26, p = 2.6 × 10<sup>-27</sup>; theta: CC = -0.09, p = 1.7 × 10<sup>-6</sup>; alpha: CC = -0.04, p = 0.04; beta: CC = 0.03, p = 0.06; gamma: CC = 0.33; p=5.4 × 10<sup>-40</sup>). Comparisons of scan-wise spatial and temporal correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figs. 3A-B</xref>) indicate that even after controlling for the variance level, the magnitude of spatial correlations remains appreciably higher than that of temporal correlations for all bands (paired t tests across individual scans; in the M1, delta: p = 1.01 × 10<sup>-35</sup>; theta: p = 3.74 × 10<sup>-50</sup>; alpha: p = 3.54 × 10<sup>-25</sup>; beta: p = 1.18 × 10<sup>-12</sup>; gamma: p= 7.02 × 10<sup>-42</sup>; in the ACC, delta: p = 6.73 × 10<sup>-21</sup>; theta: p = 5.75 × 10<sup>-5</sup>; alpha: p = 0.74; beta: p = 7.34x 10<sup>-5</sup>; gamma: p=3.43 × 10<sup>-29</sup>).</p>

<p>Given that the gamma power-derived RSN map can explain ~90% of the spatial variance of the BOLD-derived RSN map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1K</xref>, R = 0.95, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.90) when noise is diminished by averaging RSN maps across scans, we ask how much variance of the local BOLD time series the gamma power can explain without significant influence of noise. Although we cannot directly average rsfMRI/electrophysiology time courses across scans to reduce noise levels, we can estimate the true LFP-BOLD temporal correlation by quantitatively evaluating the effect of noise on correlation values. To achieve this aim, we utilized the difference between the spatial correlation of averaged M1 RSN maps (i.e. referred to as denoised data, R = 0.95, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1K</xref>) and that of unaveraged RSN maps (i.e. referred to as with-noise data, R = 0.58, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref>, gamma band power). Using this difference, we simulated two fixed signals with a true correlation of 0.95. By introducing varying levels of noise to the signals, we determined at what noise level the apparent correlation between the two signals became 0.58 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Specifically, in each trial, random noise at a defined contrast-noise-level (CNR) was added to the simulated signals, and this process was repeated 159 times (i.e. equal to the number of scans in our study) for a given CNR level. At each CNR level, the correlation was calculated based on either the averaged signals from all 159 trials (i.e. simulating denoised data, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3C</xref>), or the signals of individual trials (i.e. simulating with-noise data) before averaging resulting correlations across trials.</p>
<p>As anticipated, lower CNR values correspond to lower apparent trial-wise correlation values. Interestingly, we discovered that the trial-wise apparent correlation of 0.58, with the true correlation of 0.95, corresponds to the CNR of 1.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3D-E</xref>), which aligns with the CNR of BOLD contrast reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Atkinson et al., 2008</xref>). At this CNR level, we estimated that the true BOLD-LFP temporal correlation in the M1 should be approximately 0.59 (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.35, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3F-G</xref>), when the apparent correlation is 0.37 as measured by the gamma-BOLD temporal correlation in our real data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref>). These findings indicate the temporal information provided by gamma power can only explain a minor portion (approximately 35%) of the temporal variance in the BOLD time series, even after accounting for the noise effect, which is in line with the reported correlation values between the cerebral blood volume (CBV) and fluctuations in GCaMP signal in head-fixed mice during periods of immobility (R = 0.63) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Ma et al., 2016</xref>).These results are also consistent with previous reports of relatively weak temporal correlations between gamma power and hemodynamic signals at rest obtained using different imaging modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Scholvinck <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Winder <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Furthermore, our simulation suggests that the difference in the number of data points (1200 in temporal correlation calculation vs. 6157 in spatial correlation calculation) has a negligible influence on correlation values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figs. 3D-G</xref>).</p>

<title>Regressing out LFP powers has limited impact on RSN spatial patterns.</title>
<p>Given the lower predictive value of LFP power on the local rsfMRI signal, we investigated the extent to which the temporal information of LFP powers affects the RSN spatial patterns. The gamma-band power in the M1 (or ACC), after convolving with HRF, was linearly regressed out from rsfMRI signals of all brain voxels. As expected, the spatial patterns of gamma power-derived RSN maps observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1E</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref> disappeared after the regression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figs. 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>).

<p>To investigate whether the regression process is disproportionately dominated by time points with the largest LFP amplitude (i.e. outliers), we recalculated the M1/ACC BOLD-derived RSN maps after removing rsfMRI volumes corresponding to peaks in the M1/ACC gamma power (i.e. time points with the signal amplitude above the 85th percentile in HRF-convolved gamma power of each scan, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figs. 4D, 4E</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5D</xref>).

<title>Disparity in temporal and spatial correlations persists across different physiological states.</title>
<p>To determine whether the disparity between temporal and spatial correlations of restingstate LFP and fMRI signals we observed is a specific phenomenon under anesthesia or can be generalized to different physiologic states, we repeated the experiment in awake rats. Despite that the physiological dynamics are substantially different, we still found higher spatial correlations between LFP-derived maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Fig. S8A</xref>) and the BOLD-derived RSN map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Fig. S8B</xref>) in the M1. Also similar to what we showed in anesthetized rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>), correlation coefficients gradually changed from negative in low-frequency bands to positive in high-frequency bands, which were revealed both in conventionally defined bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figs. S8C-G</xref>) and 1-Hz bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Fig. S8H</xref>). In the ACC, while spatial correlations in low-frequency bands were somewhat diminished, the overall pattern remained similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Fig. S9</xref>). Similar to the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>, significant but weaker temporal correlations between the rsfMRI signal and HRF-convolved gamma band power were observed in awake rats (one sample t-tests; for M1, delta: CC = -0.05, p = 2.3 × 10<sup>-4</sup>; theta: CC = -0.06, p = 4.7 × 10<sup>-6</sup>; alpha: CC = -0.06, p = 4.6 × 10–5; beta: CC = -0.032, p = 3.0 × 10<sup>-3</sup>; gamma: CC = 0.04, p= 0.02; for ACC, delta: CC = 0.02, p = 0.29; theta: CC = 0.0009, p = 0.96; alpha: CC = - 0.02, p = 0.31; beta: CC = 0.006, p = 0.66; gamma: CC = 0.10, p= 9.52 × 10<sup>-7</sup>; number of scans = 50). Scan-wise comparison between temporal and spatial correlations are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Fig. S10</xref>. Overall, both spatial and temporal correlations showed lower magnitudes in the awake state, likely due to increased variability from motion and other physiological fluctuations, as well as the smaller number of scans compared to the light sedation state (50 awake scans, 159 light-sedation scans for M1 and 172 light-sedation scans for ACC). Nonetheless, the consistent pattern of lower temporal but higher spatial correlations between gamma power and the rsfMRI signal supports the notion that this disparity is a general phenomenon across different physiological states.</p>
<p>The lack of significant alteration in BOLD-derived RSN maps after regressing out gammaband power or powers of all LFP bands in both ACC and M1 of awake rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Fig. S11</xref>) further reinforces our earlier findings. These results indicate that the major findings observed in lightly anesthetized rats, including the disparity between temporal and spatial correlations, can be replicated in unanesthetized rats. Therefore, it appears that these results are not specific to the effects of anesthesia but rather reflect fundamental aspects of the relationship between electrophysiological and hemodynamic signals in the brain across different physiological states.</p>

<title>Ongoing rsfMRI signal could be contributed by electrophysiology-invisible brain activities.</title>
<p>Our findings indicate that the LFP signal can capture RSN patterns that account for nearly all the spatial variance observed in BOLD-based seedmaps. However, the temporal dynamics of the LFP signal only explain a minor fraction of the local BOLD time series and have minimal impact on the spatial patterns of BOLD-based RSNs. To reconcile this apparent contradiction, we propose a theoretical model, described as follows:</p>
<p>Brain activity consists of components measurable by electrophysiology and others that are electrophysiology-invisible. In addition to the electrophysiology activity, electrophysiology invisible brain activities, such as those involving nNOS neurons and astrocytes, actively contribute to NVC and can exert a significant influence on the rsfMRI signal. During the resting state, these two components may not be synchronized, lowering temporal correlations between electrophysiology and rsfMRI signals. Another factor contributing to low LFP-BOLD temporal correlations could be neuromodulations from distal modulator nuclei (e.g. locus coerulues and/or basal forebrain), which exert strong vasoactive effects but may not proportionately affect electrophysiology activity. Moreover, the signaling of electrophysiology activities and that of electrophysiology-invisible are both constrained by the same anatomical pathways. This allows the two signals to generate similar RSN spatial patterns in parallel measured by the BOLD signal, which can reflect both direct and indirect anatomical connectivity. The model is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figs. 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18">S12</xref>, and further details will be discussed in the next section.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>BOLD-derived RSNs have been widely investigated in multiple species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Damoiseaux et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Lu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Mantini et al., 2011</xref>) and have been applied in various physiological and pathological conditions. However, the neural mechanisms underlying RSNs and the rsfMRI signal remain incompletely understood. To shed more light on this issue, we conducted systematic analysis of simultaneously recorded electrophysiology and rsfMRI signals in both lightly anesthetized and awake animals. Our findings reveal that both electrophysiology and rsfMRI signals can generate highly consistent brain-wide RSN patterns. However, the temporal information of the LFP signal contributes only minimally to the local BOLD time series at the same recording site. These seemingly paradoxical findings, along with those reported in the literature, can potentially be reconciled by the theoretical model we propose, which suggests that RSNs may also arise from electrophysiology-invisible brain activities that play a significant role in NVC. Together, our data and model offer a new perspective for interpreting the neural basis underlying the resting-state BOLD signal.</p>
<p>The spatial correspondence between BOLD- and electrophysiology-derived RSNs has been repeatedly reported across various physiological states and species using different methods. Studies employing electroencephalography (EEG) or electrocorticography (ECoG) in humans have shown that RSNs derived from the power of multiple-site electrophysiological signals exhibit similar spatial patterns to classic BOLD-derived RSNs, such as the default-mode network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Hacker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kucyi et al., 2018</xref>). This high spatial correspondence between rsfMRI and LFP signals can even be found at the columnar level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Shi et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, simultaneous recordings of resting-state calcium and fMRI signals in awake rats have revealed highly consistent spatial patterns between calcium- and BOLD-associated RSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Ma et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, voltage sensitive dye imaging in mice has unveiled comparable sensory-evoked and hemisphere-wide activity motifs represented in spontaneous activity in both lightly anesthetized and awake states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Mohajerani et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, in a more recent study by Vafaii and colleagues, overlapping cortical networks were identified using both fMRI and calcium imaging modalities, suggesting that networks observable in fMRI studies exhibit corresponding neural activity spatial patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Vafaii et al., 2024</xref>). These results align well with the notion that RSN spatial patterns are highly consistent with known functional systems and activation patterns observed in task-based studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Biswal <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Glasser <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Hampson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Lowe <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Smith <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), as well as patterns of structural networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Andrews-Hanna <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Greicius <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Lowe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Taken together, previous studies and our data indicate that both electrophysiology and rsfMRI measurements can generate consistent RSN spatial patterns, strongly suggesting that the spatial structures of RSNs are dictated by neural activities.</p>
<p>Previous studies have also indicated that RSNs are likely constrained by axonal projections. For instance, consistent sensory-evoked and hemisphere-wide activity motifs in mice, as revealed using voltage-sensitive dye imaging, are defined by regional axonal projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Mohajerani <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Our previous work in awake rats further demonstrate spatial consistency between RSNs and anatomical connectivity patterns in thalamocortical networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Liang et al., 2013</xref>). In the current study, we compared RSNs of M1 and ACC to their anatomical networks defined by the axonal projection patterns obtained from the Allen Brain Institute database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19">Fig. S13</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Oh et al., 2014</xref>)), illustrating that RSNs revealed by either the BOLD or LFP signal closely resemble the corresponding anatomical networks. It is important to note that RSNs measured by functional connectivity can reflect both direct and indirect connectivity and thus may not necessarily have identical spatial patterns as the corresponding anatomical networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Honey et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to the seemingly strong LFP-BOLD relationship inferred from their high spatial correlations, we observed appreciably lower (yet significant) temporal correlations between the two signals from the same recording sites (M1 and ACC). Regressing out LFP powers has limited impact on RSN spatial patterns, reinforcing the notion that the contribution of temporal variations of the LFP signal to RSN spatial patterns is minor. These results are supported by previous research demonstrating weak but significant correlations between CBV changes and spontaneous gamma-band LFP or multiunit activity in awake, head-fixed mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Winder <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Importantly, persistent spontaneous fluctuations in CBV were observed even after blocking local neural spiking and glutamatergic input, as well as noradrenergic receptors, indicating that hemodynamic signal fluctuations may not dominantly reflect local ongoing electrophysiology activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Winder <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Comparably low temporal correlations between gamma-band power and the rsfMRI signal have been reported in monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Scholvinck <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Shmuel and Leopold, 2008</xref>). Additionally, data from our group show similarly low temporal correlations between spontaneous calcium peaks, a measure of neural spiking activity, and the rsfMRI signal in awake rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Ma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>). Furthermore, Vafaii et. al. revealed notable differences in functional connectivity strength measured by fMRI and calcium imaging, despite an overlapping spatial pattern of cortical networks identified by both modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Vafaii et al., 2024</xref>). These findings collectively suggest that while the temporal correlation between electrophysiology and rsfMRI signals is significant, the effect size of this correlation might be small. This result appears to remain consistent even for infraslow LFP activity (&lt;1 Hz). Our data show that in the M1, the temporal correlation between infraslow LFP power and the rsfMRI signal was 0.08, while both derived consistent RSN spatial patterns (spatial correlation = 0.7), in line with the report that RSNs can be derived from infraslow LFP activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Li et al., 2022</xref>). It is noteworthy that these results differ from two earlier studies in isoflurane-anesthetized rats, which found the LFP power in the primary somatosensory cortex was highly correlated with BOLD fluctuations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Pan et al., 2011</xref>). This discrepancy may be attributed to brain-wide synchronization during burst suppression in deeply anesthetized states in those studies.</p>
<p>Why would electrophysiology and rsfMRI signals exhibit unmatched spatial and temporal correlations? Our model offers one possible scenario that can reconcile this discrepancy. It hypothesizes that a portion of the rsfMRI signal is driven by electrophysiology invisible brain activities involved in NVC. LFP records various neural activities, such as synaptic potentials and voltage-gated membrane fluctuations, reflecting the input and local neural processing of a particular brain region. However, electrophysiology cannot measure activities from certain cell populations, while electrophysiology invisible components can trigger vasoactive responses and significantly contribute to the rsfMRI signal. For instance, the electrical activity of nNOS neurons is not detectable by electrophysiology because the nNOS neuron population is very small, yet it strongly contributes to NVC. Chemogenetic or pharmacological stimulation of nNOS neurons causes vasodilation without detectable changes in LFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Echagarruga et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, astrocytes, a type of glia cell, coordinate communication between neurons and blood vessels and play a crucial role in NVC. Astrocytes regulate vessel tone by releasing signaling molecules such as ATP, arachidonic acid metabolites and nitric oxide (Ladecola and Nedergaard, 2007; Mulligan and MacVicar, 2004; Murphy et al., 1993). Furthermore, astrocytes can alter the diameter of blood vessels by extending or retracting the endfeet wrapping around them (Mills et al., 2022; Niu et al., 2019). Optogenetic stimulation of astrocytes in transgenic mice without affecting neurons elicited a BOLD response, indicating that astrocyte activity alone can cause changes in the BOLD signal, independent of neuronal activity (Takata et al., 2018). Additionally, Uhlirova et al. conducted a study where they utilized optogenetic stimulation and two-photon imaging to investigate how the activation of different neuron types affects blood vessels in mice. They discovered that only the activation of inhibitory neurons led to vessel constriction, albeit with a negligible impact on LFP (Uhlirova et al., 2016). These studies collectively suggest electrophysiology-invisible activities can significantly drive the rsfMRI signal. Exclusively identifying all electrophysiology-invisible sources contributing to the rsfMRI signal is beyond the scope of this work. However, a key point is that as the resting state LFP and electrophysiology-invisible (and thus rsfMRI) signals reflect different components of brain activities, they can be minimally synchronized and display low temporal correlations. Another possible factor that can contribute to low BOLD-LFP temporal correlations is direct modulation of the vasculature from distant modulator nuclei (e.g. locus coerulues and/or basal forebrain). Some neuromodulators, such as norepinephrine (NE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bekar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Kim et al., 2016</xref>) and acetylcoline (Ach) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Sato and Sato, 1995</xref>), have vasoconstrictive/vasodilatory effects that are spatially targeted in distributed brain regions, and thus can modulate brain-wide rsfMRI signals. However, these neural modulation effects may not be proportionately reflected from the electrophysiology signal, lowering BOLD-LFP temporal correlations (see a schematic diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18">Fig. S12</xref>). On the other hand, as the signaling of LFP- and electrophysiology-invisible components in functional networks is constrained by the same anatomical connectivity structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Liu et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Liu et al., 2018b</xref>), the LFP- and BOLD-derived RSN spatial patterns can be highly similar and thus have high spatial correlations.</p>
<p>Our model can also potentially explain high spatial and temporal correlations when brain activation is evoked by external stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Winder <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). At the evoked state, both LFP (and spiking activity) and electrophysiology-invisible components are temporally modulated by the same external stimulation paradigm, leading to both high temporal and high spatial correlations between fMRI and electrophysiology signals.</p>
<sec id="s3-1">
<title>Potential pitfalls</title>
<p>Our proposed theoretic model represents just one potential explanation for the apparent discrepancy in temporal and spatial relationships between resting-state electrophysiology and BOLD signals. It is important to acknowledge that there may be other scenarios where a stronger temporal relationship between LFP and BOLD signals could manifest. For instance, recent research suggests that the relationship between LFP and rsfMRI signals may vary across different modes or instances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Cabral et al., 2023</xref>), which can be masked by correlations across the entire time series. Moreover, the 1-second temporal resolution employed in our study may obscure certain temporal correlations between LFPs and rsfMRI signals. Future investigations employing ultrafast fMRI imaging coupled with dynamic connectivity analysis could offer a more nuanced exploration of BOLD-LFP temporal correlations at higher temporal resolutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bolt et al., 2022</xref>; Thompson et al., 2014; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Ma and Zhang, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to LFP, various other features can be derived from electrophysiology signals and alternative methods for comparing electrophysiology and rsfMRI signals, such as rank correlation, warrant consideration. It is plausible that employing different features or comparison methods could yield a stronger BOLD-electrophysiology temporal relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Ma et al., 2016</xref>). In our current study we focused solely on band-limited LFP power as the primary feature in our analysis, given its prevalence in prior studies of LFP-rsfMRI correlates. More importantly, we demonstrate that band-specific LFP powers can yield spatial patterns nearly identical to those derived from rsfMRI signals, prompting a closer examination of the temporal relationship between these same features. Furthermore, since correlational analysis was used in studying the LFP-BOLD spatial relationship, we used the same analysis method when comparing their temporal relationship. Some other comparison methods such as rank correlation and transformation prior to comparison were also tested and results remain persistent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20">Fig. S14</xref>). These findings align with the notion that, compared to nonlinear models, linear models offer superior predictive value for the rsfMRI signal using LFP data, as comprehensively illustrated in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Nozari et al., 2024</xref>) (also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Fig. S7</xref>). Importantly, in this study, the predictive powers (represented by R<sup>2</sup>) of various comparison methods tested all remain below 0.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Nozari et al., 2024</xref>), suggesting that while certain models may enhance the temporal relationship between LFP and BOLD signals, the improvement is likely modest. Further exploration involving the extraction of all possible features from electrophysiology signals and their examination in relation to the rsfMRI signal, as well as the exploration of alternative methods for comparing LFP and rsfMRI signals warrants more detailed analysis in future studies.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>Our study demonstrates that BOLD-based RSNs can be reliably derived by the electrophysiology signal. Nonetheless, the weak BOLD-LFP temporal correlations suggest that the dominant contributors to these networks might be signals not captured by electrophysiology. This finding provides a novel interpretation of RSNs. Importantly, this new concept of RSN signaling does not in any way diminish the importance of BOLD-based RSNs or the rsfMRI method. In fact, it makes fMRI even more important than previously thought because it might provide a new signal that traditional electrophysiology measures cannot provide.</p>

<sec id="s3-2-1-1">
<title>Animals</title>
<p>All experiments in the present study were approved by and conducted in accordance with guidelines from the Pennsylvania State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Adult male Long-Evans rats weighing 300–500g were obtained from Charles River Laboratory (Wilmington, MA). Animals were housed in Plexiglas cages with food and water given ad libitum. The ambient temperature was maintained at 22–24°C under a 12h light :12h dark cycle.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3-2-1-2">
<title>Surgery</title>
<p>MR-compatible electrodes were implanted in animals with aseptic stereotaxic surgeries. The rat was briefly anesthetized with isoflurane before receiving intramuscular injections of ketamine (40 mg/kg) and xylazine (12 mg/kg). Baytril (2.5mg/kg) and long-acting buprenorphine (1.0mg/kg) were administered subcutaneously as antibiotics and analgesics, respectively. The animal was then endotracheal incubated and ventilated with oxygen using the PhysioSuite system (Kent Scientific Corporation). Body temperature was monitored and maintained at 37 °C with a warming pad placed underneath the animal (PhysioSuite, Kent Scientific Corporaition). Heart rate and SpO2 were continuously monitored using a pulse oximetry (MouseSTAT® Jr, Kent Scientific Corporation) throughout the surgery. After performing craniotomies over the right ACC (coordinates: anterior/posterior +1.5, medial/lateral +0.5, dorsal/ventral -2.8) and the left M1 (coordinates: anterior/posterior +3.2, medial/lateral -3, dorsal/ventral -2.8), two MR-compatible electrodes (MRCM16LP, NeuroNexus Inc) were carefully implanted into the ACC and M1, respectively. The reference and grounding wires from each electrode were wired together and connected to one of the two silver wires placed in the cerebellum. This electrode, which is a silicon-based micromachined probe, is capable of recording the LFP activity within a broad frequency range, starting from 0.1Hz. At last, the skull was sealed with dental cement. After surgery, the animal was returned to the homecage and allowed to recover for at least one week before any experiment.</p>

<title>Acclimation for awake imaging</title>
<p>Rats were restrained using a custom-designed restrainer during awake imaging sessions. To minimize stress and motion during the imaging process, animals underwent a 7-day acclimation procedure to the restrainer as well as the MRI environment and scanning noise. The duration of the acclimation procedure was gradually increased from 15 min on the first day to 60 min on days 4–7 days (i.e., 15 min on day 1, 30 min on day 2, 45 min on day 3, and 60 min on days 4–7). More details of the acclimation procedure can be found in previous publications from our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Liang et al., 2012</xref>) and other research groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bergmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Chang et al., 2016</xref>).</p>

<title>Simultaneous rsfMRI and electrophysiology recordings</title>
<p>All rsfMRI experiments were conducted on a 7T Bruker 70/30 BioSpec system running ParaVision 6.0.1(Bruker, Billerica, MA) using a homemade single loop surface coil at the <italic>high field MRI facility</italic> at the Pennsylvania State University. During each fMRI session, T2*-weighted rsfMRI images covering the entire brain were obtained using an echo planar imaging sequence with the following parameters: repetition time (TR) = 1 s; echo time (TE) = 15 ms; field of view = 3.2 × 3.2 cm<sup>2</sup>; matrix size = 64 × 64; slice number = 20; slice thickness = 1mm; volume number = 1200. Five to ten scans were repeated within each session. T2-weighted anatomical images were also acquired using a rapid acquisition with a relaxation enhancement (RARE) sequence with the following parameters: TR = 3000 ms; TE= 40 ms; field of view = 3.2 × 3.2 cm<sup>2</sup>; matrix size = 256 × 256; slice number = 20; slice thickness = 1 mm; repetition number = 6.</p>
<p>Six rats with two electrodes implanted in the ACC and M1 were imaged in both awake and lightly sedated states in separate fMRI sessions. Two additional rats with an electrode only implanted in the ACC were imaged in the light sedation state. For both states, animals were restrained throughout the imaging session. In the light sedation state, the animal was sedated with the combination of low-dose dexmedetomidine (initial bolus of 0.05 mg/kg followed by a constant infusion at the rate of 0.1 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>·h<sup>-1</sup>) and low-dose isoflurane (0.3%). Artificial tears were applied to protect the animal’s eyes from drying out. Body temperature was maintained at 37°C using warm air and was monitored using a rectal thermometer.</p>
<p>Before imaging, the implanted electrodes were connected to MR-compatible LP16CH headstages and a PZ5 neurodigitizer amplifier (Tucker Davis Technologies (TDT) Inc, Alachua, FL). Electrophysiology recording began 10 min before rsfMRI data acquisition and continued until the end of the imaging session using a TDT recording system and an RZ2 BioAmp Processor (TDT Inc, Alachua, FL). The raw, unfiltered electrophysiology signal was sampled at 24414 Hz and stored using the TDT Synapse software on a WS8 workstation.</p>

<sec id="s3-2-1-5">
<title>rsfMRI and electrophysiology data preprocessing</title>
<p>All data preprocessing and analysis were performed using MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA). First, the movement of each rsfMRI volume was estimated using the framewise displacement (FD). For the awake imaging data, volumes with FD &gt; 0.1 mm and their adjacent preceding and following volumes were removed. If &gt; 25% of volumes in a scan were scrubbed, the entire scan was excluded from further analysis. For rsfMRI data collected in the lightly sedated state, scans with any volume that had FD &gt; 0.1 mm were removed from further analysis. Subsequently, data were preprocessed using the following steps: co-registration to a defined atlas, motion correction (SPM12), spatial smoothing using a Gaussian kernel (FWHM = 0.75 mm), voxelwise nuisance regression with the regressors of motion parameters as well as signals from the white matter and ventricles, and the global brain signal, and, lastly, bandpass temporal filtering (0.01–0.1 Hz).</p>
<p>Raw electrophysiology data were preprocessed to remove the MR interference using a template regression method as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Tu and Zhang, 2022</xref>). Briefly, the raw electrophysiology signal for each scan was first aligned to the corresponding rsfMRI scan, and segmented for each imaging slice based on the starting time of the scan. Next, an MRI interference template for each rsfMRI slice acquisition was obtained by averaging the electrophysiology data across all slices from all rsfMRI volumes. The template was further aligned to the electrophysiology data for each slice acquisition using cross correlation and was then linearly regressed out from the raw electrophysiology data. In addition, a series of notch filters for harmonics of the power supply (60 Hz and multiples of 60 Hz) and slice acquisition (20 Hz and multiples of 20 Hz) were applied to further denoise the data.</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>The LFP power was obtained by bandpass filtering preprocessed electrophysiology data in the frequency range of 0.1 - 300 Hz. Based on the conventional LFP band definition (delta: 1–4 Hz, theta: 4–7 Hz, alpha: 7–13 Hz, beta: 13–30 Hz, gamma: 40–100 Hz) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Lu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>), the LFP band power was computed using the MATLAB function <italic>spectrogram</italic> with a window size of 1 s and a step size of 0.1 s. To investigate the relationship between the LFP and rsfMRI signals, the time course of band-specific LFP power was convolved with a hemodynamic response function (HRF, p = [4 4 1 1 6 0 32] for function <italic>spm_hrf)</italic> to generate the corresponding LFP-predicted BOLD signal. The HRF used was specific to rodents with a shorter onset time and time-to-peak as a faster HRF was reported in rats relative to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Tong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>). The temporal relationship between the LFP and fMRI signals was quantified using the Pearson correlation between the HRF-convolved LFP band power and the regionally averaged rsfMRI time course from voxels surrounding the implanted electrode for each site. To examine the potential impact of HRF used, we calculated the BOLD gamma power correlation using different HRFs with various response delays, ranging from 2 sec to 8 sec with the increment of 0.25 sec, as well as different undershoot delays ranging from 2 sec to 12 sec with the increment of 0.5 sec (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Fig. S6</xref>).</p>
<p>The LFP-derived spatial correlation maps for the M1 and ACC were respectively generated by computing voxel-wise Pearson correlations between each HRF-convolved LFP band power and brain-wide rsfMRI signals. The seedmaps for the M1 and ACC were respectively obtained by calculating the voxel-wise Pearson correlations between the regionally averaged rsfMRI time course for each seed and rsfMRI signals of all brain voxels.</p>
<p>To determine the contribution of LFP powers to BOLD-based RSFC, we removed LFP powers from voxel-wise fMRI signals and then recalculated RSNs. Given that the gamma signal might be the most related to the rsfMRI signal, the time course of gamma-band power (convolved with HRF) was linearly regressed out from rsfMRI signals of all brain voxels. To examine the potential contributions of other LFP bands, all five LFP band powers (each convolved with HRF) were “softly” removed from voxel-wise rsfMRI signals, meaning only the unique components in five bands were regressed out but the shared components were maintained. Specific details of soft regression can be found in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Griffanti et al., 2014</xref>). This method can avoid ‘over regression’ when multiple regressors are involved particularly when regressors are correlated between themselves. Lastly, we removed rsfMRI volumes corresponding to peaks in the M1/ACC gamma power. The seedmaps of M1 and ACC were recalculated and compared before and after removing the LFP signal.</p>

<title>Simulation</title>
<p>We simulated two fixed signals with the true Pearson correlation of 0.95. The first signal was generated using MATLAB function <italic>rand</italic> with 10000 data points. The second signal with a defined correlation with the first signal (i.e. 0.95) was obtained based on the equation below:

</p>
<p>in which A represents the first signal, Corr is the desired Pearson correlation coefficient, and N(0, 1) represents random values with the mean equal to 0 and standard deviation equal to 1. For each signal, random noise was added to achieve a contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) ranging from 0.1 to 5 with the step size of 0.1. CNR was quantified by the standard deviation of the signal over the standard deviation of the noise. This process was repeated 159 times (equal to the # of scans in the present study). The noise-added signals were resampled to either 1200 or 6157 data points, which corresponded to the total number of time points used to calculate temporal correlations and total number of brain voxels used to calculate spatial correlations, respectively, in our study. Pearson correlations between the resampled signals either based on the averaged signals from all 159 trials or on individual trials were calculated.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study combines fMRI and electrophysiology in sedated and awake rats to show that LFPs strongly explain spatial correlations in resting-state fMRI but only weakly explain temporal variability. The authors propose that other, electrophysiology-invisible mechanisms contribute to the fMRI signal. The evidence supporting the separation of spatial and temporal correlations is <bold>convincing</bold>, and the authors consider alternative potential factors that could account for the differences in spatial and temporal correlation that were observed. This work will be of interest to researchers who study the mechanisms behind resting-state fMRI.</p>

<p>Tu et al investigated how LFPs recorded simultaneously with rsfMRI explain the spatiotemporal patterns of functional connectivity in sedated and awake rats. They find that connectivity maps generated from gamma band LFPs (from either area) explain very well the spatial correlations observed in rsfMRI signals, but that the temporal variance in rsfMRI data is more poorly explained by the same LFP signals. The authors excluded the effects of sedation in this effect by investigating rats in the awake state (a remarkable feat in the MRI scanner), where the findings generally replicate. The authors also performed a series of tests to assess multiple factors (including noise, outliers, etc., and nonlinearity of the data...) in their analysis.</p>
<p>This apparent paradox is then explained by a hypothetical model in which LFPs and neurovascular coupling are generated in some sense &quot;in parallel&quot; by different neuron types, some of which drive LFPs and are measured by ePhys, while others (nNOS, etc.) have an important role in neurovascular coupling but are less visible in Ephys data. Hence the discrepancy is explained by the spatial similarity of neural activity but the more &quot;selective&quot; LFPs picked up by Ephys account for the different temporal aspects observed.</p>
<p>This is a deep, outstanding study that harnesses multidisciplinary approaches (fMRI and ephys) for observing brain activity. The results are strongly supported by the comprehensive analyses done by the authors, that ruled out many potential sources for the observed findings. The study's impact is expected to be very large.</p>

The authors investigate the disparity between spatial extant and temporal variance of electrophysiological-fMRI correlations in a rodent model. They found high correspondence in spatial extent but a disparity in temporal variance. From this, they propose a model of an electrophysiologically-invisible signal affecting temporal variance.</p>
<p>I remain skeptical about the &quot;electrophysiologically invisible signal&quot; model but the authors have done a much better job of both explaining it and hedging it in this version. Readers can decide for themselves.</p>
<p>The revision submitted by the authors substantially improves writing and methods.</p>

<p>This important study combines fMRI and electrophysiology in sedated and awake rats to show that LFPs strongly explain spatial correlations in resting-state fMRI but only weakly explain temporal variability. They propose that other, electrophysiology-invisible mechanisms contribute to the fMRI signal. The evidence supporting the separation of spatial and temporal correlations is convincing, however, the support of electrophysiological-invisible mechanisms is incomplete, considering alternative potential factors that could account for the differences in spatial and temporal correlation that were observed. This work will be of interest to researchers who study the fundamental mechanisms behind resting-state fMRI.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the encouraging comments. We added a section in discussion that thoroughly discussed the potential alternative factors that could account for the differences in spatial and temporal correlation that we observed.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Tu et al investigated how LFPs recorded simultaneously with rsfMRI explain the spatiotemporal patterns of functional connectivity in sedated and awake rats. They find that connectivity maps generated from gamma band LFPs (from either area) explain very well the spatial correlations observed in rsfMRI signals, but that the temporal variance in rsfMRI data is more poorly explained by the same LFP signals. The authors excluded the effects of sedation in this effect by investigating rats in the awake state (a remarkable feat in the MRI scanner), where the findings generally replicate. The authors also performed a series of tests to assess multiple factors (including noise, outliers, and nonlinearity of the data) in their analysis.</p>
<p>This apparent paradox is then explained by a hypothetical model in which LFPs and neurovascular coupling are generated in some sense &quot;in parallel&quot; by different neuron types, some of which drive LFPs and are measured by ePhys, while others (nNOS, etc.) have an important role in neurovascular coupling but are less visible in Ephys data. Hence the discrepancy is explained by the spatial similarity of neural activity but the more &quot;selective&quot; LFPs picked up by Ephys account for the different temporal aspects observed.</p>
<p>This is a deep, outstanding study that harnesses multidisciplinary approaches (fMRI and ephys) for observing brain activity. The results are strongly supported by the comprehensive analyses done by the authors, which ruled out many potential sources for the observed findings. The study's impact is expected to be very large.</p>
<p>Comment: There are very few weaknesses in the work, but I'd point out that the 1second temporal resolution may have masked significant temporal correlations between</p>
<p>LFPs and spontaneous activity, for instance, as shown by Cabral et al Nature Communications 2023, and even in earlier QPP work from the Keilholz Lab.

</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this great point. Indeed, it is likely that LFP and rsfMRI signals are more strongly related during some modes/instances than others, and hence correlation across the entire time series may have masked this effect. In addition, we agree that 1-second temporal resolution may obscure some temporal correlations between LFPs and rsfMRI signal. The choice of 1-second temporal resolution was made to be consistent with the TR in our fMRI experiment, considering the slow hemodynamic response. Ultrafast fMRI imaging combined with dynamic connectivity analysis in a future study might enable more detailed examination of BOLD-LFP temporal correlations at higher temporal resolutions. We have added the following paragraph to the revised manuscript:</p>
<p>“Our proposed theoretic model represents just one potential explanation for the apparent discrepancy in temporal and spatial relationships between resting-state electrophysiology and BOLD signals. It is important to acknowledge that there may be other scenarios where a stronger temporal relationship between LFP and BOLD signals could manifest. For instance, recent research suggests that the relationship between LFP and rsfMRI signals may vary across different modes or instances (Cabral et al., 2023), which can be masked by correlations across the entire time series. Moreover, the 1-second temporal resolution employed in our study may obscure certain temporal correlations between LFPs and rsfMRI signals. Future investigations employing ultrafast fMRI imaging coupled with dynamic connectivity analysis could offer a more nuanced exploration of BOLD-LFP temporal correlations at higher temporal resolutions (Bolt et al., 2022; Cabral et al., 2023; Ma and Zhang, 2018; Thompson et al., 2014).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The authors address a question that is interesting and important to the sub-field of rsfMRI that examines electrophysiological correlates of rsfMRI. That is, while electrophysiology-produced correlation maps often appear similar to correlation maps produced from BOLD alone (as has been shown in many papers) is this actually coming from the same source of variance, or independent but spatially-correlated sources of variance? To address this, the authors recorded LFP signals in 2 areas (M1 and ACC) and compared the maps produced by correlating BOLD with them to maps produced by BOLD-BOLD correlations. They then attempt to remove various sources of variance and see the results.</p>
<p>The basic concept of the research is sound, though primarily of interest to the subset of rsfMRI researchers who use simultaneous electrophysiology. However, there are major problems in the writing, and also a major methodological problem.</p>
<p>Major problems with writing:</p>
<p>Comment 1: There is substantial literature on rats on site-specific LFP recording compared to rsfMRI, and much of it already examined removing part of the LFP and examining rsfMRI, or vice versa. The authors do not cover it and consider their work on signal removal more novel than it is.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added more literature studies to the revised manuscript. It is important to note that while there exists a substantial body of literature on site-specific LFP recording coupled with rsfMRI, our paper makes a significant contribution by unveiling the disparity in temporal and spatial relationships between resting-state electrophysiological and fMRI signals. This goes beyond mere reporting of spatial/temporal correlations. Furthermore, our exploration of the impact of removing LFP on rsfMRI spatial patterns constitutes one among several analyses employed to demonstrate that the temporal fluctuations of LFP minimally affect BOLD-derived RSN spatial patterns. We wish to clarify that our intention is not to claim this aspect of our work is more novel than similar analyses conducted in previous studies (we apologize if our original manuscript conveyed that impression). Rather, the novelty lies in the objective of this analysis, which is to elucidate the displarity in temporal and spatial relationships between resting-state electrophysiological and fMRI signals—a crucial issue that has not been thoroughly addressed previously.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 2: The conclusion of the existence of an &quot;electrophysiology-invisible signal&quot; is far too broad considering the limited scope of this study. There are many factors that can be extracted from LFP that are not used in this study (envelope, phase, infraslow frequencies under 0.1Hz, estimated MUA, etc.) and there are many ways of comparing it to the rsfMRI data that are not done in this study (rank correlation, transformation prior to comparison, clustering prior to comparison, etc.). The one non-linear method used, mutual information, is low sensitivity and does not cover every possible nonlinear interaction. Mutual information is also dependent upon the number of bins selected in the data. Previous studies (see 1) have seen similar results where fMRI and LFP were not fully commensurate but did not need to draw such broad conclusions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>First we would like to clarify that the existence of &quot;electrophysiologyinvisible signal&quot; is not necessarily a conclusion of the present study, per se, as described by the reviewer. As we stated in our manuscript, it is a proposed theoretical model. We fully acknowledge that this model represents just one potential explanation for the apparent discrepancy in temporal and spatial relationships between resting-state electrophysiology and BOLD signals. It is important to acknowledge that there may be other scenarios where a stronger temporal relationship between LFP and BOLD signals could manifest. This issue has been further clarified in the revised manuscript (see the section of Potential pitfalls).</p>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that not all factors that can be extracted from LFP are examined. In our current study we focused solely on band-limited LFP power as the primary feature in our analysis, given its prevalence in prior studies of LFP-rsfMRI correlates. More importantly, we demonstrate that band-specific LFP powers can yield spatial patterns nearly identical to those derived from rsfMRI signals, prompting a closer examination of the temporal relationship between these same features. Furthermore, since correlational analysis was used in studying the LFP-BOLD spatial relationship, we used the same analysis method when comparing their temporal relationship.</p>
<p>Extracting all possible features from the electrophysiology signal and examining their relationship with the rsfMRI signal or exploring all other types of ways of comparing LFP and rsfMRI signals goes beyond the scope of the current study. However, to address the reviewer’s concern, we tried a couple of analysis methods suggested by the reviewer, and results remain persistent. Figure S14 shows the results from (A) the rank correlation and (B) z transformation prior to comparison. We added these new results to the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 3: The writing refers to the spatial extent of correlation with the LFP signal as &quot;spatial variance.&quot; However, LFP was recorded from a very limited point and the variance in the correlation map does not necessarily reflect underlying electrophysiological spatial distributions (e.g. Yu et al. Nat Commun. 2023 Mar 24;14(1):1651.)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer accurately pointed out that in our paper, “spatial variance” refers to the spatial variance of BOLD correlates with the LFP signal. Our objective is to assess the extent to which this spatial variance, which is derived from the neural activity captured by LFP in the M1 or ACC, corresponds to the BOLD-derived spatial patterns from the same regions. We acknowledge that this spatial variance may differ from the spatial map obtained by multi-site electrophysiology recordings. Nevertheless, numerous studies have consistently reported a high spatial correspondence between BOLD- and electrophysiology-derived RSNs using various methodologies across different physiological states in both humans and animals. For instance, research employing electroencephalography (EEG) or electrocorticography (ECoG) in humans demonstrates that RSNs derived from the power of multiple-site electrophysiological signals exhibit similar spatial patterns to classic BOLD-derived RSNs such as the default-mode network (Hacker et al., 2017; Kucyi et al., 2018). These studies well agree with our findings. Notably, the reference paper cited by the reviewer studies brain-wide changes during transitions between awake and various sleep stages, which is quite different from the brain states examined in our study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Major method problem:</p>
<p>Comment 4: Correlating LFP to fMRI is correlating two biological signals, with unknown but presumably not uniform distributions. However, correlating CC results from correlation maps is comparing uniform distributions. This is not a fair comparison, especially considering that the noise added is also uniform as it was created with the rand() function in MATLAB.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a good point. We examined the distributions of both LFP powers and fMRI signals. They both seem to follow a normal distribution. Below shows distributions of the two signals from a random scan. In addition, z transformation prior to comparison generated the same results (Fig. S14).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Comment 1: In the Discussion, a few more calcium imaging papers could be fruitfully discussed (e.g. Ma et al Resting-state hemodynamics are spatiotemporally coupled to synchronized and symmetric neural activity in excitatory neurons, PNAS 2016, or more recently Vafaii et al, Multimodal measures of spontaneous brain activity reveal both common and divergent patterns of cortical functional organization, Nat Comms 2024).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this suggestion. We have added the following discussions to the revised manuscript:</p>
<p>“These findings indicate the temporal information provided by gamma power can only explain a minor portion (approximately 35%) of the temporal variance in the BOLD time series, even after accounting for the noise effect, which is in line with the reported correlation value between the cerebral blood volume and fluctuations in GCaMP signal in head-fixed mice during periods of immobility (R = 0.63) (Ma et al., 2016).”</p>
<p>“It is plausible that employing different features or comparison methods could yield a stronger BOLD-electrophysiology temporal relationship (Ma et al., 2016).”</p>
<p>“Furthermore, in a more recent study by Vafaii and colleagues, overlapping cortical networks were identified using both fMRI and calcium imaging modalities, suggesting that networks observable in fMRI studies exhibit corresponding neural activity spatial patterns (Vafaii et al., 2024).”</p>
<p>“Furthermore, Vafaii et. al. revealed notable differences in functional connectivity strength measured by fMRI and calcium imaging, despite an overlapping spatial pattern of cortical networks identified by both modalities (Vafaii et al., 2024).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 2: Similarly when discussing the &quot;invisible&quot; populations, perhaps Uhlirova et al eLife 2016 should be mentioned as some types of inhibitory processes may also be less clearly observed in LFPs but rather strongly contribute to NVC.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the suggestion. We added the following sentences to the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>“Additionally, Uhlirova et al. conducted a study where they utilized optogenetic stimulation and two-photon imaging to investigate how the activation of different neuron types affects blood vessels in mice. They discovered that only the activation of inhibitory neurons led to vessel constriction, albeit with a negligible impact on LFP (Uhlirova et al., 2016).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Major problems with writing:</p>
<p>Comment 1: The authors need to review past work to better place their study in the context of the literature (some review articles: Lurie et al. Netw Neurosci. 2020 Feb 1;4(1):30-69. &amp; Thompson et al. Neuroimage. 2018 Oct 15;180(Pt B):448-462.)</p>
<p>Here are some LFP and BOLD &quot;resting state&quot; papers focused on dynamic changes.</p>
<p>Many of these papers examine both spatial and temporal extents of correlations. Several of these papers use similar methods to the reviewed paper.</p>
<p>Also, many of these papers dispute the claim that correlations seen are</p>
<p>&quot;electrophysiology invisible signal.&quot; Note that I am NOT saying that &quot;electrophysiology invisible&quot; correlations do not exist (it seems very likely some DO exist). However, the authors did not show that in the reviewed paper, and some of the correlations which they call an &quot;electrophysiology invisible signal&quot; probably would be visible if analyzed in a different manner.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Quite a few literature studies that the reviewer suggested were already included in the original manuscript. We have also added more literature studies to the revised manuscript. Again, we would like to emphasize that the novelty of our study centers on the discovery of the disparity in temporal and spatial relationships between resting-state electrophysiological and fMRI signals. See below our responses to individual literature studies listed.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>The following discussion was added to the revised manuscript:</p>
<p>“Some other comparison methods such as rank correlation and transformation prior to comparison were also tested and results remain persistent (Fig. S14). These findings align with the notion that, compared to nonlinear models, linear models offer superior predictive value for the rsfMRI signal using LFP data, as comprehensively illustrated in (Nozari et al., 2024) (also see Fig. S7). Importantly, in this study, the predictive powers (represented by R2) of various comparison methods tested all remain below 0.5 (Nozari et al., 2024), suggesting that while certain models may enhance the temporal relationship between LFP and BOLD signals, the improvement is likely modest.”</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>]We also examined infraslow LFP activity (&lt; 1Hz) in our data. Consistent with the finding in the reference paper (Li et al., 2022), infraslow LFP power and the BOLD signal can derive consistent RSN spatial patterns (for M1, spatial correlation = 0.70), while the temporal correlation remains very low (temporal correlation = 0.08). These results and the reference paper were added to the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>In this study, researchers compared neurophysiological maps and fMRI maps of the inferior temporal cortex in macaques in response to visual images. They observed that the spatial correlation increased as the neurophysiological maps got greater levels of spatial smoothing. This suggests that fMRI can capture large-scale spatial information, but it may be limited in capturing fine details. Although interesting, this paper did not study the electrophysiology-fMRI relationship at the resting state and hence is not very relevant to our study.</p>

<p>This study examined the neural mechanism underpinning dynamic restingstate fMRI, revealing a spatiotemporal coupling of infra-slow neural activity with a quasiperiodic pattern (QPP).

<p>This paper identified phase-amplitude coupling in rats anesthetized with isoflurane but not with dexmedetomidine, indicating that this coupling arises from a special type of neural activity pattern, burst-suppression, which was probably induced by high-dose isoflurane. They conjectured that high and low-frequency neural activities may independently or differentially influence the BOLD signal. Our study also examined the influence of various LFP frequency bands on the BOLD signal and found inversed LFP-BOLD relationship between low- and high-frequency LFP powers. We also added more results on the analysis of infraslow LFP signals.

<p>Comment 5: &quot;MR-510 compatible electrodes (MRCM16LP, NeuroNexus Inc)&quot;</p>
<p>Details of this type of electrode are not readily available. But for studies like this one, further information on materials is critical as this determines the frequency coverage, which is not even across all LFP frequencies for all materials. Most commercially prepared electrodes cannot record &lt;1Hz accurately, and this study includes at least 0.11Hz in some of its analysis.</p>

<p>The type of electrode used in our current study is a silicon-based micromachined probe.
