<title>Abstract</title><p>SYNGAP1 haploinsufficiency-related intellectual disability (SYNGAP1-ID) is characterized by moderate to severe ID, generalized epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, sensory processing dysfunction and other behavioral abnormalities. While most studies, so far, have focussed on the role of Syngap1 in cortical excitatory neurons, recent studies suggest that Syngap1 plays a role in GABAergic inhibitory neuron development as well. However, the molecular pathways by which Syngap1 acts on GABAergic neurons, and whether they are similar or different from the mechanisms underlying its effects in excitatory neurons, is unknown. Here we examined whether, and how, embryonic-onset <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency restricted to GABAergic interneurons derived from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) impacts their synaptic and intrinsic properties in adulthood. We found that <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency affects the intrinsic properties, overall leading to increased firing threshold, and decreased excitatory synaptic drive of Parvalbumin (PV)+ neurons from Layer IV auditory cortex in adult mice, whilst Somatostatin (SST)+ interneurons were mostly resistant to <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency. Further, the AMPA component of thalamocortical evoked-EPSC was decreased in PV+ cells from mutant mice. Finally, we found that targeting the Kv1 family of voltage-gated potassium channels was sufficient to rescue PV+ mutant cell-intrinsic properties to wild-type levels. Together, these data suggest that <italic>Syngap1</italic> plays a specific role in the maturation of PV+ cell intrinsic properties and synaptic drive, and its haploinsufficiency may lead to reduced PV cell recruitment in the adult auditory cortex, which could thus underlie the auditory processing alterations found in SYNGAP1-ID preclinical models and patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In mammals, the ability of the brain to process, perceive and integrate sensory stimuli is an essential function. Among the sensory modalities, audition is crucial for communication and perception of threats, which involves detecting sudden changes in the acoustic environment and extracting relevant acoustic features from noise. For mice, auditory navigation and assessment is based on the auditory system’s capacity to detect, separate, and analyse spectro-temporal information from the acoustic environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">King et al., 2018</xref>). In the mammalian primary auditory cortex (A1), neurons are well tuned to specific sound frequency, intensity, or repetition rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kilgard and Merzenich, 1999</xref>, Schreiner et al., 2007). Interestingly, A1 neurons also exhibit adaptation, attenuating their responses to redundant, repetitive stimuli carrying non-relevant information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Ulanovsky et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Szymanski et al., 2009</xref>). Such auditory computations are carried out by cortical circuits composed of tightly coupled networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons.</p>
<p>GABAergic inhibitory neurons play a pivotal role in auditory circuits shaping cortical activity and modulating auditory information processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Wehr and Zador, 2003</xref>). Based on anatomical, physiological and specific marker expression, we can identify two major sub-classes of cortical inhibitory neurons, parvalbumin-(PV+) and somatostatin-(SST+) expressing interneurons, which provide perisomatic and distal dendritic inhibition to pyramidal cells (PCs), respectively (Reyes and Levy, 2012; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Yavorska and Wehr, 2016</xref>) in the auditory cortex. Due to the specificity in their synapse location and distinct functional properties, SST+ and PV+ neurons differentially shape excitatory neuronal responses. By providing fast inhibition onto postsynaptic PC cell somata and proximal dendrites, PV+ cells exert fine control on their output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Moore and Wehr, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>), while SST+ cells targeting apical dendrites of postsynaptic PCs exert specific control over dendritic synaptic integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chiu et al., 2013</xref>). In recent years, novel transgenic and optogenetic technologies have allowed for precise labeling and manipulation of these two major classes of GABAergic interneurons <italic>in vivo</italic> in order to address their specific role in auditory processing and sound perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Letzkus et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Pi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hamilton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Keller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ceballo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chai et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Nocon et al., 2023</xref>). Specifically, SST+ neurons have a dominant role in the integration of information across multiple auditory frequencies and respond relatively slowly to a narrower range of tones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lakunina et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Li et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, the role of PV+ cells in auditory processing is still controversial with some studies reporting PV+ cells activated by a broad set of tones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Cohen and Mizrahi 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Li et al., 2015</xref>) and others showing they are well-tuned for specific auditory frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Moore and Wehr 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aizenberg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Christensen et al., 2019</xref>). The variability in the recruitment of PV+ cells remains a caveat in optogenetic studies performed in the auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Seybold et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Phillips and Hasenstaub, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Keller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gothner et al., 2021</xref>) making data interpretation difficult. A possible explanation for the heterogeneity in PV+ cell recruitment could be the presence of discrete subtypes within PV+ expressing neurons, as suggested by recent single cell transcriptomics data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bakken et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Further, while GABAergic interneurons have been extensively studied in other cortical areas, there are relatively few reports on PV+ and SST+ cell-intrinsic and synaptic properties in adult auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Rock et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Henton et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Abnormalities in auditory sensory processing are common in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and are hypothesized to contribute to core ASD behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Gonçalves and Monteiro, 2023</xref>). However, the neurobiological basis of abnormal auditory processing and how it develops is still unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Sinclair et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we focus on an increasingly well-recognised candidate gene in neurodevelopmental disorders, <italic>Syngap1</italic>, haploinsufficiency of which causes intellectual disability (SYNGAP1-ID), epilepsy, and autistic features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hamdan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Berryer et al., 2013</xref>). Further, <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficient mouse models and SYNGAP1-ID patients show similar changes in auditory processing, including increased baseline and evoked gamma oscillatory activity and impaired habituation to repetitive stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Carreño-Muñoz et al., 2022</xref>). These specific alterations are recapitulated in a mouse model where <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency is restricted to neurons derived from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), which include cortical PV+ and SST+ interneurons (Jadhav et al, in preparation), which suggests that GABAergic cell-specific dysfunction has a role in sensory processing alterations observed in preclinical models and SYNGAP1-ID patients; however, the underlying neurobiological mechanisms remains to be elucidated.</p>
<p>The function of <italic>Syngap1</italic> has been mostly studied in excitatory neurons; in particular, <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency has been shown to increase AMPA receptor density and cause premature maturation of excitatory synapses formed by hippocampal and layer 5 pyramidal cells in the somatosensory cortex (Clement et al., 201, 2013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ozkan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aceti et al, 2015</xref>). Further, <italic>Syngap1</italic> can play a non-synaptic function linked to the control of cortical neurogenesis of projecting neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Birtele et al., 2023</xref>). Recent studies have implicated <italic>Syngap1</italic> in GABAergic cell migration and inhibitory synapse maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Berryer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Su et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Sullivan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Khlaifia et al., 2023</xref>); nevertheless, whether the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are similar to those observed in excitatory cells is unknown.</p>
<p>We generated conditional transgenic mice wherein <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency was restricted to MGE-derived interneurons. We then assessed the synaptic and intrinsic properties of PV+ fast spiking (FS) and SST+ regular spiking cells in layer IV of the adult auditory cortex. We performed whole-cell voltage clamp recording in combination with electrical stimulation of thalamic fibers and current clamp recording, to study synaptic and intrinsic properties, respectively. We found that both mutant PV+ and SST+ cells show decreased excitatory synaptic drive; however, PV+, but not SST+, interneurons showed significantly increased threshold for action potential generation, which points towards a reduced recruitment of cortical PV cells in the mutant mouse. Further, we rescued PV+ cell hypofunction ex vivo using alpha-dendrotoxin (α-DTX), a drug specifically targeting the Kv1 family of voltage-gated potassium channels, suggesting that Syngap1 can act by modulating distinct molecular factors in a cell-specific fashion. Altogether our results highlight the importance of dissecting cell type-specific changes caused by <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency.</p>

<title><italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency in MGE-derived interneurons is associated with network-dependent decrease of synaptic excitation and inhibition in PV+ cells</title>
<p>Since <italic>Syngap1</italic> has been shown to regulate AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission in hippocampal cortical excitatory neurons and hippocampal inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ozkan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arora et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Khlaifia et al., 2023</xref>), we first explored whether embryonic-onset <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency in MGE-derived interneurons affects glutamatergic synaptic inputs to Nkx2.1+ interneurons from adult layer IV (LIV) auditory cortex, using whole cell voltage clamp recordings of spontaneous (sEPSCs) and miniature excitatory postsynaptic potentials (mEPSCs) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1a–j</italic></xref><italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure supplement 1a-e</xref>,</italic> <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table"><italic>Table 1</italic></xref><italic>, <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref></italic></bold>). Nkx2.1-expressing MGE precursors generate most of PV+ and SST+ cortical interneurons (Xu et al., 2008). Recorded MGE-derived interneurons, identified by GFP expression, were filled with biocytin, followed by <italic>posthoc</italic> immunolabeling with anti-PV and anti-SST antibodies. PV+ and SST+ interneuron identity was confirmed using neurochemical marker (PV or SST) expression and anatomical properties (axonal arborisation location, presence of dendritic spines). We found that sEPSC amplitude, but not inter-event interval, was decreased in both LIV PV+ and SST+ neurons from Tg(<italic>Nkx2.1-Cre</italic>):<italic>RCE<sup>f/f</sup></italic>:<italic>Syngap1<sup>+/+</sup></italic>(control) and Tg(<italic>Nkx2.1-Cre</italic>):<italic>RCE<sup>f/f</sup></italic>:<italic>Syngap1<sup>f/+</sup></italic>(cHet) littermates (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1b</italic></xref><italic>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure supplement 1b</xref></italic></bold>). sEPSC rise and decay time constants for both PV+ and SST+ interneurons was not significantly different between the two genotypes (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1d</italic></xref><italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure supplement 1d</xref></italic></bold>), suggesting that postsynaptic AMPA receptor subunit composition was not affected by <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency. Finally, charge transfer (area under sEPSC) and the product of mean PSC charge transfer and event frequency were both significantly decreased in SST+, but not PV+ cells in cHet mice compared to controls (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1e</italic></xref><italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure supplement 1e</xref></italic></bold>). To discern whether <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency had a pre or postsynaptic action on the glutamatergic drive received by PV+ cells, we recorded mEPSC (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1f-j</italic></xref></bold>). We found no difference in mEPSC amplitude between the two genotypes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref>), indicating that the observed difference in sEPSC amplitude (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1b</italic></xref></bold>) could arise from decreased network excitability. Conversely, cHet mice showed a shift toward an increase in the inter-mEPSC time interval (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Fig. 1g</italic></xref></bold>). Consistent with this observation, we observed a significant decrease in the density of putative glutamatergic synapses onto PV+ cell somata, identified by the colocalization of the vesicular glutamate 1 (vGlut1, presynaptic marker) and PSD95 (postsynaptic marker), in cHet compared to control mice (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure supplement 2a, b</xref></italic></bold>). All together these data suggest that cHet PV+ cells have a reduced glutamatergic drive as compared to control PV+ cells.</p>

<p>Since PV+ cell recruitment is regulated by the balance of its excitatory and inhibitory inputs, we next analysed sIPSC and mIPSC from layer IV PV+ cells in both genotypes.

<title>Embryonic-onset <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency in MGE-derived interneurons attenuate thalamocortical evoked AMPA transmission in layer IV PV+ cells</title>
<p>In A1, layer IV PV+ cells receive intracortical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kratz and Manis, 2015</xref>) and stronger subcortical thalamocortical inputs compared to excitatory cells and other subpopulations of GABAergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ji et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Rock et al., 2018</xref>).

Minimally evoked AMPA amplitude, AUC charge transfer (average of all responses, successes + failures, <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3b,c</italic></xref></bold>) and potency (average of all successes only, <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3e</italic></xref></bold>) were decreased in cHet mice as compared to control littermates. In addition, we found a substantial increase in onset latencies of evoked AMPA currents (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3d</italic></xref></bold>), suggesting a potential deficit in the thalamocortical recruitment of PV+ cells. Next, we assessed evoked NMDA EPSCs in PV+ cells in presence of GABA<sub>A</sub>R, GABA<sub>B</sub> and AMPA inhibitors (1 μM Gabazine, 2 μM CGP, and 10 μm NBQX, respectively) (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3c,e</italic></xref></bold>). We found that evoked NMDA currents as well as the percentage of PV+ cells showing these responses were similar in cHet and control littermates (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3c,e</italic></xref></bold>), therefore leading to increased NMDA/AMPA in cHet mice (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3e</italic></xref></bold>). Interestingly, the kinetics of evoked AMPA and NMDA currents were similar in both genotypes, indicating no change in their subunit composition (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3f</italic></xref></bold>). These results suggest that embryonic-onset <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency in MGE-derived interneurons specifically impairs AMPA-mediated thalamocortical recruitment of PV+ cells. Of note, the density of putative thalamocortical glutamatergic synapses onto PV+ cell somata, identified by the colocalization of the vesicular glutamate 2 (vGlut2, thalamocortical presynaptic marker) and PSD95 (postsynaptic marker) was not significantly different in cHet as compared to littermate controls (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure Supplement 2c,d</xref></italic></bold>), suggesting that presynaptic release from putative single excitatory thalamocortical fiber or/and AMPARs expression at thalamocortical synapses on PV+ cells are likely decreased in cHet mice.</p>

<title>cHet mice show decreased layer IV PV+ cell-intrinsic excitability</title>
<p>PV+ cell recruitment in cortical circuits is dependent on both their synaptic drive and intrinsic excitability.

However, analysis of active membrane properties revealed a significant decrease in the excitability of mutant PV+ cells (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 5b,c</italic></xref></bold>). In particular, cHet PV+ cells showed reduced AP amplitude and increased AP threshold and latency to first AP (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 5b,c</italic></xref></bold>), while overall AP kinetics, including AP rise and decay time, fAHP time and AP half width were not affected (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 5b</italic></xref>, <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table"><italic>Table 5</italic></xref></bold>). In line with the decrease in intrinsic excitability, the rheobase (the smallest current injection that triggers an AP) was increased in PV+ cells from cHet mice (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 5d</italic></xref></bold>). In addition, both cHet and control PV+ cells displayed typical, sustained high-frequency trains of brief APs with little spike frequency adaptation in response to incremental current injections (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><italic>Fig. 5e</italic></xref><italic>, right</italic></bold>).

<title>Embryonic-onset <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency in MGE-derived interneurons differentially affects the dendritic arbor and intrinsic properties of two distinct PV+ cell subpopulations</title>
<p>The majority of PV+ cells are classified as fast-spiking (FS) cells, due to their ability to sustain high-frequency discharges of APs (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 5e</italic></xref><italic>, right</italic></bold>). However, clusters of atypical PV+ cells have been previously reported in several brain regions including subiculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Nassar et al., 2015</xref>), striatum (Bengtsson Gonzales et al., 2020), hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ekins et al., 2020</xref>) and somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Helm et al., 2013</xref>). Atypical PV+ cells share many electrophysiological parameters with FS cells; however, they have a slower half width and possess a lower maximal AP firing frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Nassar et al., 2015</xref>; Bengtsson Gonzales et al., 2018; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ekins et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Helm et al., 2013</xref>). Based on these 2 criteria, in our data we found a strong negative correlation between F<sub>max</sub>initial and AP half-width in both genotypes (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 6a</italic></xref><italic>, left</italic></bold>), indicating the possible existence of PV+ cell subgroups in both cHet and control mice. To verify whether auditory cortex PV+ cells from control mice could be functionally segregated into distinct clusters, we performed hierarchical clustering of AP half-width and F<sub>max</sub> values based on Euclidean distance (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 6a</italic></xref><italic>, right</italic></bold>). Hierarchical clustering builds a map (dendrogram) quantifying the similarity between samples (PV+ cell) and clusters of samples. Based on this analysis, we identified 2 clusters of PV+ cells, with short AP half-widths associated with higher values of F<sub>max</sub>. Despite hierarchical clustering defining 2 subgroups of PV+ cells, there were still few PV+ cells with longer AP half-widths showing F<sub>max</sub> values typical of shorter AP half-widths (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 6a</italic></xref><italic>, right</italic></bold>). We thus decided to perform PCA analysis using additional key intrinsic physiological features such as passive (V<sub>m</sub>, R<sub>in</sub>, C<sub>m</sub>) and active (rheobase, AP half-width, AP amplitude, first AP latency, AP threshold, fAHP amplitude, amplitude AR, frequency AR, F<sub>max</sub> and F<sub>ss</sub>) membrane properties (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 6b</italic></xref><italic>, left</italic></bold>). We then chose the intersection point of the 2 AP half-width distributions in control and cHet mice as a cutoff to define 2 different subpopulations of PV+ cells, which we termed Basket Cell (BC)-short (AP half-width &lt;0.78ms) and BC-broad (AP half-width ≥0.78ms) (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 6c,d</italic></xref></bold>).

In contrast, the dendritic arbor of BC-short neurons and BC-broad did not show significant differences in cHet mice (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 6h</italic></xref></bold>). Direct comparison of PV+ cell dendritic arbor in cHet vs control littermates clearly showed that BC-short neurons are specifically affected by <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 6i</italic></xref><italic>, j</italic></bold>), with cHet BC-short cells showing a significant increase in dendritic complexity compared to those from control mice (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 6i</italic></xref></bold>). Further, the strong positive correlation of dendritic surface area with AP half-width was present only in PV+ cells from control mice, but disappeared in cHet mice (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 6k</italic></xref></bold>). Altogether, these data indicate that embryonic-onset <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency in Nkx2.1+ interneurons alters the dendritic development of a specific PV+ cell subpopulation, which could in turn affect their intrinsic excitability and dendritic integration of synaptic inputs.</p>

<p>Based on the observed heterogeneity in morpho-electric parameters of PV+ cells, we next sought to investigate the effect of <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency on the intrinsic excitability of specific PV+ cell subtypes (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref><italic>, Tables 7.1, 7.2</italic></bold>). We found that BC-short cells showed preserved passive membrane properties (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>) and altered active membrane properties (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 7b-e</italic></xref></bold>) in cHet compared to control mice. In particular, we found increased AP threshold affecting AP amplitude (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 7b,c</italic></xref></bold>) and increased rheobase current (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 7d</italic></xref></bold>), indicating a decrease in the excitability of cHet BC-short cells. cHet BC-short interneurons displayed AP patterns similar to those in control BC-short (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 7e</italic></xref><italic>, right</italic></bold>), but fired less APs in response to somatic depolarization (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 7e</italic></xref><italic>, left</italic></bold>). In contrast, BC-broad neurons had a more hyperpolarized RMP (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 7f</italic></xref></bold>), and increased AP latency and threshold (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 7g,h</italic></xref></bold>) in cHet mice compared to controls. However, in cHet BC-broad neurons these changes were not translated into decreased ability to generate spikes (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 7i,j</italic></xref></bold>). Altogether these data suggest that BC-short neurons may be overall more vulnerable to <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency than BC-broad neurons. They further indicate that <italic>Syngap1</italic> levels appears to play a common role in determining the threshold for AP generation in all adult PV+ cells.</p>

<title>SST+ interneuron intrinsic and firing properties are less affected by <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency in MGE-derived interneurons as compared to PV+ cells</title>
<p>Next, we examined whether <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency in MGE-derived interneurons affects the other major group of Nkx2.1-expressing cortical interneurons, the SST+ interneurons (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 8 a-f</italic></xref>, <xref rid="tbl8" ref-type="table"><italic>Table 8</italic></xref></bold>).

<p>Thus, embryonic-onset <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency in MGE-derived interneurons substantially reduced the excitability of auditory cortex LIV PV+ and SST cells, with a major impact on the PV+ cell population as reflected in both single AP properties and AP firing pattern.</p>

<title>A selective Kv1-blocker rescues PV+ cell intrinsic excitability in cHet mice</title>
<p>Based on previous studies performed in PV+ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Wang et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Goldberg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zurita et al., 2018</xref>), changes in the Kv1 family of voltage-gated potassium channel could account for the observed altered intrinsic excitability observed in cHet mice. To test this hypothesis, we performed current clamp recordings from PV+ cells in control and cHet mice in presence or absence of α-DTX (100 nM), a specific blocker of channels containing Kv1.1, Kv1.2 or Kv1.6 (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 9a-e</italic></xref>, <xref rid="tbl9" ref-type="table"><italic>Table 9</italic></xref></bold>).

Further, α-DTX facilitated AP initiation in cHet PV+ cells by reducing AP delay from stimulation onset (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 9e</italic></xref></bold>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we dissected the circuit basis of abnormal cortical auditory function in embryonic-onset MGE-restricted <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficient mice. Our data demonstrated that in auditory cortex, PV+ cells are particularly vulnerable to <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency. In particular, mutant PV+ cells showed reduced intracortical and thalamo-cortical synaptic drive, contrary to <italic>Syngap1</italic>’s documented role in the formation and plasticity of glutamatergic synapses on excitatory cells. We further found that <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency alters PV+, but not SST+, cell intrinsic properties, overall leading to decreased intrinsic excitability affecting its input-output function. PV+ cell intrinsic excitability was rescued by pharmacological inhibition of Kv1 containing K+ channels, indicating their potential involvement as molecular mediators of functional deficits induced by <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency. <italic>Syngap1</italic> has been studied mainly in the context of synaptic physiology; therefore, our data highlights a novel aspect of <italic>Syngap1</italic> biology.</p>
<p><italic>Syngap1</italic> is thought to be a potent regulator of excitatory synapses and its reduced expression in excitatory cells causes an increase in AMPA receptor density and premature maturation of excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Rumbaugh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Clement et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">2013</xref>). Unexpectedly, here we found that the <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency in MGE-derived interneurons depresses AMPA-mediated synaptic transmission based on a potential presynaptic mechanism involving the reduction of glutamatergic boutons. Further, LIV PV+ cells receive the strongest thalamocortical input compared to excitatory cells and other subpopulation of GABAergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ji et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zurita et al., 2018</xref>). Our study showed that one of the sources of the deficit in glutamatergic drive arises from a decrease in the AMPA-mediated thalamocortical input reaching PV+ cells, suggesting a decrease in presynaptic release from putative single excitatory thalamocortical fiber and/or reduction in AMPARs expression at these synapses in cHet mice. Interestingly our data showed increased onset latencies of thalamocortical evoked AMPA together with enhanced NMDA/AMPA ratio, indicating a kinetically slower thalamic recruitment of PV+ cells. How could <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency in Nkx2.1-expressing cells affect the glutamatergic drive coming from local and thalamic excitatory cells? Here, we showed a novel role of <italic>Syngap1</italic> in promoting GABAergic cell intrinsic excitability, particularly in cortical PV+ interneurons. These findings are in line with recent data reporting a decrease in intrinsic excitability of developing cortical excitatory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arora et al., 2022</xref>), and highlight the emerging function of <italic>Syngap1</italic> in the somato-dendritic compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arora et al., 2022</xref>). Since in PV+ cells, connectivity and cell excitability are reciprocally regulated at the circuit level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Favuzzi et al., 2017</xref>), it is possible that early-onset <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency in MGE-derived interneurons may first affect the development of their intrinsic excitability properties, which in turn would modulate the maturation of their excitatory drive, and activity levels in adulthood. Alternatively, homeostatic adaptation of PV+ interneurons in response to the decreased number of excitatory inputs could trigger changes in Kv1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Dehorter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Favuzzi et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, <italic>Syngap1</italic> may play complex roles at the cellular level and at different developmental stages, based on the crosstalk between neuronal activity levels and Syngap1 localisation and interaction with other proteins.</p>
<p>Based on morphology and synaptic targets, 3 main subgroups of PV+ cells have been identified in auditory cortex, ie basket cells (BCs), chandelier cells and long-range projecting PV+ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Levy and Reyes, 2012</xref>, Roch et al., 2018; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zurita et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bertero et al., 2019</xref>). Despite differences in morphology and target selectivity, different PV+ cell subgroups share common electrophysiological features such as short AP-half width, low input resistance, very high rheobase, and relatively small AP amplitude. In particular, while clusters of atypical BC PV+ have been previously reported in several areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Helm et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Nassar et al., 2015</xref>; Bengtsson Gonzales et al., 2018; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ekins et al., 2020</xref>), auditory cortex PV+ BCs have been considered as a homogeneous electrophysiological group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Studer and Barkat, 2022</xref>). One of the main findings of this study is that mature primary auditory cortex contains at least 2 morphological and electrophysiological subgroups of PV+ BCs, including a subgroup with a surprising broader duration in AP half-width (<xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>). It is possible that the genetic tools used to identify PV+ cells (<italic>PV_Cre</italic> or G42 mice vs <italic>Nkx2.1</italic>_Cre mice) might enrich for a specific PV+ BC cell subtype. Alternatively, the proportion of different PV+ BCs might depend on the specific cortical region and layer. The presence of at least 2 different PV+ BC cell subtypes with different electrophysiological signatures may in part explain the previously reported variability in the recruitment of auditory cortex PV+ cells in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Seybold et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Phillips and Hasenstaub, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Keller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gothner et al., 2021</xref>), since differences might arise from the duration of AP half-width used to sort fast-spiking cells.</p>
<p>Despite the differences observed in how <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency affects the anatomy and physiological properties of the 2 PV+ cell subtypes, a shared deficit we observed was the decrease in intrinsic excitability, as suggested by the increased AP threshold affecting AP initiation. In PV+ cells, the Kv1 family of voltage-gated potassium channels are mainly responsible for AP generation, making them powerful targets to modify AP latency, threshold and rheobase current in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Wang et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Goldberg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zurita et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we rescued the excitability of mutant PV+ cells by pharmacologically inhibiting the Kv1 family of voltage gated potassium channels. Consistent with our findings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arora et al. (2022)</xref> rescued pyramidal cell intrinsic excitability and neuronal morphology via lowering elevated potassium channels, by expressing a dominant negative form of the Kv4.2 potassium channel subunit, dnKv4.2, in developing <italic>Syngap1</italic> mutant mice. Kv4.2 and Kv1 potassium channels modulate the intrinsic excitability of pyramidal cell and PV+ interneurons, respectively, indicating that the action of <italic>Syngap1</italic> on potassium channels may be a general mechanism.</p>
<p>A recent study focusing on the PSD interactomes of Syngap1 isolated from adult homogenized mouse cortex suggested a physical interaction between Syngap1 and the potassium channel auxiliary subunit Kvβ2 (Wilkinson and Coba, 2017). Since Kvβ2 regulates the translocation of Kv1 channels in dopaminergic neurons and potentially PV+ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Okaty et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yee et al., 2022</xref>), it is possible that <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency may lead to dysregulated Kv1 translocation at the membrane, leading to excessive K currents. Of note, both Kv1 channels and Syngap1 are developmentally regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Okaty et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gamache et al., 2020</xref>), thus <italic>Syngap1</italic> hypofunction may lead to dysregulation of genes encoding voltage-gated potassium channel affecting cell maturation and excitability.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in cHet SST+ cells, we did not observe deficits in intrinsic excitability, but we found a reduction in number of APs generated at different somatic current injection. The fact that we observed differences in spiking activity in absence of intrinsic excitability alterations, could be due to the heterogeneity of SST+ interneurons likely present in our dataset (Scala et al., 2019; Hostetler et al., 2023). Recent studies showed that SYNGAP1 interacts with Kv4 (Wilkinson and Coba, 2017). Further, <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency leads to increased Kv4 function in pyramidal cells in somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arora et al. 2022</xref>). Since somato-dendritic Kv4 channels in SST+ interneurons contribute to the regulation of their firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Serôdio and Rudy, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bourdeau et al., 2007</xref>), <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency might affect SST+ cell excitability via this channel.</p>
<p>PV+ cells have a fundamental role in generating and maintaining gamma oscillations in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cardin et al., 2009</xref>). In particular, recent studies have also shown that deficiency in PV interneuron-mediated inhibition contribute to increased baseline cortical gamma rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Spencer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Carlén et al., 2012</xref>), a phenotype we observed in the auditory cortex of both mutant mice and SYNGAP1-ID patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Carreño-Muñoz et al., 2022</xref>). Specifically, PV+ interneurons, which target the perisomatic domain of pyramidal neurons, are adapted for fast synchronization of network activity controlling spike timing of the excitatory network in auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Wehr and Zador, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Li et al. 2014</xref>). To sharpen the tuning of neighboring pyramidal cells, PV+ interneurons need to be more effectively recruited by excitatory inputs so that they can restrict the temporal summation of excitatory responses of their pyramidal cell targets and increase the temporal precision of their firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Povysheva et al., 2006</xref>). Our study suggests that decrease in AMPA-mediated thalamocortical input reaching PV+ cells along with deficits in their intrinsic excitability could account for altered spike timing of pyramidal cells causing an increase in overall network excitability. In our studies, we used a conditional mouse model where <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency is restricted to specific cell types, namely MGE-derived interneurons. Since cell-type specific genetic mutations do not typically occur in humans, it would be interesting to investigate whether <italic>SYNGAP1</italic>-haploinsufficient human-derived neurons show alterations in specific GABAergic subpopulations-intrinsic and synaptic properties.</p>

<p>All procedures and experiments were done in accordance with the Comité Institutionnel de Bonnes Pratiques Animales en Recherche (CIBPAR) of the CHU Ste-Justine Research Center in line with the principles published in the Canadian Council on Animal’s Care’s. Mice were housed (2-5 per cage), maintained in a 12/12 h light/dark cycle, and given ad libitum access to food and water. Experiments were performed in 9-13 weeks-old male mice during the light phase. To investigate the effects of Syngap1 haploinsufficiency in cortical PV+ and SST+ interneurons, we generated mice heterozygous for the Syngap1 conditional allele (<italic>Syngap1<sup>f/f</sup></italic>; Jackson Laboratories; #029303) under the Tg(<italic>Nkx2.1-Cre</italic>) driver line (Jackson Laboratories; #008661) and further crossed them with mice carrying the RCE allele (Jackson Laboratories; #032037) to generate Tg(<italic>Nkx2.1-Cre</italic>):<italic>RCE<sup>f/f</sup>:Syngap1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and Tg(<italic>Nkx2.1-Cre</italic>):<italic>RCE<sup>f/f</sup>:Syngap1<sup>f/+</sup></italic>mice, for targeted recordings.

<title>Acute slice preparation</title>
<p>Briefly, animals were anaesthetized deeply with ketamine–xylazine (ketamine: 100 mg/kg, xylazine: 10 mg/kg), transcardially perfused with 25 mL of ice-cold cutting solution (containing the following in mM: 250 sucrose, 2 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 7 MgSO4, 0.5 CaCl2, and 10 glucose, pH 7.4, 330–340 mOsm/L) and decapitated. The brain was then dissected carefully and transferred rapidly into an ice-cold (0–4 °C) cutting solution. Auditory thalamocortical slices (thickness, 350 μm) containing A1 and the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN) were prepared. For A1 slices, the cutting angle was 15 degrees from the horizontal plane (lateral raised; Cruikshank et al., 2002; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Zhao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Meng et al., 2017</xref>). Auditory thalamocortical slices were cut in the previously mentioned ice-cold solution using a vibratome (VT1000S; Leica Microsystems or Microm; Fisher Scientific) and transferred to a heated (37.5 °C) oxygenated recovery solution containing the following (in mM): 124 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 3 MgSO4, 1 CaCl2, and 10 glucose; pH 7.4; 300 mOsm/L, and allowed to recover for 45 min. Subsequently, during experiments, slices were continuously perfused (2 mL/min) with standard artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing the following (in mM): 124 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 2 MgSO4, 2CaCl2, and 10 glucose, pH 7.4 saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at near physiological temperature (30–33°C).</p>

<title>Whole-cell patch clamp recording</title>
<p>PV+ and SST+ neurons located in layer IV of A1 cortex were visually identified as eGFP-expressing somata under an epifluorescence microscope with blue light (filter set: 450–490 nm). All electrophysiological recordings were carried out using a 40x water-immersion objective. Recording pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (World Precision Instruments) with a PP-83 two-stage puller (Narishige) to a resistance range of 5–7 MΩ when backfilled with intracellular solution. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from PV+ and SST+ interneurons were performed in voltage or current-clamp mode. For voltage-clamp recording, we used an intracellular Cs+-based solution containing (in mM): 130 CsMeSO4, 5 CsCl, 2 MgCl2, 10 phosphocreatine, 10 HEPES, 0.5 EGTA, 4 ATP-TRIS, 0.4 GTP-TRIS, 0.3% biocytin, 2 QX-314 (pH 7.2–7.3; 280–290 mOsm/L). These recordings were performed to analyze the excitatory drive received by PV+ and SST+ cells. Series resistance in voltage-clamp were monitored throughout the experiment and cells that had substantial changes in series resistance (&gt;15%) during recording were discarded. Recordings of spontaneous and miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSC, mEPSCs) were performed in voltage-clamp at –70 mV in the presence of gabazine (1μM; Tocris Bioscience) and CGP55845 (2μM; Abcam Biochemicals) for sEPSCs and with addition of tetrodotoxin for mEPSCs (TTX; 1μM; Alomone Labs). Recordings of spontaneous and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSC, mIPSCs) were performed in voltage-clamp at +10mV in the presence of NBQX (10μM; Abcam Biochemicals) and DL-AP5 (100μM; Abcam Biochemicals) for sISPCs and with addition of TTX (1μM) for mIPSCs. For recordings of thalamocortical electrically evoked AMPA/NMDA EPSC in layer IV PV+ cells, current pulses were delivered to the thalamic radiation (TR) via a tungsten concentric bipolar microelectrode placed in the white matter midway between the MGN and the AI (rostral to the hippocampus). Evoked AMPA (eAMPA) currents were recorded at -70 mV in presence of CGP (2μM) and gabazine (1μM), while evoked NMDA (eNMDA) currents were recorded at +40 mV in presence of NBQX (10µM) and confirmed after with the application of DL-AP5 (100µM).</p>
<p>Current-clamp recordings were obtained in ACSF containing synaptic blockers gabazine (1μM), CGP55845 (2μM) and kynurenic acid (2mM). For these recordings, we used an intracellular K+-based solution containing (in mM): 130 KMeSO4, 2 MgCl2, 10 di-Na-phosphocreatine, 10 HEPES, 4 ATP-Tris, 0.4 GTP-Tris, and 0.3% biocytin (Sigma), pH 7.2–7.3, 280–290 mOsm/L. Passive and active membrane properties were analyzed in current clamp mode: active membrane properties were recorded by subjecting cells to multiple current step injections (step size 40 pA) of varying amplitudes (–200 to 600 pA). In subsequent experiments, the same protocol was repeated in presence of the voltage gated potassium channel (Kv) blocker α-DTX (100nM; Alomone labs). In these experiments, slices were recovered in a holding chamber for at least 1 hr in presence of α-DTX. Once placed in recording chamber slices were kept for recording for max 1 hr. Passive membrane properties, resting membrane potential (Vm), input resistance (Rin), and membrane capacitance (Cm) were obtained immediately after membrane rupture. Membrane potentials were maintained at –80 mV, series resistances (10–18 MΩ) and Rin were monitored on-line with a 40 pA current injection (150ms) given before each 500ms current injection stimulus. Only cells with resting membrane potential more negative than -60mV at the start of recording and spikes with overshoot were considered for further analysis. Data acquisition (filtered at 2–3 kHz and digitized at 10kHz; Digidata 1440, Molecular Devices, CA, United States) was performed using the Multiclamp 700B amplifier and the Clampex 10.6 software (Molecular Devices).</p>

<title>Electrophysiological data analysis</title>
<p>All analysis was performed by researchers blinds to the genotype. Analysis of electrophysiological recordings was performed using Clampfit 10.7 (Molecular Devices). For the analysis of sEPSCs, mEPSCs, sIPSCs and mIPSCs a minimum of 100 events were sampled per cell over a 2min period using an automated template search algorithm in Clampfit. The 20–80% rise time of the response and the decay time constant determined from the exponential fit (100–37%) were calculated. Charge transfer was calculated by integrating the area under the EPSC and IPSC waveforms. The mean PSC synaptic current was calculated as the charge transfer of the averaged PSC (ΔQ) multiplied by mean PSC frequency. For thalamocortical eAMPA and eNMDA, the mean amplitude of EPSCs including both failure and success was obtained from a total of 5 to 10 sweeps. Onset latency indicated the time from beginning of stimulus artifact and the onset of eAMPA or eNMDA. To measure eNMDA/eAMPA ratios, the eAMPA component was taken at the peak of EPSC at −70 mV, whereas the eNMDA component was measured at the peak of EPSC at +40 mV.</p>
<p>For the analysis of current-clamp recordings from PV cells, rheobase was measured as the minimal current necessary to evoke an action potential (AP). For the analysis of the AP properties, the first AP appearing within a 50ms time window from beginning of current pulse was analyzed. AP latency was measured as the time between current step onset and when membrane voltage reached AP threshold. The AP amplitude was measured from the AP threshold to the peak. The AP half-width was measured at the voltage level of the half of AP amplitude. The AP rise and fall time were measured between the AP threshold and the maximal AP amplitude, and between the maximal AP amplitude and the AP end, respectively. The fast afterhyperpolarization (fAHP) amplitude was determined as the minimum voltage following the AP peak subtracted from the AP threshold. fAHP time was determined as the time between AP threshold and the negative peak of fAHP. The hyperpolarization-activated cation current (I<sub>h</sub>)-associated voltage rectification (I<sub>h</sub> sag) was determined as the amplitude of the membrane potential sag from the peak hyperpolarized level to the level at the end of the hyperpolarizing step when the cell was hyperpolarized to –100mV. Membrane time constant (τ) was calculated by the product of R<sub>in</sub> and C<sub>m</sub>. For the firing analysis, we considered only APs with amplitude &gt;30 mV as full APs. Spikelets with amplitude smaller than 30mV were not analyzed in this study. The inter-spike interval (ISI) was determined by the time difference between adjacent AP peaks. Spike amplitude accommodation ratio (AAR) was calculated by dividing the amplitude of the last AP by the amplitude of the first generated in response to 2x rheobase current injection. Firing frequency adaptation ratios (FFAR) were calculated by dividing the last ISI with the first one of the responses to 2x rheobase current injection. The maximal (initial) firing frequency (F<sub>max</sub>) was computed as the reciprocal of the average of the first 2 ISIs in a spike train elicited by the current step (max +600pA) applied before a noticeable appearance of spikelets. The steady-state firing frequency (F<sub>ss</sub>) was computed as the reciprocal of the average of the last 4 ISIs in the spike train were Fmax was obtained. Finally, the # APs-current relationship for evoked firing was determined by injecting 500-ms somatic current steps of increasing amplitude (40pA increments) to a maximum of 600pA. For current-clamp recordings in presence of α-DTX experiments the delta (Δ) values were calculated for rheobase, AP threshold and AP number at +200pA, by subtracting individual values of α-DTX-treated cells from the average of their respective control group.</p>

<title>Hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis (PCA)</title>
<p>This analysis was based on previous published data finding heterogeneity in PV+ interneurons population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Helm et al., 2013</xref>), and performed using the software IBM SPSS V29.0.0. Hierarchical clustering was based on Euclidean distance of PV+ cells from control mice. To identify potential clusters, we used AP-Half width and Max frequency values. We then performed multidimensional cluster analysis on passive and active membrane properties to identify possible common groupings of PV+ interneurons using the software Prism 9.0 (GraphPad Software). In our database, we focused on 13 parameters (see <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 6b</italic></xref></bold>) that were for the majority unrelated. <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref></bold> is a cross-correlation matrix of these 13 parameters with correlation indices shade coded, with black being perfectly correlated (correlation index of 1.0) and white being perfectly uncorrelated (correlation index of 0). We therefore performed PCA on the 13 parameters to reduce the dimensionality and to potentiate clusters separation.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry, cell reconstruction and anatomical identification</title>
<p>For post-hoc anatomical identification, every recorded neuron was filled with biocytin (0.5%, Sigma) during whole-cell recordings (15 min). To reveal biocytin, the slices were permeabilized with 0.3% triton X-100 and incubated at 4 °C with a streptavidin-conjugated Alexa-488 (1:1000) in TBS. For PV and SST immunofluorescence, sections were permeabilized with 0.25.1–0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS and incubated in blocking solution containing 120% normal goat serum (NGS) for 1 h. Then, sections were incubated with the following primary antibodies diluted in 1% NGS, 0.25% Triton-X 100 in PBS: were incubated with primary antibodies mouse anti-PV (1:1000, Swant, Cat# 235) and rabbit anti-SST (1:500, Thermofisher Invitrogen, Cat# PA5-82678) at 4°C for 48-72 h. , Sections were then washed in PBS (3X-10 mins each), incubated for 2 hrs at RT with the following secondary antibodies diluted in 1% NGS, 0.25% Triton-X 100 in PBS and mounted on microscope slides: streptavidin conjugated Alexa 488 followed by incubation with conjugated secondary antibodies for 4h at RT, rinsed, and mounted on microscope slides. The secondary antibodies used were Alexa-Fluor conjugated 488 (1:1000, Invitrogen, Cat# S11223), Alexa 555-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:500; Life technologies, A21430) and Alexa 555 (1:500) and 647-conjugated goat anti-mouse (1:250, Cell signaling, 4410S). Z-stacks of biocytin-filled cells were acquired with a 1μm step using a 20x objective (NA 0.75) on the Leica SP8-DLS confocal microscope. Confocal stacks were merged for detailed reconstruction in Neuromantic tracing software version 1.7.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Myatt et al., 2012</xref>). Dendritic arbors were reconstructed plane-by-plane from the image z-stack and analyzed using the Neuromantic software. Sholl analysis of reconstructed dendritic arbors was performed in FIJI software using the plugin Neuroanatomy. This analysis was performed in radial coordinates, using a 10μm step size from r=0, with the origin centered on the cell soma, and counting the number of compartments crossing a given radius.

<p>P60 mice were anesthetized with: Ketamine-100mg/kg+Xylazine-10mg/kg+Acepromazine-10mg/kg and perfused transcardially with 0.9% saline followed by 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate buffer (0.1M PB, pH 7.2-7.4). Brains were dissected out and post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4°C. They were subsequently transferred to 30% sucrose (prepared in PBS, pH 7.2) at 4°C for 48 hrs. Brains were then embedded in molds filled with OCT Tissue Tek and frozen in a bath of 2-methybutane placed on a bed of dry ice and ethanol. Coronal sections were cut at 40μm with a cryostat (Leica CM3050 S) and collected as floating sections in PBS. Brain sections were first permeabilized in 0.2 % Triton-X in PBS for 1 hr at RT and then blocked in 10% normal donkey serum (NDS) with 0.2% Triton-X 100 and 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 2 hrs at RT followed by incubation at 4°C for 48 hrs with the following primary antibodies diluted in 5% NDS, 0.2% Triton-X 100 and 2 % BSA in PBS: goat anti-PV (1:1000, Swant, Cat# PVG-213), rabbit anti-VGlut1 (1:100 Thermo Fisher/ Invitrogen, Cat# 48-2400), rabbit anti-VGlut2 1:1000, Synaptic systems, Cat# 135402 ) mouse anti-PSD95 (1:500, Invitrogen, Cat# MA1-05).

<p>Confocal Imaging and quantification: Immunostained sections were imaged using a Leica SP8-STED confocal microscope, with a 63x (NA 1.4) at 1024 X 1024, zoom=1, z-step =0.3 μm, stack size of ∼15 μm. Images were acquired from the auditory cortex from at least 3 coronal sections per animal. Acquisition and analysis of images were done by an experimenter blind to the genotype. Perisomatic puncta density was analysed using Image J-Fiji. At least 5 cells were chosen from each slice and puncta was quantified by drawing an ROI around each PV-positive cell soma. All images were post-processed for analysis using an appropriate filter, thresholded, and puncta was counted using the Analyze particles macro in ImageJ/Fiji. All analysis was performed by researchers blinds to the genotype. No mouse was excluded from this analysis.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>Data were expressed as mean±SEM. For statistical analysis, we based our conclusion on the statistical results generated by linear mixed model (LMM), modelling animal as a random effect and genotype as fixed effect. We used this statistical analysis because we considered the number of mice as independent replicates and the number of cells in each mouse as repeated measures. For comparison with LMM analysis, we also tested the data for normality with a Shapiro–Wilcoxon test, then if data were normally distributed, standard parametric statistics were used (unpaired t-test), while if data were not normally distributed, non-parametric Mann–Whitney test was used for comparisons of two groups. The two statistical analyses were always performed for all the data of the study and indicated in the tables related to each figure. Two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparison post hoc test was used for the detection of differences in AP firing and number of dendritic intersections between genotypes. Statistical analysis was performed using Sigma Plot 11.0, Prism 9.0 (GraphPad Software) and IBM SPSS V29.0.0 for LMM analysis.</p>

<p>The study is designed to assess the role of Syngap1 in regulating the physiology of the MGE-derived PV+ and SST+ interneurons. Syngap1 is associated with some mental health disorders, and PV+ and SST+ cells are the focus of many previous and likely future reports from studies of interneuron biology, highlighting the translational and basic neuroscience relevance of the authors' work.</p>
<p>Strengths of the study are using well-established electrophysiology methods and the highly controlled conditions of ex vivo brain slice experiments combined with a novel intersectional mouse line, to assess the role of Syngap1 in regulating PV+ and SST+ cell properties. The findings revealed that in the mature auditory cortex, Syngap1 haploinsufficiency decreases both the intrinsic excitability and the excitatory synaptic drive onto PV+ neurons from Layer 4. In contrast, SST+ interneurons were mostly unaffected by Syngap1 haploinsufficiency. Pharmacologically manipulating the activity of voltage-gated potassium channels of the Kv1 family suggested that these channels contributed to the decreased PV+ neuron excitability by Syngap insufficiency. These results therefore suggest that normal Syngap1 expression levels are necessary to produce normal PV+ cell intrinsic properties and excitatory synaptic drive, albeit, perhaps surprisingly, inhibitory synaptic transmission was not affected by Syngap1 haploinsufficiency.</p>
<p>Since the electrophysiology experiments were performed in the adult auditory cortex, while Syngap1 expression was potentially affected since embryonic stages in the MGE, future studies should address two important points that were not tackled in the present study. First, what is the developmental time window in which Syngap1 insufficiency disrupted PV+ neuron properties? Albeit the embryonic Syngap1 deletion most likely affected PV+ neuron maturation, the properties of Syngap-insufficient PV+ neurons do not resemble those of immature PV+ neurons. Second, whereas the observation that Syngap1 haploinsufficiency affected PV+ neurons in auditory cortex layer 4 suggests auditory processing alterations, MGE-derived PV+ neurons populate every cortical area. Therefore, without information on whether Syngap1 expression levels are cortical area-specific, the data in this study would predict that by regulating PV+ neuron electrophysiology, Syngap1 normally controls circuit function in a wide range of cortical areas, and therefore a range of sensory, motor and cognitive functions. These are relatively minor weaknesses regarding interpretation of the data in the present study that the authors could discuss.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors investigated how partial loss of SynGap1 affects inhibitory neurons derived from the MGE in the auditory cortex, focusing on their synaptic inputs and excitability. While haplo-insufficiently of SynGap1 is known to lead to intellectual disabilities, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The questions are novel</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Despite the interesting and novel questions, there are significant concerns regarding the experimental design and data quality, as well as potential misinterpretations of key findings. Consequently, the current manuscript fails to contribute substantially to our understanding of SynGap1 loss mechanisms and may even provoke unnecessary controversies.</p>
<p>Major issues:</p>
<p>(1) One major concern is the inconsistency and confusion in the intermediate conclusions drawn from the results. For instance, while the sEPSC data indicates decreased amplitude in PV+ and SOM+ cells in cHet animals, the frequency of events remains unchanged. In contrast, the mEPSC data shows no change in amplitudes in PV+ cells, but a significant decrease in event frequency. The authors conclude that the former observation implies decreased excitability. However, traditionally, such observations on mEPSC parameters are considered indicative of presynaptic mechanisms rather than changes of network activity.‎ The subsequent synapse counting experiments align more closely with the traditional conclusions. This issue can be resolved by rephrasing the text. However, it would remain unexplained why the sEPSC frequency shows no significant difference. If the majority of sEPSC events were indeed mediated by spiking (which is blocked by TTX), the average amplitudes and frequency of mEPSCs should be substantially lower than those of sEPSCs. Yet, they fall within a very similar range, suggesting that most sEPSCs may actually be independent of action potentials. But if that was indeed the case, the changes of purported sEPSC and mEPSC results should have been similar.</p>
<p>(2) Another significant concern is the quality of synapse counting experiments. The authors attempted to colocalize pre- and postsynaptic markers Vglut1 and PSD95 with PV labelling. However, several issues arise. Firstly, the PV labelling seems confined to soma regions, with no visible dendrites. Given that the perisomatic region only receives a minor fraction of excitatory synapses, this labeling might not accurately represent the input coverage of PV cells.</p>
<p>
Secondly, the resolution of the images is insufficient to support clear colocalization of the synaptic markers. Thirdly, the staining patterns are peculiar, with PSD95 puncta appearing within regions clearly identified as somas by Vglut1, hinting at possible intracellular signals. Furthermore, PSD95 seems to delineate potential apical dendrites of pyramidal cells passing through the region, yet Vglut1+ partners are absent in these segments, which are expected to be the marker of these synapses here.</p>
<p>
Additionally, the cumulative density of Vglut2 and Vglut1 puncta exceeds expectations, and it's surprising that subcortical fibers labeled by Vglut2 are comparable in number to intracortical Vglut1+ axon terminals. Ideally, N(Vglut1)+N(Vglut2) should be equal or less than N(PSD95), but this is not the case here. Consequently, these results cannot be considered reliable due to these issues.</p>
<p>(3) One observation from the minimal stimulation experiment was concluded by an unsupported statement. Namely, the change in the onset delay cannot be attributed to a deficit in the recruitment of PV+ cells, but it may suggest a change in the excitability of TC axons.</p>
<p>(‎4) The conclusions drawn from the stimulation experiments are also disconnected from the actual data. To make conclusions about TC release, the authors should have tested release probability using established methods, such as paired-pulse changes. Instead, the only observation here is a change in the AMPA components, which remained unexplained.</p>
<p>(5) The sampling rate of CC recordings is insufficient ‎to resolve the temporal properties of the APs. Therefore, the phase-plots cannot be interpreted (e.g. axonal and somatic AP components are not clearly separated), raising questions about how AP threshold and peak were measured. The low sampling rate also masks the real derivative of the AP signals, making them apparently faster.</p>
<p>
A related issue is that the Methods section lacks essential details about the recording conditions, such as bridge balance and capacitance neutralization.</p>
<p>(6) Interpretation issue: One of the most fundamental measures of cellular excitability, the rheobase, was differentially affected by cHet in BCshort and BCbroad. Yet, the authors concluded that the cHet-induced changes in the two subpopulations are common.</p>
<p>(7) Design issue:</p>
<p>
The Kv1 blockade experiments are disconnected from the main manuscript. There is no experiment that shows the causal relationship between changes in DTX and cHet cells. It is only an interesting observation on AP halfwidth and threshold. However, how they affect rheobase, EPSCs, and other topics of the manuscript are not addressed in DTX experiments.</p>
<p>
Furthermore, Kv1 currents were never measured in this work, nor was the channel density tested. Thus, the DTX effects are not necessarily related to changes in PV cells, which can potentially generate controversies.</p>
<p>(8) Writing issues:</p>
<p>
Abstract:</p>
<p>
The auditory system is not mentioned in the abstract.</p>
<p>
One statement in the abstract is unclear‎. What is meant by &quot;targeting Kv1 family of voltage-gated potassium channels was sufficient...&quot;? &quot;Targeting&quot; could refer to altered subcellular targeting of the channels, simple overexpression/deletion in the target cell population, or targeted mutation of the channel, etc. Only the final part of the Results revealed that none of the above, but these channels were blocked selectively.</p>
<p>
Introduction:</p>
<p>
There is a contradiction in the introduction. The second paragraph describes in detail the distinct contribution of PV and SST n‎eurons to auditory processing. But at the end, the authors state that &quot;relatively few reports on PV+ and SST+ cell-intrinsic and synaptic properties in adult auditory cortex&quot;. Please be more specific about the unknown properties.</p>
<p>(9) The introduction emphasizes the heterogeneity of PV neurons, which certainly influences the interpretation of the results of the current manuscript. However, the initial experiments did not consider this and handled all PV cell data as a pooled population.</p>
<p>(10) The interpretation of the results strongly depends on unpublished work, which potentially provide the physiological and behavioral contexts about the role of GABAergic neurons in SynGap-haploinsufficiency. The authors cite their own unpublished work, without explaining the specific findings and relation to this manuscript.</p>
<p>(11) The introduction of Scholl analysis ‎experiments mentions SOM staining, however, there is no such data about this cell type in the manuscript.</p>

<p>This paper compares the synaptic and membrane properties of two main subtypes of interneurons (PV+, SST+) in the auditory cortex of control mice vs mutants with Syngap1 haploinsufficiency. The authors find differences at both levels, although predominantly in PV+ cells. These results suggest that altered PV-interneuron functions in the auditory cortex may contribute to the network dysfunction observed in Syngap1 haploinsufficiency-related intellectual disability. The subject of the work is interesting, and most of the approach is direct and quantitative, which are major strengths. There are also some weaknesses that reduce its impact for a broader field.</p>
<p>(1) The choice of mice with conditional (rather than global) haploinsufficiency makes the link between the findings and Syngap1 relatively easy to interpret, which is a strength. However, it also remains unclear whether an entire network with the same mutation at a global level (affecting also excitatory neurons) would react similarly.</p>
<p>(2) There are some (apparent?) inconsistencies between the text and the figures. Although the authors appear to have used a sophisticated statistical analysis, some datasets in the illustrations do not seem to match the statistical results. For example, neither Fig 1g nor Fig 3f (eNMDA) reach significance despite large differences. Also, the legend to Fig 9 indicates the presence of &quot;a significant decrease in AP half-width from cHet in absence or presence of a-DTX&quot;, but the bar graph does not seem to show that.</p>
<p>(3) The authors mention that the lack of differences in synaptic current kinetics is evidence against a change in subunit composition. However, in some Figures, for example, 3a, the kinetics of the recorded currents appear dramatically different. It would be important to know and compare the values of the series resistance between control and mutant animals.</p>
<p>(4) A significant unexplained variability is present in several datasets. For example, the AP threshold for PV+ includes points between -50-40 mV, but also values at around -20/-15 mV, which seems too depolarized to generate healthy APs (Fig 5c, Fig7c).</p>
<p>(5) I am unclear as to how the authors quantified colocalization between VGluts and PSD95 at the low magnification shown in Supplementary Figure 2.</p>
<p>(6) The authors claim that &quot;cHet SST+ cells showed no significant changes in active and passive membrane properties&quot;, but this claim would seem to be directly refused by the data of Fig 8f. In the absence of changes in either active or passive membrane properties shouldn't the current/#AP plot remain unchanged?</p>
<p>(7) The plots used for the determination of AP threshold (Figs 5c, 7c, and 7h) suggest that the frequency of acquisition of current-clamp signals may not have been sufficient, this value is not included in the Methods section.</p>

<p>We agree with the reviewer on the proposed open questions, which we will certainly discuss in the revised manuscript we are preparing. We do have experimental evidence suggesting that Syngap1 mRNA is expressed by PV+ and SST+ neurons in different cortical areas, during early postnatal development and in adulthood; therefore, we agree that it will be important, in future experiments, to tackle the question of when the observed phenotypes arise.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors investigated how partial loss of SynGap1 affects inhibitory neurons derived from the MGE in the auditory cortex, focusing on their synaptic inputs and excitability. While haplo-insufficiently of SynGap1 is known to lead to intellectual disabilities, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The questions are novel</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Despite the interesting and novel questions, there are significant concerns regarding the experimental design and data quality, as well as potential misinterpretations of key findings. Consequently, the current manuscript fails to contribute substantially to our understanding of SynGap1 loss mechanisms and may even provoke unnecessary controversies.</p>
<p>Major issues:</p>
<p>(1) One major concern is the inconsistency and confusion in the intermediate conclusions drawn from the results. For instance, while the sEPSC data indicates decreased amplitude in PV+ and SOM+ cells in cHet animals, the frequency of events remains unchanged. In contrast, the mEPSC data shows no change in amplitudes in PV+ cells, but a significant decrease in event frequency. The authors conclude that the former observation implies decreased excitability. However, traditionally, such observations on mEPSC parameters are considered indicative of presynaptic mechanisms rather than changes of network activity.‎ The subsequent synapse counting experiments align more closely with the traditional conclusions. This issue can be resolved by rephrasing the text. However, it would remain unexplained why the sEPSC frequency shows no significant difference. If the majority of sEPSC events were indeed mediated by spiking (which is blocked by TTX), the average amplitudes and frequency of mEPSCs should be substantially lower than those of sEPSCs. Yet, they fall within a very similar range, suggesting that most sEPSCs may actually be independent of action potentials. But if that was indeed the case, the changes of purported sEPSC and mEPSC results should have been similar.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand the reviewer’s perspective; indeed, we asked ourselves the very same question regarding why the sEPSC and mEPSC frequency fall within a similar range when we analysed neuron means (bar graphs). We have already recorded sEPSCs followed by mEPSCs from several PV neurons (control and cHet) and are in the process of analyzing the data. We will add this data to the revised version of the manuscript. We will also rephrase the manuscript to present multiple potential interpretations of the data.</p>
<p>We hope that we have correctly interpreted the reviewer's concern. However, if the question is why sEPSC amplitude but not frequency is affected in cHet vs ctrl then the reviewer’s comment is perhaps based on the assumption that the amplitude and frequency of miniature events should be lower for all events compared to those observed for spontaneous events. However, it's essential to note that changes in the mean amplitude of sEPSCs are primarily driven by alterations in large sEPSCs (&gt;9-10pA, as shown in cumulative probability in Fig. 1b right), with smaller ones being relatively unaffected. Consequently, a reduction in sEPSC amplitude may not necessarily result in a significant decrease in frequency since their values likely remain above the detection threshold of 3 pA. This could explain the lack of a significant decrease in average inter-interval event of sEPSCs (as depicted in Fig. 1b left).</p>
<p>If the question is whether we should see the same parameters affected by the genetic manipulation in both sEPSC and mEPSC, then another critical consideration is the involvement of the releasable pool in mEPSCs versus sEPSCs. Current knowledge suggests that activity-dependent and -independent release may not necessarily engage the same pool of vesicles or target the same postsynaptic sites. This concept has been extensively explored (reviewed in Kavalali, 2015). Consequently, while we may have traditionally interpreted activity-dependent and -independent data assuming they utilize the same pool, this is no longer accurate. The current discussion in the field revolves around understanding the mechanisms underlying such phenomena. Therefore, comparisons between sEPSCs and mEPSCs may not yield conclusive data but rather speculative interpretations. For a rigorous analysis, particularly in this context involving thousands of events, it is essential to assess these data sets (mEPSCs vs sEPSCs) separately and provide cumulative probability curves. This approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying distributions and helps to elucidate any potential differences between the two types of events. We will rephrase the text, and as mentioned above, add additional data, to better reflect these considerations.</p>

<p>(2) Another significant concern is the quality of synapse counting experiments. The authors attempted to colocalize pre- and postsynaptic markers Vglut1 and PSD95 with PV labelling. However, several issues arise. Firstly, the PV labelling seems confined to soma regions, with no visible dendrites. Given that the perisomatic region only receives a minor fraction of excitatory synapses, this labeling might not accurately represent the input coverage of PV cells. Secondly, the resolution of the images is insufficient to support clear colocalization of the synaptic markers. Thirdly, the staining patterns are peculiar, with PSD95 puncta appearing within regions clearly identified as somas by Vglut1, hinting at possible intracellular signals. Furthermore, PSD95 seems to delineate potential apical dendrites of pyramidal cells passing through the region, yet Vglut1+ partners are absent in these segments, which are expected to be the marker of these synapses here.
Additionally, the cumulative density of Vglut2 and Vglut1 puncta exceeds expectations, and it's surprising that subcortical fibers labeled by Vglut2 are comparable in number to intracortical Vglut1+ axon terminals. Ideally, N(Vglut1)+N(Vglut2) should be equal or less than N(PSD95), but this is not the case here. Consequently, these results cannot be considered reliable due to these issues.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize, as it appears that the images we provided have caused confusion. The selected images represent a single focal plane of a confocal stack, which was visually centered on the PV cell somata. We chose just one confocal plane because we thought it showed more clearly the apposition of presynaptic and postsynaptic immunolabeling around the somata. In the revised version of the manuscript, we will provide higher magnification images, which will clearly show how we identified and selected the region of interest for the quantification of colocalized synaptic markers. In our confocal stacks, we can also identify PV immunolabeled dendrites and colocalized vGlut1/PSD95 or vGlut2/PSD95 puncta on them; but these do not appear in the selected images because, as explained, only one focal plane, centered on the PV cell somata, was shown.</p>
<p>We acknowledge the reviewer's point that in PV+ cells the majority of excitatory inputs are formed onto dendrites; however, we focused on the somatic excitatory inputs to PV cells, because despite their lower number, they produce much stronger depolarization in PV neurons than dendritic excitatory inputs (Hu et al., 2010; Norenberg et al., 2010). Further, quantification of perisomatic putative excitatory synapses is more reliable since by using PV immunostaining, we can visualize the soma and larger primary dendrites, but smaller, higher order dendrites are not be always detectable. Of note, PV positive somata receive more excitatory synapses than SST positive and pyramidal neuron somata as found by electron microscopy studies in the visual cortex (Hwang et al., 2021; Elabbady et al., 2024).</p>
<p>Regarding the comment on the density of vGlut1 and vGlut2 puncta, the reason that the numbers appear high and similar between the two markers is because we present normalized data (cHet normalized to their control values for each set of immunolabelling) to clearly represent the differences between genotypes. This information is present in the legends but we apologize for not clearly explaining it the methods section. We will provide a more detailed explanation of our methods in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Briefly, immunostained sections were imaged using a Leica SP8-STED confocal microscope, with a 63x (NA 1.4) at 1024 X 1024, z-step =0.3 μm, stack size of ~15 μm. Images were acquired from the auditory cortex from at least 3 coronal sections per animal. All the confocal parameters were maintained constant throughout the acquisition of an experiment. All images shown in the figures are from a single confocal plane. To quantify the number of vGlut1/PSD95 or vGlut2/PSD95 putative synapses, images were exported as TIFF files and analyzed using Fiji (Image J) software. We first manually outlined the profile of each PV cell soma (identified by PV immunolabeling). At least 4 innervated somata were selected in each confocal stack. We then used a series of custom-made macros in Fiji as previously described (Chehrazi et al, 2023). After subtracting background (rolling value = 10) and Gaussian blur (σ value = 2) filters, the stacks were binarized and vGlut1/PSD95 or vGlut2/PSD95 puncta were independently identified around the perimeter of a targeted soma in the focal plane with the highest soma circumference. Puncta were quantified after filtering particles for size (included between 0-2μm2) and circularity (included between 0-1). Data quantification was done by investigators blind to the genotype, and presented as normalized data over control values for each experiment.</p>

<p>(3) One observation from the minimal stimulation experiment was concluded by an unsupported statement. Namely, the change in the onset delay cannot be attributed to a deficit in the recruitment of PV+ cells, but it may suggest a change in the excitability of TC axons.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer, please see answer to point below.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(‎4) The conclusions drawn from the stimulation experiments are also disconnected from the actual data. To make conclusions about TC release, the authors should have tested release probability using established methods, such as paired-pulse changes. Instead, the only observation here is a change in the AMPA components, which remained unexplained.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer and we will perform additional paired-pulse ratio experiments at different intervals. We will rephrase the discussion and our interpretation and potential hypothesis according to the data obtained from this new experiment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The sampling rate of CC recordings is insufficient ‎to resolve the temporal properties of the APs. Therefore, the phase-plots cannot be interpreted (e.g. axonal and somatic AP components are not clearly separated), raising questions about how AP threshold and peak were measured. The low sampling rate also masks the real derivative of the AP signals, making them apparently faster.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge that a higher sampling rate could offer a more detailed analysis of the action potential waveform. However, in the context of action potential analysis, it is acceptable to use sampling rates ranging from 10 kHz to 20 kHz (Golomb et al., 2007; Stevens et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023), which are considered adequate in the context of the present study. Indeed, our study aims to evaluate &quot;relative&quot; differences in the electrophysiological phenotype when comparing groups following a specific genetic manipulation. A sampling rate of 10 kHz is commonly employed in similar studies, including those conducted by our collaborator and co-author S. Kourrich (e.g., Kourrich and Thomas 2009, Kourrich et al., 2013), as well as others (Russo et al., 2013; Ünal et al., 2020; Chamberland et al., 2023).</p>
<p>Despite being acquired at a lower sampling rate than potentially preferred by the reviewer, our data clearly demonstrate significant differences between the experimental groups, especially for parameters that are negligibly or not affected by the sampling rate used here (e.g., #spikes/input, RMP, Rin, Cm, Tm, AP amplitude, AP latency, AP rheobase).</p>
<p>Regarding the phase-plots, we agree that a higher sampling rate would have resulted in smoother curves and more accurate absolute values. However, the differences were sufficiently pronounced to discern the relative variations in action potential waveforms between the experimental groups.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>A related issue is that the Methods section lacks essential details about the recording conditions, such as bridge balance and capacitance neutralization.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We indeed performed bridge balance and neutralized the capacitance before starting every recording. We will add the information in the methods.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Interpretation issue: One of the most fundamental measures of cellular excitability, the rheobase, was differentially affected by cHet in BCshort and BCbroad. Yet, the authors concluded that the cHet-induced changes in the two subpopulations are common.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are uncertain if we have correctly interpreted the reviewer's comment. While we observed distinct impacts on the rheobase (Fig. 7d and 7i), there seems to be a common effect on the AP threshold (Fig. 7c and 7h), as interpreted and indicated in the final sentence of the results section for Figure 7 (page 12). If our response does not address the reviewer's comment adequately, we would greatly appreciate it if the reviewer could rephrase their feedback.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Design issue:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The Kv1 blockade experiments are disconnected from the main manuscript. There is no experiment that shows the causal relationship between changes in DTX and cHet cells. It is only an interesting observation on AP halfwidth and threshold. However, how they affect rheobase, EPSCs, and other topics of the manuscript are not addressed in DTX experiments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Furthermore, Kv1 currents were never measured in this work, nor was the channel density tested. Thus, the DTX effects are not necessarily related to changes in PV cells, which can potentially generate controversies.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While we acknowledge the reviewer's point that Kv1 currents and density weren't specifically tested, an important insight provided by Fig. 5 is the prolonged action potential latency. This delay is significantly influenced by slowly inactivating subthreshold potassium currents, namely the D-type K+ current. It's worth noting that D-type current is primarily mediated by members of the Kv1 family. The literature supports a role for Kv1.1-containing channels in modulating responses to near-threshold stimuli in PV cells (Wang et al., 1994; Goldberg et al., 2008; Zurita et al., 2018). However, we recognize that besides the Kv1 family, other families may also contribute to the observed changes.</p>
<p>To address this concern, we will revise our interpretation. We will opt for the more accurate term &quot;D-type K+ current&quot; and only speculate about the involved channel family in the discussion. It is not our intention to open unnecessary controversy, but present the data we obtained. We believe this approach and rephrasing the discussion as proposed will prevent unnecessary controversy and instead foster fruitful discussions.</p>

What is meant by &quot;targeting Kv1 family of voltage-gated potassium channels was sufficient...&quot;? &quot;Targeting&quot; could refer to altered subcellular targeting of the channels, simple overexpression/deletion in the target cell population, or targeted mutation of the channel, etc. Only the final part of the Results revealed that none of the above, but these channels were blocked selectively.</p>

<p>There is a contradiction in the introduction. The second paragraph describes in detail the distinct contribution of PV and SST n‎eurons to auditory processing.

Please be more specific about the unknown properties.</p>

<p>(9) The introduction emphasizes the heterogeneity of PV neurons, which certainly influences the interpretation of the results of the current manuscript. However, the initial experiments did not consider this and handled all PV cell data as a pooled population.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the initial experiments, we handled all PV cell data together because we wanted to be rigorous and not make assumptions/biases on the different PV cells, which in later experiments we were to distinguish based on the intrinsic properties alone. We will make this point clear in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>This paper compares the synaptic and membrane properties of two main subtypes of interneurons (PV+, SST+) in the auditory cortex of control mice vs mutants with Syngap1 haploinsufficiency. The authors find differences at both levels, although predominantly in PV+ cells. These results suggest that altered PV-interneuron functions in the auditory cortex may contribute to the network dysfunction observed in Syngap1 haploinsufficiency-related intellectual disability. The subject of the work is interesting, and most of the approach is direct and quantitative, which are major strengths. There are also some weaknesses that reduce its impact for a broader field.</p>
<p>(1) The choice of mice with conditional (rather than global) haploinsufficiency makes the link between the findings and Syngap1 relatively easy to interpret, which is a strength. However, it also remains unclear whether an entire network with the same mutation at a global level (affecting also excitatory neurons) would react similarly.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer raises an interesting and pertinent open question which we will address in the discussion of the revised paper.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) There are some (apparent?) inconsistencies between the text and the figures. Although the authors appear to have used a sophisticated statistical analysis, some datasets in the illustrations do not seem to match the statistical results. For example, neither Fig 1g nor Fig 3f (eNMDA) reach significance despite large differences.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We respectfully disagree, we do not think the text and figures are inconsistent. In the cited example, large apparent difference in mean values does not show significance due to the large variability in the data; further, we did not exclude any data points, because we wanted to be rigorous. In particular, for Fig.1g, statistical analysis shows a significant increase in the inter-mEPSC interval (*p=0.027, LMM) when all events are considered (cumulative probability plots), while there is no significant difference in the inter-mEPSCs interval for inter-cell mean comparison (inset, p=0.354, LMM).  Inter-cell mean comparison does not show difference with Mann-Whitney test either (p=0.101, the data are not normally distributed, hence the choice of the Mann-Whitney test). For Fig. 3f (eNMDA), the higher mean value for the cHet versus the control is driven by two data points which are particularly high, while the other data points overlap with the control values. The Mann-Whitney test show also no statistical difference (p=0.174).</p>
<p>In the manuscript, discussion of the data is based on the results of the LMM analysis, which takes in account both the number of cells and the numbers of mice from which these cells are recorded. We chose this statistical approach because it does not rely on the assumption that cells recorded from same mouse are independent variables. In the supplemental tables, we provided the results of the statistical analysis done with both LMM and the most commonly used Mann Whitney (for not normally distributed) or t-test (for normally distributed), for each data set.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Also, the legend to Fig 9 indicates the presence of &quot;a significant decrease in AP half-width from cHet in absence or presence of a-DTX&quot;, but the bar graph does not seem to show that.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for our lack of clarity. In legend 9, we reported the statistical comparisons between 1) cHET mice in absence of a-DTX and control mice and 2) cHET mice in presence of a-DTX and control mice. We will rephrase result description and the legend of the figure to avoid confusion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors mention that the lack of differences in synaptic current kinetics is evidence against a change in subunit composition. However, in some Figures, for example, 3a, the kinetics of the recorded currents appear dramatically different. It would be important to know and compare the values of the series resistance between control and mutant animals.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that there appears to be a qualitative difference in eNMDA decay between conditions, although quantified eNMDA decay itself is similar between groups. We have used a cutoff of 15 % for the series resistance (Rs), which is significantly more stringent as compared to the cutoff typically used in electrophysiology, which are for the vast majority between 20 and 30%. To answer this concern, we re-examined the Rs, we compared Rs between groups and found no difference for Rs in eAMPA (13.2±0.5 in WT n=16 cells, 7 mice vs 13.7±0.3 in cHet n=14 cells, 7 mice, p=0.432 LMM) and eNMDA (12.7±0.7 in WT n=6 cells, 3 mice vs 13.8±0.7 in cHet n=6 cells, 5 mice, p=0.231, LMM). Thus, the apparent qualitative difference in eNMDA decay stems from inter-cell variability rather than inter-group differences. Notably, this discrepancy between the trace (Fig. 3a) and the data (Fig. 3f, right) is largely due to inter-cell variability, particularly in eNMDA, where a higher but non-significant decay rate is driven by a couple of very high values (Fig. 3f, right). In the revised manuscript, we will show traces that better represent our findings.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) A significant unexplained variability is present in several datasets. For example, the AP threshold for PV+ includes points between -50-40 mV, but also values at around -20/-15 mV, which seems too depolarized to generate healthy APs (Fig 5c, Fig7c).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the variability in AP threshold data, with some APs appearing too depolarized to generate healthy spikes. However, we meticulously examined each AP that spiked at these depolarized thresholds and found that other intrinsic properties (such as Rin, Vrest, AP overshoot, etc.) all indicate that these cells are healthy. Therefore, to maintain objectivity and provide unbiased data to the community, we opted to include them in our analysis. It's worth noting that similar variability has been observed in other studies (Bengtsson Gonzales et al., 2020; Bertero et al., 2020).</p>
<p>Further, we conducted a significance test on AP threshold excluding these potentially unhealthy cells and found that the significant differences persist. After removing two outliers from the cHet group with values of -16.5 and 20.6 mV, we obtain: -42.6±1.01 mV in control, n=33, 15 mice vs -36.2±1.1 mV in cHet, n=38 cells, 17 mice, ***p&lt;0.001, LMM. Thus, whether these cells are included or excluded, our interpretations and conclusions remain unchanged.</p>
<p>We would like to clarify that these data have not been corrected with the junction potential. We will add this info in the revised version.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) I am unclear as to how the authors quantified colocalization between VGluts and PSD95 at the low magnification shown in Supplementary Figure 2.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for our lack of clarity. Although the analysis was done at high resolution, the figures were focused on showing multiple PV somata receiving excitatory inputs. We will add higher magnification figures and more detailed information in the methods of the revised version. Please also see our response to reviewer #2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The authors claim that &quot;cHet SST+ cells showed no significant changes in active and passive membrane properties&quot;, but this claim would seem to be directly refused by the data of Fig 8f. In the absence of changes in either active or passive membrane properties shouldn't the current/#AP plot remain unchanged?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While we acknowledge the theoretical expectation that changes in intrinsic parameters should correlate with alterations in neuronal firing, the absence of differences in the parameters analyzed in this study should not overshadow the clear and significant decrease in firing rate observed in cHet SST+ cells. This decrease serves as a compelling indication of reduced intrinsic neuronal excitability. It's certainly possible that other intrinsic factors, not assessed in this study, may have contributed to this effect. However, exploring these mechanisms is beyond the scope of our current investigation. We will rephrase the discussion and add this limitation of our study in the revised version.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) The plots used for the determination of AP threshold (Figs 5c, 7c, and 7h) suggest that the frequency of acquisition of current-clamp signals may not have been sufficient, this value is not included in the Methods section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This study utilized a sampling rate of 10 kHz, which is a standard rate for action potential analysis in the present context. We will describe more extensively the technical details in the method section of the revised manuscript we are preparing. While we acknowledge that a higher sampling rate could have enhanced the clarity of the phase plot, our recording conditions, as detailed in our response to Rev#2/comment#5, were suitable for the objectives of this study.</p>
