<title>Abstract</title><p>Functional diversification of homologous neuronal microcircuits is a widespread feature observed across brain regions as well as across species, while its molecular and developmental mechanisms remain largely unknown. We address this question in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae by focusing on segmentally homologous Wave command-like neurons, which diversify their wiring and function in a segment-specific manner. Anterior Wave (a-Wave) neurons extend axons anteriorly and connect to circuits inducing backward locomotion, whereas posterior Wave (p-Wave) neurons extend axons posteriorly and trigger forward locomotion. Here, we show that Frizzled receptors DFz2 and DFz4, together with the DWnt4 ligand, regulate the segment-specific Wave axon projection. <italic>DFz2</italic> knock-down (KD) not only reroutes Wave axons to posterior neuromeres but also biases its motor command to induce forward instead of backward locomotion as tactile response. Thus, segment-specific axon guidance diversifies the function of homologous command neurons in behavioral regulation. Since control of anterior-posterior (A-P) axon guidance by Wnt/Fz-signaling is evolutionarily conserved, our results reveal a potentially universal molecular principle for formation and diversification of the command system in the nerve cord. Furthermore, this work indicates that sensorimotor transduction can be rerouted by manipulating a single gene in a single class of neurons, potentially facilitating the evolutionary flexibility in action selection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The adaptive behavior of an animal is underpinned by the complex, yet precise, connectivity of its nervous system. For ecologically fit behaviors to occur, information regarding various sensory inputs must be routed to appropriate motor outputs by the neuronal circuits, which are established during development. Previous studies on axon guidance and selective synapse formation revealed the mechanisms of how connectivity between a pair of neurons is formed during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kolodkin and Tessier-Lavigne, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Tessier-Lavigne and Goodman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Tosches, 2017</xref>). However, how a population of neurons as a whole is wired to form functional circuits and generate adaptive behaviors remains unknown.</p>
<p>Functional diversification of homologous brain regions is a widespread phenomenon observed across brain regions and across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chakraborty and Jarvis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Tosches, 2017</xref>), including spinal segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Leung and Shimeld, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Levine et al., 2012</xref>), basal ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Grillner and Robertson, 2016</xref>), cerebral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Tosches et al., 2018</xref>), and cerebellar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kebschul et al., 2021</xref>) cortices. For instance, the spinal cord in vertebrates and ventral nerve cord (VNC) in invertebrates are composed of homologous neuromeres, which link inputs from the corresponding body segment to appropriate motor output(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Barthélemy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Levine et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Saltiel et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Takagi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Tresch and Bizzi, 1999</xref>). Accordingly, adaptive behaviors may be established in part by diversifying the connectivity among homologous circuits, through changes in the circuit’s wiring during development. However, whether such a mechanism play a role in diversifying behaviors remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chakraborty and Jarvis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Katz, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kirschner and Gerhart, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Tosches, 2017</xref>). Since the circuit wiring process recruits stepwise interactions with various surrounding cells during development as well as synaptic matching among a number of pre- and postsynaptic cells, circuit diversification may require orchestrated changes in the expression of a large number of genes across cell types. Alternatively, there may be some degree of flexibility in the system such that modulation of a small number of developmental properties (e.g. changes in the expression of neurite guidance molecules in a small population of cells) is sufficient to alter an animal’s behavior. It has been difficult to examine these possibilities due to the lack of tools to visualize and manipulate neural wiring in homologous circuits and our limited knowledge on the relationship between neurite guidance and behavioral regulation.</p>
<p>Previously, we identified a class of segmentally homologous command-like neurons in the VNC of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae, named Wave neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Takagi et al., 2017</xref>), which adaptively link tactile inputs from different segments to appropriate motor outputs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A and A</xref>’) by diversifying their connectivity. Wave neurons are present in identical positions in each abdominal neuromere, A1-A7, and extend their proximal axons to the neuropile in similar manners (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A-C</xref>). In contrast to such homology, there is a striking difference in their longitudinal axon projection upon entering the neuropile and subsequent formation of functional connectivity. Wave neurons in anterior segments (a-Wave; in neuromeres A1-A3) extend axons anteriorly and connect to circuits inducing backward locomotion, whereas Wave neurons in posterior segments (p-Wave; in neuromeres A4-A7) extend axons posteriorly and elicit forward locomotion. However, which molecular mechanism(s) underly the diverged Wave A-P axon projections and how they are relevant to behavioral regulations remained unknown.</p>

<title>DFz2 and DFz4 regulate segment-specific Wave axon projection</title>
    <p>We focused on Wnt receptors (Frizzled/Ryk) as they were known to be involved in bidirectional A-P axon guidance in mammals and nematodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hilliard and Bargmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kirszenblat et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lyuksyutova et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Salinas and Zou, 2008</xref>). We performed an RNAi-based KD of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Wnt receptors (<italic>DFz, DFz2, DFz3, DFz4, drl, Drl-2, smo, Corin</italic>) in Wave neurons (see Method details) and observed their neurite morphology using a GAL4 line that consistently targets Wave neurons from embryonic to larval stages (<xref rid="fig1_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We identified two genes, <italic>DFz2</italic> and <italic>DFz4</italic>, as being possibly involved in the axon extension towards the posterior end. <italic>DFz2</italic> KD elongated the axon extension towards the posterior end, whereas <italic>DFz4</italic> KD shortened it (<xref rid="fig1_2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A-D</xref>, <italic>p</italic> = 2.38×10<sup>-6</sup>, Chi-square test).</p>
    <p>To further characterize the role of these receptors, we examined the morphology of single Wave neurons by using MultiColor FlpOut (MCFO, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Nern et al., 2015</xref>) technique while knocking-down these receptors in Wave neurons. We found that axon extension towards the posterior end (but not towards the anterior end) was elongated both in a-Wave and p-Wave neurons upon <italic>DFz2</italic> KD by using two independent RNAi lines (A2-Wave to A6-Wave; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B-M</xref>; <xref rid="fig1_2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F and F’</xref>). Notably, the abnormal extension of Wave axons towards the posterior end was accompanied by presynaptic varicosities <italic>en route</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1D and E</xref>), suggesting that ectopic synapses are formed in this region. The ectopic axon extension from a-Wave neurons intruded the region where p-Wave axons normally project to (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1F-J</xref>), raising the possibility that a-Wave neurons gain connections to the circuits inducing forward locomotion as p-Wave neurons normally do. Conversely, overexpression of <italic>DFz2</italic> in Wave neurons resulted in the shortening of a-Wave (but not p-Wave) axon extension towards the posterior end (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1K and L</xref>). In summary, DFz2 is necessary for the suppression of Wave neurite outgrowth towards the posterior end (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1M</xref>), and such suppression might be indispensable to diversify Wave neuron connectivity across segments. Aside from axons, we also found a posterior extension of the dendrites of Wave neurons in <italic>DFz2</italic> KD animals (<xref rid="fig1_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1— figure supplement 3</xref>). However, the ectopic extension of dendrites was much shorter and occurred less frequently as compared to that of the axon. The conserved dendritic extension pattern suggests that a-Wave neurons still receive inputs from tactile sensory neurons in anterior segments in <italic>DFz2</italic> KD animals as in the wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Takagi et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, while it cannot be completely excluded that there are some changes in the inputs, the outputs are more likely to be rerouted by <italic>DFz2</italic> KD in a-Wave neurons.</p>
<p>To test if ectopic synapses are indeed formed in the extended Wave axon projections, we co-labelled wild-type and <italic>DFz2</italic> KD Wave neurons with a synaptic marker Bruchpilot (Brp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Wagh et al., 2006</xref>). We labelled A4-Wave by using MCFO and quantified the distribution of boutons (defined as axonal varicosities that have more than twice the width of axonal process) and whether they are co-labelled with Brp. While not all the boutons were Brp<sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A, B</xref>), we observed that synapses are formed at all the neuromere where the A4-Wave axon is projecting (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C, D</xref>). Importantly, the number of synapses were shifted towards posterior neuromeres upon <italic>DFz2</italic> KD, which is a pattern similar to the axon projection phenotype. The fraction of synapses over all boutons were relatively uniform across neuromeres (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>), indicating that presynaptic varicosities are a decent indicator of synapses. These observations suggest that <italic>DFz2</italic> KD results in ectopic downstream Wave connectivity, possibly altering the motor command upon its activation.</p>

<p>We also found that posterior axon extension of the most posterior p-Wave neuron (A6-Wave) is shortened in <italic>DFz4</italic> KD animals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A-I</xref>). This observation suggests that <italic>DFz4</italic> mediates attraction of the p-Wave axons towards the posterior end. Neither posterior extension of other Wave axons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C-F</xref>) nor the anterior extension of A6 or other Wave axons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C-G</xref>) was affected, implying that DFz4 promotes axon extension of Wave axons selectively in A6-Wave and towards the posterior end (summarized in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>). Also, no abnormality was observed in the dendrites of a-or p-Wave neurons (data not shown). <italic>DFz4</italic> overexpression did not yield any obvious morphological changes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3H and I</xref>), suggesting that DFz4 expression alone is not sufficient to change the axon extension of Wave neurons.</p>

<title>DWnt4 is a graded cue that regulates A-P Wave axon guidance</title>
    <p>We next sought to identify the ligand(s) of DFz2/DFz4 receptors that mediate Wave axon guidance. We first examined the overall extension pattern of Wave neurites in four <italic>Drosophila Wnt</italic> mutants (<italic>DWnt4<sup>C1/EMS23</sup></italic>, <italic>DWnt5<sup>400</sup></italic>, <italic>DWnt6<sup>KO</sup></italic>, and <italic>DWnt8<sup>KO1</sup></italic>) and found that p-Wave axon extension towards the posterior end was shortened in <italic>DWnt4</italic> mutants, which is reminiscent of <italic>DFz4</italic> KD animals (<xref rid="fig1_2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A-C</xref>). DWnt4 is known to have binding affinity to both DFz2 and DFz4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Wu and Nusse, 2002</xref>), making it a strong candidate as a shared ligand of these receptors in Wave axon guidance. Further analyses with single-Wave labelling (by using heat-shock FlpOut) also revealed abnormalities in a-Wave; posterior extension of a-Wave axons was elongated, as was observed in <italic>DFz2</italic> KD animals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4D, E, and G</xref>).</p>

    <p>Additionally, a-Wave axon extension towards the anterior end was shortened in <italic>DWnt4</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4D, E, and F</xref>), which was not observed in DFz2 or DFz4 receptor KD animals, suggesting that DWnt4 regulates anterior extension of a-Wave via other receptor(s). The fact that <italic>DWnt4</italic> mutants recapitulated both phenotypes observed in <italic>DFz2</italic> and <italic>DFz4</italic> KD animals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>) suggests that both DFz2 and DFz4 use DWnt4 as a guidance cue to regulate the extension of Wave axons along the A-P axis but with opposite “valences”.</p>
    <p>Polarized extension of axons along the A-P axis could be regulated by gradients of the guidance cues and/or their receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kirszenblat et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lyuksyutova et al., 2003</xref>). We therefore asked if there is any difference in the expression of DWnt4 and DFz2 along the A-P axis in the VNC. It has been previously suggested that <italic>DWnt4</italic> mRNAs are strongly expressed at the posterior end of the VNC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hessinger et al., 2017</xref>). Our analyses of <italic>DWnt4</italic> knock-in GAL4 line (<italic>Wnt4<sup>MI03717-Trojan</sup>-GAL4</italic>) further confirmed that the expression of <italic>DWnt4</italic> shows a gradient with higher expression towards the posterior end of the VNC (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5A and B</xref>; <xref rid="fig5_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, DWnt4 immunostaining revealed a similar gradient within the neuropil (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5C and D</xref>; <xref rid="fig5_2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>), indicating that protein expression is also polarized. These observations support the notion that DWnt4 regulates axon guidance along the A-P axis by forming a gradient along the axis.</p>

</fig>
    <p>Next, we performed DFz2 immunostaining to investigate the receptor expression along the A-P axis. We observed a weak bidirectional gradient of DFz2 expression along the A-P axis, with a slightly higher level of expression in the anterior part of the VNC neuropil (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5E and F</xref>; <xref rid="fig5_2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>) as well as in the posterior end (<xref rid="fig5_3" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Collectively, these results are consistent with the idea that complementary expression of DWnt4 and DFz2 regulates Wave axon extension via repulsion: Wave axons with higher levels of DFz2 and thus with higher sensitivity to repulsive DWnt4 signaling extend to the anterior VNC where levels of DWnt4 are low (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5G</xref>). Due to the lack of reagents that allow visualization of DFz4 expression, whether DFz4 also shows graded expression along the A-P axis remains to be determined. Nonetheless, based on the phenotype of <italic>DFz4</italic> KD (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) and the expression of DWnt4, it is likely that DFz4 guides p-Wave axons posteriorly by recognizing DWnt4 as an attractive cue (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>).</p>

<title>Motor commands of a-Wave neurons are altered by <italic>DFz2</italic> KD</title>
    <p>Having characterized the molecular mechanisms involved in morphological divergence of Wave neurons, we asked if the behavioral outputs of Wave is altered upon such anatomical perturbation. We previously used FLP-Out optogenetics experiments to show that activation of single a- and p-Wave neurons in freely behaving larvae induces backward and fast-forward locomotion, respectively, and co-activation of both a- and p-Wave neurons induces rolling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Takagi et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with this, optogenetic stimulation of all Wave neurons in the larvae induces a mixture of fast-forward locomotion, backward locomotion, and roll/bend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Takagi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Fast-forward locomotion occurs in the context of escape from nociceptive inputs and is considered a distinct behavior from normal forward locomotion (e.g. during navigation) of the larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Ohyama et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">2015</xref>). Since it is technically challenging to perform FLP-Out optogenetics in RNAi KD animals, we tested the impact of <italic>DFz2</italic> KD, and accompanied alteration in axon extension, on Wave neuron’s motor outputs by activating all Wave neurons in the larvae. In control animals, as observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Takagi et al., 2017</xref>), the stimulation induced fast-forward locomotion (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>), backward locomotion (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>’) and rolling (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>’’). By contrast, in <italic>DFz2</italic> KD animals, the stimulation induced fast-forward locomotion (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>) and rolling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C’’</xref>) but not backward locomotion (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C’</xref>).</p>

<title>Altered behavioral response to tactile stimuli in <italic>DFz2</italic> KD larvae</title>
    <p>The differential motor behaviors commanded by Wave neurons are triggered by tactile stimuli at different body parts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A and A</xref>’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Takagi et al., 2017</xref>). Does the altered axon projection of Wave neurons in <italic>DFz2</italic> KD animals impact the behavioral response evoked by tactile stimuli? Specifically, does selective a-Wave activation by natural tactile stimuli in the head induce fast-forward instead of backward locomotion, as observed in the optogenetic experiment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>)? We tested these possibilities by presenting freely behaving larvae with a gentle touch on their head using a von Frey filament, which activates a-but not p-Wave neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Takagi et al., 2017</xref>). The gentle touch responses are known to be stereotypic but range from weak to strong: continuation of forward crawls (score 0), halting followed by crawl resumption (score 1), turning followed by crawl resumption (score 2), backing-up once (score 3), and backing-up multiple times (score 4) in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kernan et al., 1994</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>).

Since turning is not induced by Wave activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Takagi et al., 2017</xref>), it is likely that the increased turning is due to the disinhibition of turning-inducing pathways (through other second-order tactile interneurons) by the deterioration of the backward-inducing pathway (through Wave). Critically, the speed of forward locomotion after each touch (usually after turning) was faster in <italic>DFz</italic>2 KD animals (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7B’’ and C’’</xref>), implying that fast-forward locomotion was induced in response to tactile stimulus. Taken together, our results suggest that changes in the axon guidance of Wave neurons alters the behavioral strategy of the larvae in response to external stimuli by altering the neurons’ command from backward to fast-forward locomotion (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To understand the circuit mechanisms underlying behavior, perturbation of neurons and circuits while observing the behavior has been a successful paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Luo et al., 2018</xref>). Most studies linking change in nervous system perturbation and behavioral alteration are either changes in physiology and/or mainly in the sensory periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ardesch et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Seeholzer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Tinbergen, 1951</xref>). Here, we revealed a link between axon guidance and circuit function by identifying molecular mechanisms underlying the divergent axon extension of segmentally homologous Wave neurons and showing changes in the axon guidance alter motor commands (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). The results illustrate several crucial features on how neural circuits mediating adaptive sensorimotor transformation form during development, and on how the evolution of the nervous system might lead to the acquisition of new behaviors.</p>

<title>Universal roles of Wnt/Fz signaling in A-P neurite guidance</title>
<p>Secreted proteins Wnts and their receptors Frizzled are evolutionarily conserved families of proteins. Wnt/Fz signaling is known to regulate A-P axon pathfinding in the nervous system of mammals and <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hilliard and Bargmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lyuksyutova et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Salinas and Zou, 2008</xref>). For instance, commissural neurons in the mouse spinal cord after crossing the midline extend their axons anteriorly by recognizing an anterior-high gradient of Wnt4 via the Frizzled-3 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lyuksyutova et al., 2003</xref>). Similarly, lin-44/Wnt and lin-17/Frizzled regulate the A-P extension of the PLM mechanosensory neuron in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hilliard and Bargmann, 2006</xref>). Although Wnt/Fz proteins are known to regulate axon guidance in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Inaki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Sato et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Yoshikawa et al., 2003</xref>), whether they play roles in A-P neurite guidance in the nerve cord was not previously known. The present study demonstrates this in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and thus points to the universal roles played by Wnt/Fz signaling in A-P neurite guidance in the animal kingdom.</p>
<p>We have shown that Frizzled receptors DFz2 and DFz4 regulate A-P axon guidance of homologous Wave neurons in segment-specific manner and in opposite valences, presumably by using DWnt4 as a common external guidance cue. Our results suggest that DFz4 mediates attraction of posterior Wave neurons towards the source of DWnt4 at the posterior end, whereas DFz2 mediates repulsion of both anterior and posterior Wave neurons away from the DWnt4 source. Presence of two graded signaling systems with antagonistic effects may aid in establishing reliable A-P axon guidance as proposed by theoretical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gierer, 1987</xref>). Our functional analyses of DFz2 and DFz4 receptors support the idea that the two signaling systems cooperate to guide the projection of Wave axons along the A-P axis. While this study focused on Wave neurons, it is likely that Wnt/Fz signaling also regulates A-P guidance of many other longitudinal axons, since DFz2 immunoreactivity was seen on a large fraction of axons in the anterior VNC.</p>

<title>Diversification of segment-specific motor commands by Fz-signaling</title>
    <p>The command neuron concept is a widely appreciated notion that a specific type of interneuron serves as a linking node between external inputs and appropriate motor outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bouvier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kupfermann and Weiss, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wiersma and Ikeda, 1964</xref>). For command neurons to function in adaptive manners, they must be precisely wired to appropriate upstream and downstream circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Faumont et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, modulation of input connectivity to command neurons is known to alter sensory-evoked behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Tenedini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Valdes-Aleman et al., 2021</xref>). However, whether changes in command neuron axon guidance alter their motor outputs was unknown. More importantly, how homologous command neurons might diverge their function to encode adaptive behavior(s) has been a long-standing question.</p>
<p>Here, we found that <italic>DFz2</italic> KD appears to influence both the axon projection pattern of a-Wave neurons and their associated motor outputs, shifting the behavioral response from backward to forward locomotion. Upon optogenetic activation, <italic>DFz2</italic> KD Wave neurons triggered significantly less backward locomotion and instead promoted fast forward locomotion (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>). Furthermore, DFz2 manipulation altered larval responses to head touch, favoring turning-and-running over backing-up(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). It is interesting that these behavioral changes were induced even though DFz2 was specifically manipulated in Wave neurons and thereforeother known secondary neurons downstream of touch sensors and nociceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Eschbach and Zlatic, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hu et al., 2020</xref>) were likely unaffected. These findings imply that the specificity of Wave-mediated motor commands play important roles inr shaping larval behavior. It should be noted, however, that while the DFz2 KD phenotypes are consistent with aberrant wiring of a-Wave axons to forward locomotion-promoting circuits, the contributions of dendritic alterations remain unclear. Additionally, altered perception and projection of p-Wave neurons may directly or indirectly contribute to the observed behavioral phenotypes, particularly in response to mechanical stimulation.</p>
<p>Segmental units in the spinal cords in vertebrates and VNC in invertebrates receive sensory inputs from corresponding body segment(s) and reroute the information to distinct motor outputs. The fact that <italic>DFz2</italic> KD a-Wave neurons function like p-Wave neurons and induce forward locomotion suggests that posterior axon projection and connection with forward-inducing circuits are a default state of Wave neurons and that suppression of posterior extension by Wnt/DFz2 is required for a-Wave to connect to alternative downstream circuits (those inducing backward locomotion) and acquire an alternative motor command. Our findings suggest a possible mechanism by which command functions of segmentally homologous neurons may diverge during development, potentially contributing to diverse sensory-motor transformations.</p>

<title>Flexible modulation of motor commands by A-P axon guidance</title>
<p>Since the way in which the nervous system carries out sensory-to-motor transformation is different between animal species in order to meet their respective ecological niches, the connectivity must be able to change flexibly during the evolution of the nervous system. If and how such connectivity changes occur during evolution remains poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Katz, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Tosches, 2017</xref>). While a few studies demonstrated that the evolution of nervous system functions is indeed accompanied by connectivity changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ardesch et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sakurai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Seeholzer et al., 2018</xref>), the underlying developmental mechanisms remain unknown. Since command neurons link specific sensory inputs to appropriate motor outputs, changes in their wiring are likely to be a powerful mechanism by which animals acquire new sensory-evoked behavioral strategies that match changing environments without perturbing the overall network stability. In this study, we propose a simple developmental mechanism that may contribute to such an evolutionary process. By rerouting the axon of a single command neuron (a-Wave) to an ectopic location (posterior neuromeres), we observed changes in larval behavior. These findings imply the existence of flexible neural mechanisms that could support a “plug-and-play” style modulation of motor commands as follows.</p>
<p>First, simply guiding the axon to a novel position appears to be sufficient for synapse formation with alternative downstream circuits. Since a-Wave neurons acquired the ability to induce fast forward locomotion in <italic>DFz2</italic> KD animals, these neurons likely formed synapses with neural circuits that trigger the behavior, presumably the downstream targets of p-Wave. It is known that neurons have robust capacity to form synapses with non-target cells, for instance when placed in an ectopic position or when normal targets are deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bekkers and Stevens, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cash et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hassan and Hiesinger, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Shen and Bargmann, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Xu et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, since a-Wave and p-Wave neurons are segmental homologues and likely share a large fraction of gene expression including those involved in synapse formation, a-Wave neurons once placed in the target region of p-Wave may readily form synapses with the p-Wave targets.</p>
<p>Second, there appears to be mechanism(s) that suppress functional connectivity to alternative downstream circuits so that only one behavioral output is induced. While a-Wave neurons in <italic>DFz2</italic> KD animals form ectopic axon extension posteriorly, the original anterior axon extension, which normally connects to backward-inducing circuits, remains largely intact morphologically. Nonetheless, the ability of a-Wave to induce backward locomotion is greatly reduced and instead forward-inducing ability is conferred. This suggests that connectivity from a-Wave axons to backward-inducing circuits is functionally suppressed, possibly by weakening of functional synapses between the synaptic partners and/or via reciprocal inhibition between the antagonistic downstream circuits.</p>
<p>The observation that switching in motor commands can be induced by manipulating a single gene in a single class of neurons raises the possibility that the Wave circuitry may be relatively amenable to evolutionary modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kirschner and Gerhart, 1998</xref>), potentially allowing adaptation to species-specific tactile environments. Supporting this idea, we observed that larval responses to head touch, where Wave neurons are thought to play major roles, differ among closely related species of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (S. Takagi and A.N., unpublished data). These results point to a degree of flexibility in the command system that might facilitate behavioral evolution. Accordingly, the present study not only provides insight into how segment-specific motor commands may be established along the A-P axis during development, but also highlights a potential molecular mechanism that could underlie evolutionary changes in the command system. Since Wnt/Fz-mediated regulation of A-P axon guidance is conserved across phyla, our finding may reflect a broader principle relevant to the formation and diversification of the command system in the nerve cord.</p>

                <p>Immunohistochemistry experiments for 3<sup>rd</sup> instar larvae were performed as done previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Takagi et al., 2017</xref>). For 12-16hAEL embryos in <xref rid="fig1_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>, whole-mount staining was performed. First, the animals were chemically dechorionated with 50% sodium hypochlorite solution, transferred into a glass vial containing 2 mL heptane (organic layer), and were fixed by 2 mL addition of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (water layer) for 30 min at room temperature with shaking. After removal of the water layer, half of the heptane was removed and 1 mL MeOH was added. The vial was vigorously shaken for 20 sec to facilitate cracking of the vitelline membrane. After removing the organic layer, the embryos were washed with MeOH twice, and with EtOH once. The embryos were then transferred into a plastic microtube, and thereafter the same protocol as in the larvae was applied.</p>

The eggs were collected by trapping the parent flies on a yeast paste-coated apple plate, covered with a cup with small air holes. To prevent collecting withheld eggs (which are most likely pre-developed), the flies were allowed to lay their eggs on the plate for one hour. For experiments in <xref rid="fig1_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, we adopted the following procedure. The flies were transferred onto another fresh plate and were allowed to lay eggs for one hour. The plates were kept at 25°C until the embryos developed to the desired stage. The stages are indicated as hours after egg laying (hAEL), which includes an error of ±0.5 hours. The stages were further validated at the time of confocal imaging by observing the development of the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Campos-Ortega and Hartenstein, 1985</xref>), and animals that did not meet the standard were excluded.</p>

                <title>Identification and characterization of <italic>R60G09-GAL4</italic> and embryonic Wave neurons</title>
                <p>Since neurite outgrowth of larval neurons occurs during embryogenesis, we first searched for a GAL4 line that targets Wave neurons consistently from embryonic to larval stages, as the previously used GAL4 (<italic>MB120B-spGAL4</italic>) lacks expression at embryonic stages (animals with GFP-positive cells: <italic>n</italic> = 2 out of 70 animals). We identified in the FlyLight database a sparse GAL4 line, <italic>R60G09-GAL4</italic>, which targets Wave neurons in 3<sup>rd</sup> instar larvae (<xref rid="fig1_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>) with the exception of a single pair of ascending neurons in T2 in the VNC, and also drives expression in two pairs of segmental neurons in the embryo (<xref rid="fig1_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). Stage-by-stage observation revealed that one of the GAL4-targeted embryonic neurons is a Wave neuron, which was continuously marked and thus can be traced through embryonic stages (10, 12, 16, 18, and 20 hAEL; <xref rid="fig1_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, C, and D</xref>) to larval stages (3rd instar; <xref rid="fig1_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Another <italic>GAL4</italic>-targeted non-Wave neurons (that resides posteriorly to Wave with the cell size being larger) started to get fragmented and densely stained in 16hAEL (<xref rid="fig1_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and was extinct at later stages (<xref rid="fig1_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>) in segments anterior than A5, suggesting that this neuron is dMP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Miguel-Aliaga, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Miguel-Aliaga et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
                <p>Although dMP2 neurons in segments A6-A8 are known to survive up to larval stages, the GAL4-driven expression in dMP2 neurons vanished in these stages (<xref rid="fig1_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p>

The behavioral experiment was conducted on an apple juice agar plate, which was placed on a heating plate to set the surface temperature of the agar within 25°C ± 1°C.

                <p>The behavioral experiment was conducted on an apple juice agar plate, which was placed on a heating plate to set the surface temperature of the agar within 25°C ± 1°C. von Frey filament (Touch Test Sensory Evaluator (0.07 g), North Coast; #NC12775-04) was used to provide gentle head touch. Gentle touch was applied to the target site (dorsal side of T3 ± 1 segment) until the filament showed a mild bend, so that a consistent force was applied across trials. Trials with failed stimulation (wrong location, insufficient filament bend) were excluded from the analyses. Five trials were performed for eight animals in each group.

<p>Summary</p>
<p>In this study Takagi and colleagues demonstrate that changes in axonal arborization of the segmental wave motor command neurons are sufficient to change behavioral motor output.</p>
<p>The authors identify the Wnt receptors DFz2 and DFz4 and the ligand Wnt4 as modulators of the stereotypic segmental arborization pattern of segmental wave neurons along the anterior-posterior body axis. Based on both embryonic expression pattern analysis and genetic manipulation of the signaling components in wave neurons (receptors) and the neuropil (Wnt4) the authors convincingly demonstrate that Wnt4 acts as a repulsive ligand for DFz2 that restricts posterior axon guidance of both anterior and posterior wave neurons. They also provide first evidence that Wnt4 potentially acts as an attractive ligand for Df4 to promote posterior extension of p-wave neurons. Interestingly, artificial optogenetic activation of all wave neurons that normally induces a backward locomotion due to the activity of anterior wave neurons, fails to induce backward locomotion in a DFz2 knock down condition with altered axonal extensions of all wave neurons towards posterior segments. In addition, the authors now observe enhanced fast forward locomotion a feature normally induced by posterior wave neurons. Consistent with these findings, they observe that the natural response to an anterior tactile stimulus is similarly altered in DFz2 knock down animals. The animals respond with less backward movement and increase fast forward motion. These results suggest that alterations in the innervation pattern of wave motor command neurons are sufficient to switch behavioral response programs.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>The authors convincingly demonstrate the importance of Wnt signaling for anterior-posterior axon guidance of a single class of motor command neurons in the larval CNS. The demonstration that alteration of the expression level of a single axon guidance receptor is sufficient to not only alter the innervation pattern but to significantly modify the behavioral response program of the animal provides a potential entry point to understand behavioral adaptations during evolution.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>The authors demonstrate an alteration of the behavioral response to a natural tactile stimulus and correlate this to morphological alterations observed in the single-neuron analyses. As the authors suggest an alteration of the command circuitry, a direct observation of the downstream activation pattern in response to selective optogenetic stimulation of anterior wave neurons (if possible with appropriate genetic tools in the future) would further strengthen their claims.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the manuscript, the authors aim to determine the molecular mechanisms involved in wiring the segmentally homologous a- and p -Wave neurons distinctively and thus are functionally different in modulating forward or backward locomotion. The genetic screen focused on Wnt/Fz-signaling due to its known anterior-to-posterior guidance roles in mammals and nematodes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The conclusion that Frizzled receptors DFz2 and DFz4 as well as the DWnt4 ligand is essential for normal segment-specific axon projections of Wave command neurons is strongly supported by the elaborate morphological analyses of numerous Wnt/Fz in gain and loss of function mutants. The distinctive Wnt/Fz ligand-receptor gradients also imply that they contribute to the diversification of Wave neurons in a location-dependent manner and that DFz2 and DFz4 may have opposing effects on axon extension.</p>
<p>Labeling of synaptic marker Bruchpilot in DFz2 mutants in this revised manuscript, now supports that the ectopic projections in a-Wave neurons make synaptic connections. Finally, the altered responses in two behavioral assays (optogenetic stimulation of all Wave neurons or tactile stimuli on heads using a von Frey filament) further strongly support the main conclusion, that Wnt/Fz-signaling is essential for the guidance of both Wave neurons and in diversifying their protection pattern in a segment-specific manner.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are no major weaknesses in the revised version of this work.</p>
<p>Re-analysis of DFz2 expression now shows it is bidirectionally distributed. This new result does not affect the previous and current conclusions for the a-Wave neurons but leaves alternative interpretations for p-Wave neurons, which the author now included in their discussions. Evidently, it seems unlikely that the complex wiring of the numerous segmental a- and p-Wave neurons will be solely dependent on Wnt4-DFz2/4 but are likely to also involve other Wnt/Fz (see, Figure 1-figure supplement 2) or distinct guidance signaling pathways. However, unraveling all factors involved is certainly beyond the scope of this study, and the main conclusions made by the authors are well supported by the data provided.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>In this study, Takagi and colleagues demonstrate that changes in axonal arborization of the segmental wave motor command neurons are sufficient to change behavioral motor output.</p>
<p>The authors identify the Wnt receptors DFz2 and DFz4 and the ligand Wnt4 as modulators of stereotypic segmental arborization patterns of segmental wave neurons along the anterior-posterior body axis. Based on both embryonic expression pattern analysis and genetic manipulation of the signaling components in wave neurons (receptors) and the neuropil (Wnt4) the authors convincingly demonstrate that Wnt4 acts as a repulsive ligand for DFz2 that restricts posterior axon guidance of both anterior and posterior wave neurons. They also provide the first evidence that Wnt4 potentially acts as an attractive ligand for Df4 to promote the posterior extension of p-wave neurons. Interestingly, artificial optogenetic activation of all wave neurons that normally induces backward locomotion due to the activity of anterior wave neurons, fails to induce backward locomotion in a DFz2 knockdown condition with altered axonal extensions of all wave neurons towards posterior segments. In addition, the authors now observe enhanced fast-forward locomotion, a feature normally induced by posterior wave neurons. Consistent with these findings, they observe that the natural response to an anterior tactile stimulus is similarly altered in DFz2 knockdown animals. The animals respond with less backward movement and increased fast forward motion. These results suggest that alterations in the innervation pattern of wave motor command neurons are sufficient to switch behavioral response programs.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>The authors convincingly demonstrate the importance of Wnt signaling for anteriorposterior axon guidance of a single class of motor command neurons in the larval CNS. The demonstration that alteration of the expression level of a single axon guidance receptor is sufficient to not only alter the innervation pattern but to significantly modify the behavioral response program of the animal provides a potential entry point to understanding behavioral adaptations during evolution.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>While the authors demonstrate an alteration of the behavioral response to a natural tactile stimulus the observed effects, a reduction of backward motion and increased fast-foward locomotion, currently cannot be directly correlated to the morphological alterations observed in the single-neuron analyses. The authors do not report any loss of innervation in the &quot;normal&quot; target region but only a small additional innervation of more posterior regions. An analysis of synaptic connectivity and/or a more detailed morphological analysis that is supported by a larger number of analyzed neurons both in control and experimental animals would further strengthen the confidence of the study. As the authors suggest an alteration of the command circuitry, a direct observation of the downstream activation pattern in response to selective optogenetic stimulation of anterior wave neurons would further strengthen their claims (analogous to Takagi et al., 2017, Figure 4).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for their insightful comments, which were instrumental in improving our manuscript. In response to the reviewers’ suggestion, we have now studied Brp expression and demonstrate that the ectopically extending Wave axons in the posterior region do contain synapses (new Figure 2). This finding supports the idea that these axons are functionally connected to ectopic downstream circuits.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have increased the number of analyzed Wave clones in Figure 1F-J (WT and DFz2 KD) and new Figure 3C-G (WT; formerly Figure 2C-G) to strengthen the morphological analyses. We fully agree with the reviewer that “direct observation of the downstream activation pattern in response to selective optogenetic stimulation” would further reinforce our conclusions. However, this was not feasible in the current study since we found that the Wave-Gal4 driver used in this study, which drives expression during embryonic stages, does not drive sufficiently strong expression in the larvae to enable selective optogenetic stimulation (please see below for details).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors previously demonstrated that anterior-located a-Wave neurons (neuromeres A1-A3) extend axons anteriorly to connect to circuits inducing backward locomotion, while p-Wave axon (neuromeres A4-A7) project posteriorly to promote forward locomotion in Drosophila larvae. In the manuscript, the authors aim to determine the molecular mechanisms involved in wiring the segmentally homologous Wave neurons distinctively and thus are functionally different in modulating forward or backward locomotion. The genetic screen focused on Wnt/Fz-signaling due to its known anterior-to-posterior guidance roles in mammals and nematodes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Knock-down (KD) DFz2 with two independent RNAi-lines caused ectopic posterior axon and dendrite extension for all a- and p-Wave neurons, with a-Wave axon extending into regions where p-Wave axons normally project. Both behavioral assays (optogenetic stimulation of all Wave neurons or tactile stimuli on heads using a von Frey filament) show that backward movement is reduced or absent and that the speed of evoked fast-forward locomotion is increased. This demonstrates that altered projections of Wave do alter behavior and the DFz2 KD phenotype is consistent with the potential aberrant wiring of a-Wave neurons to forward locomotion-promoting circuits instead of to backward locomotion-promoting circuits.</p>
<p>The main conclusion, that Wnt/Fz-signaling is essential for the guidance of Wave neurons and in diversifying their protection pattern in a segment-specific manner, is further supported by the results showing that DFz2 gain of function causes shortening of a-Wave but not p-Wave axon extensions towards the posterior end and that KD of DFz4 causes axonal shortening only in A6-p-Wave neurons but does not affect dendrites or processes of other Wave neurons. A role for ligand Wnt4 is demonstrated by results indicating that WNT4 mutants' posterior extension of aWave axons was elongated similar to DFz2 KD animals and p-Wave axon extension towards the posterior end was shortened similar to DFz2 KD animals. Finally, a DWnt4 gradient decreasing from the posterior (A8) to the anterior end (A2), similar to that described in other species, is supported by analyses of DWnt4 gene expression (using Wnt4 Trojan-Gal4) and protein expression (using antibodies). In contrast, DFz2 receptor levels seemed to decrease from the anterior (A2) to the posterior end (A5/6). Together the results support the conclusion that opposing Wnt/Fz ligand-receptor gradients contribute to the diversification of Wave neurons in a location-dependent manner and that DFz2 and DFz4 have opposing effects on axon extension.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Wave axon and dendrite projections are not exclusively determined by Wnt4, DFz2, and DFz4, and are likely to involve other Fz receptors, Wt ligands, and other types of receptor-ligand signaling pathways. This is in part supported by the fact that Wnt4 loss of function also resulted in phenotypes that do not mimic DFz2 KD or DFz4 KD (Figures 3D, E, and F) and that other Fz/Wnt mutants caused wave neuron phenotypes (Figure 1-supplement 2, D+E). This is not a weakness per se, since it doesn't affect the main conclusion of the manuscript. However, the description and analyses of the data in particular for Figure 1-supplement 2 D should be clarified in the legend. The number within the bars and the asterisks are not defined. It's presumed they refer to numbers of animals assessed and the asterisk next to DFz2 and DFz4 indicate statistically significant differences. However, only one p-value is provided in the legend. It is also unclear if p-values for the other mutants have not been determined or are non-significant. At least for mutants like Corin, which also exhibit altered axon projections, the p-values should be provided.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this reviewer’s careful attention to detail and intellectual curiosity. We apologize for the confusions caused by the statistical reporting in Figure 1 – figure supplement 2D. The numbers shown in the bars represent the number of neurons (i.e. Wave neurons from left or right hemisphere). As mentioned in Materials and Methods section, we applied Chi-square test followed by Haberman's adjusted residual analysis to determine the statistical significance of each RNAi group. The p-value provided in the figure legend corresponds to the Chi-square test. P-values for Haberman's adjusted residual analysis were calculated for all RNAi groups and groups without the asterisk are not statistically significant. We have clarified these points in the corresponding figure legend.</p>

<p>Figure 4 D, F. The gradient for Wnt4 was determined by comparison of expression levels of other segments to A8 but the gradient for DFz2 was by comparison to A2 and the data supports opposing gradients. However, for DFz2 (Figure 4, F) it seems that the gradient is bi-directional with the lowest being in A5 and increasing towards A2 as well as A8. Analysis should be performed in reference to A8 as well to determine if it is indeed bi-directional. While such a finding would not affect the interpretation of aWave neurons, it may impact conclusions about p-Wave neuron projections.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this interesting possibility. In response, we performed an additional analysis of the DFz2 gradient by comparing the signal from each neuromere to that from A8 (new Figure 5—figure supplement 3). This analysis confirmed that the gradient is indeed bidirectional. We revised the description of DFz2 expression accordingly in the revision. We believe this finding does not affect our main conclusions since only the anterior gradient is relevant for a-Wave axon guidance.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>As discussed above, the DFz2 KD phenotypes are consistent with the potential aberrant wiring of a-Wave neurons to forward locomotion-promoting circuits instead of to backward locomotion-promoting circuits. However, since the axon and dendrites of a-Wave and p-Wave are affected the actual dendritic and axonal contributions for the altered behavior remain elusive. The authors certainly considered a potential contribution of altered dendrite projection of a-Wave neurons to the phenotype and their conclusion that altered axonal projections are involved is supported by the optogenetic experiment &quot;bypassing&quot; sensory input (albeit it seems unlikely that all Wave neurons are activated simultaneously when perceiving natural stimuli).However, the author should also consider that altered perception and projection of pWave neuron may directly (e.g. extended P-wave axon projections increase forward locomotion input thereby overriding backward locomotion) or indirectly (e.g. feedback loops between forward and backward circuits) contribute to the altered behavioral phenotypes in both assays. It is probably noteworthy that the more complex behavioral alterations observed with mechanical stimulation are likely to also be caused by altered dendritic projections.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully agree with the reviewer’s thoughtful interpretation. We have now included these important possibilities in the revised Discussion section. Specifically, we acknowledge that while the DFz2 knockdown phenotypes are consistent with aberrant wiring of a-Wave neurons to forward locomotion-promoting circuits, the contributions of both axonal and dendritic alterations remain unclear. We also recognize that altered perception and projection of p-Wave neurons may directly or indirectly contribute to the observed behavioral phenotypes, particularly in response to mechanical stimulation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Presynaptic varicosities of a-Wave neurons in DFz2 KD animals are indicated by orange arrows in Figure 1. However, no presynaptic markers have been used to confirm actual ectopic synaptic connections. At least the authors should more clearly define what parameters they used to &quot;visually&quot; define potential presynaptic varicosities. Some arrows seem to point to more &quot;globular structures&quot; but for several others, it's unclear what they are pointing at.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As mentioned in our response to Reviewer #1, we have now performed Brp immunostaining to confirm the presence of ectopic synaptic connections (new Figure 2). This analysis supports the interpretation that the presynaptic varicosities observed in DFz2 knockdown animals represent actual synaptic sites. We also clarified in the figure legend the visual criteria used to identify potential presynaptic varicosities.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewing Editor (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>There are a few major concerns that we recommend the authors address:</p>
<p>(1) Neuroanatomy: The point aberrant synaptic connectivity of a-Wave neurons following Dfz2 knockdown could be substantiated. This could be done by using a presynaptic marker and showing ectopic posterior presynaptic sites ( and/or reduced anterior presynaptic sites) in a-wave neurons.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As mentioned in our response to the public review, we now have used Brp as a presynaptic marker to quantify the number and distribution of presynaptic sites along the normal and ectopic a-Wave axons (new Figure 2). We show that ectopic posterior Wave axons do contain presynaptic sites.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Gradient calculations: As detailed in the reviews below, the Dfz2 gradient looks like it may be bidirectional. Changing the way the gradient is calculated might help address this point.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As mentioned in our response above, we now have recalculated the gradient by comparing the DFz2 signal to A8 and show that it indeed is bidirectional (new Figure 5—figure supplement 2; formerly Figure 4—figure supplement 2).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3)  Statistics and sample sizes: As detailed in the reviews, some of the statistical reporting could be improved. Further, increasing sample sizes could help bolster confidence in the data as well.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As mentioned above, we have added a description on the sample size, asterisks, and p-values in Figure 1 – figure supplement 2 legend. We also increased sample sizes of single Wave neurons in control and DFz2 knock-down animals (Figure 1F-J (WT and DFz2 KD) and new Figure 3C-G (WT; formerly Figure 2C-G)).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) It would help to include some discussion of the potential contributions of altered p-wave neurons to the observed phenotypes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As described above, we have added in the Discussion potential contributions of altered p-wave neurons to the observed phenotypes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) In the current model the authors assume that posterior elongation of a-wave neuron connectivity (axonal projections) induces a loss of connectivity to their natural targets, as backward motion is no longer induced, and a gain of connectivity to posterior wave neuron targets. Is this at the cost of innervation of p-wave neurons, e.g. did these neurons now lose connectivity to their natural targets as well? Therefore, it would be very interesting if the authors would test the behavioral responses to tactile stimuli in the posterior parts of the animal - does the response pattern change?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is indeed an interesting possibility that p-Wave function is altered upon DFz2 knock-down and hence behavioral response to posterior touch is changed. However, it is technically challenging to test this with tactile stimuli, due to the difficulty of (1) distinguishing between normal and fast-forward locomotion and (2) delivering a posterior touch stimulus while the larva is moving forward, which is the default behavior of the larvae on an agar plate.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>As highlighted above, the authors should provide additional evidence that the circuit response to a-wave neurons is changed after a DFz2 knockdown. The authors should monitor the activation wave in response to optogenetic activation of anterior wave neurons - analogous to the data provided in Figure 4 of their 2017 paper. If this response is now switched for a-wave activation but not p-wave activation it would greatly support their claims and this data would be less ambiguous compared to the behavioral locomotion data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As described in our response to the public review, we attempted this approach but found that the in vitro optogenetics experiment is unfortunately not feasible due to relatively weak expression of R60G09-GAL4 in the larvae. Local activation of control aWave induced fictive backward locomotion only at low frequencies, making comparison with the experimental a-Wave very difficult.  The MB120B-spGAL4 used in our 2017 study could not be employed in this study as it does not drive expression during the embryonic stages and thus cannot be used to knock down DFz2 during development.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Related to this point. Why would the normal &quot;backward&quot; circuitry of a-wave neurons be functionally suppressed in Dfz2 knockdowns? Do the authors observe reduced synaptic connectivity in these segments? Vesicle clustering of synaptotagmin or other presynaptic markers could be used as a first. As the innervation pattern is only extended by approximately one segment, it is surprising that the changes are so significant.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that these are important and interesting points, which remain to be explored in the future study. As described above, we have performed Brp immunostaining and showed that the posterior ectopic axons of a-Wave do contain synapses (new Figure 2). We also found a slight decrease in the number of synapses in the anterior region, which could partially contribute to the weaker activation of downstream neurons responsible for eliciting backward locomotion. Another possibility is that backward suppression occurs through lateral interaction among downstream circuits. Since forward and backward locomotion do not occur simultaneously, it is likely that the circuits driving these two behaviors are mutually inhibitory. Upon DFz2 knock down in a-Wave, downstream neurons inducing fastforward locomotion may become more strongly activated than those inducing backward locomotion, resulting in inhibition of the latter via a “winner-take-all” mechanism. Since these discussions are highly speculative, we chose not to include them in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The low number of neurons analyzed per segment is of slight concern. This is particularly the case for the control data set used in Figure 1 and Figure 2. As stated, the same datasets are used for both figures. However, at most 6 neurons were analyzed (and for two segments only 3). The control morphology may be more variable than indicated by this data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As mentioned above, we now have dissected 50 larvae each for the control and experimental groups, obtained seven and six clones respectively, and included these data in the revised manuscript. We apologize that the sample sizes are still relatively small but hope the reviewer understands the inherently low “hit rate” of the stochastic labelling method.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It is somewhat curious that in Figure 1- Supplement 3 the authors report the same number of control clones per segment as in Figure 1/2 - is this simply a coincidence? And if this is an independent dataset why did the author use new controls here but not for Figure 2? It is clear that it is very difficult to generate this data but increasing the n-number beyond 3-6 per segment would significantly increase the confidence in the presented data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the confusion. The data in Figure 1 – figure supplement 3 represent the innervation pattern of dendrites, not axons. We have corrected the figure caption accordingly. These data were obtained from the same samples used to analyze axonal innervation, as shown in the original version of Figure 1F-J.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The name of the RNAi lines should be indicated in Figure 1 and Figure Supplement 3 to facilitate reading - at least the precise names should be given in both figure legends.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added these labels in the revised figure legends as requested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In Figure 4E again the control numbers of Figure 1 for the A2-wave axon are reused. This does not seem appropriate as now a different Gal4 driver is used and a different method to induce individual neuronal clones. Both components may induce significant variability in expression or arborization. As only 3 clones for the wnt4 mutant condition are analyzed (and compared to 5 control clones), this data does not allow for strong conclusions. The authors clearly state the reuse and different methods in the legend of Figure 4 F/G but should also highlight it for the E panel.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Here, we assume that the reviewer is referring to the former Figure 3 (now Figure 4). We have added a note in the legend that the control data, obtained using a different method, were reused in this panel.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The expression levels of DWnt4 and DFz2 were analyzed at the end of embryogenesis. At what developmental stage does the axonal extension of wave neurons take place? Is the gradient maintained throughout the first larval stages?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Based upon the lateral view of Wave neurons in Figure 1—figure supplement 1D, we think that the axonal extension is already established by approximately 20 hr after egg laying. Previously, we performed Wnt4<sup>MI03717-Trojan-GAL4</sup> &gt; GFP.nls immunostaining in the third instar larva and observed a similar gradient of GFP signals towards the posterior end of the ventral nerve cord (VNC). We have included this data in the revised manuscript (new Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The authors state that either 2nd or 3rd instar larvae were used for the optogenetic experiments. This may induce unnecessary variation in their assay and should be avoided. As natural variance exists in larvae regarding forward stride duration, the comparison of &quot;on&quot; state forward stride duration between control and experimental genotype is potentially not the best measurement of effect size. What is the difference between OFF and ON stage within the control and experimental genotype? In both cases stride duration decreases but there may not be a significant difference between the delta of the two genotypes. Thus, the observed effect may in part be due to &quot;slower&quot; animals in the control pool. The authors should discuss this more carefully.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this critical issue. Indeed, the stride durations of larvae between the control and DFz2 knock-down are slightly different in the OFF condition, although this is not statistically significant. In addition, the effect size of Wave activation on mean stride duration is -0.14 (s) in control while -0.21 (s) in DFz2 knock-down, which we interpret as DFz2 knock-down resulting in stronger fastforward locomotion upon Wave activation. We have incorporated this note in the corresponding figure legends (new Figure 6; formerly Figure 5).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) While the study clearly provides convincing evidence for their model, the authors should tune down their conclusions in the discussion a little bit and highlight that parts of their discussion are speculative.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have revised the discussion as suggested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Albeit the optogenetic behavioral experiments strongly support that the altered axonal projection affect normal locomotion, simultaneous labeling of Wave neurons in DFz2 KD animals with presynaptic markers would strengthen the conclusion of ectopic connection of the extended axon with other circuits.</p>
