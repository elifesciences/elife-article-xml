<title>Summary</title><p>Despite exciting developments in cancer immunotherapy, its broad application is limited by the paucity of targetable antigens on the tumor cell surface. As an intrinsic cellular pathway, nonsense- mediated decay (NMD) conceals neoantigens through the destruction of the RNA products from genes harboring truncating mutations. We developed and conducted a high throughput screen, based on the ratiometric analysis of transcripts, to identify critical mediators of NMD. This screen revealed disruption of kinase SMG1âs phosphorylation of UPF1 as a potent disruptor of NMD. This led us to design a novel SMG1 inhibitor, KVS0001, that elevates the expression of transcripts and proteins resulting from truncating mutations <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Most importantly, KVS0001 concomitantly increased the presentation of immune-targetable HLA class I-associated peptides from NMD-downregulated proteins on the surface of cancer cells. KVS0001 provides new opportunities for studying NMD and the diseases in which NMD plays a role, including cancer and inherited diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Despite success with cancer immunotherapies, approved immunotherapies are not available for the majority of cancer patients and only a minority of treated patients realize a durable response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Current studies largely focus on discovering new agents and identifying patients most likely to benefit from existing immunotherapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. While many studies correlate tumor insertion and deletion (indel) mutation load with immunotherapeutic response, not all tumors with high indel mutational loads respond to checkpoint inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The typical adult solid tumor contains a median of 54 coding somatic nucleotide variants, many of which have the potential to create novel neoantigens or Mutation Associated NeoAntigens (MANA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Approximately 5% of mutations are insertions/deletions (indels) or splice site changes that alter the open reading frame (ORF) of the transcript<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. This subset of mutations is of particular interest because they can result in proteins and derived peptides that are foreign to a hostâs healthy cells, giving rise to neoantigens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. In normal cells, nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) plays an important role in messenger RNA (mRNA) quality control, as well as normal gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. In cancer cells, however, NMD may aid immuno-evasion by eliminating RNA transcripts coming from genes that carry truncating mutants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. This prevents translation and presentation of peptides from these proteins on MHC class I complexes, rendering them invisible to immune cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Previous work has shown knockdown of the NMD pathway with siRNA enhances the anti-tumor immune response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Analysis of cell lines with loss of the UPF1 RNA helicase and ATPase gene (<italic>UPF1</italic>), a key mediator of NMD degradation, also showed increased levels of aberrant transcripts and mutant proteins in the alleles targeted by NMD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. This is reminiscent of the pharmacological modulation of splicing, which has also been shown to increase the number of neoantigens present on the cancer cell surface due to similar underlying mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Despite early studies showing little toxicity with NMD inhibition, there is as of yet no reports of a specific chemical inhibitor of the pathway with good bioavailability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In this work we create a cell-based high throughput assay to query the effects of a curated library of small molecules on NMD function. From this screen, we identify a lead compound capable of inhibiting NMD and ascertain its protein target as nonsense mediated mRNA decay associated PI3K related kinase (SMG1), a kinase that is a critical mediator of NMD. As the lead compound produced unacceptable toxicity in animal models, we then designed a specific and bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of SMG1 (KVS0001) that is well tolerated <italic>in vivo</italic>. We then demonstrate that targeted inhibition of SMG1 by KVS0001 leads to the presentation of novel neoantigens identifiable by T cells leading to tumor growth inhibition <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Development of a high throughput assay to identify NMD inhibitors</title>
<p>To develop an assay to find NMD inhibitors, we identified isogenic cell lines with out-of-frame indel mutations, hereinafter referred to as truncating mutations, targeted by NMD activity. We previously reported a panel of non-cancerous cell lines in which 19 common tumor suppressor genes were inactivated using the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Through evaluation of this panel, we discovered two genes, Stromal Antigen 2 (<italic>STAG2</italic>) and Tumor Protein p53 (<italic>TP53</italic>), which did not express their expected proteins when assessed by western blots (STAG2) or immunohistochemistry (p53) (Figure S1). Because the inactivation of these two genes was the result of frame-shift mutations, we suspected that the absence of the proteins was due to NMD. This suspicion was supported by whole transcriptome RNA-sequencing (Figure S2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Notably we saw an average decrease of STAG2 RNA transcripts by 20-fold and TP53 by 6-fold relative to their respective wild-type transcripts in the parental cell lines.</p>
<p>We selected two <italic>STAG2</italic> knockout clones (clone 2 and 8) and one <italic>TP53</italic> knockout clone (clone 221) derived from the Retinal Pigmented Epithelial (RPE1) cell line to design a high-throughput screen (HTS). Treatment with the canonical NMD inhibitor emetine demonstrated up to a 60-fold recovery of mutant RNA transcript expression, establishing this panel as appropriate for HTS (Figure S3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We then designed a Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) assay for NMD (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We mixed the three cell lines in equal proportions and plated the mixture in 96-wells plates followed by treatment with one compound (drug) per well. We determined NMD inhibition efficacy by comparing the wild-type and truncating mutant transcript expression levels in a ratiometric manner. Specifically, the wild-type sequences of the reciprocally knocked out clone (i.e., wild-type <italic>STAG2</italic> sequence from the <italic>TP53</italic> knockout clones, and wild-type <italic>TP53</italic> sequence from the <italic>STAG2</italic> knockout clones) served as internal references, providing a ratiometric assay of mutant to wild-type transcript abundance. This ratiometric assay minimized confounders introduced by nonspecific transcriptional activators or generally toxic agents.</p>

<p>The use of three cell lines with different truncating mutations from two different target genes minimized the possibility that drugs identified in the HTS were cell-line clone or mutation-specific. Note that the use of these cell lines, carefully mixed, banked, and preserved, did not substantially increase the amount of time or work required to screen a single cell line. A combination of well and plate barcodes allowed the pooling and scoring of over 1920 assays in a single NGS lane (see methods).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Execution of a high throughput screen to identify NMD inhibitors</title>
<p>Previous human clinical trials suggest that off-target toxicity at doses required for NMD inhibition makes emetine and other well-known NMD inhibitors unsuitable for human use<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. We performed a high throughput screen (HTS) to identify more specific NMD inhibitors by treating the isogenic cell line panel described above with a commercially available library consisting of 2,658 FDA- approved or in late-phase clinical trial small molecules and natural products (Table S1). After purifying RNA from cells 16 hours post-treatment, we scored NMD inhibition using the strategy described in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and Figure S4. Predictably, emetine increased the relative expression of mutant to wild-type transcripts by 3 to 4 fold on average (Figure S5). Eight compounds (0.3% of the library) increased the ratiometric mutant transcript fraction more than five standard deviations above the DMSO controls in all three cell lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). This hit threshold was chosen as it was the minimum required to ensure no false positives were observed in the DMSO controls. One of these eight compounds, anisomycin, is a known inhibitor of protein synthesis and commonly used NMD inhibitor for <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, providing independent validation of the screen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. The other seven compounds increased mutant RNA transcript levels 5 to 10-fold relative to untreated cells.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>LY3023414 inhibits NMD and causes re-expression of mutant RNA and protein</title>
<p>To validate the eight hit compounds described above, we tested their effects in additional lines with mutations targeted by NMD. First, we assessed them on isogenic <italic>STAG2</italic> and <italic>TP53</italic> knockouts in RPtec cells, another non-cancerous cell line (Figures S6A, S6B, and S7)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Four of the original eight hit compounds increased mutant RNA expression in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C</xref> and S8). Next, we examined the effects of these four compounds on additional RPE1 TP53 knockout cell lines with different mutations predicted to generate truncated TP53 proteins (Figures S6C and S7). While treatment with all four potential NMD inhibitors restored expression of the truncated mutant TP53 proteins, two of them (LY3023414 and halofuginone) did so most robustly (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>). Additionally, <italic>TP53</italic> has an isoform, TP53Î², whose expression is known to be controlled by the NMD pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Using cell lines with intact TP53Î² isoform transcripts, we observed an increase in the TP53Î² isoform in cell lines treated with both LY3023414 and halofuginone (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> middle and left column). Quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) of both the full-length TP53 (TP53Î±) and NMD sensitive (TP53Î²) transcripts in parental RPE1 and RPTec cells treated with LY3023414 or halofuginone confirmed the selective upregulation of TP53Î², but not TP53Î±, transcripts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Based on a consistently stronger effect of LY3023414 over halofuginone across multiple isogenic cell lines and assays, LY3023414 was chosen to be the initial lead compound for further studies involving NMD inhibition.</p>

<title>LY3023414 increases expression of NMD repressed mutant RNA transcripts and proteins <italic>in vitro</italic> <bold>and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</bold></title>
<p>To evaluate whether LY3023414 could relieve NMD repression of naturally occurring heterozygous mutant transcripts, we chose the NCI-H358 and LS180 cancer cell lines. Treatment with LY3023414 followed by whole transcriptome RNA sequencing revealed increased expression of the mutant allele in 42% and 67% of heterozygous, out-of-frame, indel mutations in these two lines (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). A third of the nonsense mutations in NCI-H358 were also ârecoveredâ (i.e., mutant transcripts increased relative to wildtype transcripts) after treatment with LY3023414 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> middle). In LS180 there was only one nonsense mutation meeting the required coverage, so it could not be evaluated in depth. Single base pair substitutions not resulting in stop codons were not affected by LY3023414 in either line (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> right).</p>

<p>The whole transcriptome sequencing data was confirmed by targeted deep RNA sequencing of two naturally occurring heterozygous truncating mutations from each cell line. Increased expression of the truncated mutant alleles relative to the wild-type alleles of the <italic>EXOC1</italic> and <italic>SPTAN1</italic> genes was observed in NCI-H358 cells after treatment with LY3023414 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> left). Likewise, increased expression of <italic>HNRNPA3</italic> and <italic>LRPPRC</italic> mutant transcripts was observed in LS180 after LY3023414 treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> right). We noted no significant effects on two coding region heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPâs) after LY3023414 treatment in the genes <italic>RNF43</italic> or <italic>DROSHA</italic> in either cell line (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). To substantiate these transcriptomic effects at the protein level, we treated NCI- H358 cells for 24 hours with LY3023414. Western blotting revealed truncated mutant protein for both EXOC1 and SPTAN1 after treatment with LY3023414, whereas the full-length protein levels remained present and unchanged in both the treated and control (DMSO) samples (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref> left)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>.

<p>LY3023414 was originally developed as a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (<italic>PI3K</italic>) inhibitor with activity against AKT Serine/Threonine Kinase 1 (<italic>AKT1</italic>) and Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (<italic>mTOR</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>.

To determine whether LY3023414 affects NMD <italic>in vivo</italic>, we established xenograft tumors of both NCI-H358 and LS180 in nude mice. Treatment of these mice with a single oral dose of 60 mg/kg LY3023414 led to a significant increase in the expression of mutant RNA transcripts relative to wild-type transcripts 16 hours later (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). The <italic>RNF43</italic> gene, which harbors a coding region heterozygous SNP, served as a control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Severe drug-associated toxicity, including weight loss bordering on cachexia and near total inactivity, precluded the longer-term dosing required for anti-tumorigenic effects of LY3023414 in both BALB/c and C57BL/6N immunocompetent mouse strains.</p>

<title>The kinase SMG1 is the target for NMD inhibition by LY3023414</title>

<title>Development of an improved NMD inhibitor targeting SMG1</title>
<p>In view of the problems with LY3023414 and SMG1i-11, we sought to develop a new SMG1 inhibitor based on the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the binding pocket of SMG1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. We attempted the synthesis of eleven compounds (KVS0001 to KVS0011) and tested for bioavailability and preservation of target specificity. Among these, KVS0001 stood out due to its solubility while preserving SMG1 inhibitory activity (Table S2, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3C</xref> and S12). Mass spectrometry-based assays showed that KVS0001 inhibits SMG1 protein more than any of the other 246 protein or lipid kinases tested at concentrations from 10nM to 1ÂµM (Table S3 and Figure S13)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Noteworthy off-target kinase inhibition was not observed until doses of 1ÂµM and above. Experiments using NCI-H358 and LS180 cells showed that KVS0001 is bioactive in the nanomolar range and subverts the NMD-mediated down-regulation of truncating mutant transcripts and proteins (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3D</xref>, 3E, S14, S15). Inhibition at concentrations as low as 600nM led to equal expression of wild-type and mutant transcripts, suggesting near total blockade of the NMD pathway (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3D</xref>, S14). Western blotting showed that KVS0001 substantially decreases the amount of phosphorylated UPF1, the downstream target of SMG1 kinase activity, in three different cell lines (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Finally, KVS0001 treatment of NCI-H358 and LS180-derived xenograft tumors in nude mice resulted in significant increases in transcript levels in each of six tested endogenous genes with truncating mutations, while having had no measurable effects on genes containing heterozygous coding region SNPâs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3G</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3H</xref>).</p>

<title>NMD inhibition with KVS0001 causes MHC class I display of hidden neoantigens</title>
<p>Cancer cells may evade immune surveillance by downregulating genes with truncating mutations as a result of NMD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Indeed, previous studies with non-specific or toxic NMD inhibitors have shown an increase in selected antigens from tumor-specific mutations when NMD is inhibited<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. We therefore investigated whether KVS0001 could similarly alter the cell surface presentation of proteins from genes harboring truncating mutations in NCI-H358 and LS180 cells.

<title>Targetable peptide presentation occurs with NMD inhibition by KVS0001</title>
<p>To test whether cancer cell neoantigens presented as a result of NMD inhibition could be targeted, we evaluated two cancer cell lines, NCI-H716 and NCI-H2228. Both lines contain homozygous truncating mutations in <italic>TP53</italic> which produce transcripts down-regulated by NMD, with each exhibiting RNA levels less than 20% of the median level of expression among 675 cancer cell lines (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4C</xref> and S18)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>.

<p>To determine whether this disruption of NMD repression is targetable by T-cells, we developed a bispecific antibody (KVS-BI043) that recognizes a peptide-HLA complex on one end and CD3 on the other end. CD3 is expressed only on T-cells, and this bispecific antibody functions as a T-cell engager, linking target cells to cytotoxic T-cells, which then kill the targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. KVS-BI043 recognizes a ten amino acid peptide (residues 125 to 134 of TP53) bound to HLA-A24. NCI-H2228 naturally express A24 whereas NCI-H716 cells were engineered to express A24 using a retrovirus (NCI-H716_A24). Treatment of NCI-H716_A24 or NCI-H2228 cells with KVS0001 and the KVS-BI043 bispecific antibody in the presence of normal T-cells caused a significant increase in interferon (IFN-Î³) release (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). We observed no changes in IFN-Î³ levels in the absence of KVS-BI043 or normal T-cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref> grey boxed lanes). Most importantly, treatment of NCI-H716_A24 with KVS0001 in the presence of KVS- BI043 and T-cells led to significant killing of the target cancer cells, which was also not observed in the absence of T-cells or the absence of HLA-24 in the target cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). NCI-H2228 was assessed for killing but expressed too much TP53 at baseline (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref> left most lane) and thus displayed substantial killing even in the DMSO controls.</p>

<title>Tumor growth is slowed in mice treated with KVS0001</title>
<p>Finally, we investigated whether KVS0001 could impact tumor growth in syngeneic models in which the native immune system might play a role. For this purpose, we first used murine RENCA (renal cancer) and LLC (lung cancer) as they are known to have a relatively large number of out-of-frame indel mutations (Table S4). Although murine and human SMG1 are highly related (98% at the amino acid level), it was important to show that KVS0001 could actually inhibit NMD in murine cells. For this purpose, we tested eight genes in LLC, and four in RENCA, which contained out-of-frame indel mutations potentially targeted by NMD. We also assessed the expression of three genes without any mutations known to have their normal expression controlled by NMD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>.

The dose of KVS0001 was based on experiments showing that the maximum solubility limit was reached around 2 to 3mg/mL, leading to a maximum single dose of 30mg/kg per mouse per treatment. At this dose, the only toxicity noted was transient weight loss (Figure S20), and no other pathology was observed. Both tumor types experienced significant slowing of tumor growth (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We report the design and execution of a high throughput screen to identify small molecule inhibitors of the nonsense-mediated decay pathway. The method employs a ratiometric output, allowing quantitative and controlled determination of RNA expression changes associated with NMD. Unlike previous NMD screens, this assay is directed at NMD as a process rather than as a way to identify compounds for treating specific mutations related to a disease state, such as cystic fibrosis or Î²- thalassemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. The genetically modified isogenic cell lines employed here are uniquely suited for this approach, producing a high signal-to-noise ratio. Follow- up experiments confirmed a low false positive rate in the screen: four of the eight hits re-expressed transcripts from genes with truncating mutations in a dose-responsive manner when re-tested. Note that our assay allows for the detection of NMD inhibitors regardless of effects on protein translation by virtue of the comparison of wild-type to mutant transcripts for each queried gene. This is an important feature, as many previously reported inhibitors of NMD rely on inhibition of protein translation and thus are unlikely to be optimal for specific restoration of NMD- targeted RNA and protein expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The optimal inhibitor of NMD found in our screen was LY3023414, and we were able to show that this compound inhibited the SMG1 protein kinase. <italic>SMG1</italic> acts as the gatekeeper of <italic>UPF1</italic> activity through its phosphorylation at multiple sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Unfortunately, issues likely related to off-target (pan- kinase) toxicity at the doses required for NMD inhibition prevented LY3023414 from being utilized in further <italic>in vivo</italic> work. While there are previously described SMG1 inhibitors, all have undesirable off- target or biophysical characteristics complicating their use as therapeutic agents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. For example, SMG1i-11 was previously identified as a potent and specific SMG1 inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. However, in our hands, it was insoluble and neither we nor others have been able to formulate it for administration <italic>in vivo</italic>. Another unrelated compound has shown successful <italic>in vivo</italic> re-expression of mutant RNA transcripts, but the effect is reported as less than a two-fold change, compared to the three to four-fold demonstrated here by KVS0001, and little work has been done to develop the compound further in subsequent studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In light of these issues, we attempted to improve the biophysical properties of SMG1i-11 through the development of KVS0001. As reported in this study, KVS0001 was a specific inhibitor of SMG1 that was soluble and could easily be administered to mice. Treatment of KVS0001 not only increased levels of transcripts and proteins from genes with truncating mutations, but also increased the levels of corresponding peptide bound-HLA complexes on the cell surfaces. We developed a new bispecific antibody, KVS-B043, which could recognize these pHLA complexes when the truncating mutations were in the <italic>TP53</italic> gene and destroy cancer cells harboring such mutations. In syngeneic mouse models, KVS0001 slowed the growth of some tumors containing multiple truncating mutations, but only when the mice were immunocompetent. This dependence on an intact immune system supports the idea that the slowed growth of the treated tumors was due to recognition of neoantigens.</p>
<p>Despite these encouraging data, the potential utility of KVS0001 for therapeutic purposes remains speculative, for several reasons. First, we do not understand why KVS0001 (and other NMD inhibitors) increase the expression of many, but not all, genes with truncating mutations. More research on the biochemistry of NMD will undoubtedly be required for such understanding, and perhaps the tools described here may facilitate that effort. Second, treatment with KVS0001 reduced the growth of some but not all syngeneic tumor types tested in mice. There appeared to be a correlation between the ability of KVS0001 to inhibit growth and the number of truncating mutations in the tumor. This situation is reminiscent of that encountered with immune checkpoint inhibitors, in which there is a positive but imperfect correlation with tumor mutation burden<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Undoubtedly, the ability of the immune system to react to neoantigens is related to their quality as well as their quantity, with quality defined as the ability of the neoantigen to be bound to the hostâs particular MHC constitution and initiate an immune response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. Third, treatment with KVS0001 led to decreased tumor growth in immunocompetent mice, but did not lead to tumor regressions of the type mandated by RECIST criteria in human clinical trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. Whether this failure to cure tumors in mice results from the contrived nature of the models used â injection of large numbers of rapidly growing cancer cells into animals with relatively little time to react prior to their demise â complicates the interpretation of many pre-clinical immunotherapeutic approaches.</p>
<p>Finally, KVS0001, though it was soluble and could be administered to animals for at least a month, was not entirely non-toxic, causing transient weight loss in some of the mice. Previous work has raised concerns that the importance of NMD in development and normal gene expression make it a difficult pathway to safely disrupt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. The limited impact on body weight or observed physical activity of mice undergoing KVS0001 therapy at therapeutically relevant doses suggests that NMD inhibition may have acceptable toxicity and be tolerated in developed animals. Another example of this lies in the natural genetic variants of NMD components, which convey variability in the efficiency of NMD between humans, and lends itself to supporting that knockdown of this pathway may be tolerable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>. Studies in mice also support this observation, as post-development knockdown of UPF1 displayed minimal phenotype change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. The broad use of NMD in normal development and growth, coupled with the observations here, suggests future work with inhibitors of this pathway should continue with a close eye for on-target off-tissue toxicity.</p>
<p>Though there is much work to be done, we hope that the tools, approaches, and compounds described here will facilitate that work. Should the administration of KVS0001 or a related compound prove non-toxic and well-tolerated in humans, we end with a speculation about the possibility of KVS0001 being used as a preventative rather than as a therapeutic agent. Its potential use to prevent the onset of symptoms in pediatric syndromes caused by germline truncating mutations is obvious<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>. Less obvious is the potential for it to prophylactically reduce cancer incidence in patients with hereditary non- polyposis colorectal cancer. These patients inherit heterozygous mutations of a mismatch repair gene, and they do not develop tumors until biallelic mutations of that mismatch repair gene are acquired in a rare stem cell during the second or third decade of life. Similar speculations can be made about the potential of KVS0001 to be used to prevent cancer initiation or progression in patients with other inherited mutations in repair genes, or in individuals exposed to high levels of exogenous mutagens.</p>

<title>NMD screen</title>
<p>We screened the Selleckchem Bioactive Compound library, a 2,658 compound library (Selleckchem, Texas, USA, Cat #L1700). The library was distributed over 33 x 96-well tissue culture plates with each plate containing library compounds, 2 NMD positive controls (emetine, 12 Î¼g/mL) and 6 NMD negative controls (DMSO). We mixed the three cell lines, RPE1 STAG2 2, RPE1 STAG2 8, and RPE1 TP53 221, in equal ratio and dosed with the compound library at 10 Î¼M for 14 hours. Cell pools were harvested by washing plates 2x with PBS and frozen. RNA extraction and reverse transcriptase cDNA conversion were performed as described in <italic>Targeted RNA-seq.</italic> Quality control was performed by qPCR of one NMD positive and one NMD negative control well from each plate to confirm that increased expression of the positive control (emetine) wells was observed. All samples were prepared for sequencing by amplifying cDNA using primers containing both a plate (forward primer) and well (reverse primer) barcode which amplifies the knockout cell line specific mutation for STAG2 and TP53 (See Table S5). Primers were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Iowa, USA). PCR was performed using Phusion Flash High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher, USA, Cat #F548S) for 1 min at 98 Â°C, 29 cycles of 10 sec at 98 Â°C, 15 sec at 64 Â°C, 15 sec at 72 Â°C, and 5 min at 72 Â°C. Samples were then well barcoded using a similar PCR setup for 2-4 cycles. Samples were then pooled, cleaned up with AMPure beads (Beckman Coulter, California, USA, Cat #A63880), and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500 using manufacturerâs instructions (150 cycle single read) for an average of 56,753 reads per well. The screen was scored by calculating the number of sequencing reads matching each mutant and reference transcript and calculating a Mutant Allele Fraction (MAF) correcting for the number of cell lines and heterozygous mutations.</p>
<p>NMD positive and negative control data were pooled, respectively, and averaged across all plates to determine the hit threshold of MAF &gt; 0.46. This value, 5 standard deviations above the mean for the DMSO controls, was chosen to ensure no false positives in the DMSO controls were observed. A compound was considered a hit if the MAF for all three cell lines was greater than this value. All results from the screen are reported as MAF.</p>

<p>In this study, the authors developed a cell-based screening assay for the identification of small molecule inhibitors of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). They used it to validate a novel small molecule SMG1 kinase inhibitor that inhibits NMD in cultured cells leading to the expression of neoantigens from NMD-targeted genes, and in vivo slows tumor growth of cells with a significant number of out-of-frame indel mutations. The conclusions are supported by <bold>convincing</bold> evidence, and the significance of this work consists in the development of a novel and very promising NMD inhibitor drug that acts as an inhibitor of the SMG1 NMD kinase and is suitable for use in animals. This is an <bold>important</bold> advance for the field, as previous NMD inhibitors were not specific, lacked efficacy, or were very toxic and hence not suitable for animal application.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work identified new NMD inhibitors and tested them for cancer treatment, based on the hypothesis that inhibiting NMD could lead to the production of cancer neoantigens from the stabilized mutant mRNAs, thereby enhancing the immune system's ability to recognize and kill cancer cells. Key points of the study include:</p>
<p>â¢ Development of an RNA-seq based method for NMD analysis using mixed isogenic cells that express WT or mutant transcripts of STAG2 and TP53 with engineered truncation mutations.</p>
<p>â¢ Application of this method for a drug screen and identified several potential NMD inhibitors.</p>
<p>â¢ Demonstration that one of the identified compounds, LY3023414, inhibits NMD by targeting the SMG1 protein kinase in the NMD pathway in cultured cells and mouse xenografts.</p>
<p>â¢ Due to the in vivo toxicity observed for LY3023414, the authors developed 11 new SMG1 inhibitors (KVS0001-KVS0011) based on the structures of the known SMG1 inhibitor SMG1i-11 and the SMG1 protein itself.</p>
<p>â¢ Among these, KVS0001 stood out for its high potency, excellent bioavailability, and low toxicity in mice. Treatment with KVS0001 caused NMD inhibition and increased presentation of neoantigens on MHC-I molecules, resulting in the clearance of cancer cells in vitro by co-cultured T cells and cancer xenografts in mice by the immune system.</p>
<p>These findings support the strategy of targeting the NMD pathway for cancer treatment and provide new research tools and potential lead compounds for further exploration.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The RNA-seq-based NMD analysis, using isogenic cell lines with specific NMD-inducing mutations, represents a novel approach for the high-throughput identification of potential NMD modulators or genetic regulators. The effectiveness of this method is exemplified by the identification of a new activity of AKT1/mTOR inhibitor LY3023414 in inhibiting NMD.</p>
<p>The properties of KVS0001 described in the manuscript as a novel SMG1 inhibitor suggest its potential as a lead compound for further testing the NMD-targeting strategies in cancer treatment. Additionally, this compound may serve as a useful research tool.</p>
<p>The results of the in vitro cell killing assay and in vivo xenograft experiments in both immuno-proficient and immune-deficient mice indicate that inhibiting NMD could be a viable therapeutic strategy for certain cancers.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors did not address the potential effects of NMD/SMG1 inhibitors on RNA splicing. Given that the transcripts of many RNA-binding proteins are natural targets of NMD, inhibiting NMD could significantly alter splicing patterns. This, in turn, might influence the outcomes of the RNA-seq-based method for NMD analysis and result interpretation.</p>
<p>While the RNA-seq-based approach offers several advantages for analyzing NMD, the effects of NMD/SMG1 inhibitors observed through this method should be confirmed using established NMD reporters. This step is crucial to rule out the possibility that mutations in STAG2 or TP53 affect NMD in cells, as well as to address potential clonal variations between different engineered cell lines.</p>
<p>The results from the SMG1/UPF1 knockdown and SMG1i-11 experiments presented in Figure 3 correlate with the effects seen for LY3023414, but they do not conclusively establish SMG1 as the direct target of LY3023414 in NMD inhibition. An epistatic analysis with LY3023414 and SMG1-knockdown is needed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Several publications during the past years provided evidence that NMD protects tumor cells from being recognized by the immune system by suppressing the display of neoantigens, and hence NMD inhibition is emerging as a promising anti-cancer approach. However, the lack of an efficacious and specific small-molecule NMD inhibitor with suitable pharmacological properties is currently a major bottleneck in the development of therapies that rely on NMD inhibition. In this manuscript, the authors describe their screen for identifying NMD inhibitors, which is based on isogenic cell lines that either express wild-type or NMD-sensitive transcript isoforms of p53 and STAG2. Using this setup, they screened a library of 2658 FDA-approved or late-phase clinical trial drugs and had 8 hits. Among them they further characterized LY3023414, showing that it inhibits NMD in cultured cells and in a mouse xenograft model, where it, however, was very toxic. Because LY3023414 was originally developed as a PI3K inhibitor, the authors claim that it inhibits NMD by inhibiting SMG1. While this is most likely true, the authors do not provide experimental evidence for this claim. Instead, they use this statement to switch their attention to another previously developed SMG1 inhibitor (SMG1i-11), of which they design and test several derivatives. Of these derivatives, KVS0001 showed the best pharmacological behavior. It upregulated NMD-sensitive transcripts in cultured cells and the xenograft mouse model and two predicted neoantigens could indeed be detected by mass spectrometry when the respective cells were treated with KVS0001. A bispecific antibody targeting T cells to a specific antigen-HLA complex led to increased IFN-gamma release and killing of cancer cells expressing this antigen-HLA complex when they were treated with KVS0001. Finally, the authors show that renal (RENCA) or lung cancer cells (LLC) were significantly inhibited in tumor growth in immunocompetent mice treated with KVS0001. Overall, this establishes KVS0001 as a novel and promising ant-cancer drug that by inhibiting SMG1 (and therewith NMD) increases the neoantigen production in the cancer cells and reveals them to the body's immune system as &quot;foreign&quot;.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The novelty and significance of this work consists in the development of a novel and - judging from the presented data - very promising NMD inhibiting drug that is suitable for applications in animals. This is an important advance for the field, as previous NMD inhibitors were not specific, lacked efficacy, or were very toxic and hence not suitable for animal application. It will be still a long way with many challenges ahead towards an efficacious NMD inhibitor that is safe for use in humans, but KVS0001 appears to be a molecule that bears promise for follow-up studies. In addition, while the idea of inhibiting NMD to trigger neoantigen production in cancer cells and so reveal them to the immune system has been around for quite some time, this work provides ample and compelling support for the feasibility of this approach, at least for tumors with a high mutational burden.</p>
<p>Main weaknesses:</p>
<p>There is a disconnect between the screen and the KVS0001 compound, that they describe and test in the second part of the manuscript since KVS0001 is a derivative of the SMG1 inhibitors developed by Gopalsamy et al. in 2012 and not of the lead compound identified in the screen (LY3023414). Because of high toxicity in the mouse xenograft experiments, the authors did not follow up LY3023414 but instead switched to the published SMG1i-11 drug of Gopalsamy and colleagues, a molecule that is widely used among NMD researchers for NMD inhibition in cultured cells. Therefore, in my view, the description of the screen is obsolete, and the paper could just start with the optimization of the pharmacological properties of SMG1i-11 and the characterization of KVS0001. Even though the screen is based on an elegant setup and was executed successfully, it was ultimately a failure as it didn't reveal a useful lead compound that could be further optimized.</p>
<p>Additional points:</p>
<p>- Compared to SMG1i-11, KVS0001 seems less potent in inhibiting SMG1 (higher IC50). It would therefore be important to also compare the specificity of both drugs for SMG1 over other kinases at the applied concentrations (1 uM for SMG1i-11, 5 uM for KVS0001). The Kinativ Assay (Fig. S13) was performed with 100 nM KVS0001, which is 50-fold less than the concentration used for functional assays and hence not really meaningful. In addition, more information on the pharmacokinetic properties and toxicology of KVS0001 would allow a better judgment of the potential of this molecule as a future therapeutic agent.</p>
<p>- On many figures, the concentrations of the used drugs are missing. Please ensure that for every experiment that includes drugs, the drug concentration is indicated.</p>
<p>- Do the authors have an explanation for why LY3023414 has a much stronger effect on the p53 than on the STAG2 nonsense allele (Figure 1B, S8), whereas emetine upregulates the STAG2 nonsense alleles more than the p53 nonsense allele (Figure S5). I find this curious, but the authors do not comment on it.</p>
<p>- While it is a strength of the study that the NMD inhibitors were validated on many different truncation mutations in different cell lines, it would help readers if a table or graphic illustration was included that gives an overview of all mutant alleles tested in this study (which gene, type of mutation, in which cell type). In the current version, this information is scattered throughout the manuscript.</p>
<p>- Lines 194 and 302: That SMG1i-11 was highly insoluble in the hands of the authors is surprising. It is unclear why they used variant 11j, since variant 11e of this inhibitor is widely used among NMD researchers and readily dissolves in DMSO.</p>
<p>- Line 296: The authors claim that they were able to show that LY3023414 inhibited the SMG1 kinase, which is not true. To show this, they would have for example to show that LY3023414 prevents SMG1-mediated UPF1 phosphorylation, as they did for KVS0001 and SMG1i-11 in Fig. 3F. Unless the authors provide this data, the statement should be deleted or modified.</p>
