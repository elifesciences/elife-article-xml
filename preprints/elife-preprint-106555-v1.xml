<title>Abstract</title><p>State-of-the-art cardiac electromechanical modelling and simulation form the basis for recent developments in cardiac Digital Twin technologies. However, a comprehensive evaluation of electromechanical models at cellular, tissue, and organ level has yet to be performed that addresses both ECG and pressure-volume biomarkers.

<p>We aimed to follow ASME V&amp;V40 standards to develop a strategy for calibration, validation, and uncertainty quantification of ventricular electromechanical Digital Twins under healthy conditions.

<p>When applied to a biventricular multiscale model, we achieved healthy calibrated values for the QRS duration (89 ms), QT interval (360 ms), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (51 %), peak systolic pressure (14 kPa), end diastolic (110 mL) and end systolic volumes (50 mL), peak ejection flow rate (180 mL/ms). Model validation was performed by comparison to displacement and strain biomarkers including systolic atrioventricular plane displacement (1.5 cm), systolic fibre strain (−0.18) and longitudinal strain (−0.15). Sensitivity analysis of model parameters at cellular and ventricular scales was also performed. We quantified the effects of variability in ionic conductance, mechanical stiffness, cross-bridge cycling dynamics, and systemic circulation on action potential and active tension dynamics at the cellular scale, and on ECG, pressure-volume, displacement, and strain biomarkers at the ventricular scale. Simulations showed that the relationship between healthy LVEF and T wave biomarkers was primarily underpinned by variability in L-type calcium channel conductance and SERCA activity through multi-scale effects. In this study, we pave the way towards credible cardiac electromechanical Digital Twins by setting the basis for a strategy for calibration and validation based on both ECG and mechanical biomarkers.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Digital Twins are playing an increasingly important role in healthcare to enable tailored therapy design for precision medicine. The importance of this emerging technology was attested to by recent regulatory attention and the publication of the ASME V&amp;V40 Standard in 2018<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. The Standard provided a risk-based framework for evaluating their credibility for biomedical applications.</p>
<p>At the core of the cardiac Digital Twin are realistic mechanistic models that can coherently assimilate multi-modal and multi-scale data and can explain disease mechanisms and predict therapy outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. An important aspect of cardiac function is the coupling of electrophysiology and mechanics in the ventricles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. To describe electromechanical function, Digital Twin models are built on mathematical descriptions of electromechanical coupling at cellular, tissue, and organ scales. The biophysical detail gives the model the advantage of high explainability and predictive power over statistical or machine learning approaches.</p>
<p>Electromechanical cardiac Digital Twins have had broad applicability in cardiology, such as in unravelling the relationship between the electrocardiogram (ECG) and mechanical deformation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, the ECG and ejection fraction in post-myocardial infarction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, demonstrate how mechanical deformation provides triggers and substrate for arrhythmia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> and affects re-entrant wave stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, and predicting therapy outcomes in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> and heart failure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Recent developments have enabled increasingly personalised cardiac Digital Twins through assimilation of omics, imaging, blood pressure, and electrocardiogram (ECG) data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> and promises to deliver patient-specific therapy planning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> in the near future.</p>
<p>Despite significant developments, a lack of thorough reviews of model credibility considering both electrophysiological and mechanical properties from cell to organ scales hinders wider acceptance of cardiac Digital Twin technologies. Thus far, cardiac applications of the ASME V&amp;V40 standards have focused on device optimisation using fluid-structure interaction models for left ventricular assistive devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> and for artificial heart valves<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, but this has yet to be applied to ventricular electromechanical simulations. Examples of rigorous model evaluation at cellular scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> highlight the importance of strictly separating calibration and validation data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> and consideration of both electrophysiological and mechanical biomarkers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. At the ventricular scale, most studies focused either on the ECG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> or pressure-volume biomarkers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> but not on both, and deformation and strain biomarkers are rarely considered. Simulation studies have investigated how model parameters relate to specific aspects of cardiac electromechanical function, such as the atrioventricular plane displacement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, and how model deformations relate to ECG morphologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, but not in a comprehensive manner. Large scale global sensitivity analyses studies of pressure and volume biomarkers have analysed effects from anatomical variations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> and contractility and haemodynamic parameter variations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, without any analysis of concurrent ECG biomarker effects. Furthermore, the strategies and data used for calibration and validation in these studies were typically not discussed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Therefore, in this study we aim to propose a calibration and validation strategy based on a thorough review of the literature for model parameters and considering both ECG and mechanical biomarkers for evaluating ventricular electromechanical Digital Twins, following ASME V&amp;V40 principles. We apply this to a multiscale, biventricular model with the aim to 1) reproduce healthy pressure-volume, ECG, deformation, and strain dynamics, and 2) investigate multi-scale mechanisms that underpin the relationship between ECG and pressure-volume biomarkers.</p>

<p>Simulation of the electrical excitation and relaxation through the ventricles was through the monodomain model with orthotropic diffusion along the fibre, sheet, and sheet-normal directions. Ionic current dynamics and calcium handling dynamics were modelled using the human ventricular electrophysiological cell ToR_ORd model <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, with extensive validation on experimental action potential morphology and calcium dynamics, as well as responses to multi-channel drug block.</p>
<p>Purkinje-myocardial junctions were modelled using a fast endocardial activation layer with isotropic conduction velocity <italic>σ <sub>endo</sub></italic> on the left and right ventricular endocardial surfaces. Standard 12-lead electrode positions were manually mapped from the heart and torso geometry of a previous study to the current geometry, and the 12-lead ECG was simulated at these electrode positions using the pseudo-ECG method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>The mechanical behaviour was characterised by the balance of linear momentum in a total Lagrangian formulation, considering inertial contributions but ignoring volumetric forces.

The constitutive law for the passive mechanical behaviour of the ventricular tissue was a nearly incompressible version of Holzapfel and Ogden which was orthotropic in mechanical behaviour<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. The strain energy density function defining this hyper-elastic continuum is:

The reader is directed elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> for the precise form of the passive contribution to the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor.</p>
<p>Boundaries were defined as: epicardium <italic>Γ<sub>epi</sub></italic>, left ventricular endocardium <italic>Γ<sub>LVendo</sub></italic>, right ventricular endocardium <italic>Γ<sub>RVendo</sub></italic>, and the non-endocardial surfaces of the valvular plugs <italic>Γ<sub>valve</sub></italic>,

where <italic>n</italic><sub>0</sub> was the outward normal defined on the whole material boundary <italic>∂Ω</italic><sub>0</sub>, and <italic>K<sub>epi</sub></italic> (<italic>uv c<sub>l</sub></italic>) was the stiffness corresponding to an elastic spring boundary condition applied to the endocardium and was described as a step function of the longitudinal coordinate <italic>l</italic> with magnitude of <italic>K<sub>epi</sub></italic> at values of 0&lt;<italic>uv c<sub>l</sub></italic> &lt;0.85 (i.e. applied for 85% of the longitudinal dimension of the heart from the apex). This was a simplified version of the method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, which uses an exponential decay formulation at the ‘edge’ of the pericardial constraint rather than a step function. <italic>P<sub>LVendo</sub></italic> and <italic>P<sub>RVendo</sub></italic> were the pressures applied to the left and right endocardial surfaces, respectively, and was prescribed by two independent piece-wise functions that describe the five-phases (not including initiation) of the cardiac cycle:

<list-item><p><italic>Phase 0: Initiation.</italic> Endocardial pressures were linearly increased to reach diastasis values <italic>P<sub>RVDS</sub></italic> and <italic>P<sub>LVDS</sub></italic>.</p></list-item>

Endocardial pressures were linearly increased over time <italic>t <sub>EDP</sub></italic> to end diastolic values <italic>EDP<sub>LV</sub></italic> and <italic>ED P<sub>RV</sub></italic> to mimic the effect of atrial contraction.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Phase 2: Isovolumetric contraction</italic>. Electrical activation ensues and active contraction develops. During this, the ventricular pressure was controlled such that the volume was maintained to be constant via:

The volume rate term was used as stabilisation against spurious oscillations of the ventricular pressure, which might occur due to inertial effects.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Phase 3: Ejection.</italic> When the ventricular pressure surpasses the aortic <italic>P<sub>AO</sub></italic> and pulmonary artery <italic>P<sub>PA</sub></italic> pressures, the ejection phase begins.

were the resistance of the aortic and pulmonary circuits, respectively. During the ejection phase, the ventricular pressures <italic>P<sub>LVendo</sub></italic> and <italic>P<sub>RVendo</sub></italic> were modelled as equal to the arterial pressures <italic>P<sub>AO</sub></italic> and <italic>P<sub>PA</sub></italic> respectively, disregarding negligible pressure gradients across the arterial valves.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Phase 4: Isovolumetric relaxation</italic>. This phase was triggered when the ventricular flow reverses <italic>V</italic><sup>•</sup> <italic><sub>LVendo</sub></italic>&gt;0, and <italic>V</italic><sup>•</sup><italic><sub>RVendo</sub></italic>&gt;0, and it follows the same formulation as the isovolumetric contraction Phase 2.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Phase 5: Passive filling</italic>. This phase begins when the endocardial pressure drops below the left and right atrial pressures P_LA, P_RA. The pressure was prescribed so that the two ventricular volumes were returned to its diastasis value (DSV_LV, DSV_RV).</p></list-item>

Where <italic>C <sub>pLAV</sub>, C <sub>pRAV</sub>, C<sub>vLAV</sub>, C<sub>vRAV</sub></italic> were the inverse of penalty terms for volume different to DSVs and volume rates, for the left and right ventricles, respectively.</p>
<p>The two ventricular volumes <italic>V <sub>LVendo</sub></italic> and <italic>V <sub>RVendo</sub></italic> were calculated and updated throughout the cardiac cycle by using the divergence theorem and the assumption that the volume was constrained by a flat lid located on the aortic and pulmonary valvular planes, for right and left ventricles respectively, leading to:

<title>Electromechanical coupling</title>
<p>Electrophysiological activation begins at Phase 2 of the cardiac cycle and drives the active tension generation. This is modelled at the cellular level by coupling of the Land active force generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> with intracellular calcium dynamics from the human cellular electrophysiology ToRORd model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, henceforth referred to as the human cellular electromechanical ToRORd-Land model. In order to couple the ToRORd to the Land model, the Hill coefficient of calcium cooperativity and tropomyosin rate constant of the Land model were re-fitted in a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> so that physiological active tension could be produced in response to the calcium transient dynamics of the ToRORd model, which were different to the calcium transient to which the original Land model was fitted.</p>
<p>In the Land model, active force generation is modelled using four cross-bridge cycling states (blocked, unbound, pre-power stroke and the force-generating state) and the transition rates between each were calibrated to human skinned myocyte data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. The ToRORd-Land coupling is bidirectional, where calcium from the ToRORd binds to troponin C and drives the transition between the blocked and unbound states of the crossbridge system, while the binding of calcium from the Land model acts as a buffer for the ToRORd calcium transient. Furthermore, the length-dependence of troponin calcium affinity/sensitivity in the Land model means that calcium buffering in the ToRORd is dynamically affected by tissue deformation. The Land model was first constructed using skinned myocyte data, then several of the parameters were re-fitted to enable sufficient ejection at the ventricular scale, including the transition rate from the pre-power stroke to force-generating state of the cross bridge (k<sub>ws</sub>), the sensitivity of troponin to calcium binding (Cal50)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. At the tissue level, the active tension was then added to the stress tensor to drive mechanical contraction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>.</p>

<sec id="s2e">
<title>Quantities of interest</title>
<p>To ensure model relevance to its context of use, the quantities of interest were chosen to be biomarkers with known links to key cardiac diseases, including Torsade de Pointes, myocardial infarction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension. Therefore we selected the following biomarkers from the 12-lead ECG (QRS duration, QT dispersion, T wave amplitude, T peak to T end duration, and JT interval), the pressure-volume relationship (left and right end diastolic and end systolic volumes and end systolic pressures, and left ejection fraction, left pressure upstroke velocity, left peak ejection and peak filling flow rate), and from measurements of displacement (end diastolic and end systolic wall thicknesses, atrioventricular plane displacements, systolic percentage volume change, and apical displacement) and strain (systolic global longitudinal strain, radial strain, circumferential strain, and fibre stretch ratio).

<p>Cellular biomarkers including action potential duration (APD90), active tension peak (Ta<sub>max</sub>), active tension duration (TaD50) and peak upstroke of active tension (dTa/dt<sub>max</sub>) were not explicitly included in the biomarker list since they have already been used to calibrate and validation the cellular electromechanical model previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>.

<title>Compilation of biomarker data</title>
<p>The healthy ranges for each quantity of interest (biomarker) were compiled from the literature. Reports from larger datasets were preferred for better estimates of population variability. For this reason, values were preferentially included from the UK Biobank, which is a large-scale biomedical database with health information from half a million UK participants, with more than 40,000 cardiac magnetic resonance recordings available<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. This is then supplemented by smaller studies as needed. The use of gold standard magnetic resonance imaging data was preferentially included over other imaging modalities such as echocardiography for volumetric and deformation biomarkers.</p>

<title>Separation of calibration vs validation data</title>
<p>The quantities of interest were separated into a calibration and a validation dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. The calibration dataset consisted of ECG and pressure-volume biomarkers that clinically defined healthy electromechanical function, while the validation dataset included displacement and strain biomarkers that explored the model’s capabilities for providing mechanistic explanations.</p>

<title>Sensitivity analyses strategy</title>
<p>The model was further validated through sensitivity analyses. To showcase versatility, a wider set of parameters were included in the analyses than has explicitly been linked to any disease or therapeutic target.</p>
<p>The following model parameters were included from the cellular electrophysiology (conductances of the fast sodium current GNa, late sodium current GNaL, L-type calcium current GCaL, transient outward potassium current Gto, rapid delayed rectifier potassium current GKr, slow delayed rectifier potassium current GKs, sodium calcium exchanger GNCX, inward rectifier current GK1, sodium-potassium pump current GNaK, peak calcium release Jrel, peak calcium re-uptake SERCA, and magnitude of the stimulus current Istim), the cellular active tension generation (peak active tension T<sub>ref</sub>, calcium sensitivity Cal50, cross bridge transition rates from unbound to pre-powerstroke k<sub>uw</sub> and from pre- to post-powerstroke k<sub>ws</sub>), passive mechanical properties (bulk stiffness a, fibre stiffness a<sub>f</sub>, sheet stiffness a<sub>s</sub>, fibre-sheet shear stiffness a<sub>fs</sub>, compressibility coefficient Kct, pericardial constraint stiffness K<sub>epi</sub>), and circulatory haemodynamics (aortic resistance R<sub>LV</sub>, aortic compliance C<sub>LV</sub>, aortic ejection threshold pressure P<sub>ejectionLV</sub>).</p>
<p>Model parameter ranges were informed by variabilities in literature reports (summarised in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Cellular conductances were uniformly varied from 50 to 200% to cover the experimentally measured ranges as done in previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. For passive mechanics, only the parameters carrying units of stiffness were included in the exploration and their ranges come directly from the literature. The compressibility parameter (Kct), pericardial constraint stiffness (Kepi), and the active tension coefficient (Tref) parameters were allowed greater ranges of variation since they do not correspond to experimental measurements and their physical meanings were model-dependent. Similarly, the resistance and compliance parameters and the ejection threshold pressure were allowed a large uncertainty range since they were part of a lumped parameter model and do not directly map to experimental measurements.</p>

<title>Calibration to ECG and pressure-volume biomarkers</title>
<p>The 12-lead ECG signals of a female healthy volunteer with similar myocardial mass (108 g) as the biventricular mesh (96 g) was extracted and beat-averaged<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> for calibration of electrophysiological activation and repolarisation characteristics. The conduction velocities along the fibre and sheet-normal directions were extracted from surgical measurements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. The root nodes of earliest activation on the endocardial surface as well as the conduction velocities on the endocardial surface and transmurally were calibrated using the QRS segment of the ECG signal, while spatial heterogeneity in the slow rectifier potassium current (IKs) was calibrated to the ST-T segment of the ECG signal, using a Bayesian-based inference method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>.

<p>When the initialised parameter values were used in a preliminary electromechanical simulation, the results undershot healthy values of left ventricular peak systolic pressure by 2 kPa, ejection fraction by 32%, stroke volume by 29 mL, and peak ejection rate by 142 mL/ms, and peak filling rate by 207 mL/ms, and overshot the end systolic volume by 18 mL, and the peak pressure upstroke velocity by 70 kPa/ms.

<p>Due to the high computational cost of ventricular electromechanics simulations, calibration methods that require high volume of evaluations were infeasible. In this study, we designed a sequential calibration strategy based on knowledge of model sensitivities (described in detail in Appendix 1). This involves a series of sampling and parameter selections as follows, where single parameters were uniformly sampled and multiple parameters were sampled using Latin Hypercube Sampling:

Atrioventricular plane displacement was calculated by tracking the longitudinal displacement of the top 10% of the geometry using the apex-to-base ventricular coordinate.

<p>A global sensitivity analysis was first performed at the cellular scale using the human cellular electromechanical ToR_ORd-Land model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> to identify the key parameters that affect active tension and action potential duration.

The key parameters that affect active tension dynamics and action potential duration were identified through ranking the parameters using the total Sobol index.

<title>Biventricular electromechanics model calibration to ECG and pressure-volume biomarkers</title>
<p>Following model calibration, the simulated ECG showed good R wave progression from V1 to V6 and QRS duration that fell within the ranges shown in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) as well as simulated left ventricular ejection fraction of 51% and peak systolic pressure of 14 kPa, with end diastolic and end systolic volumes of 110 mL and 50 mL (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), and a peak filling rate of 310 mL/ms (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), all falling within 95% interval of physiological biomarker ranges as listed in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The right ventricular end diastolic and end systolic volumes also fell within physiological ranges, though the right ventricular ejection fraction did not, as this was not a key target for calibration. The calibrated model overshot the peak pressure upstroke by 30 kPa/ms and peak ejection rate by 180 mL/ms (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). However, the importance of matching to these two biomarkers is lower compared with other haemodynamic markers due to the relative paucity of reported data: n=17 for peak pressure upstroke and n=15 for peak ejection rate, compared with n=804 for ejection fraction and n=150 for peak systolic pressure (Table 3), It is also possible that the calibration could be improved by including some additional model parameters, such as those relating to stretch-rate dependent force generation, even though they did not show a strong effect on single cell active tension upstroke (<xref rid="figa1" ref-type="fig">Appendix Figure A1</xref>). These additional parameters might have a stronger effect on the upstroke at ventricular scale than at single cell scale because the single cell simulations were performed under isometric conditions.

<p>ECG biomarkers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) were mostly affected by variabilities in ionic conductances (red block), with some small effects from the mechanical parameters (green block). QRS effects were very minimal, since conduction velocities were not altered in the analysis. QRS duration altered by SERCA (magnitude of change: 2.8 ms), GCaL (1 ms), GKr (1.8 ms), and GNaL (1.3 ms), while normalised QRS amplitude in lead V3 was very weakly affected by calcium sensitivity Cal50 (magnitude of change: 0.04), pericardial stiffness k<sub>epi</sub> (0.01), and the passive stiffness parameter a<sub>f</sub> (0.02) (<xref rid="figa1" ref-type="fig">Appendix Figure A1.A</xref>). The ST and T wave segments were much more sensitive to model parameters. The QT interval was strongly affected by GKr (magnitude of change: 173 ms), GNaL (92 ms), GNaK (72 ms), GCaL (69 ms), and SERCA (49 ms), with weak effects from calcium sensitivity (Cal50) (1.7 ms).</p>
<p>Normalised T wave amplitude was affected by GKr (magnitude of change: 0.1), GNaK (0.06), GNaL (0.06), and SERCA (0.04), GCaL (0.03), with very minor (&lt;0.01) amplitude changes in select precordial leads for Tref (lead V4), Cal50 (lead V4), pericardial stiffness (lead V3) and Kct (lead V2) (<xref rid="figa1" ref-type="fig">Appendix Figure A1.B</xref>).</p>
<p>Pressure volume biomarkers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>) were mostly affected by the mechanical (green block) and circulatory parameters (yellow block), alongside ionic currents (red block) that affect the calcium signaling system (GCaL and SERCA). <xref rid="figa2" ref-type="fig">Appendix Figure A2</xref> illustrates in detail the parameter effects on the pressure-volume loops. The ejection fraction was predominantly affected by cross-bridge power-stroke rate (k<sub>ws</sub>) (magnitude of change in ejection fraction: 32 %), compressibility (Kct) (16 %), GCaL (15 %), peak active tension (Tref) (12 %), SERCA activity (10 %). There were also some effects on LVEF from GNaL (9%), arterial resistance (6 %), calcium sensitivity (Cal50) (8 %), and very weak effects from pericardial stiffness (4%), passive mechanical parameters a (3 %), a<sub>f</sub> (2 %), a<sub>s</sub> (4 %), and GNaK (2%), and GKr (2 %).</p>
<p>The peak systolic pressure was affected by the same parameters as the ejection fraction, except for GNaK, GNaL and GKr, and with the addition of arterial compliance (magnitude change: 1.1 kPa) and ejection pressure threshold (1.9 kPa). The peak rate of rise of ventricular pressure (dPdtmax) was strongly influenced by only the cross-bridge power-stroke rate (k<sub>ws</sub>) (magnitude of change: 1 kPa/s), with weak effects from calcium sensitivity (Cal50) (0.6 kPa/s) (<xref rid="figa3" ref-type="fig">Appendix Figure A3.A</xref>). The peak ejection flow rate (PER) was influenced by Cal50, Tref, k_ws, while the peak filling rate (PFR) was influenced by a larger group of parameters including Tref, Cal50, Kct, GCaL, SERCA, and the bulk parameter controlling the diastolic filling rate (<xref rid="figa3" ref-type="fig">Appendix Figure A3.B</xref>).</p>
<p>Mechanical displacement biomarkers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>) were predominantly affected by active mechanics (green block) and calcium system conductances (red block), with very minor effects from passive mechanical parameters. Systolic AVPD (<xref rid="figa4" ref-type="fig">Appendix Figure A4.A</xref>) was strongly influenced by Cal50 (magnitude of effect: 0.54 cm), GCaL (0.36 cm), Tref (0.33 cm), Kct (0.41 cm), SERCA (0.31 cm), with weaker effect from k<sub>ws</sub> (0.15 cm), arterial resistance (0.09 cm), and pericardial stiffness (0.08 cm). Systolic wall thickness was predominantly affected by the same parameters as systolic AVPD, except for Kct, which had only a weak effect. Systolic percentage volume change (<xref rid="figa4" ref-type="fig">Appendix Figure A4.C</xref>) was strongly affected by the compressibility parameter (Kct) (magnitude of change: 12 %), as was expected, but also strongly affected by GCaL (9 %), Tref (8 %), SERCA (6 %), and kws (3 %). An increase in SERCA and Cal50 shifted the timing of peak volume reduction to earlier during systole.</p>
<p>Simulated strain biomarkers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>) were predominantly affected by passive mechanical parameters (green block) and circulatory parameters (yellow block). The influence of parameters on the radial, circumferential and longitudinal strain patterns (<xref rid="figa5" ref-type="fig">Appendix Figure A5</xref>) followed broadly that of the AVPD and wall thickness. Of note was that at high values of the ejection pressure, the mid-ventricular circumference expands rather than contracts during systole and fails to return to the reference condition even after relaxation, pointing to failure of proper pumping function (<xref rid="figa5" ref-type="fig">Appendix Figure A5.A</xref>).</p>

<title>Multi-scale mechanisms underpinning ECG and LVEF relationship</title>
<p>Simulation results indicated that the link between ECG biomarkers and LVEF was chiefly underpinned by GCaL and SERCA, which had strong effects on both T wave biomarkers and the pressure-volume loop (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).

<p><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> illustrates the multi-scale mechanisms of GCaL’s effect on both LVEF and ECG. A four-fold increase in GCaL caused an eight-fold increase in cellular active tension peak and a 200 ms prolongation of active tension duration (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), which resulted in a 15 mL decrease in end systolic volume and 2.5 kPa higher peak systolic pressure at the ventricular scale (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>

<p>GCaL’s dramatic effect on end systolic volume was facilitated by 10 % higher systolic myocardial volume compression, 4.5 % higher systolic longitudinal contraction, 3.5 % higher systolic circumferential contraction, and 0.4 cm lower (towards apex) systolic position of the atrioventricular plane (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). The increase in GCaL caused an increase of 60 ms in cellular action potential duration (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), which prolonged the global repolarisation time (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>) and led to the prolongation of the QT interval (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). GCaL did not have a significant effect on the activation pattern and conduction velocity in our simulations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>) or on the QRS complex of the ECG (not shown).</p>
<p><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> illustrates how a four-fold increase in SERCA activity caused a 12% decrease in LVEF, with non-monotonic effects on the QT interval. The increase in SERCA conductance increased diastolic residual active tension (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), which was sufficient to cause 3 mL reduction in end diastolic volume (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Even though increasing SERCA increased peak active tension at the cellular scale by 9 kPa (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), it reduced peak systolic pressure and LVEF at the ventricular scale (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). This was because increasing SERCA hastened the arrival of peak active tension by 50 ms and reduced its duration by 100 ms (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), which meant that the mechanical contractions were not given enough time to developed, resulting in earlier and weaker systolic contractions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). On the electrophysiological side, while SERCA did not elicit strong APD changes at the single cell simulation, when combined with non-isometric conditions in ventricular simulations, it caused action potential prolongation at values higher than 1.5-fold and resulted in prolonged repolarization (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we presented the calibration, validation and sensitivity analysis of human healthy ventricular electromechanical modelling and simulation, following the ASME V&amp;V40-based assessment guidelines. The first step was compiling biomarkers values from multi-modal data characterizing pressure-volume, ECG, displacement, and strain behavior of human healthy ventricles, and separated the data for calibration and validation. The calibration was informed by unravelling the interlinking relationships between simulated biomarkers and model parameters, especially highlighting the plethora of model parameters that affect the ejection fraction. We demonstrated multi-scale mechanistic explanations of the relationship between LVEF and ECG underpinned by variability in L-type calcium channel conductance and SERCA activity.</p>
<p>Previous examples of applying the ASME V&amp;V40 framework for cardiac model credibility assessment have focused primarily on evaluating computational models of medical devices such as the left ventricular assist device<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> and artificial heart valves<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, where model validation was performed by comparing to experimental recordings specifically designed for this purpose. These studies, as well as other examples of model validation without explicit reference to the ASME Standard, commonly have narrow focuses on specific diseases and/or therapies, and the biomarkers used for model evaluation were similarly limited in scope. In the case of disease models, calibrations were commonly performed at the cellular or tissue scale and validation was performed at the ventricular scale through comparisons with known ECG or ejection fraction phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. While these studies have been valuable for providing model credibility in their specific disease/therapeutic contexts of use, they have not been designed to give credibility to the underlying computational electromechanics framework. In this study, we instead focused on building a comprehensive calibration and validation strategy for baseline healthy biventricular electromechanics. Through considering biomarkers at multiple scales and across both electrophysiology and mechanics, we hoped to establish a firm foundation of credibility for computational electromechanics that can be refined in future studies.</p>
<p>We showed in this study that literature values for model parameters do not automatically provide good baseline simulations. We proposed a sequential calibration strategy based on knowledge of model sensitivities, as detailed in the methods. This approach can be adapted for more sophisticated numerical techniques involving the use of emulators and Bayesian statistics to enable faster and more comprehensive explorations of the parameter space<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Our sensitivity analysis results showed that in the simulated ECGs, the T wave was far more sensitive to electrophysiological parameters than to mechanical ones, within the ranges of uncertainty expected from literature reports of each parameter. In our simulations, the ionic conductances GNaK and GNaL primarily affected the T wave through altering the action potential duration (<xref rid="figa1" ref-type="fig">Appendix Figure A1</xref>) while having minimal effect on mechanical deformation or strain. GCaL and SERCA strongly affected the repolarization pattern and deformation and strain patterns during systole (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). However, other parameters that had a strong effect on deformation and strain, such as Tref, Cal50, pericardial stiffness and Kct had only a minor effect on the T wave (<xref rid="figa2" ref-type="fig">Appendix Figure A2</xref>). Previous studies on this question focused on comparing either end diastolic versus end systolic geometry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> or a static versus dynamic geometry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup> when simulating the T wave. These simulations involved a much larger perturbation in deformation than relevant to physiological situations and showed a larger effect on the T wave amplitude than our simulations. Within the context of physiological systolic deformations, however, our results showed that deformation uncertainties had only minor effects on T wave amplitude.</p>
<p>Our simulations showed only minor changes to QRS amplitudes in response to variation in those parameters that influenced the end diastolic geometry: calcium sensitivity, through altering diastolic residual active tension, pericardial stiffness, through restricting diastolic inflation, and the passive mechanical parameters a and af, through altering bulk stiffness and stiffness along the myofibre direction. However, it is possible that the magnitude of changes to the QRS was underestimated in our simulations, because the local activation times on the endocardial surface in our simulations were fixed. This meant that our simulations did not explore the effect of variations in end diastolic geometry on the conduction velocity of the fast endocardial activation layer or on Purkinje conductivity. It should also be noted that other parameters that affect the activation pattern, such as GNa and conduction velocities, were not included in this analysis.</p>
<p>The fact that the initialised literature values of model parameters failed to achieve LVEF above 50 % pointed to limitations in using ex vivo tissue measurements to represent in vivo function. In our simulations, we saw that the LVEF was strongly sensitive to changes in the incompressibility of the tissue (Kct), such that an increase in compressibility of the myocardial tissue helped to increase LVEF. The systolic volume has been reported to change up to 13%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup>, pointing to limitations of assumptions of incompressibility in the modelling of the myocardial tissue. Additionally, our model did not achieve a high amount of wall thickening in validation, which meant that the high compressibility required in our model to achieve LVEF could be compensating for a lack of sufficient wall thickening, in addition to anatomical effects. Previous experimental and simulations studies have shown how wall thickening is related to sliding of sheetlets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup>. However, in our simulations we did not see a significant effect of the sheer stiffness parameter a<sub>fs</sub> on wall thickness or LVEF. One possible avenue of exploration would be the effect of sheet and fibre orientations on the thickening effect, as explored in a previous simulation study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Displacement and strain biomarkers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>) were far more sensitive to calcium handling dynamics, cross-bridge cycling rate, and contractility than to passive stiffness parameters, which indicates they would be better indicators of systolic rather than diastolic dysfunctions in HF. The sensitivity of strains and displacements to the pericardial stiffness parameter was unsurprising due to the association of reduced strains in diseases affecting the pericardial sack<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></sup>. The sensitivity of longitudinal and radial strain to the incompressibility of the myocardium (Kct) mirrors the sensitivity of the LVEF to that parameter, which was in accordance with the fact that those two strains were surrogate markers of LVEF and show better predictive power<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this study, we show the importance of applying vigorous VVUQ evaluations of ventricular electromechanics for achieving physiological simulations. We set the basis for a strategy for calibrating and validating baseline electromechanical modelling and simulation frameworks for cardiac Digital Twins. We compiled a comprehensive list of biomarkers for evaluating healthy electromechanical function, and grouped the dataset into non-overlapping calibration and validation sets. We provide evidence of credibility through calibration to haemodynamic and ECG biomarkers and validation by comparison to strain and deformation biomarkers and uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, our analyses highlighted the interplay between cellular, tissue, and haemodynamic parameters on the LVEF and provided multi-scale explanations of its link with ECG biomarkers. Taken together, the study paves the way towards credible electromechanical cardiac Digital Twins.</p>

<label>1.</label><title>Pressure volume calibration strategy design</title>
<p>The goal of the calibration of the initialised set of parameters was to increase LVEF, increase systolic pressure, increase peak filling rate, but decrease peak ejection rate and lower dP/dt<sub>max</sub>. The LVEF and peak systolic pressure had the highest degree of importance for calibration, since they were implicated in a variety of diseases and was well established. The filling rates and dPdt<sub>max</sub> took a secondary role, since the data came from much smaller sample sizes, and the filling rates were measured using echocardiography techniques, which were not as reliable as volume measurements in CMR (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>From the uncertainty quantification, we saw that a handful of parameters can increase both LVEF and peak systolic pressure simultaneously: Tref, k<sub>ws</sub>, GCaL, SERCA, Cal50, Kct (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). However, Tref and kws effects saturate at high values, large changes in SERCA and GCaL can become arrhythmic substrates, Cal50 has a non-monotonic effect on LVEF due to its effect on the diastolic function, and dramatic reductions in Kct brings unrealistic amounts of systolic volume change. A combination of changes in these parameters was needed to dramatically improve LVEF and peak systolic pressure, and in practice, was insufficient by themselves. Decreasing arterial resistance was also needed to help increase LVEF. However, this comes at the cost of reducing peak systolic pressure, which needed to be counterbalanced by increasing the ejection pressure threshold. An increase in ejection pressure increased time spent in isovolumic contraction and isometric force development, and thereby increased the peak systolic pressure. An additional challenge was that there was not a single parameter in our analysis that could decrease peak ejection flow rate (Tref, kws, Kct) and dPdt<sub>max</sub> (kws) without also decreasing LVEF at the same time. This meant that we needed to achieve higher than healthy LVEF first. With all this in mind, the calibration strategy was as detailed in the Methods section.</p>

<p>This is a potentially <bold>important</bold> study that explores the relevant range of parameter values for calibration and validation of cardiac electromechanics in ventricular models. Although much of the work presented is <bold>solid</bold>, the evidence provided to support the authors' key scientific claims is <bold>incomplete</bold>, especially as it relates to the emphasis on standardized validation and verification approaches. Notably, the level of model personalization presented in this work falls short of the threshold for what could reasonably be called a &quot;digital twin&quot;, even by the relatively relaxed standards that have emerged in computational physiology and related fields in recent years.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study by Wang et al. investigates cardiac electromechanical modeling and simulation techniques, focusing on the calibration and validation of ventricular models according to ASME V&amp;V40 standards. The researchers aim to calibrate model parameters to align with key biomarkers such as QRS duration and left ventricular ejection fraction, and validate the model against independent measurements such as displacement and strain metrics. The authors also examine the impact of parameter variations on deformation, ejection fraction, strains, and other biomarkers. The overarching aim of the study is to give &quot;credibility to the underlying computational electromechanics framework&quot; and to &quot;pave the way towards credible cardiacelectromechanical Digital Twins.&quot;</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The study presents a solid validation strategy for cardiac models based on independent data.</p>
<p>(2) It integrates electrophysiological, mechanical, and hemodynamic biomarkers for sensitivity analysis and calibration.</p>
<p>Weaknesses and Limitations:</p>
<p>(1) Model Assumptions: The study employs simplified modeling assumptions that are not state-of-the-art, e.g.,</p>
<p>
a) Isotropic scaling of the mesh to generate an unloaded reference geometry.</p>
<p>
b) Simple afterload and preload models that fail to produce physiological results.</p>
<p>
c) Simplified epicardial boundary conditions.</p>
<p>(2) Numerical Framework:</p>
<p>
a) The mesh resolution and/or the numerical framework used for the mechanical part appears to suffer from known numerical artifacts (locking effects), leading to overly stiff or inaccurate behavior in finite element analysis. This results in an artificially stiff response to deformation, which is compensated by setting active contraction to ten times the value reported in the literature. The authors attribute this to limitations in using ex vivo tissue measurements to represent in vivo function, although similar issues were not observed in previous works.</p>
<p>
b) Further, the authors employ the monodomain model for the simulation of the electrical excitation and relaxation on a relatively coarse grid with an approximate edge length of 1mm. This resolution is known to be insufficient for reliable results in organ-scale electrophysiology modeling.</p>
<p>(3) Geometrical model and digital twin: The geometrical model, taken from a public cohort and calibrated to an ECG of another individual along with population-averaged values from a databank (UK Biobank), and unrelated measurements from surgical procedures, can hardly be considered a digital twin. Further, validation of the model was then performed against data from yet another cohort.</p>
<p>(4) Calibration procedure: There are apparent flaws in the calibration procedure, or it is not described in sufficient detail. The authors dedicate significant effort to motivating parameter ranges, but in the end they use mostly other parameters for the calibration process, aiming to maximize left ventricular ejection fraction. It is not clear whether the chosen parameters result in, e.g., physiological calcium traces or calibrated parameters that are within physiological ranges.</p>
<p>(5) Goodness of fits, e.g., a direct comparison of the measured and the simulated ECG, are not provided to assess calibration quality.</p>
<p>(6) Due to these limitations and weaknesses, the authors fall short of achieving some of their goals, particularly establishing credibility for the underlying computational framework and in reproducing healthy pressure-volume loops, and in achieving physiological simulations while using physiological or reported ranges for the calibrated parameters.</p>
<p>For example, a key physiological requirement is that the right and left ventricular stroke volumes are approximately equal in a heart beating at a limit cycle, as the blood pumped by the right ventricle into the pulmonary circulation must match the amount pumped by the left ventricle into the systemic circulation. This balance is not achieved in this study.</p>
<p>(7) The conclusive claim that &quot;the study paves the way towards credible electromechanical cardiac Digital Twins&quot; is not supported. The model exhibits non-physiological behavior, requires unsupported parameter alterations (such as a 10-fold active stress scaling), and does not represent a digital twin, as model data are drawn from various unrelated, non-patient-specific sources.</p>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>Overall, this reviewer considers that the study requires a major revision, including improvements in numerical methods, modeling choices, and checks for physiological behavior. Nevertheless, the provided tables with averaged values from the UK Biobank and the presented validation strategy could be valuable to the research community.</p>

<p>The authors present an interesting study on calibrating and validating a biventricular cardiac electromechanical model. This is an important contribution, but some questions remain about the quantitative validation and verification aspects of the study.</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>(1) The title and paper stress the importance of validation on several occasions. However, the actual validation performed is limited to the section in lines 427-439. Furthermore, it is entirely qualitative, making assessing the model's quality difficult. Most of the paper is focused on sensitivity analysis, which is also interesting but unrelated to validation. Can you include a quantitative comparison with deformation biomarkers? E.g., spatially quantify strain differences between simulation and in vivo data, or overlay the current configuration of the geometry with MRI in various views, and calculate a displacement error norm.</p>
<p>(2) You mention the ASME V&amp;V40 standards throughout your paper. Yet, you only address the &quot;second V&quot; validation, ignoring the &quot;first V&quot; verification. How did you ensure that your computational models are implemented correctly?</p>
<p>(3) All parameters discussed in this publication are physical parameters. What is the sensitivity of your model outputs concerning computational parameters?</p>
