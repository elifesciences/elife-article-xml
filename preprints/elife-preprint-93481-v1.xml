<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Axo-axonic cells (AACs), also called chandelier cells (ChCs) in the cerebral cortex, are the most distinctive type of GABAergic interneurons described in the neocortex, hippocampus, and basolateral amygdala (BLA). AACs selectively innervate glutamatergic projection neurons (PNs) at their axon initial segment (AIS), thus may exert decisive control over PN spiking and regulate PN functional ensembles. However, the brain-wide distribution, synaptic connectivity, and circuit function of AACs remains poorly understood, largely due to the lack of specific and reliable experimental tools. Here, we have established an intersectional genetic strategy that achieves specific and comprehensive targeting of AACs throughout the mouse brain based on their lineage (<italic>Nkx2.1</italic>) and molecular (<italic>Unc5b</italic>, <italic>Pthlh</italic>) markers. We discovered that AACs are deployed across essentially all the pallium-derived brain structures, including not only the dorsal pallium-derived neocortex and medial pallium-derived hippocampal formation, but also the lateral pallium-derived claustrum-insular complex, and the ventral pallium-derived extended amygdaloid complex and olfactory centers. AACs are also abundant in anterior olfactory nucleus, taenia tecta and lateral septum. AACs show characteristic variations in density across neocortical areas and layers and across subregions of the hippocampal formation. Neocortical AACs comprise multiple laminar subtypes with distinct dendritic and axonal arborization patterns. Retrograde monosynaptic tracing from AACs across neocortical, hippocampal and BLA regions reveal shared as well as distinct patterns of synaptic input. Specific and comprehensive targeting of AACs facilitates the study of their developmental genetic program and circuit function across brain structures, providing a ground truth platform for understanding the conservation and variation of a bona fide cell type across brain regions and species.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The precision of inhibitory control is crucial for regulating information processing and routing in brain circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Roux &amp; Buzsáki, 2015</xref>). In the cerebral cortex, inhibitory signaling is mediated by a large array of GABAergic interneurons (INs), which regulate the input and output of glutamatergic projection neurons (PNs), together forming dynamic ensembles of information processing and relay. Cortical INs comprise highly diverse subpopulations distinguished by their anatomical and physiological properties and gene expression profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Fishell &amp; Kepecs, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gouwens et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Huang &amp; Paul, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>). Recent single-cell RNAseq and computational analyses have delineated the hierarchical tree-like organization of cortical GABAergic neurons from subclasses and supertypes down to transcriptomic subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tasic et al., 2018</xref>)(BICCN 2021). Among these, the axo-axonic cells (AACs), or chandelier cells (ChCs), represent the most distinctive and a bona fide type, as they exclusively innervate the axon initial segments (AIS) of pyramidal neurons (PNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Somogyi, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Somogyi et al., 1982</xref>). Because AIS are the site of action potential initiation and individual AACs innervate hundreds of PNs in their vicinity, AACs are thought to exert decisive control over spike generation in ensembles of PNs (Crick 1986) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Howard et al., 2005</xref>), thereby regulating network operations and information relay. Thus, a more complete understanding of AACs will not only provide key insights into the functional organization of cortical circuits but also facilitate an integrated multi-modal definition of ground truth neuron types, shedding light on the granularity of hierarchical cell type organization. However, current knowledge on AAC distribution, connectivity, and function remains incomplete, largely due to the lack of reliable experimental tools.</p>
<p>An ideal genetic tool for studying AACs, or any other bona fide neuron type, would have two important features: specificity (targeting only AACs but no other cells) and comprehensiveness or even completeness (capturing most if not all AACs). Genetic labeling of AACs was first achieved through fate mapping neural progenitors of the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) at late embryonic stages using the <italic>Nkx2.1-CreER</italic> mouse line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Taniguchi et al., 2013</xref>). This approach has facilitated analyses of neocortical AAC subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), transcriptome profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Paul et al., 2017</xref>), connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lu et al., 2017</xref>), synapse development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ishino et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Tai et al., 2019</xref>), and activity-dependent pruning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Wang et al., 2021</xref>); it also enabled a comprehensive fate mapping of AACs across MGE neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kelly et al., 2019</xref>). However, late embryonic induction in <italic>Nkx2.1-CreER</italic> mice is not only cumbersome but also not entirely specific to AACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kelly et al., 2019</xref>), and does not capture all AACs. With the identification of several putative AAC molecular markers from scRNAseq datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Paul et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tasic et al., 2018</xref>), several gene-knockin driver lines have been generated, which have facilitated studying AACs. Yet, none of these driver lines have been shown to be specific and comprehensive. For example, the <italic>Vipr2-ires-Cre</italic> driver captures a subset of neocortical and basolateral amygdala (BLA) AACs, but is not entirely specific in these areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Daigle et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Nakashima et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tasic et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, our <italic>Unc5b-CreER</italic> line enabled AAV targeting of hippocampal AACs, but also labels endothelial cells when combined with a reporter line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dudok et al., 2021</xref>). Despite extensive effort to date, no singularly unique molecular marker for AACs has been identified. Indeed, the same is true for most if not all neuronal subtypes of the mammalian brain. Therefore, specific and comprehensive genetic access to ground truth neuron types remains a broad and major challenge in neural circuit studies.</p>
<p>Here, we leverage lineage origin and molecular markers to establish an intersectional strategy, achieving highly specific and comprehensive targeting of AACs across the mouse brain. We discovered that much beyond the neocortex, hippocampus and BLA as previously described, AACs are in fact widely distributed across all pallium-derived brain structures and beyond. These include not only the dorsal pallium-derived neocortex and medial pallium-derived hippocampal formation, but also the lateral pallium-derived claustrum-insular complex, the ventral pallium-derived extended amygdaloid complex, and olfactory centers such as piriform cortex. In addition, putative AACs are also abundant in anterior olfactory nucleus, taenia tecta and are also found in the lateral septum and the diencephalic or third-ventricle-derived hypothalamus. The comprehensive labeling of cortical AACs allowed us to quantify their areal, laminar, and axon terminal distribution as well as to describe multiple anatomic subtypes. We further extend our strategy to AAV-based targeting and map synaptic input sources to AACs in sensorimotor cortical areas, hippocampal CA1, and BLA, demonstrating feasibility for functional manipulations. Together, these results provide a brain-wide overview of AACs and their subtype variations and input sources in the cerebral cortex. Precise and comprehensive genetic access to AACs sets the stage for understanding many aspects of their role in circuit development and function across the extended brain regions. This establishes a powerful model system to study the conservation and divergence of a ground truth neuron type across different brain regions towards understanding the principles of cell type organization.</p>

<title>Lineage and marker-based intersectional targeting captures AACs across brain regions</title>
<p>The embryonic subpallium generates GABAergic neurons of the telencephalon, with the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) giving rise to AACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kelly et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Taniguchi et al., 2013</xref>) while other progenitor domains, such as the caudal ganglionic eminence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Miyoshi et al., 2015</xref>) or preoptic area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gelman et al., 2011</xref>) do not. Within the MGE <italic>Nkx2.1</italic> lineage, AACs are generated in two consecutive waves during both early and late neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kelly et al., 2019</xref>), extending our initial report of their birth pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Taniguchi et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, late embryonic induction in the <italic>Nkx2.1-CreER</italic> line only enriches a subset of neocortical AACs and also labels at least two other interneuron types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kelly et al., 2019</xref>); this strategy also misses AACs in the hippocampus, BLA, and potentially other brain areas that are born earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kelly et al. 2019</xref>). Taking a different approach based on scRNAseq analysis, we identified several putative AAC markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Paul et al., 2017</xref>) and accordingly generated <italic>Unc5b-CreER</italic> and <italic>Pthlh-Flp</italic> driver lines. However, neither by itself is fully specific to AACs: the former also labels endothelial cells and sparse cortical pyramidal neurons (data not shown), and the latter labels a subset of CGE-derived interneurons (<xref rid="figs1-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 3m-p</xref>). To purify AACs from these driver lines, we then designed an intersectional strategy that combines lineage and molecular markers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>); we tested the intersection of <italic>Nkx2.1-Flp</italic> with <italic>Unc5b-CreER</italic> as well as <italic>Nkx2.1-Cre</italic> with <italic>Pthlh-Flp</italic>. We expected that the constitutive <italic>Nkx2.1-Flp</italic> or <italic>Cre</italic> line would cover the entire output from MGE, including all AACs, and the intersection with postmitotic markers would specifically capture AACs.</p>

<p>We first combined <italic>Nkx2.1-Flp</italic> and <italic>Unc5b-CreER</italic> driver lines with an <italic>Ai65</italic> intersectional reporter allele to generate <italic>Unc5b-CreER;Nkx2.1-Flp;Ai65</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). Tamoxifen induction (TM) allows dose-dependent titration of AAC labeling density, allowing the characterization of global distribution patterns <italic>en masse</italic> with high dose as well as the evaluation of individual cell morphologies with sparser labeling by lower dose (see methods). Indeed, postnatal high dose TM induction generated dense and highly characteristic AAC labeling patterns throughout the neocortex, hippocampus, and BLA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d-g</xref>). The characteristic chandelier axon arbor morphology with strings of synaptic boutons (“cartridges”) along the AIS of pyramidal neurons unequivocally indicated their AAC identity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, <xref rid="figs1-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1-3</xref>).</p>
<p>Surprisingly, cell labeling extended much beyond these three previously reported structures that contain AACs. As the AAC identity of labeled cell are validated in most but not all these structures, we tentatively call some of these putative AACs (pAACs). Extensive analysis of these brain regions revealed an overarching pattern: AACs and pAACs are abundantly present in essentially all pallium-derived structures and several additional structures (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1c-g</xref>, <xref rid="figs1-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1-2</xref>, Supplemental movie 1). The dorsal pallium (dPAL)-derived structures include the entire neocortex and entorhinal/ectorhinal cortices. The medial pallium (mPAL)-derived structures include the entire hippocampal formation. Beyond these previously known structures, pAACs are abundant in lateral pallium (lPAL)-derived claustrum, insular, and endopiriform dorsal. In addition, the ventral pallium (vPAL)-derived structures include most of the amygdaloid complex (cortical amygdala, basolateral and basomedial amygdala, and medial amygdala) and extended amygdala (bed nucleus of stria terminalis). Most surprisingly, AACs are highly abundant in a set of olfactory centers including piriform cortex, anterior olfactory nucleus, and taenia tecta. Among these, the piriform derives from the vPAL while AON and TTd derive from septum neuroepithelium. Finally, pAACs are found in lateral septum (also derived from septum neuroepithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Magno et al., 2022</xref>) and parts of the hypothalamus (derived largely from neuroepithelium of the third ventricle).</p>

<caption><title>Brain-wide distribution pattern of putative AACsI</title></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="566059v1_tbl1.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</table-wrap>
<p>Consistent with these findings, the <italic>Pthlh-Flp;Nkx2.1-Cre;Ai65</italic> mice were found to have a similar overall pattern of pAAC distribution across different brain regions, with several differences (<xref rid="figs1-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). First, this intersection also labeled a set of layer 4 interneurons in the somatosensory cortex (<xref rid="figs1-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 3f</xref>). Second, <italic>Pthlh;Nkx2.1</italic> yielded slightly higher cell targeting in retrosplenial cortex (<xref rid="figs1-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 3h-i</xref>). Third, <italic>Pthlh;Nkx2.1</italic> labelled fewer cells in the AON and BST). As an additional application of the <italic>Pthlh-Flp</italic> line, we demonstrate that when combined with an inducible <italic>Nkx2.1-CreER</italic> driver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Taniguchi et al., 2013</xref>) the <italic>Pthlh-Flp;Nkx2.1-CreER;Ai65</italic> mice led to exclusive fate mapping of AACs (<xref rid="figs1-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 3j-l</xref>). The overall similarity between <italic>Unc5b/Nkx2.1</italic> and <italic>Pthlh/Nkx2.1</italic> patterns, and high density of cells captured, provided independent evidence that these intersectional approaches may have captured most if not all AACs in the brain.</p>
<p>In addition to targeting AACs, the <italic>Pthlh-Flp</italic> is a useful tool for at least two additional cell types. First, consistent with its expression in a set of CGE-derived interneurons (including VIP-expressing cells), intersection with the <italic>VIP-Cre</italic> driver line, which alone expresses in other cell types, was highly-specific for an interneuron subtype with striking vertical morphology that may represent interneuron-selective cells (<xref rid="figs1-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 3m-p</xref>). Second, <italic>Pthlh/Nkx2.1</italic> intersection yielded dense labeling of striatal interneurons (i.e. striatal neurons without axons in SNr/GPi) (<xref rid="figs1-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 3f-h</xref>), consistent with known <italic>Pthlh</italic> expression in striatal PV interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Munoz-Manchado et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, our lineage and marker intersections combining <italic>Nkx2.1-Flp/Cre,</italic> or <italic>CreER</italic> with <italic>Unc5b-CreER</italic> or <italic>Pthlh-Flp</italic> appear to have achieved unprecedented specificity and comprehensiveness of AAC targeting. To validate this result, in the following sections, we present more detailed and quantitative descriptions of AACs and pAACs across brain structures.</p>

<p>Previous studies have identified ChCs in multiple neocortical areas and cortical layers with the observation of several morphological variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kelly et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Somogyi et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Taniguchi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), but the global and quantitative distribution of ChC across the cerebral cortex and cortical layers is unknown. To first validate the specificity of our method to ChCs, we used single low dose TM induction to sparsely label individual cells across cortical areas (<xref rid="figs2-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2— figure supplement 1</xref>). Combined with immunolabeling of AnkyrinG-stained pyramidal neuron (PN) AIS, we showed that the vast majority of RFP<sup>+</sup> cells (97.3%, n=110 cells from 6 mice) had axonal cartridge structure with synaptic boutons along PN AIS, validating their ChC identity (<xref rid="figs2-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2— figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>
<p>To systematically map and quantify ChC distribution across the entire cerebral cortex, we then used high dose TM induction in <italic>Unc5b-CreER;Nkx2.1-Flp;Ai65</italic> mice to densely label ChCs and performed serial 2-photon tomography (STP) across the entire mouse brain at 50um intervals (Supplemental movie 1). The whole brain STP datasets were then registered to the Allen CCFv3 atlas, followed by segmentation of anatomical regions and an automated cell detection algorithm was applied to identify and quantify labeled cells in each region (Ragan et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2017; Matho et al., 2021). ChCs were detected across all areas of cerebral cortex (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>; Supplemental movie 1). Normalized cell density analysis revealed area-specific patterns (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). The highest densities were observed in ventrolateral areas such as PERI, ECT, TEA, and AI as well as ventromedially in ILA (see appendix for abbreviations). There was a slight decline in ChC density very rostrally in FRP or caudally in RSP.</p>

<p>We further mapped ChC distribution across cortical layers in several sensory and motor areas (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c, d</xref>). The majority of ChC somas were located in L2/3, though this was area specific, with normalized density ranging from the lowest in SSs (65.5±0.6%) to highest in VISp (94.7±1.0%). An analysis of relative cortical depth (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2e</xref>) revealed that ∼80% of ChCs occupied a narrow band just below the L1/2 border, though this varied by anterior-posterior location. Nevertheless, ChCs were found at nearly all cortical depths, with a sizable proportion forming a second, less dense band above the white matter tract. This largely “bilaminar” pattern was highly evident in certain areas such as the SSp (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2f</xref>).</p>
<p>To more systematically sample the morphological variations of ChCs, we used low dose TM induction to resolve individual cells across areas (<xref rid="figs2-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We identified all the previously described laminar and morphological subtypes (Wang 2019), including supragranular (L2/3) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2g</xref>), infragranular (L5/6) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2h</xref>), and inverted (axon arbors extend above cell soma). Notably, we found rather frequent bi-laminar and tri-laminar subtypes–L2/3 ChCs extending their axon arbors not only locally but further down to another one or two deep layers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2i</xref>). These translaminar ChCs may coordinate PN ensembles between cortical layers. The abundance of translaminar ChCs varied among cortical areas, e.g. with high abundance in auditory cortex (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2j</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to soma position and cell morphology, we sought to map the distribution of ChC axon terminals (i.e. cartridges) throughout the mouse cortex. For this purpose, we used a Cre/Flp-dependent reporter line expressing a synaptophysin-EGFP fusion protein and cytoplasmic tdTomato (Niederkofler et al., 2016) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2k-l</xref>). Following high-dose induction and dense labeling, we performed whole brain STP imaging and calculated cartridge density across ARAv3 areas (see Methods). ChC cartridges exhibited a wide range of densities across areas and layers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2m</xref>), with overall similarity to ChC soma densities in those areas and layers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). Plotting the relative laminar depth for ChC cartridges in each area (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2n</xref>) revealed characteristic patterns of population-level laminar innervation onto PNs.</p>

<title>AACs in the hippocampus</title>
<p>Decades of studies of hippocampal AACs using traditional anatomical and physiological methods have implicated their role in network oscillations, including sharp waves and epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fitzgerald et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Klausberger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Viney et al., 2013</xref>) but the quantitative distribution of AACs across hippocampal formation has remained unknown, and reliable genetic access to hippocampal ACCs is not well established. We applied <italic>Unc5b/Nkx2.1</italic> intersectional targeting and STP to map AAC distribution throughout hippocampal compartments. Single cell labeling by low-dose tamoxifen and immunohistochemistry confirmed that the vast majority (98.2%, n=56 cells, 6 mice) were AACs, characterized by vertically-oriented cross laminar apical dendrites in CA1-CA3 and axon terminals innervating PN AIS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a-b, d</xref>). Dense labeling with high dose TM followed by cell density analysis revealed that AAC density was, surprisingly, highest in CA2 and lowest in dentate gyrus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>), with density in CA1 and CA3 approximately equal. Only a very sparse population of AAC was labelled in dentate gyrus. Overall AAC density in CA2 was 3-4 fold greater than CA1/CA3 and 13-fold greater than DG (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>). As the density of PNs across hippocampal areas are overall similar, this result suggests substantially different AAC-PN innervation ratio and that AACs may exert much denser and likely stronger control of CA2 PNs than CA1/CA3 PNs or DG granule cells.</p>

<title>AACs in anterior insular, claustrum, and dorsal endopiriform nuclei</title>
<p>According to the updated tetrapartite model of pallial/cortical development (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>), the lateral pallium gives rise to the claustro-insular complex as well as the dorsal endopiriform nuclei (EPd) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Puelles, 2017</xref>). Our brain wide imaging of <italic>Unc5b-CreER;Nkx2.1-Flp;Ai65</italic> mice revealed pAACs deployed across these three regions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>). Unlike cortical and hippocampal AACs whose axon arbors exhibit highly characteristic laminar pattern, reflecting the organization of their postsynaptic targets (i.e. AIS of PNs), the axon arbors of RFP cells in AI, CLA, EPd do not show clear laminar patterns and exhibit less uniformity and are more multipolar in morphology (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4b-c</xref>), making it more difficult to ascertain their identity. Nevertheless, strings of synaptic boutons were frequently identified that co-localized with AnkG labeled AIS, suggesting these as pAACs. Quantification from dense labeling revealed higher pAAC density in EPd compared to claustrum and EPv, the latter of which structure is derived from ventral pallium (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4d</xref>).</p>

<title>AACs in the amygdaloid complex and extended amygdala</title>
<p>The amygdaloid complex includes over a dozen nuclei and can be segregated into 5 groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Beyeler &amp; Dabrowska, 2020</xref>): 1) the basolateral amygdala (BLA) divided into a dorsal section (lateral amygdala, LA) and basal section (basal amygdala, BA), 2) the basomedial amygdala (BMA), 3) the central amygdala (CeA) further splits into medial, lateral, and central sections (CeM, CeL, and CeC), 4) the medial amygdala (MeA), and 5) the cortical amygdala (CoA). Furthermore, the CeM extends rostrally and medially, thereby including the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BST) to form the extended amygdala. Based on developmental origin, connectivity, and gene expression, these groups can be assigned into two large categories: pallium-derived cortex-like structures and subpallium-derived basal ganglia-like structures. The former includes BLA, CoA, BMA, and MeA, while the latter includes CeA and BST. Within the amygdala nuclei, projection neurons are exclusively glutamatergic in BLA, CoA, BMA, exclusively GABAergic in CeA, and predominantly GABAergic in MeA and BST. In rodents, there is also a population of GLU PNs (derived from third ventricle neuroepithelium) that populates the BST, MeA, and hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Garcia-Moreno et al., 2010</xref>; Huilgol and Tole, 2016).</p>
<p>In this context, we found AACs or pACCs in all the amygdala nuclei containing GLU PNs, i.e. except CeA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4i-h</xref>). Sparse labelling and immunohistochemical co-staining with AnkG confirmed that the labeled cells in these compartments were nearly exclusively AIS-targeting (97.2%, n=36 cells, 6 mice). Morphologically, AACs in the amygdala tended to be similar to those in the claustrum, exhibiting multipolar dendrites and multipolar axon terminal branches (in contrast to axon arbor of cortical AACs that typically extend either below or above the soma) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4f</xref>). The density of AACs in amygdala appears to correlate with the known abundance of GLU PNs: densities in BLA, CoA, BMA were much higher than those in MeA and BST. Among the pallium-derived amygdala subdivisions (LA, BLA, BMA, PA), AACs were present at roughly similar densities (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4i</xref>), while among striatum-like amygdala nuclei they were largely concentrated in MeA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4j</xref>). Our results indicate that AACs are deployed to all amygdala nuclei containing GLU PNs. Within the largely GABAergic structures such as MeA and BST, we hypothesize that pAACs might innervate the minor glutamatergic PNs in these structures.</p>

<title>AACs in olfactory centers: piriform cortex, AON, TTd</title>
<p>A major novel finding is the surprising abundance of ACCs across multiple olfactory centers. Derived from the ventral pallium, the piriform cortex had been reported to contain axo-axonic synapses by co-localization of the inhibitory presynaptic marker GAT1 and AnkG (Wang and Sun, 2012). Our dense labelling in <italic>Unc5b-CreER;Nkx2.1-Flp;Ai65</italic> mice revealed a striking abundance of AACs that span the anterior-medial extent of the piriform in a single layer (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a-c</xref>). Sparse labeled single AACs exhibited characteristic morphologies analogous to L2/3 AACs of the neocortex, with extended branching of apical dendrites to L1 and dense axon arbors below the cell body forming cartridges along PN AIS (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5d-j</xref>). The single layer distribution pattern of piriform AACs continued dorsally to the insular cortex and ventrally to piriform-amygdala area (PAA) and COA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref>).</p>

<p>Furthermore, we found that AACs are deployed to two other olfactory centers that derive from outside of the four pallial domains: namely the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON) and taenia tecta (TT) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a-b</xref>). Though exhibiting a range of different morphologies, AACs in all three areas resemble those of L2/3 neocortex, with apical dendrites often extending to the pia and basally-oriented axon arbors; their somata are located at the upper border of the pyramidal cell layer in the case of TT and AON (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6c-g</xref>). Overall, AACs in piriform, TT, and AON exhibited higher density than AACs in cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6h</xref>, see Extended Data for <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).</p>

<title>Monosynaptic input tracing to AACs in sensorimotor cortex</title>
<p>In addition to using Cre AND Flp-dependent reporter lines for AAC access, it is advantageous to extend our intersectional strategy to engage viral vectors that enable more selective and anatomy-based labeling, recording, and manipulation. Because the endogenous expression of <italic>Unc5b</italic> and <italic>Nkx2.1</italic> occur at non-overlapping stages in development, it is not feasible to directly use Cre-AND-Flp dependent viral vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Fenno et al., 2020</xref>).

Interestingly, we identified sparse inputs from GPe directly to ChCs and PV in all three cortical areas. Overall input patterns were comparable between ChCs and PV, although ChCs received significantly less homotypic inputs from the contralateral hemisphere for each injection site (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7e-g</xref>).</p>

<title>Monosynaptic input tracing to AACs in CA1</title>
<p>The functional role of AACs is perhaps best understood in hippocampus, where CA3 AACs tend to fire at distinct epochs compared to other cell types and near the peak of theta oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Viney et al., 2013</xref>). Little is known about the inputs to AACs that might drive this cell-type functional distinction, although non-specific tracers have identified an inhibitory connection from medial septum (MS) to AACs in CA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Viney et al., 2013</xref>).

<title>Specific and comprehensive targeting of ground truth cell types</title>
<p>A major challenge in studying the functional organization of GABAergic inhibitory circuits, and neural circuits in general, is establishing specific and comprehensive genetic access to ground truth cell types. Here, leveraging an intersectional strategy that integrates lineage and molecular markers, we have achieved near-perfect specificity and near-complete comprehensiveness in targeting a bona fide interneuron type. This strategy will facilitate studying the connectivity, function, and development of AACs across brain regions, thereby providing a robust experimental platform for integrating multi-modal analysis of a ground truth cell type across brain circuits. A practical drawback of this approach is the requirement of combining three engineered genetic alleles. In this context, the <italic>Unc5b-CreER</italic> line by itself is already useful for AAV-mediated targeting of AACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dudok et al., 2021</xref>). Because most AAVs are neurotrophic, Cre-activated AAVs would bypass endothelial cells to target only AACs in the <italic>Unc5b-CreER</italic> line, even though this approach is not suited to quantify brain-wide AAC patterns. Beyond relying on germline engineering, the recently invented CellREADR technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Qian et al., 2022</xref>) will further simplify AAC targeting by identifying an RNA sensor of <italic>Unc5b</italic> mRNA and deliver it with an AAV vector. As <italic>Unc5b</italic> is a conserved AAC marker from rodents to primates including humans, the CellREADR approach may enable genetic access to AACs across mammalian species.</p>

<sec id="s3b">
<title>Implications of brain-wide AAC distribution pattern</title>
<p>The initial discovery of neocortical AACs was based on their striking chandelier-like morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Szentágothai, 1975</xref>), reflecting the spatial arrangement of their exclusive synaptic targets – the AIS of cortical pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Somogyi, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Somogyi et al., 1982</xref>). This defining feature of synapse specificity led to subsequent discoveries of AACs in the hippocampus and BLA. These findings have relied on meticulous efforts of skilled neuroanatomists to correctly identify AACs, mostly post hoc, by synapse specificity at AIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bienvenu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Veres et al., 2014</xref>). Since then, it has been widely assumed that AACs are restricted to these brain structures, and likely to the mammalian species. Here, based on developmental lineage and key molecular markers that likely include all AACs, our results reveal a vastly expanded and likely complete brain distribution pattern of AACs. Most importantly, we found that pAACs are deployed to the entire pallium-derived brain structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Puelles, 2017</xref>), including not only the dPAL-derived neocortex and mPAL-derived hippocampal formation, but also the lPAL-derived claustrum-insular complex, the vPAL-derived extended amygdaloid complex, piriform cortex, and other olfactory centers such as AON, taenia tecta. In addition, subregions of the lateral septum and hypothalamus also contain pAACs.</p>
<p>Among the pallium-derived structures, the density of AACs vary substantially within and across regions. For example, within the neocortex, ChCs are highest in perirhinal and lowest in retrosplenial cortex. Across cortical layers, AACs are highly concentrated in L2, enriched in L5/6, and significantly less abundant in middle layers. Consistent with these results, the number and density of GABAergic synapses at AIS also vary substantially among different PyNs within and across cortical layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">DeFelipe et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Fish et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Schneider-Mizell et al., 2021</xref>). Similar variations are seen across the hippocampal formation, where CA2 exhibit the highest and DG the lowest density. It is also possible that these regional differences might reflect the distinction of PN types and/or their inherent physiological and connectivity properties that might require different levels and ratio of AAC control.</p>
<p>In particular, the finding of a striking abundance of AACs in olfactory centers across piriform cortex, AON, taenia tecta suggests strong inhibitory regulation of PNs at AIS in these regions. Although the functional significance is not yet clear, the simpler circuit architecture and strong link to innate rodent behaviors of these olfactory centers may facilitate uncovering the logic of AAC function. Furthermore, as these olfactory circuits are evolutionarily preserved across vertebrate species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zeppilli et al., 2023</xref>), our finding raises the possibility that AACs might be present in the CNS of other vertebrates, beyond the mammalian brain.</p>
<p>Notably, although the MeA and BST comprise mostly GABAergic neurons that are primarily generated from the subpallium, they contain subsets of glutamatergic projection neuron that migrate from pallium origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Beyeler &amp; Dabrowska, 2020</xref>) or from the third ventricle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Garcia-Moreno et al., 2010</xref>). The true AAC identity in these regions, and in several other regions such as the hypothalamus, remains to be validated by synapse innervation at AIS of GLU PNs. Nevertheless, based on current results, our overarching hypothesis is that AACs are deployed across all pallium-derived structures to control the AIS of GLU PNs, including those in MeA and BST. Our results also indicate that AACs are absent from the rest of the CNS. This finding suggests a major distinction between the physiology and functional organization of pallium-derived GLU PNs versus those in other CNS regions.</p>

<title>AACs as a model for understanding neuronal cell type organization across regions and species</title>
<p>The rapid scaling of single cell RNA sequencing enables the generation of massive transcriptome datasets across brain regions and species (Trygve E. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bakken et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hain et al., 2022</xref>). These datasets provide unprecedented opportunities to discover the organization and relationship of cell types within and across brain regions, which reflect their gene regulatory programs and developmental origin. Cross species analyses promise to further reveal the evolutionary conservation and divergence of brain cell types (T. E. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bakken et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Tosches, 2021</xref>). However, transcriptomic cell homologies between brain regions and species, especially more distantly related regions and species, are often discernible only at a relatively coarse level and do not fully capture the biological complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Tosches, 2021</xref>). A major challenge is to evaluate statistically defined transcriptomic similarity against biological ground truth, such as anatomic connectivity and developmental relationship. In this context, the most appealing attribute of AACs is their singularly defining synapse specificity at AIS of GLU PNs, which can be readily measured and validated. Under this overarching connectivity-based definition, all other molecular and phenotypic variations can be assessed and organized accordingly regardless of brain regions and species. Therefore, genetic access to AACs across brain regions provides a rare and compelling ground truth platform that can unambiguously identify this cell type across regions and species. This will further facilitate transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis to discover the gene regulatory program of AACs, and contribute to understanding the principles of cell type organization by linking developmental genetic program, circuit connectivity and function, and evolutionary trajectory.</p>

Mice with Unc5b-CreER were induced by tamoxifen i.p. (TM; Sigma-Aldrich, Cat# T5648) administered either 1) for dense labelling and input tracing, 100mg/kg for five consecutive days starting at P55-60 2) for single cell labeling, 25mg/kg for 1-2 consecutive days at P55-P60. Animals were fed ad libitum and their health status were routinely monitored. Both male and female animals were used in all experiments, with 3-4 mice total for each injection site x genotype and for cell distribution analysis.

Sections were washed three times in PBS and incubated for 2h at room temperature with corresponding secondary antibodies, Goat or Donkey Alexa Fluor 488, 568 or 647 (1:500, Life Technologies) and DAPI to label nuclei (1:1000 in PBS, Life Technologies, Cat# 33342). Sections were washed three times with PBS and dry-mounted on slides using Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech, Cat# 0100-01) mounting medium. Primary antibodies used were Anti-AnkryinG (1:500, Neuromab, Cat#: 75-146), Anti-ChAT (1:300, Millipore, Cat#: AB144P), Anti-EAAC1 (1:500, Millipore, Cat#: AB1520), Anti-GABA (1:500, Sigma-Aldrich, Cat#: A2052), Anti-GFP (1:1000, Aves Labs, Cat#: 1020), Anti-parvalbumin (1:1000, Sigma-Aldrich, Cat#: P3088), Anti-Phospho-IκBα (1:500, Cell Signaling Technology, Cat#: 2859), Anti-RFP (1:1000, Rockland, Cat#: 600-401-379). Samples for AAC validation were collected from 6 mice given 25mg/kg for 1-2 consecutive days, as described above.</p>

<title>Floating section two-color in situ hybridization</title>
<p>In situ hybridization was performed using hybridization chain reaction (HCR v3.0, Molecular Instruments). Samples post-fixed in 4% PFA at 4°C were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose solution in RNAse-free PBS (DEPC-PBS) at 4°C for 48 hr, frozen in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. Compound (Sakura), and stored at –80°C until sectioning. 50 µm thick coronal floating sections were collected into a sterile 24-well plate in DEPC-PBS, fixed again briefly for 5 min in 4% PFA, then placed in 70% EtOH in DEPC-PBS overnight. Sections were rinsed in DEPC-PBS, incubated for 45 min in 5% SDS in DEPC-PBS, rinsed and incubated in 2x SSCT, pre-incubated in HCR hybridization buffer at 37°C, and then placed in HCR hybridization buffer containing RNA probes overnight at 37°C. The next day, sections were rinsed 4 × 15 min at 37°C in HCR probe wash buffer, rinsed with 2X SSCT, pre-incubated with HCR amplification buffer, then incubated in HCR amplification buffer containing HCR amplifiers at room temperature for ∼24 hr. On the final day, sections were rinsed in 2x SSCT, rinsed again with 2x SSCT, then mounted on slides and coverslipped with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech).</p>

<title>Viruses</title>
<p>To construct AAVDJ-TRE3g-TVA-oG-eGFP, TVA, the optimized rabies glycoprotein oG (Kim et al., 2016), and eGFP were linked by ‘self-cleaving’ 2A and P2A peptides and cloned into pAAV-TRE3G (Sacha Nelson). For AAVDJ-TRE3g-eGFP only eGFP was cloned. AAVs serotype DJ were packaged by a commercial vector core facility (Vigene). Genomic titers of AAVDJ-TRE3g-TVA-oG-eGFP and AAVDJ-TRE3g-eGFP were 9.24 × 10<sup>12</sup> gc/ml and 5.0 × 10<sup>12</sup> gc/ml, respectively. TVA, oG, and eGFP were subcloned from AAV-hSyn-FLEX-TVA-P2A-EGFP-2A-oG (Addgene, Cat# 85225). AAVs were diluted 1:5 in 1x PBS immediately prior to use. EnvA-pseudotyped G-Deleted Rabies dsRedXpress was purchased from Salk Institute (5.0 × 107 titer units (TU)/ml).</p>

<title>Stereotactic viral injections</title>
<p>Adult mice were anaesthetized with 2% isofluorane delivered by constant air flow (0.4 L/min). Analgesics ketoprofen (5 mg/kg) and dexamethasone (0.5 mg/kg) were administered subcutaneously just prior to sugery, while lidocaine (2-4 mg/kg) was applied intra-inciscionally. Mice were mounted on a stereotaxic headframe (Kopf Instruments, 940 series or Leica Biosystems, Angle Two) and stereotactic coordinates identified as follows, (MOs): 2.25mm anterior to bregma, 1.2mm lateral, 0.3mm in depth; (MOp): 0.5mm anterior to bregma, 1.6mm lateral, 0.3mm in depth; (SSp): 1.12mm posterior to bregma, 3.25mm lateral, 0.3mm in depth; (CA1): 1.94mm posterior to bregma, 1.4mm lateral, 1.4mm in depth ; (BLA): 1.9mm posterior to bregma, 3.38mm lateral, 4.76mm in depth. An incision was made over the scalp, a small burr hole drilled in the skull and brain surface exposed. A pulled glass pipette with a tip of 20–30 µm containing virus was lowered into the brain. Virus was delivered at a rate of 30nL/min using a Picospritzer (General Valve Corp) for a total volume of 100-150nL for starter AAV and 300-400nL for rabies virus. The pipette remained in place for 10 min prior to retraction to prevent backflow, after which the incision was closed with 5/0 nylon suture thread (Ethilon Nylon Suture Ethicon) or Tissueglue (3M Vetbond). Mice were kept warm on a heating pad until complete recovery. For input tracing experiments, <italic>Unc5b-CreER; Nkx2.1-Flp; dual-tTA2</italic> (tamoxifen-induced as described above) and <italic>PV-Cre; Nkx2.1-Flp; dual-tTA2</italic> were injected at respective coordinates with AAVDJ-TRE3g-TVA-oG-eGFP at P75±2. After a 2-3 week incubation period, a second injection at the same coordinates was performed using EnvA-pseudotyped G-Deleted Rabies-dsRedXpress. Following another 7 day incubation mice were perfused as described above.</p>

<title>Whole-brain STP tomography and image analysis</title>
<p>We used the whole-brain STP tomography pipeline described previously (Ragan et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2017; Matho et al., 2021). Perfused and post-fixed brains were embedded in 4% oxidized-agarose in 0.05 M PB, cross-linked in 0.2% sodium borohydrate solution (in 0.05 M sodium borate buffer, pH 9.0–9.5). The entire brain was imaged coronally with a 20× Olympus XLUMPLFLN20XW lens (NA 1.0) on a TissueCyte 1000 (Tissuevision) with a Chameleon Ultrafast-2 Ti:Sapphire laser (Coherent). EGFP/EYFP or tdTomato/dsRedXpress signals were excited at 910 nm or 920 nm, respectively. Whole-brain image sets were acquired as series of 12 (x) × 16 (y) tiles with 1 µm × 1 µm sampling for 230–270 z sections with a 50-µm z-step size. Images were collected by two PMTs (PMT, Hamamatsu, R3896), for signal and autofluorescent background, using a 560-nm dichroic mirror (Chroma, T560LPXR) and band-pass filters (Semrock FF01-680/SP-25). The image tiles were corrected to remove illumination artifacts along the edges and stitched as a grid sequence. Image processing was completed using ImageJ/FIJI and Adobe/Photoshop software with linear level and nonlinear curve adjustments applied only to entire images. Registration of brain-wide datasets to the Allen reference Common Coordinate Framework version 3 (CCFv3) was performed by 3D affine registration followed by a 3D B-spline registration using Elastix software (Klein et al., 2010), according to established parameters. Somata labelled by Ai65-tdtomato or rabies-dsRedXpress and catridges labelled by synaptotagmin-EGFP were automatically detected by a convolutional network trained as described previously (Ragan et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2017; Matho et al., 2021). For AAC laminar depth, somata and cartridge coordinates were overlaid on a mask for relative cortical depth, as described. For area cell density and cortical depth analysis, we registered each dataset, reporting cells detected in each brain structure without warping the imaging channel.</p>
<p>All cell density quantifications are reported as mean cells per cubic µm ± SEM from n=4 mice.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this manuscript, the authors set out to develop genetic tools that can specifically and comprehensively label Axo-Axonic Cells (AACs), also known as Chandelier cells. These AACs possess unique morphological and connectivity features, making them an ideal subject for studying various aspects of cell types across different experimental methods. To achieve both specificity and comprehensiveness in AAC labeling, the authors employ an intersectional strategy that combines lineage origin and molecular markers. This approach successfully targets AACs across the mouse brain and reveals their widespread distribution in various brain structures beyond the previously known regions. Additionally, the authors utilize rabies transneuronal labeling to provide a comprehensive overview of AACs, their variations, and input sources throughout the brain. This experimental approach offers a powerful model system for investigating the role of AACs in circuit development and function across diverse brain regions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Genetic Tools and Specificity: The authors' genetic tools show qualitative evidence of specificity for AACs, opening new avenues for targeted research on these cells. The use of intersectional strategies enhances the precision of AAC labeling.</p>
<p>Widespread Distribution: The study significantly broadens our understanding of AAC distribution, revealing their presence in brain regions beyond what was previously documented. This expanded knowledge is a valuable contribution to the field.</p>
<p>Transneuronal Labeling: The inclusion of rabies transneuronal labeling provides a comprehensive view of AACs, their variations, and input sources, allowing for a more holistic understanding of their role in neural circuits.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Quantitative Analysis: While the claim of specificity appears qualitatively convincing, the manuscript could be improved with more quantitative analysis.</p>
<p>Comprehensiveness Claim: The assertion of comprehensiveness, implying labeling &quot;almost all&quot; AACs in all brain regions, is challenging to substantiate conclusively. Acknowledging the limitations of proving complete comprehensiveness and discussing them in the discussion section would be more appropriate than asserting it in the results section.</p>
<p>Local Inputs: While the manuscript focuses on inter-areal inputs to AACs, it would benefit from exploring local inputs as well. Identifying the local neurons that target AACs and analyzing their patterns could provide valuable insights into AAC function within specific brain regions.</p>
<p>Discussion Focus: The discussion section should delve deeper into the biological implications of the findings, moving beyond technical significance. Exploring similarities and differences in input patterns between AACs and other cell types, and linking them to the locations of starter cells or specific connectivity patterns in the brain, would enrich the discussion. For instance, investigating whether input patterns can be predicted based on the locations of starter cells or connectivity specificity could provide valuable insights.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The goals of this study were to develop a genetic approach that would specifically and comprehensively target axo-axonic cells (AACs) throughout the brain and then to describe the patterns and characteristics of the targeted AACs in multiple, selected brain regions. The investigators have been successful in providing the most complete description of the regional distribution of putative (pAACs) throughout the brain to date. The supporting evidence is convincing, even though incomplete in some brain regions. The findings should serve as a guide for more detailed studies of AACs within each brain region and lead to new insights into the connectivity and functional organization of this important group of GABAergic interneurons.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The study has numerous strengths. A major strength is the development of a unique intersectional genetic strategy that uses cell lineage (Nkx2.1) and molecular (Unc5b or Pthlh) markers to identify axo-axonic AACs specifically and, apparently, nearly completely throughout the mouse brain. While AACs have been described previously in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala, there has been no specific genetic marker that selectively identifies all AACs in these regions.</p>
<p>The current genetic strategy has labeled pAACs in a large number of additional brain regions, including the claustrum-insular complex, extended amygdala, and several olfactory centers. In general, the findings provide support for the specificity of the methods for targeting AACs, and include some examples of labeling near markers of axon initial segments. However, the Investigators are careful to refer to labeled neurons as &quot;putative AACs&quot; as they have not been fully characterized and their identity verified.</p>
<p>The descriptions and numerous low-magnification images of the brain provide a roadmap for subsequent, detailed studies of AACs in numerous brain regions. The overview and summaries of the findings in the Abstract, Introduction, and Discussion are particularly clear and helpful in placing the extensive regional descriptions of AACs in context.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
One weakness of the study is the lack of an illustration of the high-resolution cell labeling that can be achieved with the methods, including labeling of numerous rows of axon terminals in contact with axon initial segments. The initial images of the brain-wide distribution of putative AACs are necessarily presented at low magnification. Although the authors indicate that the cells have &quot;highly characteristic AAC labeling patterns throughout the neocortex, hippocampus and BLA&quot;, these morphological details cannot be visualized by the reader at the current magnification, even when the images are enlarged on the computer screen. Some of the details become evident in later Figures, but an initial illustration of single cell labeling with confocal microscopy, or tracing of their characteristic axonal arbors, would support the specificity of the labeling in the low magnification images.</p>
<p>Table 1 indicates that the AAC identity of the cells has been validated in many brain regions but not in all. The methods used for validation have not been described and should be included for completeness. The authors are careful to acknowledge that labeled cells in some regions have not been validated and refer to such cells as pAACs.</p>
<p>The intersectional genetic methods included the use of the lineage marker Nkx2.1 with either Unc5b or Pthlh as the molecular marker. As described, the mice with intersectional targeting of Nkx2.1 and Unc5b appear to show the most specific brain-wide labeling for AACs, and the majority of the descriptions are from these mice. The targeting with Nkx2.1 and Pthlh is less convincing. The title for Figure 1 Supplemental Figure 3 suggests a similar AAC distribution in the Pthlh;Nkx2.1 mouse compared to the Unc5b;Nkx2.1 mouse. However, the descriptions of the individual panels suggest a number of inconsistencies and non-AAC labeling. The heavy labeling in the caudate and cells in layer 4 is particularly problematic. Based on the data presented, it appears that heavy labeling achieved in these mice could not be relied on for specific labeling of all AACs, although specific labeling could be achieved under some conditions, such as following tamoxifen administration at select ages.</p>
<p>The methods described for dense labeling and single-cell labeling are described briefly in the methods. Some discussion of the development of the methods would be useful, including how it was determined that methods for heavy labeling identified AACs specifically and completely.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Raudales et al. aimed at providing an insight into the brain-wide distribution and synaptic connectivity of bona fide GABAergic inhibitory interneuron subtypes focusing on the axo-axonic cell (AAC), one of the most distinctive interneuron subtypes, which innervates the axon initial segments of glutamatergic projection neurons. They establish intersectional genetic strategies that enable them to specifically and comprehensively capture AACs based on their lineage (Nkx2.1) and marker expression (Unc5b, Pthlh). They find that AACs are deployed across essentially all the pallium-derived brain structures as well as the anterior olfactory nucleus, taenia tecta, and lateral septum. They show that AACs in distinct areas and layers of the neocortex as well as different subregions of the hippocampal formation display unique soma and synaptic density and morphological variations. Rabies virus-based retrograde monosynaptic input tracing reveals that AACs in the neocortex, the hippocampus, and the basolateral amygdala receive synaptic inputs from common as well as specific brain regions and supports the utility of this novel genetic approach. This study elucidates brain-wide neuroanatomical features and morphological variations of AACs with solid techniques and analysis. Their novel AAC-targeting strategies will facilitate the study of their development and function in different brain regions. The conclusions in this paper are well supported by the data. However, there are a few comments to strengthen this study.</p>
<p>1. The definition of putative AAC (pAAC) is unclear and Table 1 may not be accurate. Although the authors find synaptic cartridges of RFP-labeled cells in the claustro-insular complex and the dorsal endopiriform nuclei, they still consider these cells as pAACs (not validated). The authors claim that without examining the presence of synaptic cartridges, RFP-labeled cells in the hypothalamus and the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis (BNST) are pAACs while those in the L4 of the somatosensory cortex in Pthlh;Nkx2.1;Ai65 mice are non-AACs. In Table 1, the BNST is supposed to contain AACs (validated), but in the text, the authors claim that RFP-labeled cells in the BNST are pAACs. Could the authors clarify how AACs, pAACs, and non-AACs are defined?</p>
<p>2. The intersectional strategies presented in this study could also specifically capture developing AACs. If so, how early are AACs labeled in the brain? It would also be nice if the authors could add a simple schematic like Fig. 1a showing the time course of Pthlh expression.</p>
