<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The medial habenula (mHb)/interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) circuitry is resident to divergent molecular, neurochemical and cellular components which, in concert, perform computations to drive emotion, reward and addiction behaviors. Although housing one of the most prominent mu opioid receptor (mOR) expression levels in the brain, remarkably little is known as to how they impact mHb/IPN circuit function at the granular level. In this study, our systematic functional and pharmacogenetic analyses demonstrate that mOR activation attenuates glutamatergic signaling whilst producing an opposing potentiation of glutamatergic/cholinergic co-transmission mediated by mHb substance P and cholinergic neurons, respectively. Intriguingly, this latter non-canonical augmentation is developmentally regulated only emerging during later postnatal stages. Further, specific potassium channels act as a molecular brake on nicotinic receptor signaling in the IPN with the opioid mediated potentiation of this arm of neurotransmission being operational only following attenuation of Kv1 function. Thus, mORs play a remarkably complex role in controlling the salience of distinct afferent inputs and transmitter modalities that ultimately influences synaptic recruitment of common downstream GABAergic IPN neurons. Together, these observations provide a framework for future investigations aimed at identifying the neural underpinnings of maladaptive behaviors that can emerge when endogenous or exogenous opioids, including potent synthetic analogs such as fentanyl, modulate/hijack this circuitry during the vulnerable stages of adolescence and in adulthood.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Substance use disorders (SUDs) are agnostic to demographic group posing a widespread public health crisis impacting many communities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Drugs of misuse influence synaptic function resulting in acute and protracted circuit adaptations that can exacerbate compulsive behaviors resulting in dependence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Mu-opioid receptors (mORs) represent the primary molecular substrate responsible for both the clinical efficacious (i.e. pain management) and the euphoric effects promoting opioid misuse and addiction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Additionally, mainly via liberation of endogenous opioids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, mORs also facilitate the addictive propensity of other substances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> e.g. alcohol and nicotine which, together with opioids, comprise the three most prevalent drugs of abuse worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. mORs are expressed by varied neural cell-types resident in numerous regions within the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Thus, detailed investigations as to how mOR activation impacts circuit dynamics constitutes an important endeavor critical for identification of potential therapeutic interventions aimed at alleviating the deleterious societal consequences of SUDs.</p>
<p>Here, we focus on a relatively understudied brain circuit comprising the medial habenula (mHb) and interpeduncular nucleus (IPN). The mHb is a bilateral epithalamic structure receiving significant synaptic input from, for example, the diagonal band and various septal regions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. The efferent output of the mHb is predominantly mediated by two distinct populations, substance P (SP) and cholinergic neurons, that primarily impinge on the IPN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. This latter structure in the ventral midbrain is populated mainly withGABAergic neurons that influence activity in downstream brain regions such as the raphe nuclei and ventral tegmental area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Thus, the mHb/IPN axis is anatomically positioned to integrate incoming limbic forebrain signals to ultimately control the function of therse midbrain monoaminergic nuclei. It is therefore unsurprising that, perturbation/modulation of the synaptic recruitment or activity of IPN GABAergic neurons precipitates varied emotion, reward and addiction phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The mHb/IPN axes houses one of the highest densities of mORs in the central nervous system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> thus representing a prominent brain locus for opioid action. Despite this, descriptions regarding the role of mHb/IPN mORs in shaping behavior are still in their relative infancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. mOR activation and subsequent G-protein signaling (Gi/o) classically produces an acute direct inhibitory effect in many neuronal types typified by membrane potential hyperpolarization via activation of inward rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels and/or reduced function of voltage-gated calcium channels function that are coupled to neurotransmitter release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Strikingly, there is a dearth of information concerning the cellular effects and subsequent circuit influence of mOR signaling in the mHb/IPN rendering the neural correlates underlying the behavioral outcomes elicited by opioids unclear at present. Interestingly, direct excitatory effects of mOR activation are apparent in certain areas of the nervous system either under basal conditions or following chronic drug regimens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Furthermore, within the IPN itself, GABA<sub>B</sub>-receptor activation (another Gi-linked receptor) produces an increase in synaptic transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> questioning whether this surprising effect is generalized to other members of this receptor family expressed within this region such as mORs.</p>
<p>The central role of the mHb/IPN circuitry underlying numerous behavioral aspects relating to emotion and the cycle of addiction, the conspicuous expression of mORs and a clear precedent for non-canonical effects of Gi-linked receptors together formed the impetus for the current work. Employing cell-type conditional optogenetics in combination with slice electrophysiology and pharmacogenetics we systematically dissect the effects of opioids on the mHb/IPN circuitry with a particular focus on synaptic signaling between these structures.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The two major neuronal populations of the mHb, substance P (SP) and cholinergic subtypes can be distinguished by virtue of <italic>Tac1</italic> and <italic>ChAT</italic> gene expression and largely segregate to the dorsal versus ventral mHb, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a,b</xref>). Together they provide much of the afferent input to the IPN via the fasciculus retroflexus (fr) axonal tracts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>) ultimately dictating IPN neuronal recruitment. The projection pattern as delineated by use of specific Cre transgenic mouse lines (ChATCre and Tac1Cre) when crossed to a conditional TdTomato reporter (Ai9), reveals a predominant innervation of IPL by SP neurons whereas cholinergic neurons impinge on the IPR/IPC subdvisions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). As previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, we confirm here that mOR protein expression is notable in the mHb, the fasciculus retroflexus axonal tracts and particularly prevalent in the IPN (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Within this latter structure, high resolution microscopy clearly show mOR expression is densest in the lateral IPN (IPL) with intermediate and relatively lower levels found in the rostral IPN (IPR) and central IPN (IPC) subregions, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Selective stimulation of each of these mHb neuronal populations in isolation is achieved using Cre-mediated conditional expression of channel rhodopsin by crossing Ai32 mice with either ChATCre or TAC1Cre mice; see methods for details). Adopting this optogenetic approach we investigate how mOR receptor activation modulates habenulo-interpeduncular synaptic dialogue imparted by these parallel yet distinct afferent systems in adult mice (p&gt;40). Both SP and cholinergic neurons express the glutamate vesicular transporter, VGlut1, and hence competently release this excitatory neurotransmitter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>mOR activation reduces substance P neuronal mediated glutamatergic transmission onto IPL GABAergic neurons</title>
<p>Since the highest expression of mOR was found in the IPL, we initially probed the effect of a selective mOR agonist (DAMGO, 500 nM) on AMPA receptor mediated transmission mediated by SP neurons that innervate this subregion. DAMGO application results in a significant decrease in light-driven (470 nM; typically, 10–50 % arbitrary LED power equating to approximately 0.4 – 3.4 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>; CoolLED illumination system) AMPAR mediated EPSCs in TAC1Cre:Ai32 mice that is partially reversed upon washout of the agonist(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d,e</xref>). This is accompanied by an increase in S2/S1 paired pulse ratio (PPR) suggesting the modulation is driven by presynaptic changes in release probability(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d,f</xref>). Thus, neurotransmitter release by this specific afferent input to the IPL is directly, negatively modulated like that seen in many other neural circuits within the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2-2">
<title>mOR activation augments the strength and fidelity of glutamatergic transmission by cholinergic neurons resulting in enhanced excitation-spike coupling in IPR GABAergic neurons</title>
<p>We next examined how mORs modulate mHb-IPN neurotransmission that occurs via the other major input mediated by cholinergic neurons. To this end, we employed ChATCre:ai32 mice and focused on the IPR subdivision (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>) due to the relatively high levels of combined mOR expression and cholinergic neuronal innervation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b,c</xref>) in this subregion. Remarkably, DAMGO application elicited a significant robust and reversible potentiation of light-evoked (470 nM; typically, 10–100 % arbitrary LED power equating to approximately 0.4 – 6.9 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>; CoolLED illumination system) AMPAR EPSC amplitude (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a,b</xref>) in stark contrast to that seen with mHb TAC1-IPL glutamatergic signaling described previously (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d,e</xref> versus <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). Notably, the accompanying PPR changes were not consistent with an increase in release probability raising uncertainty as to the synaptic locus of the mOR effect (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). We considered non-specific actions of DAMGO such as those mediated by direct modulation of ChR2 itself to explain this non-canonical observation. However, our previous data demonstrating the reduction of glutamatergic neurotransmission mediated by SP neurons by DAMGO described (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) renders this possibility unlikely. Furthermore, a similar potentiation of cholinergic neuronal mediated glutamatergic transmission in the IPN upon activation of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors has demonstrated a propensity for this circuit to undergo such modulation in response to a Gi-linked receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, despite this precedent, we employed a pharmacological approach to further validate this unexpected result. We show that lower concentrations of DAMGO (100 nM) and alternative mOR agonists, Met-enkephalin (Met-enk, 3 μM) and morphine (10 μM) all induce potentiation of ChAT neuronal glutamatergic transmission to similar extents (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). In addition, pre-treatment with the mOR selective antagonist (CTAP, 1mM) completely prevents the DAMGO induced response (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). Together, this pharmacological battery of tests employing an experimental, an endogenous and clinical/recreational mOR agonists and selective mOR antagonism clearly implicate this opioid receptor in mediating a non-canonical potentiation of AMPAR EPSC amplitude elicited by mHb cholinergic neurons in IPN.</p>

</fig>
<p>In several recordings, no measurable post synaptic AMPA receptor EPSC could be elicited in IPR neurons following light-evoked stimulation of cholinergic axons even with the maximal possible light intensity available (i.e. 100 % arbitrary LED power; approximately 6.9 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>), and thus further interrogation was typically not performed. However, in a few instances, we nevertheless proceeded with DAMGO or Met-enk application and surprisingly in 7/11 recorded IPR neurons a robust and reversible emergence of a significant AMPAR mediated EPSC was observed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e,f</xref>). Thus, these data clearly reveal that mOR activation invokes a synaptic mechanism that, at its most extreme, results in an “un-silencing” of ChAT neuronal glutamatergic transmission in IPN. Since, PPR measurements are only valid if the same population of release sites are assayed before and after experimental manipulation, the additional engagement of a putative reluctant vesicular pool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> by mOR activation could explain the discrepancy between the augmentation of EPSC amplitude and observed changes in PPR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b,c</xref>). Future interrogation is required to definitively identify the relative contribution of pre- and post-synaptic loci to the potentiation observed.</p>
<p>To date, we have examined the effect of mOR on synaptic transmission during paired pulse light activation delivered at 20 Hz. Although, mHb cholinergic neurons are capable of burst firing at much higher frequencies in response to afferent stimulation <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, they typically exhibit low frequency (i.e &lt;10Hz) intrinsic (i.e. independent of synaptic input) firing <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. In agreement with these previous studies, cholinergic neurons in ventral mHb (identified in ChATCre:Ai9 mice) spontaneously elicit action potentials measured in cell-attached recordings at an average of ~5 Hz (range 2 - 10Hz; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). Therefore, we assessed the role of mOR activation on glutamatergic transmission mediated by cholinergic neurons elicited by light stimulation trains delivered at this frequency. Interestingly, even with this relatively low frequency paradigm, glutamatergic transmission is extremely labile in nature as evidenced by the large and rapid depression of AMPAR EPSC during the stimulus train (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b,c</xref>). Remarkably, activation of mORs essentially eliminates activity-dependent depression at this synapse. This switch in transmission dynamics greatly facilitates the probability of excitatory postsynaptic potential-spike coupling (ES coupling) in response to each stimulus within the train (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d-e</xref>). Thus, these data clearly demonstrate that at physiologically relevant stimulus patterns, mORs serve to dramatically increase the fidelity of glutamatergic transmission in the IPR mediated by cholinergic neurons culminating in an enhanced recruitment of postsynaptic IPR neurons.</p>

<title>mORs constitute a molecular switch to alter the salience of glutamatergic transmission mediated by cholinergic and substance P neurons in the IPR</title>
<p>An intriguing inconsistency was observed regarding the DAMGO effect on light-evoked and spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSCs) impinging on IPR neurons. Under the experimental conditions employed, as observed with light evoked EPSCs, sEPSC events were exclusively mediated by AMPARs as evidenced by a virtually complete cessation upon DNQX application (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Remarkably, in contrast to the previously described robust potentiation of light-evoked AMPAR EPSCs, activation of mORs significantly attenuates sEPSC frequency with no effect on amplitude (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b-d</xref>). Thus, in a single IPR postsynaptic neuron opposing effects on light-evoked and spontaneous AMPAR EPSCs is evident (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). Prevailing circuit schemas based on axonal arborization patterns portray a mutually exclusive, non-overlapping afferent input to IPN mediated by cholinergic and SP neurons to IPR/IPC versus IPL, respectively. However, in the current study by employing high-resolution imaging in Tac1Cre:Ai32 mice a clear presence of synaptic bouton-like structures in the IPR is noted. These structures do not co-localize with endogenous ChAT, but do express the glutamate vesicular transporter, VGluT1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g,h</xref>). This presence of putative presynaptic anatomical substrates points to the existence of a secondary input to IPR distinct to the well-established one originating from mHb cholinergic neurons. Indeed, significant light-evoked AMPAR EPSCs in IPR neurons can be elicited in Tac1Cre:Ai32 mice with essentially similar amplitudes across all LED powers employed to that seen in ChATCre:Ai32 mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4i</xref>). Thus, in contrast to recent ultrastructural EM analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, these data indicate a previously unidentified glutamatergic input to IPR mediated by SP neurons. Interestingly, DAMGO application significantly depresses the SP neuronal glutamatergic output in IPR and increases PPR (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a-c</xref>) to a similar extent to that observed in IPL (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d,e</xref>; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7i</xref>). This is in direct contrast to the role of mORs in positively modulating the ChAT neuronal glutamatergic transmission in the IPR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a,b</xref>; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7i</xref>). Thus, for the first time we demonstrate both SP and cholinergic input to the same subregion of IPN and that mOR activation elicits diametrically opposing effect on transmission mediated by these respective presynaptic neuronal populations.</p>

<title>Dynamic regulation of the mOR elicited afferent specific switch in salience of the glutamatergic transmission to the IPR during adolescence</title>
<p>Our functional studies thus far have been restricted to sexually mature, adult mice (&gt; p40). mOR expression emerges in many brain structures during prenatal development largely overlapping with their final adult distribution profile by mid/late gestation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. In agreement, we reveal that mOR protein expression in IPR is present at appreciable levels from early postnatal stages (from P5 onwards; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>). This begs the question whether modulation of interpeduncular synaptic transmission described during these critical early epochs mirrors that seen in the adult. To examine this, we extended our analyses to earlier time points (P15 to P40) and found that mOR modulation of glutamatergic transmission mediated by cholinergic neurons in the IPR undergoes a remarkable developmental regulation. This is characterized by an initial inhibitory effect on light-evoked AMPAR EPSCs transitioning to the previously described augmentation(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e,f,i</xref>). In contrast, the glutamatergic input to the IPL and the newly discovered input to the IPR elicited by SP neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4i</xref>) is not developmentally regulated with synaptic transmission being consistently inhibited by DAMGO application at all ages tested (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5g-i</xref>). Thus, during early development opioids result in overall inhibition of afferent input to the IPR agnostic to afferent input with the emergence of the previously highlighted differential regulation of mHB cholinergic versus substance P neuronal output emerging during the late adolescent stages (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4i</xref>).</p>

<title>mOR induced potentiation of nicotinic receptor signaling in IPR is conditional on the removal of a molecular brake mediated by Kv1 channel function</title>
<p>In addition to mORs, this circuitry contains dense expression of nicotinic receptors located at pre- and postsynaptic sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. However, the ability to reliably evoke post-synaptic nicotinic receptor (nAchR) EPSCs in response to physiologically appropriate stimuli has been challenging. Indeed, many studies have resorted to high frequency and prolonged stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> or bath/puff applications of nicotine to investigate nAChR function in this circuit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Despite the faithful co-expression of endogenous ChAT in ChatCre:Ai32 expressing terminals located in the IPR(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>), in agreement with previous observations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>, evoked transmission by brief light pulses (1–5ms) from cholinergic neurons predominantly elicits pure AMPAR EPSC in postsynaptic IPR neurons under the experimental conditions employed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1a-c</xref>). Additionally, DAMGO, at concentrations that strongly potentiate glutamatergic transmission, does not result in a measurable postsynaptic nAChR EPSC after AMPARs are pharmacologically silenced. (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1a-c</xref>). Conversely, the potentiated ESPC following mOR activation is purely AMPAR mediated as evidence by complete block by DNQX (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1d-f</xref>). Thus, brief pulses of light (1–5ms) in ChatCre:ai32 mice does not result in sufficient ACh release, if any, to produce measurable postsynaptic nAChR response even under conditions where mOR activation strongly enhances glutamatergic transmission at these synapses. Interestingly, cholinergic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) can be boosted via potassium channel blockade with fampridine (4-aminopyridine) and has been clinically indicated in disorders such as myasthenia gravis and multiple sclerosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Furthermore, low micromolar 4-AP in slices amplifies acetylcholine release, as assessed by Grab-ACh mediated fluorescence in the IPN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Experimentally, these concentrations are relatively selective in inhibiting K<sup>+</sup>-channels of the shaker family (Kv1). Interestingly, of the members of this family, <italic>KCNA2</italic> (the gene encoding Kv1.2) mRNA is highly expressed in ventral habenula (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>) a region that is enriched in cholinergic neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). We therefore speculated that Kv1.2 block could result in enhancement of ACh release to perhaps reveal postsynaptic nAChR EPSCs in IPR neurons. Indeed, following block of glutamatergic transmission (DNQX + APV), subsequent application of 4-AP (50–100 μM) or the more selective Kv1 channel antagonist, dendrotoxin-α (100 nM) results in the emergence of an EPSC elicited by brief light pulses including in response to trains of 5Hz stimulation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c,d</xref>). This emergent EPSC is mediated by nAChRs as evidenced by ~ 80–90% block by the nicotinic receptor antagonist, DHβE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> (2 μM; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d,e</xref>). Interestingly, this approach allows for the calculation of nAChR;AMPAR peak amplitude ratio as a measure of the relative contributions of these components of co-transmission within an individual postsynaptic IPR neuron (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6g</xref>). As an alternative approach we also employed the ChAT-ChR2 mouse. nAChR EPSCs could also be elicited in this mouse line following 4-AP application, although the measured nAChR:AMPAR ratio is higher than that seen in ChatCre:ai32 mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6g</xref>) indicating a skew towards more prominent cholinergic transmission when compared to that mediated by glutamate. It is unclear as to the exact reason for this divergence, but it may be related to increased levels of the vesicular Ach transporter (vAChT) expression observed in ChAT:ChR2 mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. In Tac1Cre:Ai32 mice, 4-AP application following block of glutamatergic transmission does not result in emergence of any EPSC thus nAChR:AMPAR ratios is essentially 0 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6g</xref>) Finally, application of a cholinesterase inhibitor (ambenonium, 50 nM) markedly prolongs the EPSC waveform with minimal effect on amplitude (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6h</xref>). Thus together, these results corroborate the role of Kv1.2 as a molecular brake, removal of which, results in the emergence of habenulo-interpeduncular synaptic transmission via postsynaptic nAChRs on IPR GABAergic neurons.</p>

<p>Having established the ability to reliably assess an otherwise reluctant cholinergic transmission, we subsequently investigate how nAChR mediated signaling in the IPR is impacted by mOR activation. As with AMPAR mediated EPSCs, DAMGO produces a marked potentiation of light-evoked nAChR EPSC amplitude in IPR that is completely blocked by DHβE (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a,b</xref>). The mOR-mediated potentiation of both the glutamatergic and cholinergic output is essentially similar (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7i</xref>) Till now, we have utilized optogenetic approaches to assay synaptic transmission in the IPN. Interestingly, following acute block of Kv1, nAChR EPSCs could also be elicited via electrical stimulation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref>). Further, DAMGO reliably potentiated both electrical and light evoked nAChR EPSCs in a single IPR neuron to similar extents, a response that is blocked by DHβE (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c-e</xref>). Finally, we tested the molecular specificity of the DAMGO response employing ChAT-ChR2:global <italic>OPRM1</italic> knockout mice. In these mice DAMGO application is ineffective in augmenting glutamatergic or cholinergic mediated neurotransmission in IPR whilst the potentiation upon GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor activation previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> remains intact (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7f-h</xref>; note that in these experiments CGP55845A which is routinely included in all other experiments was omitted). This genetic approach complements our previous pharmacological data (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>) to directly implicate mORs in the potentiation of mHb-IPN transmission.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the current study, we reveal for the first time a remarkable augmentation of glutamatergic/cholinergic co-transmission by mHb cholinergic neurons following mOR activation in the IPN. However, the underlying cellular/network mechanisms responsible remain unclear. The most parsimonious explanation is that mORs in proximity to the release machinery of cholinergic nerve terminals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> mediate this effect. However, one must consolidate the fact that a Gi-linked receptor, which typically serve to directly inhibit release, results in a seemingly paradoxical potentiation. Functional and mechanistic studies have elegantly demonstrated that GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (another member of the Gi-linked subfamily) trigger acute molecular and structural adaptations resulting in enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and a switch of transmission modes within single presynaptic terminals to ultimately increase neurotransmitter release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Although, these observations set a precedent for potentiation by Gi-linked receptor activation in the IPN similar experimental approaches to that employed in the examination of the GABA<sub>B</sub>-receptor mediated potentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> are required to definitively implicate overlapping mechanisms. In other brain regions, a canonical inhibitory influence of mORs elicits overall network excitation via disinhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Furthermore, numerous studies have revealed an intricate interplay involving diverse neuromodulatory components intrinsic to the IPN that serve to regulate synaptic transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Thus, at present we cannot discount the possibility that the potentiation observed here may result via the activation of mORs residing on other neural elements within the IPN microcircuitry such as postsynaptic neurons or glia, for instance. Regardless, of the exact underlying cellular and/or network mechanisms our data extend the previously described Gi-linked receptor potentiation of neurotransmission in the IPN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> to mORs, a predominant target of a societally relevant and prevalently misused class of drugs.</p>
<p>Recent generation of transgenic mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> have permitted manipulation of mOR-expressing neurons and mOR receptors including those expressed specifically within the mHb/IPN. Emerging behavioral studies adopting such conditional genetic approaches have highlighted an important role of mORs within this circuitry in mediating varying aspects of reward and aversion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Unsurprisingly, it has been concluded that the observed behavioral effects of such manipulations are due to perturbations of a generalized inhibition mediated by mORs within the mHb/IPN circuit. Here, we reveal a functional dichotomy characterized by an inhibitory yet excitatory influence on neurotransmission mediated by SP and cholinergic neurons, respectively. These distinct neuronal populations participate in and drive specific behavioral facets demonstrating a division of labor. For example, SP neuronal activity positively correlates with reward outcome, history and hedonic value<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>, whereas that of cholinergic neurons is reduced during behaviors associated with reward<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. mHb cholinergic neurons have also been linked to negative affect including anxiety and depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup> that promote drug-seeking behaviors during withdrawal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. We reveal for the first time that the IPR subdivision receives functional glutamatergic afferent input from SP neurons that based on previous anatomical interrogation were considered to exclusively target the IPL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the novel opposing effect on transmission extends to the IPR thus demonstrating a role for mORs in altering the relative salience of these distinct afferent systems with regard recruitment of common downstream IPR neurons. The IPR houses somatostatin (SST) GABAergic neurons whose afferents impinge on the raphe nucleus and lateral dorsal tegmental nucleus, the latter in turn influencing the VTA and its downstream structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Thus, careful consideration regarding future examination of behavioral outcomes resulting from the described contrasting effects of mOR activation on the parallel processing of reward (mHB SP) and anti-reward (mHB ChAT) in this circuit is essential.</p>
<p>Throughout this study we contextualize the effect of mOR activation in the IPN primarily through the lens of exogenously introduced opioids. However, physiological activation of mORs can be mediated to differing extents by endogenous ligands such as dynorphin or enkephalin. Indeed, we demonstrate that met-enkephalin effectively boosts co-transmission from cholinergic neurons in a similar manner to morphine. Interestingly the IPN is home to a population of pro-enkephalin (PENK)-expressing neurons and detectable met-enkephalin immunoreactivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. In other brain regions, manipulation of PENK neuronal activity and or ablation of PENK itself elicits mOR mediated circuit modulation and behavioral alterations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. It is anticipated that activation of mORs by local endogenous opioid release yields similar complex effects to those following exogenous application of mOR agonists described here. Thus, this physiological route will have major implications concerning the role of mHB/IPN mORs in mediating the positive reinforcing effects of non-opioid drugs of abuse (e.g. nicotine, alcohol, amphetamines) and other “natural” rewarding stimuli (e.g. such as those associated with social interaction, exercise and food intake) thus extending the relevance of our study to these additional modalities.</p>
<p>Another novel finding in the current study relates to the identification of a “molecular brake” that exerts strong control over nAChR signaling impinging on postsynaptic IPN neurons. Specifically, compromising the function of delayed rectifying K<sup>+</sup>-channels containing Kv1.2 subunits results in emergence of nAChR EPSCs in response to light and electrical stimuli delivered with physiological paradigms likely thru increased axonal/bouton excitability and calcium influx via action potential waveform modulation. Kv1.2 function can be bidirectionally impacted by use-dependent mechanisms or through secondary activity mediated cascades resulting in post-translational modifications (e.g. phosphorylation state) that impact its function and/or trafficking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. These plausible endogenous mechanistic routes could serve to titer the strength nAChR mediated transmission in the IPR. The resident nAChRs in the mHb/IPN are primarily encoded by the CHRNA3/B4/A5 gene cluster and the role of this circuitry in nicotine use is well characterized. For example, increased propensity for nicotine abuse in humans is associated with dysregulation of nAChR function precipitated by single nucleotide polymorphisms of this gene cluster<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>. Experimental manipulation of nAChR signaling in the mHb/IPN generates phenotypes associated with various aspects of nicotine consumption in mouse models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>. Furthermore, chronic nicotine results in adaptations in nAChR expression and function that can exacerbate continued nicotine consumption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup>. Together, these studies establish a link between nAChR mediated signaling within this circuitry and prevalence of nicotine misuse. Here we highlight an intriguing interplay between opioid and cholinergic systems within the mHb/IPN axes. Our data clearly demonstrate that mORs and Kv1.2 together comprise synergistic molecular targets that, in addition to others previously identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, when leveraged in tandem can manipulate nAChR mediated signaling to yield potential interventions for nicotine overuse.</p>
<p>Adolescence is a critical period for many aspects of brain and social development and represents a high-risk demographic group for drug use developing into long-term addiction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup>. Propelled by the societal introduction of highly potent synthetic morphine analogs (e.g fentanyl), one of the many devastating sequalae of the well-documented opioid crisis is an alarming high rate of overdose deaths not only in adults but also during vulnerable teenage years. Of note is the striking valence conversion from depression to potentiation of mHb ChAT neuronal signaling in the IPR occurring around the late postnatal stages. This is in stark contrast to that seen with the newly described SP neuronal mediated transmission in this same IPN subdivision where mOR activation is inhibitory at all life stages assayed. Thus, during postnatal development opioids acting via mORs result in a blanket inhibition of these two distinct inputs prior to the establishment of the afferent specific modulation in the adult. Interestingly, numerous studies have highlighted changes in the role of mORs in reward associated behaviors coinciding with similar periods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup>. An attractive hypothesis is that coordinated modifications at the cellular, molecular and/or network level underlie this dynamic developmental regulation. Thus, our circuit analyses provide insights into the neural correlates for the differing propensity of mORs to regulate not only positive reinforcement but also the negative effects associated with withdrawal at various stages of development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>. Whether these adaptations underlie the increased propensity for substance abuse during development remains to be ascertained. Furthermore, opioid exposure during early developmental epochs imparts long lasting effects on the brains reward circuitry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Thus together, it is imperative to consider the newly described developmentally regulated impact of mORs in the modulation of the mHb/IPN circuitry. This is of particularly relevance with respect to generation of potential preventative treatments for the deleterious consequences of fetal opioid exposure and SUDs in high-risk juveniles.</p>
<p>In addition to a central role in addiction, the mHb/IPN circuitry encodes fear associated behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup>. Interestingly, prevention of GABA<sub>B</sub>-receptor function in mHb cholinergic neurons or increasing IPN neuronal activity facilitates and augments expression of fear extinction, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, Dysregulation of this behavioral aspect is a key underlying cause of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></sup>. Based on this previous work, the novel mOR mediated potentiation of the mHb cholinergic transmission and hence IPN neuronal recruitment described here constitutes a parallel, yet alternative circuit mechanism involved in the extinction of learnt fear. Thus, pharmacogenetic manipulation of mOR mediated signaling specifically in the IPN may constitute a viable approach to alleviate conditions associated with abnormal fear processing such as those seen in PTSD.</p>
<p>In summary, we highlight several previously undescribed and hence unappreciated roles of mORs in the dynamic regulation of synaptic transmission impinging on IPN GABAergic neurons following exposure to exogenous opioids. Together these detailed functional analyses have yielded important findings that necessitate consideration in future interrogation concerning the role of these receptors in modulating a critical, yet relatively understudied, brain circuitry which encodes varying aspects of emotion, hedonic and addiction behaviors.</p>

<p>Mice (P&gt;15) were perfused trans-cardinally using 4% PFA and dissected brain tissues were post-fixed in 4% PFA for 24 hours at 4 °C. For P5 mice, brains were removed and drop fixed in 4% PFA for 24 hours at 4 °C. Fixed brain tissues were thoroughly washed in 1x phosphate buffer (PB) followed by cryopreservation using 30% sucrose. 50 μm coronal sections were made on a frozen microtome. To perform floating section IHC, brain slices were washed with 1x PB at room temperature for 1 hour with 2–3 changes of 1x PB followed by blocking and permeabilizing in Blocking Solution (1x PB + 10% donkey serum + 0.5% Triton X-100) at room temperature for at least 2 hours. Blocked brain slices were incubated in primary antibodies, which were diluted to working concentration using Antibody Solution (1x PB + 1% donkey serum + 0.1% Triton X-100), at 4 °C for 24–48 hours. After wash with 1x PB at room temperature for 15 minutes with 3 repeats, brain slices were incubated in secondary antibodies diluted with Antibody Solution at room temperature for 1 hour, followed by DAPI staining at 1ug/ml for additional 15 minutes.

<p>P15-P91 mice (for details refer to the results section) were anesthetized with isoflurane, and the brain removed in ice–cold partial sucrose substituted ASCF (ssACSF) solution containing (in mM): 90 Sucrose, 80 NaCl, 25 NaHCO3, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 3.5 KCl, 4.5 MgCl2, 0.5 CaCl2, 10 glucose, saturated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> (pH 7.4; osmolarity 300–310 mOsm). Coronal sections containing wither the mHB or IPN (270 - 300 µm) were cut using a VT–1000S vibratome (Leica Microsystems, Bannockburn, IL) in ice-cold ssACSF. The slices were allowed to recover in the ssACSF at 31–33°C for 20–30 minutes followed by an additional 20 minutes at room temperature. Slices were then transferred to our standard extracellular solution (ACSF) of the following composition (in mM): 130 NaCl, 24 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 3.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 glucose, saturated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> (pH 7.4; osmolarity 300–310 mOsm) for storage until electrophysiological recording. Slices were transferred to an upright Olympus BX51WI microscope and visualized with infrared differential interference contrast microscopy and perfused (2–4 ml/min) with the above extracellular solution. Unless otherwise indicated the recording extracellular solution was routinely supplemented with 2μM CGP55845A, 50μM picrotoxin and 10 μM bicuculline (Tocris Science or Ascent Scientific).</p>
<p>All recordings were performed at 31–33°C with electrodes (3–5 MΏ) pulled from borosilicate glass (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) filled with one of two intracellular solutions (in mM); (i) 135 CsMeSO4, 8 KCl, 4 MgATP, 0.3 NaGTP, 5 QX–314, 0.5 EGTA and 3 mg/ml biocytin. (ii) 150 K–gluconate, 3 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 EGTA, 2 MgATP, 0.3 Na2GTP, 10 HEPES and 3 mg/ml biocytin. pH was adjusted to 7.3 with KOH or CsOH and osmolarity adjusted to 285–295 mOsm. Whole–cell patch–clamp recordings were made using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Signals were filtered at 4 – 10 kHz and digitized at 10 – 20 kHz (Digidata 1322A and pClamp 10 Software; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). For cell attached recordings pipettes were filled with our standard extracellular solution.</p>
<p>For optogenetic stimulation of ChR2 light stimuli at a wavelength of 470nm and duration of 1–5 ms were delivered through the 40X water immersion objective using a CoolLED pE–4000 Illumination system (Andover, UK). Arbitrary LED power typically ranged between 10 – 100% corresponding to ~ 0.4 – 6.9 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> as measured with a digital power meter (Thor Labs, NJ, USA). sEPSC analyses was performed on post hoc filtered episodic traces (Clampfit; Bessel 8-pole, -3db cutoff 1000Hz). Frequency of sEPSCs and average sEPSC amplitude were determined over 5 consecutive sweeps totalling a period of 4 seconds (i.e. 0.8s per sweep). sEPSC were detected via a thresholding procedure set at 4 times the RMS baseline noise. Note that neurons with a baseline sEPSC frequency of &gt; 8Hz were selected for further interrogation. Analyses of electrophysiological data was performed in Clampfit (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and curated in Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.</p>

<p>This study presents <bold>important</bold> information about the role of mu opioid receptors in synaptic communication between the medial habenula and the interpeduncular nucleus. The authors provide <bold>solid</bold> evidence that mu opioid receptor activation has differential effects on glutamate release from substance P neurons and cholinergic neurons, with a canonical reduction in release from the former but a novel increase in release from the latter. They also show that blocking potassium channels can unmask a nicotinic cholinergic synaptic response that is also facilitated by mu opioid receptor activation. This work will be of interest to those studying the interpeduncular nucleus, as well as the larger neuroscience community studying opioids and motivated behavior.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors demonstrate for the first time that opioid signaling has opposing effects on the same target neuron depending on the source of the input. Further, the authors provide evidence to support the role of potassium channels in regulating a brake on glutamatergic and cholinergic signaling, with the latter finding being developmentally regulated and responsive to opioid treatment. This evidence solves a conundrum regarding cholinergic signaling in the interpeduncular nucleus that evaded elucidation for many years.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This manuscript provides 3 novel and important findings that significantly advance our understanding of the medial habenula-interpeduncular circuitry:</p>
<p>(1) Mu opioid receptor activation (mOR) reduces postsynaptic glutamatergic currents elicited from substance P neurons while simultaneously enhancing postsynaptic glutamatergic currents from cholinergic neurons, with the latter being developmentally regulated.</p>
<p>(2) Substance P neurons from the Mhb provide functional input to the rostral nucleus of the IPN, in addition to the previously characterized lateral nuclei.</p>
<p>(3) Potassium channels (Kv1.2) provide a break in neurotransmission in the IPN.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Overall I find the data presented compelling, but I feel that the number of observations is quite low (typically n=3-7 neurons, typically one per animal). While I understand that only a few slices can be obtained for the IPN from each animal, the strength of the novel findings would be more convincing with more frequent observations (larger n, more than one per animal). The findings here suggest that the authors have identified a novel mechanism for the normal function of neurotransmission in the IPN, so it would be expected to be observable in almost any animal. Thus it is not clear to me why the authors investigated so few neurons per slice and chose to combine different treatments into one group (e.g. Figure 2f), even if the treatments have the same expected effect.</p>
<p>There are also significant sex differences in nAChR expression in the IPN that might not be functionally apparent using the low n presented here. It would be helpful to know which of the recorded neurons came from each sex, rather than presenting only the pooled data.</p>
<p>There are also some particularly novel observations that are presented but not followed up on, and this creates a somewhat disjointed story. For example, in Figure 2, the authors identify neurons in which no response is elicited by light stimulation of ChAT-neurons, but the application of DAMGO (mOR agonist) un-silences these neurons. Are there baseline differences in the electrophysiological or morphological properties of these &quot;silent&quot; neurons compared to the responsive neurons?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, Chittajallu and colleagues present compelling evidence that mu opioid receptor (MOR) activation can potentiate synaptic neurotransmission in a medial habenula to interpeduncular nucleus (mHb-IPN) subcircuit. While, projections from mHb tachykinin 1 (Tac1) neurons onto lateral IPN neurons show a canonical opioid-induced synaptic depression in glutamate release, excitatory neurotransmission in mHb choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) projections to the rostral IPN is potentiated by opioids. This process may require the inhibition of voltage-gated potassium channels (Kv1.2) and results in an augmented co-release of glutamate and acetylcholine. This function emerges around age P27 in mice, when MOR expression in the IPN peaks.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Carefully executed electrophysiological experiments with appropriate controls. Interesting description of a neurodevelopmental change in the effects of opioids on mHb-IPN signaling.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The genetic strategy used to target the mHb-IPN pathway (constitutive expression in all ChAT+ and Tac1+ neurons) is not specific to this projection. In addition, a braking mechanism involving Kv1.2 has not been identified.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Here the authors describe the role of mORs in synaptic glutamate release from substance P and cholinergic neurons in the medial habenula to the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) circuit in adult mice. They show that mOR activation reduces evoked glutamate release from substance P neurons yet increases evoked glutamate release and Ach release from cholinergic neurons. Unlike glutamate release, Ach release is only detected when potassium channels are blocked with 4-AP or dendrotoxin, implicating Kv1.2. The authors also report a previously unidentified glutamatergic input to IPR mediated from SP neurons and describe the developmental timing of mOR-facilitation in adolescent mice.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The experiments provide new insight into the role of mORs in controlling evoked glutamate release in a circuit with high levels of mORs and established roles in relevant behaviors.</p>
<p>(2) The experimental design is generally rigorous, and the results are clear-cut. The conclusions are largely supported by the data.</p>
<p>(3) The findings will be of interest to those working in the field.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The mechanistic underpinnings of the most interesting results are not pursued. For example, the experiments do not provide new insight into the differential effects of evoked and spontaneous glutamate/Ach release by Gi/o coupled mORs, nor the differential threshold for glutamate versus Ach release.</p>
<p>(2) The significance of the ratio of AMPA versus nACh EPSCs shown in Figure 6 is unclear since nAChR EPSCs measured in the K+ channel blockers are compared to AMPA EPSCs in control (presumably 4-AP would also increase AMPA EPSCs).</p>
<p>(3) The authors note that blocking Kv1 channels typically enhances transmitter release by slowing action potential repolarization. The idea that Kv1 channels serve as a brake for Ach release in this system would be strengthened by showing that these channels are the target of neuromodulators or that they contribute to activity-dependent regulation that allows the brake to be released.</p>
