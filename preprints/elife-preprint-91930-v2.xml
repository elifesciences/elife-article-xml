<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) is known to survive within macrophages by compromising the integrity of the phagosomal compartment in which it resides. This activity primarily relies on the ESX-1 secretion system, predominantly involving the protein duo ESAT-6 and CFP-10. CFP-10 likely acts as a chaperone, while ESAT-6 likely disrupts phagosomal membrane stability via a largely unknown mechanism. we employ a series of biochemical analyses, protein modeling techniques, and a novel ESAT-6-specific nanobody to gain insight into the ESAT-6’s mode of action. First, we measure the binding kinetics of the tight 1:1 complex formed by ESAT-6 and CFP-10 at neutral pH. Subsequently, we demonstrate a rapid self-association of ESAT-6 into large complexes under acidic conditions, leading to the identification of a stable tetrameric ESAT-6 species. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we pinpoint the most probable interaction interface. Furthermore, we show that cytoplasmic expression of an anti-ESAT-6 nanobody blocks Mtb replication, thereby underlining the pivotal role of ESAT-6 in intracellular survival. Together, these data suggest that ESAT-6 acts by a pH dependent mechanism to establish two-way communication between the cytoplasm and the Mtb-containing phagosome.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tuberculosis (TB), caused by <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb), is a major global health concern, claiming over 1.6 million lives annually. Mtb is highly adept at evading the immune system, and it can persist within an infected person for decades. This situation is worsened by the nearly 1.7 billion people globally who harbor a dormant Mtb infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Houben and Dodd, 2016</xref>), coupled with the rising trend of drug-resistant TB cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">World Health Organization, 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>To successfully establish an infection in the host, Mtb utilizes a plethora of virulence factors delivered via its several ESX-secretion systems. Studies have indicated that Mtb has the ability to damage the phagosomal membrane, a process that is heavily reliant on the activity of the ESX-1 secretion system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Conrad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">López-Jiménez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Schnettger et al., 2017</xref>). Currently, the most probable candidate driving ESX-1 dependent lytic activity is the well-known T cell antigen, the 6 kDa early secreted antigenic target (ESAT-6, or EsxA)) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Andersen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sørensen et al., 1995</xref>), after which the ESX family of T7SSs was originally named (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gey van Pittius et al., 2001</xref>). Secretion of the various ESX-1 substrates are known to be highly complex and interdependent, and while the full scope of ESX-1 components and substrates is still being worked out, many individual ESX-1 component knockouts are known to phenocopy the ESAT-6 deletion, indicating that ESAT-6 itself is responsible for the lion’s share of the activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Clemmensen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Cronin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lienard et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Sanchez et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Over the last few decades, there have been numerous studies focused on uncovering the possible mechanism of membrane lysis by ESAT-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Augenstreich et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Conrad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">de Jonge et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kinhikar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Koo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lienard et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Osman et al., 2022</xref>), and how this might lead to escape of Mtb from the phagosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Houben et al., 2012</xref>). However, the field has been plagued by setbacks such as the discovery that many studies prior to 2017 showing membrane disruption by ESAT-6 were confounded by the contamination with the detergent ASB-14, which was originally added to remove endotoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Conrad et al., 2017</xref>). Consequently, most recent studies have focused on the use of intact bacteria in assays, frequently with the closely related <italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic> (Mm), to avoid using recombinant proteins. The conclusions of these experiments are complicated by the interdependent nature of ESX-1 structural components, chaperones, and substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Augenstreich et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Osman et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Santucci et al., 2022</xref>). Mm has been a valuable model for working out ESX-1 and ESAT-6 function, and many of the key studies in the field have used Mm exclusively. However, the unique characteristics of Mm compared to Mtb can sometimes leads to differing results, and conclusions drawn from one species do not always apply to the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bosserman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Carlsson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lienard et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Osman et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Smith et al., 2008</xref>). This is important because the membranolytic activity of the ESX-1 seems to be highly context dependent, and more biochemical work is needed to work out the specific contributions of ESAT-6 to the membrane disruption phenotype.</p>
<p>Despite extensive research, the precise mechanism of ESAT-6 action remains elusive. This study aims to bridge this gap by performing comprehensive biochemical and cellular investigations of ESAT-6 under neutral and acidic conditions. We use biolayer interferometry (BLI) to measure the tight association between ESAT-6 and CFP-10, and the pH dependent ESAT-6 self-association. We use fluorescence microscopy to directly observe formation of large ESAT-6 complexes, and we measure the stoichiometry of ESAT-6 under different pH conditions using multi-angle light scattering. We then use molecular dynamics-based modeling to evaluate the most likely modes of ESAT-6 interaction. We also generated a novel ESAT-6-binding alpaca-derived nanobody, E11rv, to further define the significance of ESAT-6 during Mtb infection. We perform biochemical characterization of E11rv, as well as functional testing, which showed inhibition of Mtb growth inside macrophages treated with E11rv or expressing cytoplasmic E11rv.</p>

<title>Recombinant ESAT-6 and CFP-10 purification</title>
<p>In seeking to perform functional studies of ESAT-6 and CFP-10, we produced recombinant protein using <italic>E. coli</italic> expression plasmids available from BEI Resources: pMRLB.7 (NR-50170) containing ESAT-6, and pMRLB.46 (NR-13297) containing CFP-10. Both of these plasmids have been used extensively in literature, including many of the most influential biochemical characterization studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Augenstreich et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Behura et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Choi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Conrad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">de Jonge et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Eitson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gallegos et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Harrison et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Koyuncu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Mukherjee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Niazi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Osman et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Pathak et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Peng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Refai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Smith et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Stavri et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Vesosky et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Woolhiser et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Xiao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). The specification sheet for pMRLB.7 indicates that it includes a C-terminal FALE solubility tag and subsequent Histidine affinity tag while pMRLB.46 indicates that it contains only a C-terminal Histidine tag. We performed sequencing of both plasmids (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), and noticed a stretch of 10 additional amino acids ahead of the reported tags in the pMRLB.7 plasmid (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>). The precise amino acid sequence of the pMRLB.46 plasmid has not been reported, but it appears to contain 4 additional amino acids ahead of the expected tag. Importantly, we were able to confirm that the full and complete sequences of ESAT-6 and CFP-10 are each contained in their respective plasmids, and the inconsistencies fall within the C-terminal tag regions of each protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>Expression and purification by Nickel-NTA chromatography resulted in bands of the expected sizes by SDS-PAGE and His<sub>6</sub>-specific western blot (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Amino acid sequences of the recombinant proteins were also confirmed by mass spectrometry (MS), where it was observed that CFP-10 undergoes N-terminal methionine excision in our <italic>E. coli</italic> expression system (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Giglione et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hirel et al., 1989</xref>). Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) showed appropriate relative retention volumes and combining equimolar quantities of ESAT-6 with CFP-10 resulted in a leftward shift, suggesting correct dimerization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>

<title>Dimerization of ESAT-6 and CFP-10 at neutral pH</title>
<p>To validate that ESAT-6 and CFP-10 are forming a native dimer, we next performed native-PAGE with different ratios of the two proteins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). We incubated ESAT-6 and CFP-10 for 1 hour at 4°C prior to running the gels, combining them in different ratios. The isoelectric point of ESAT-6 and CFP-10 are both quite low, for our constructs they are 5.18 (net charge -8.22 at pH 7.4) and 5.72 (net charge -5.27 at pH 7.4), respectively. Thus, we oriented the positive electrode toward the bottom of the gel. As expected, we observed that ESAT-6 ran faster than CFP-10. Combinations of each showed a distinct third band of intermediate charge which was greatest in the 1:1 mixture and absent in each pure protein, indicating formation of a 1:1 complex with no intermediate species. This aligns with our results from <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>, and aligns with historical research on the interaction between ESAT-6 and CFP-10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Poulsen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Renshaw et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">2002</xref>).</p>

<p>Another commonly used test of ESAT-6 function is hemolysis, or the ability to damage red blood cell (RBC) membranes and release hemoglobin. Historical studies reported that ESAT-6 was able to cause hemolysis, but Conrad et al. discovered that most of this hemolytic activity was due to detergent contamination with ASB-14, which is commonly added during the wash steps of Nickel-NTA purification to remove endotoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Conrad et al., 2017</xref>). Our recombinant ESAT-6 was produced without detergent, and we confirmed that it was not able to induce hemolysis at any pH between 4.5 and 7.5 (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>). However, the hemolysis assay still finds contemporary use when testing the ability of whole bacteria to induce membrane damage in an ESX-1 and contact-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Augenstreich et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bosserman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Conrad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Osman et al., 2022</xref>). In such experiments, RBCs are mixed with log-phase bacterial cultures at high MOI and pelleted by centrifugation to force direct contact. Similar to previous reports, we found that <italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic> (Mm) is capable of efficiently causing hemolysis within 2 hours (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast, we found that Mtb was incapable of hemolysis over a similar time frame. It is well established that Mm-induced hemolysis is ESX-1 dependent, but our results suggest that there are some differences in Mtb that affect the rate or extent of hemolysis. One previous study was able to induce hemolysis using Mtb, but this required 48 hours instead of the typical 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Augenstreich et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

<title>Binding kinetics of ESAT-6 and CFP-10</title>
<p>To measure the binding strength of ESAT-6 and CFP-10 we developed a biolayer interferometry (BLI) assay to measure their interactions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). We first measured the ability of ESAT-6 and CFP-10 to form homo-oligomers or hetero-oligomers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), and found that they preferentially formed hetero-oligomers. ESAT-6 showed a small, but measurable amount of self-association, while CFP-10 showed no self-association. The dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of the ESAT-6/CFP-10 heterodimer has not hitherto been directly measured, but Renshaw et al. estimated an upper bound of 10nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Renshaw et al., 2002</xref>). We performed a detailed measurement of the ESAT-6/CFP-10 association and measured a K<sub>D</sub> of 220 pM, indicating exceptionally tight binding (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). ESAT-6 self-association resulted in reduced overall binding to the sensor and displayed a rapid on rate, but also a rapid off rate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). The curve shape is suggestive of something other than traditional 1:1 binding, but for comparison purposes we calculated an apparent K<sub>D</sub> of approximately 1.5 µM, weaker than that of the ESAT-6/CFP-10 association.</p>

<p>The pH of the Mtb-containing compartment typically ranges from 4.5 in IFN-γ activated macrophages to 6.2 in non-activated macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">MacMicking et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Vandal et al., 2008</xref>). Because Mtb can exists in an acidified compartment, we tested whether ESAT-6 binding changes under low pH conditions. Surprisingly, ESAT-6 displayed robust self-association at pH 4.5 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), resulting in several-fold more mass attaching to the sensor than even the ESAT-6/CFP-10 association at neutral pH. The apparent K<sub>D</sub> for this interaction was slightly weaker than ESAT-6 self-association at neutral pH, but the total amount of binding was 20-30-fold greater, suggesting that low pH conditions trigger ESAT-6 to assemble into larger complexes. Further, there have been conflicting reports on whether ESAT-6 and CFP-10 dissociate from each other at low pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">de Jonge et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">De Leon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lightbody et al., 2008</xref>).

To determine the precise pH at which ESAT-6 self-association becomes dominant, we performed BLI experiments at half pH units from 4.5 to 6.5 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>).

<p>The BLI experiments we have shown thus far using the streptavidin-coated biosensors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), have utilized ESAT-6 which had been biotinylated using succinimide chemistry (ChromaLINK, Vector labs) allowing for precise quantification of incorporated biotin. Using 3 molar equivalents of labeling reagent, we obtained ESAT-6 with an average of 0.99 biotins/protein. However, succinimide chemistry can label any primary amine including the N-terminus and lysine residues. ESAT-6 normally contains 3 lysines, and the pMRLB.7 construct contains 1 additional lysine for a total of 4 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Because it is unknown which region of the protein may be involved in self-association, we generated an additional ESAT-6 construct capable of C-terminal site-directed biotinylation via sortase-mediated transpeptidation via an LPETG motif (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Guimaraes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Popp et al., 2009</xref>).

<p>To analyze the stoichiometry of these complexes, we next performed SEC coupled with multi-angle light scattering (MALS), which can measure the molecular weight of complexes as they elute from the SEC column. At pH 7.5, we observed a single peak with an approximate molecular weight of 21 kDa, which most likely corresponds to an ESAT-6 homodimer (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). We did not observe the presence of any monomeric ESAT-6, indicating that it likely self-pairs in the absence of CFP-10. This agrees with our BLI results from (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). At pH 4.5, we were surprised to see a single, well-defined peak at 46 kDa, most likely corresponding to a tetramer (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). No measurable monomer, dimer, or higher molecular weight complexes were observed. While it is not surprising that the high molecular weight complexes observed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>) were unable to traverse the SEC column intact, it was unexpected that tetramers would be the only species observed.</p>
<p>To address the question of the likely conformation of the homodimer and tetramer, we performed modeling experiments using docking followed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to estimate the most stable conformations. We started with a homology model based on previously reported structures of the ESAT-6/CFP-10 heterodimer (PDB: 3FAV, 4J11, 4J7K, 4J10 and 4J7J) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Poulsen et al., 2014</xref>). To estimate the structure of the ESAT-6 monomer, we then performed a molecular dynamics simulation to observe the structural stability of the protein’s conformation. We observed that the energy-minimized structure of monomeric ESAT-6 strongly resembles its conformation in the heterodimer. The helix-turn-helix structure exhibits strong amphipathic nature, with both helices aligning to form a hydrophobic face flanked by charged residues (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>).</p>
<p>We next modeled an ESAT-6 homodimer, starting again with a homology model based on the heterodimer followed by a molecular dynamics simulation. The homodimer model showed head-to-tail alignment of the ESAT-6 monomers associating via their hydrophobic faces and stabilized on either side by salt bridges (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). This homodimer model represents a likely conformation of the species observed in the pH 7.5 SEC-MALS experiment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>).</p>
<p>To model the tetrameric species observed in the acidic SEC-MALS experiment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>), we performed docking of ESAT-6 homodimers and then a molecular dynamics simulation of the lowest energy conformation observed in docking. We observed the dimers interacting in a head-to-tail orientation via their hydrophilic faces, supported by salt bridges (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). In the tetramer model, some of the charged residues, such as Lys<sub>67</sub>, which had previously supported the dimer interface, switched orientations to support the tetramer interface.</p>
<p>For each of these models, the molecular dynamics informs us about the proteins’ conformational stability. The root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) quantifies the amount of movement along the peptide backbone for each residue, with lower values equating to more stability. We performed molecular dynamics experiments for ESAT-6 in monomer, dimer, and tetramer forms in order to evaluate the stability of each species (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). In general, the α-helices of ESAT-6 are stable, while the C- and N-termini are highly flexible. However, in the monomeric form, the residues between 20 and 50 exhibit increased flexibility at pH 7.5. At pH 4.5, the monomeric form exhibits increased flexibility along a majority of the backbone. At both pH values, dimerization (and tetramerization) result in greater overall stability. At pH 7.5, the average RMSF of the monomer is 2.51, which reduces to 2.33 for the dimer due to the reduced flexibility between residues 20 and 50. The tetramer is only marginally more stable, at 2.27. At pH 4.5, the difference between each state is even more pronounced, with an RMSF of 2.74, 2.04, and 1.94 for the monomer, dimer, and tetramer, respectively.</p>

<p>To determine the binding site, we performed hydrogen deuterium exchange experiments with ESAT-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Harris et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Masson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Rathinaswamy et al., 2021</xref>). This involves incubating either apo or E11rv-bound ESAT-6 in D<sub>2</sub>0 buffer for different lengths of time. The deuterium will exchange with acidic protons in the protein at different rates depending on the solvent exposure, giving insights into which areas of the protein are more tightly folded, or shielded by protein-protein interactions with a nanobody (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D-F</xref>). Digestion followed by MS allows quantification of the extent of deuteration along the peptide backbone and concomitant binding site estimation. For E11rv, we observed decreased deuteration compared to apo around positions 50-65 (on the C-terminal helix, near the loop), and to a lesser extent positions 98-110 (within the tag). The region between these segments, from residues 66-94, displayed an increase in solvent exposure, as did residues 14-28, on the opposing helix directly across from 66-94. A likely explanation for this pattern is that E11rv binds around residues 50-65, and that this somehow destabilizes the C-terminal portion of the helix or separates the helices enough to allow more solvent exposure between helices. It is unclear how the small region within the tag might be involved, but <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref> suggests that the positioning of the tag has little impact on binding, and this region is predicted to be largely unstructured.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study has several key findings. Firstly, ESAT-6 undergoes rapid self-association into large complexes at pH levels below 5.0, and this may be preceded by formation of stable tetramers. Second, in the absence of CFP-10, ESAT-6 exists as a homodimer at neutral pH. Third, our nanobody, E11rv, binds to ESAT-6 and can inhibit the growth of Mtb inside cells when treated externally or via cytoplasmic expression.</p>
<p>The issue of incomplete information about the amino acid sequence of one of the most widely used ESAT-6 constructs is surprising, but none of the data we have generated suggested a practical difference with differently tagged constructs. Previous studies have found major differences in function between recombinant ESAT-6 in general when compared with “native” ESAT-6 purified from Mtb cultures, which are typically purified using much harsher techniques than recombinant protein due to the lack of affinity tags. One attractive theory for the observed difference between recombinant and native ESAT-6 which is gaining traction is N-terminal acetylation being required for ESAT-6 function, but this has not yet been proven in Mtb infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aguilera et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Collars et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Mba Medie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Okkels et al., 2004</xref>). The most commonly given reason for the importance of N-acetylation is that acetylated ESAT-6 is more easily released from CFP-10 under acidic conditions. Our results suggest that purified ESAT-6 exists in a dimerized state in the absence of CFP-10, but our Native-PAGE (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) and SEC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) demonstrate that purified ESAT-6 has no trouble interacting with CFP-10 to form a 1:1 complex. It is unclear whether the observed 1:1 complex is an ESAT-6/CFP-10 heterodimer formed by exchange between ESAT-6 and CFP-10 homodimers, or if we are instead observing formation of a tetramer composed of one each ESAT-6 and CFP-10 homodimers. Further, our low pH BLI results (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>) suggest that self-associated ESAT-6 has no difficulty interacting with CFP-10.</p>
<p>Our modeling and SEC-MALS data suggest that ESAT-6 can interact with itself using both of its faces, one of which is hydrophobic, and one of which is hydrophilic; and both of which are supported by salt bridges formed by charged residues at either edge. This implies that ESAT-6 may still be able to self-associate within membranes via its hydrophilic face. This agrees with the putative requirement for compartment acidification in order to drive membrane damage, as our data suggests that low pH is required for self-association at this interface, but likely does not affect the hydrophobic interface, which must then require a different mechanism for dissociation and membrane insertion. Some have suggested that other mycobacterial factors may help facilitate the membrane insertion of ESAT-6, such as phthiocerol dimycocerosates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Augenstreich et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Modeling approaches have also been used previously to propose an organized ESAT-6 pore structure using similar logic, but these have yet to be supported by physical evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Karki et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Refai et al., 2015</xref>). However, there is precedent for ESAT-6-like WXG proteins to form organized membrane channels, with a recent study demonstrating a pentameric EsxE/EsxF structure capable of membrane insertion and toxin trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Tak et al., 2021</xref>). Critically, EsxE does not dissociate from EsxF in order to insert into the membrane. Such structures have yet to be observed with ESAT-6/CFP-10, but this may just be a matter of finding the appropriate conditions and reagents.</p>
<p>Finding molecular tools to interrogate the function of Mtb virulence factors remains a challenge due to the complexity of accessing Mtb in its native environment within the phagosome. The nanobody described here presents a novel way of targeting the bacteria <italic>in situ</italic>, which we demonstrated by modulating its growth using intracellularly expressed E11rv. Because E11rv showed functional effects both when added in the media and when expressed inside the cell cytoplasm, it suggests a significant amount of communication between Mtb inside the phagosome and other compartments of the cell. This is consistent with the findings of many other studies which show numerous putative activities for ESAT-6 such as induction of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Behura et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Choi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Yang et al., 2015</xref>), inhibition of interferon-γ production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kumar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Peng et al., 2011</xref>), inhibition of autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Romagnoli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Yabaji et al., 2020</xref>), inhibition of antigen presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Sreejit et al., 2014</xref>), induction of type I interferon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Jang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lienard et al., 2020</xref>), and a more recent study showing an ESX-1-dependent mechanism for incorporation of Mtb antigens into MHC-I presentation via cytosolic antigen processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Leddy et al., 2023</xref>). Most of these functions rely on ESAT-6 getting into the cytoplasm, and this may occur via disruptions in the phagosomal membrane to establish two-way communication between compartments, or by complete phagosomal escape of Mtb into the cytoplasm and subsequent secretion of ESAT-6 directly into the cytoplasm.</p>

<p>ESAT-6-LPETG was generated by in vivo assembly (IVA) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">García-Nafría et al., 2016</xref>). PCR was performed on pMRLB.7 using ESAT-6-Fw and ESAT-6-Rv primers using Q5 polymerase with the following recipe and cycle design. Reactions were treated with DpnI for 15 minutes at 37°C. 2 µL of reaction mixture was added directly to 50 µL of chemically competent DH5-α cells, incubated on ice for 30 minutes, heat shocked at 42 for 30 seconds, then immediately added to 200 µL of SOC, after which it was recovered for 30 minutes at 37°C and plated on Luria Bertani (LB)-ampicillin (amp) agar plates, and incubated overnight at 37°C.

Each starter culture was used to inoculate 1L of LB, which was then grown at 37°C until reaching an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.8, at which point it was induced with 0.1 mM IPTG for 4 hours at 37°C. Bacteria was pelleted by centrifugation at 6,000×g for 10 minutes, then frozen at –80°C. Pellets were thawed and resuspended in 25 mL of 10 mM Tris HCl, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mM Imidazole, 1 ug/mL DNase and RNase, 0.5 mg/ml Lysozyme, 10 mM DTT, and 1 tablet/100 mL Sigma fast EDTA free protease inhibitor (Lysis buffer) for 20 minutes. Lysates were sonicated on ice for 30 seconds on and 30 seconds off for a total of 5 minutes. Crude lysates were then clarified by centrifugated at 20,000×g for 20 minutes. Supernatant was decanted and spun again similarly. Ni-NTA beads were washed with 10 mM Tris HCl, 300 mM NaCl, 10 % glycerol (wash buffer). Lysate was applied to 0.5 mL of Ni-NTA beads per liter of bacteria and rocked for 1 hour at 4°C then poured over a 25 mL chromatography column. The column was then washed with 10 column volumes of wash buffer plus 10 mM Imidazole, and then eluted in 10 mL wash buffer plus 250 mM Imidazole.

<p>Hemolysis experiments were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Conrad et al., 2017</xref>). Sheep blood (HemoStat labs, SBC100) was washed with PBS by centrifugation at 3200×g for 5 minutes and resuspended to a final concentration of 1% (v/v) red blood cells (RBC) in PBS. Bacterial cultures, Mm, Mtb, MtbΔRD1 were grown in Middlebrook 7H9 with OADC to an OD<sub>600</sub> between 0.3 and 1.0. Cultures were washed with PBS by centrifugation at 500×g for 5 minutes and resuspended in PBS. The equivalent of 3 mL of culture at OD<sub>600</sub> 1.0 was resuspended in 100 µL of PBS and combined with 100 µL of 1% RBCs. Centrifuged samples at 3200×g for 5 minutes, then incubated the pelleted samples at 37°C for Mtb and MtbΔRD1, or 33°C for Mm for 2 hours. Samples were then resuspended by pipette and spun again similarly. The absorbance at 405 nm was measured for each sample using a plate reader, as well as for samples without bacteria and samples with 0.1% Triton-X100. Percent hemolysis was calculated as (A<sub>405</sub>Sample – A<sub>405</sub>PBS) ÷ (A<sub>405</sub>Triton – A<sub>405</sub>PBS) × 100.</p>

<title>Biolayer interferometry (BLI)</title>
<p>BLI was performed using an Octet Red384 machine (ForteBio). Octet Streptavidin Biosensors (Sartorius, #18-5019) were used for all experiments. Biotinylated proteins were prepared using the succinimide (ESAT-6, CFP-10, RBD) or sortase (ESAT-6-LPETG, E11rv, VHH 52) method. Recombinant SARS-Cov-2 spike RBD was used as a loading control for ESAT-6 and CFP-10 experiments, while VHH 52 against influenza was used as a loading control for E11rv experiments. For all experiments, Biosensors were soaked for 20 minutes in DI water, blocked for 30 seconds in 10mM Citrate, 100mM NaCl, 3mM EDTA, 0.1% BSA, 0.005% Tween-20 (running buffer) which was adjusted to match the pH of the test condition (4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, or 7.5). Biotinylated protein was then loaded onto the biosensors until approximately 1 nm of binding response was observed. Excess protein was washed off with three cycles of 15 seconds in 10 mM glycine pH 1.7 then 15 seconds in running buffer. Washing was followed by a 30 second baseline step in running buffer, an association step with test analyte diluted in running buffer, then dissociation step in plain running buffer. When multiple conditions were tested, the lowest concentration was tested first, and 3 wash cycles were performed between conditions. Loading control biosensors followed the same protocol with identical sample concentrations. Data was collected with Octet Data Acquisition 10.0.0.87 (ForteBio), and data was analyzed with Octet Data Analysis HT 10.0.0.48 (ForteBio). Background subtraction was performed using loading control biosensors, data was aligned to the average of the baseline step, and smoothed by Savitzky-Golay filtering. All data were fit to a 1:1 model using the “full (assoc and dissoc) setting” using the entire step length. Reported kinetic binding constants (K<sub>D</sub>, K<sub>ON</sub>, and K<sub>OFF</sub>) values were calculated by taking the geometric mean of binding constants calculated for individual conditions and replicates. Conditions were excluded from the average when the Data Analysis HT software was unable to calculate all constants for a given condition due to insufficient signal. The only conditions excluded using this criterion were ESAT-6 pH 7.5 self-association at 0.316 nM, and E11rv association with ESAT-6 and ESAT-6-LPETG at 0.33 and 0.1 µM.</p>

<title>Turbidity assay</title>
<p>ESAT-6 was buffer exchanged into PBS using a Zeba spin column (ThermoFisher) and diluted to a concentration of 50 µM. 30 µL of ESAT-6 was added to each well in a 384 well plate. To each well, 2 µL of either PBS or Citrate buffer was added. Citrate buffer contained 50mM citric acid and 100 mM NaCl, and was adjusted for pH such that mixing 5mL buffer with 45mL PBS resulted in a solution with pH 4.5. Plates were immediately added to a plate reader following pH adjustment and A<sub>350</sub> was read every 2 minutes for a total of 60 minutes with 10 seconds of shaking between each read.

<title>Homology Modeling</title>
<p>The ESAT6 and CFP10 protein sequences were modeled via the Homology Modeling protocol in YASARA version 22.09.24. Sidechain optimization occurred through the FoldX plugin, with an energy minimization using AMBER14 force-field. X-ray structures with specified PDB IDs: 3FAV-A, 4J11-B, 4J7K-B, 4J10-A and 4J7J-B (PDB ID-Chain) served as templates for full-length modeling of both proteins, with alternative models considered if alignments were unclear. For CFP10, about 66% aligned with the template, and specific residues (MAEMKTDAAT and RADEEQQQAL) were predicted using loop modeling. Similarly, around 69% of ESAT6 aligned, with residues (STEGNVTGMF and MTEQQW) modeled as described earlier. After side-chain building and optimization, new model components underwent combined steepest descent and simulated annealing minimization. YASARA then integrated the best model parts to create a high-accuracy hybrid for each protein. Structures, dihedrals, and 1D to 3D packing were inspected for optimal monomer models. Dimer models were based on orientations from the 3FAV template, while tetrameric structures were predicted using dimer models as templates via the M-Zdock server.</p>

As such, these were examined at both pH 4.5 and 7.4 through molecular dynamics simulations. These simulations, performed under the NPT ensemble with periodic boundary conditions, provided a sampling of the conformational space available to the various oligomeric forms of ESAT6 and CFP10. The domains were subjected to MD simulations for a period of 50 ns and snapshots were taken at 250 ps intervals for later examination. Each simulation process was run twice with distinct random seeds to confirm the reliability of the simulations. The RMSF of each simulation was plotted as displayed in the Figure.</p>

<p>Protein samples were rapidly thawed and injected onto an integrated fluidics system containing a HDx-3 PAL liquid handling robot and climate-controlled (2°C) chromatography system (LEAP Technologies), a Dionex Ultimate 3000 UHPLC system, as well as an Impact HD QTOF Mass spectrometer (Bruker). The full details of the automated LC system are described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Stariha et al., 2021</xref>). The samples were run over one immobilized pepsin column (Waters; Enzymate Protein Pepsin Column, 300Å, 5µm, 2.1 mm X 30 mm) at 200 µL/min for 3 minutes at 2°C. The resulting peptides were collected and desalted on a C18 trap column (Acquity UPLC BEH C18 1.7mm column (2.1 x 5 mm); Waters 186003975). The trap was subsequently eluted in line with an ACQUITY 1.7 μm particle, 100 × 1 mm<sup>2</sup> C18 UPLC column (Waters), using a gradient of 3-35% B (Buffer A 0.1% formic acid; Buffer B 100% acetonitrile) over 11 minutes immediately followed by a gradient of 35-80% over 5 minutes. Mass spectrometry experiments acquired over a mass range from 150 to 2200 m/z using an electrospray ionization source operated at a temperature of 200°C and a spray voltage of 4.5 kV.</p>

<title>Peptide identification</title>
<p>Peptides were identified from a non-deuterated sample of ESAT6 using data-dependent acquisition following tandem MS/MS experiments (0.5 s precursor scan from 150-2000 m/z; twelve 0.25 s fragment scans from 150-2000 m/z). MS/MS datasets were analysed using PEAKS7 (PEAKS), and peptide identification was carried out by using a false discovery-based approach, with a threshold set to 0.1% using a database of purified proteins and known contaminants. The search parameters were set with a precursor tolerance of 20 ppm, fragment mass error 0.02 Da, charge states from 1-8, leading to a selection criterion of peptides that had a -10logP score of 16.2.</p>

<title>Mass Analysis of Peptide Centroids and Measurement of Deuterium Incorporation</title>
<p>HD-Examiner Software (Sierra Analytics) was used to automatically calculate the level of deuterium incorporation into each peptide. All peptides were manually inspected for correct charge state, correct retention time, appropriate selection of isotopic distribution, etc. Deuteration levels were calculated using the centroid of the experimental isotope clusters. Results are presented as relative levels of deuterium incorporation and the only control for back exchange was the level of deuterium present in the buffer (78.6%). Differences in exchange in a peptide were considered significant if they met all three of the following criteria: ≥4.5% change in exchange, ≥0.45 Da difference in exchange, and a p value &lt;0.01 using a two tailed student t-test. Samples were only compared within a single experiment and were never compared to experiments completed at a different time with a different final D<sub>2</sub>O level. The data analysis statistics for all HDX-MS experiments are in <bold>Supplemental Table 1</bold> according to the guidelines of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Masson et al., 2019</xref>). The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Perez-Riverol et al., 2022</xref>).</p>

<title>Imaging-based Mtb viability assay</title>
<p>Live/Dead H37rv Mtb constitutively express mCherry and have Tet<sup>ON</sup> inducible GFP expression. THP-1 cells were seeded at 40,000 cells/well in glass bottom, black-walled 96 well tissue culture plates and treated with 100 µM Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) for 24 hours prior to infection. Endotoxin free E11rv and unrelated isotype nanobodies were prepared to 1 mg/mL and sterile filtered prior to use. THP-1 cells were infected at an MOI of 1 with Live/Dead Mtb was pre-incubated for 30 minutes with 100 µg/mL of nanobody. Infected plates were incubated for 3 days in tissue culture conditions. Doxycyline was added to a final concentration of 1 µg/mL and incubated for 24 hours. Plates were fixed with 5% formaldehyde in PBS for 1 hour at RT in accordance with OHSU biosafety procedures before removing plates from the BSL3. Plates were then washed with PBS and stained with Phalloidin-AF405 at 1:40 from 6.6 µM stock for 1 hour. Wells were imaged with a Keyence (BZX-710) using a 20× S Plan Fluor ELWD lens. 49 images were captured for each well using the same exposure settings for each experiment. Images were analyzed with CellProfiler 4.2.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Stirling et al., 2021</xref>). Images with obvious defects such as large dust particles were excluded from the analysis. Mean GFP / Mean RFP was calculated for each identified TB particle and the average GFP/RFP value was tabulated for each image. Images were plotted as individual points in Prism (Graphpad) as described in the statistics section.</p>

<title>Continuous luminescence viability assay</title>
<p>THP-1 cells were transduced with lentivirus to express nanobody-GFP fusion constructs for E11rv and VHH 52 under a Tet<sup>ON</sup> promoter (pInducer20 plasmid). The lentiviruses were generated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Niekamp et al., 2021</xref>). THP-1 cells were transduced and selected with 600 µg/mL of G418 for 3 weeks, then maintained with 300 µg/mL G418 in every other passage. For each experiment opaque white 96-well plates were seeded with 30,000 cells/well along with a matched clear plate, both including 100 nM PMA. Cells were incubated with PMA for 24 hours before inducing with 1 µg/mL doxycycline for another 24 hours. Cell health and nanobody expression was verified by microscopy of the clear plate. The opaque plate was infected with bioluminescent pLux Mtb, which expresses the full luxABCDE cassette, at an MOI of 1. The plate was sealed with a Beathe-Easy plate seal (Research Products International 248738) and put into a climate-controlled CLARIOstart plate reader for continuous luminescence reading for 120 hours.</p>

<p>This <bold>useful</bold> study investigates two secreted Mycobacterium tuberculosis proteins, ESAT-6 and CFP10, using biochemical assays, including a Biolayer Interferometry assay. <bold>Solid</bold> experimental evidence demonstrates that ESAT-6 forms a tight interaction with CFP10 as a heterodimer at neutral pH and that ESAT-6 also forms a homodimer at acidic pH. Additional, more definitive evidence is required to describe how these proteins disrupt the phagosomal membrane. While improved compared to a previous version, the revised manuscript did not address these concerns adequately.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors sought to establish a biochemical strategy to study ESAT-6 and CFP-10 biochemistry. They established recombinant reagents to study these protein associations in vitro revealing an unexpected relationship at low pH. They next develop much needed reagents to study these proteins in an infection context and reveal that treatment with an ESAT-6 nanobody enhances Mtb control.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The biochemical conclusions are supported by multiple configurations of the experiments. They combine multiple approaches to study a complex problem.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>It would be valuable to understand if the nanobody is disrupting the formation of the ESAT6-CFP10 complex. It is unclear how the nanobody is functioning to enhance control in the infection context. More detail or speculation in the discussion would have been valuable. Where is the nanobody in the cell during infection?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Bates TA. et al. studied the biochemical characteristics of ESAT-6, a major virulence factor of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), as part of the heterodimer with CFP10, a molecular chaperon of ESAT-6, as in homodimer and in homotetramer using recombinant ESAT-6 and CFP10 expressed in E. coli by applying several biochemical assays including Biolayer Interferometry (BLI) assay. The main findings show that ESAT-6 forms a tight interaction with CFP10 as a heterodimer at neutral pH, and ESAT-6 forms homodimer and even tetramer based larger molecular aggregates at acidic pH. Although the discussion of the potential problems associated with the contamination of ESAT-6 preparations with ASB-14 during the LPS removal step is interesting, but this research does not test the potential impact of residual ASB-14 contaminant on the biochemical behavior ESAT-6-CFP10 heterodimer and ESAT-6 homodimer or tetramer and their hemolytic activity in comparison with the ones without ASB-14. The main strength of this study is the generation of ESAT-6 specific nanobodies and demonstration of its anti-tuberculosis efficiency in THP-1 cell line infected with Mtb strains with reporter genes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Generation and demonstration of the anti-ESAT-6 nanobodies against tuberculosis infection in cell line based Mtb infection model. Probably identifying potential anti-ESAT-6 nanobody interacting amino acid residues of ESAT-6 is critical in understanding their effects on ESAT-6 mediated membrane lytic activity.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although the biochemistry studies provide quantitative data about the interactions of ESAT-6 with its molecular chaperon CFP10 and the interaction of ESAT-6 homodimer and tetramers, the novel information from these studies are minimal.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript describes some biochemical experiments on the crucial virulence factor EsxA (ESAT-6) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. EsxA is secreted via the ESX-1 secretion system. Although this system is recognized to be crucial for virulence the actual mechanisms employed by the ESX-1 substrates are still mostly unknown. The EsxA substrate is attracting most attention as the central player in virulence, especially phagosomal membrane disruption. EsxA is secreted as a dimer together with EsxB. The authors show that EsxA is also able to form homodimers and even tetramers, albeit at very low pH (below 5). Furthermore addition of a nanobody that specifically binds EsxA is blocking intracellular survival, also if the nanobody is produced in the cytosol of the infected macrophages.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Decent biochemical characterization of EsxA and identification of a new and interesting tool to study the function of EsxA (nanobody). Well written.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The findings are not critically evaluated using extra experiments or controls.</p>
<p>
For instance, tetrameric EsxA in itself is interesting and could reveal how EsxA works. But one would say that this is a starting point to make small point mutations that specifically affect tetramer formation and then evaluate what the effect is on phagosomal membrane lysis. Also one would like to see experiments to indicate whether these structures can be produced under in vitro conditions, especially because it seems that this mainly happens when the pH is lower than 5, which is not normally happening in phagosomes that are loaded with M. tuberculosis.</p>
<p>
Also the fact that the addition of the nanobody, either directly to the bacteria or produced in the cytosol of macrophages is interesting, but again the starting point for further experimentation. As a control one would like to se the effect on an Esx-1 secretion mutant. Furthermore, does cytososlic production or direct addition of the nanobody affect phagosomal escape? What happens if an EsxA mutant is produced that does not bind the nanobody?</p>
<p>
Finally, it is a bit strange that the authors use a non-native version of esxA that has not only an additional His-tag but also an additional 12 amino acids, which makes the protein in total almost 20% bigger. Of course these additions do not have to alter the characteristics, but they might. On the other hand they easily discard the natural acetylation of EsxA by mycobacteria itself (proven for M. marinum) as not relevant for the function because it might not happen in (the close homologue) M. tuberculosis.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Will the nanobody be available to the TB research community?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, we will make E11rv available upon request. Please see our materials availability statement.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) It would be interesting to test the potential impact of residual ASB-14 contaminant on the biochemical behavior of ESAT-6-CFP10 heterodimer and ESAT-6 homodimer or tetramer and their hemolytic activity in comparison with the ones without ASB-14.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that this is an interesting line of questioning. Based on the study by Refai et al. that we cite in the text, ESAT-6 treated with nonionic detergents ASB-14 or LDAO, but not other common detergents, undergoes a conformational change that increases its cytotoxicity in cell assays, hemolytic activity, and ability to dimerize with CFP-10. What is not known at this point, is how similar the ASB-bound conformation is to anything seen physiologically.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Building on the progress in making anti-ESAT-6 nanobodies and their anti-Mtb effects in the cells, it could have been tested in human or mouse primary macrophages infected with Mtb and a mouse model of Mtb infection for its anti-Mtb efficiency.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, and we agree that these would be very informative next steps for determining the therapeutic potential of anti-ESAT-6 nanobodies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Minor comments:</p>
<p>Line 133: &quot;It is well established that Mm-induced hemolysis is ESX-1 dependent, but our results suggest that Mtb must lack one or more factors necessary for efficient hemolysis.&quot;. I would tone this down a bit, as it is also known that M. tuberculosis escapes much later than M. marinum from the phagosome, which could indicate different kinetics.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their insightful comments. We agree that the kinetics of Mtb and Mm infection are quite different and that this may impact the hemolysis assay. As described by Augenstreich et al. some hemolysis by Mtb is observed at 48 hours, though the method of normalization makes it impossible to determine absolute amount of hemolysis that occurred in their experiment. Our findings just show that the absolute amount of Mtb hemolysis in 2 hours is negligible, setting it apart from Mm. We have edited the wording of this statement in the manuscript to avoid any confusion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 155: &quot;Because Mtb often exists in an acidified compartment&quot;. First of all, the reference used here does not discuss anything about Mtb, secondly, papers that do measure the acidification of Mtb-loaded phagosomes indicate that this acidification is very mild (typically to pH 6.2).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that this point should be articulated more precisely. We have added additional clarification that the pH of Mtb-containing compartments in macrophages can fall in a broad range depending on the activation state of the macrophages, and that non-activated macrophages are typically only mildly acidic. We have updated our references to better describe the current state of knowledge on this topic.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 339: &quot;Whereas most of these functions rely only on the secretion of ESAT-6 into the cytoplasm, the ability of E11rv to access Mtb suggests that this communication is likely two-way.&quot; No, not necessary, there are many processes in which ESX-1 substrates affect the macrophage. This nanobody could affect EsxA functioning only once the bacteria reach the cytoplasm. I think checking phagosomal escape in these cells is therefore crucial.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that phagosomal escape and subsequent direct secretion of ESAT-6 into the cytoplasm is a reasonable alternative hypothesis. We have added this point to our discussion, and we agree that looking directly at phagosomal escape is an important next step.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 7 is not mentioned in the text (mistake for Fig 6).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This has been corrected.</p>
