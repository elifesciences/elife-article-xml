<title>Abstract</title><p>The claustrum complex is viewed as fundamental for higher order cognition; however, the circuit organization and function of its neuroanatomical subregions are not well understood. We demonstrated that some of the key roles of the CLA complex can be attributed to the connectivity and function of a small group of neurons in its ventral subregion, the endopiriform (EN). We identified a subpopulation of EN neurons by their projection to the ventral CA1 (EN<sup>vCA1-proj.</sup> neurons), embedded in recurrent circuits with other EN neurons and the piriform cortex. Although the EN<sup>vCA1-proj.</sup> neuron activity was biased toward novelty across stimulus categories, their chemogenetic inhibition selectively disrupted the memory-guided but not innate responses of mice to novelty. Based on our functional connectivity analysis, we suggest that EN<sup>vCA1-proj.</sup> neurons serve as an essential node for recognition memory through recurrent circuits mediating sustained attention to novelty, and through feed forward inhibition of distal vCA1 neurons shifting memory-guided behavior from familiarity to novelty.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The claustrum (CLA) complex, an evolutionarily conserved brain region found across mammalian species, reptiles, and birds, is hypothesized to serve as a node for establishing higher order cognitive functions by coordinating neuronal activity on a global scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). This view is based on its extensive connections with many cortical and subcortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Some of these functions include sensory perception and attention, which may affect memory processing, including working memory, associative memory, and recognition memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Consistent with this view, abnormalities of the CLA complex is found in major cognitive disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). However, microcircuitry and functional segregation of the individual constituents of the CLA complex have remained unclear.</p>
<p>The cytoarchitecture and genetic expression broadly divide the CLA complex into dorsal and ventral parts, with the dorsal part typically referred to as “CLA” and ventral part having its own nomenclature: “endopiriform (EN)” in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Current evidence indicates that the CLA forms reciprocal connections with dorsal cortices containing sensory, motor and association areas generating diverse physiological effects depending on the cortical targets and their activity patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). In contrast, EN primarily provides inputs to the piriform cortex and limbic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), suggesting its distinct circuit organization and role in bridging olfactory information processed by the piriform cortex and memory processed by the limbic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>).</p>
<p>One of distinct targets of EN, the ventral CA1 (vCA1), is known to coordinate in a range of behaviors related to exploration and recognition memory, and these functions are thought to be regulated by its afferent inputs in a domain-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). We, therefore, hypothesized that EN is a key node for establishment of recognition memory. To address this, we set out to characterize circuit and function of EN neurons defined by their projection to vCA1 (EN <sup>vCA1-proj.</sup> neurons) using genetic tools and mouse models of social and object recognition memory.</p>
<p>We found EN <sup>vCA1-proj.</sup> neurons innervated multiple components of the limbic system except amygdala and prefrontal cortex and produced potent feedforward inhibitory control over vCA1 pyramidal neurons. During recognition memory test, activity of EN <sup>vCA1-proj.</sup> neurons were condensed around conspecifics or objects where mice spent most time on. However, disruption of EN <sup>vCA1-proj.</sup> activity only impaired memory-guided exploration of novel stimuli without affecting innate exploration induced by novelty. These findings demonstrate that EN subserves some of the key functions required for recognition memory governed by specific limbic system.</p>

<title>Endopiriform represents a major afferent of the ventral CA1</title>
<p>To assess the significance of EN as a vCA1 afferents, we injected a retrograde tracer (60 nl) into the vCA1 of mice and compared the number of the retrogradely labeled neurons in the EN and other brain regions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A, B</xref>, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">S1A</xref>, Methods). We found labeled neurons in multiple areas including the septum, entorhinal cortex, and basolateral amygdala (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C-F</xref> and <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). In addition to these well-known vCA1 afferents, prominent labeling was observed in the area defined as EN in Allen Brain Atlas (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>, Methods). The number of presynaptic neurons in EN was ∼10 fold lower than entorhinal cortex (data not shown). However, the normalized count of presynaptic neurons in EN was significantly greater than basolateral amygdala, lateral septum, and medial septum (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>).</p>

<p>The vCA1-projecting neurons in the EN were spread along antero-posterior axis with two peak densities, one in anterior and another in posterior to the bregma (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I, J</xref>). Number of labeled neurons was greater in posterior EN (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref>). In contrast, the same analysis along dorso-ventral axis showed a single dominant peak at the depth consistent with the location of EN (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C</xref>). To further confirm the location of these vCA1-projecting neurons, we injected a retrograde tracer (60 nl for each) in one color into vCA1 and a retrograde tracer in another color into a cortical area known to receive projections from EN or “CLA” representing a dorsal part of CLA complex (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). We targeted the prefrontal cortex to label EN, and the anterior cingulate cortex, the motor cortex, and the dorsomedial entorhinal cortex to label CLA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C-F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>).</p>

<p>We found there is a major spatial overlap in labeling of vCA1-projecting neurons with prefrontal cortex-projecting neurons, but not with other cortical projection neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G-J</xref>). Moreover, around 30% of vCA1-projecting neurons were found to be double-labelled when a cortical injection was made into the prefrontal cortex, suggesting some vCA1-projecting neurons send axons to this cortical area (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2K, L</xref>).</p>
<p>To further determine the cortical and subcortical innervation pattern of vCA1-projecting EN neurons, we used an intersectional approach to label their somata and axons with eGFP. CAV2-Cre (60 nl) was injected into the vCA1 and flox-eGFP (100 nl) was injected into the EN (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2M</xref>). Apart from vCA1, axons from vCA1-projecting neurons were found in various cortical areas including prefrontal cortex, lateral entorhinal cortex, and piriform cortex (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2N-P</xref> and <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A-C</xref>). Projection to prefrontal cortex was much sparser relative to that of vCA1, as expected based on the retrograde labeling data (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2K</xref>). The connectivity of vCA1-projecting EN neurons to the amygdala, which represents the major component of limbic systems, was also sparse relative to vCA1 (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2C</xref>), indicating vCA1 is the main target of these EN neurons in this system. Within the hippocampus, very sparse EN axons were observed in vCA3 and dentate gyrus (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2D</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these findings indicate EN represents a major afferent of vCA1. Moreover, EN neurons projecting their axons to vCA1 also send strong collaterals to lateral entorhinal cortex and piriform cortex, but relatively weak to the prefrontal cortex or other limbic structures. Since our subsequent study focused on EN neurons defined by their projection to vCA1, we refer to them as EN<sup>vCA1-proj.</sup> neurons.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Projection pattern and synaptic connectivity of EN axons in vCA1</title>
<p>We next investigated projection pattern of EN axons in hippocampus by injecting an anterograde tracer (AAV-GFP, 60 nl) into the EN (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A, B</xref>). Analysis of different parts of hippocampal section indicated EN axons were mostly confined in SLM layer of distal part of vCA1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C, D</xref>). Projection to intermediate or dorsal CA1 was limited or undetectable (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A-C</xref>). Since SLM mainly consists of GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>), we hypothesized that EN axons form synapses with this cell type. To test this, we first applied monosynaptic rabies tracing technique to Vgat-Cre mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, Methods). The distribution of starter cells (identified by GFP and mCherry co-labeling) was confirmed to be within the ventral-intermediate region of hippocampus using AMaSiNe (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">S4A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>).

<p>To determine how EN inputs are integrated into the local circuit in vCA1, we systematically assessed the connections between EN axons and GABAergic neurons in different layers of distal vCA1. We expressed channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) into the EN axons by injecting AAV-ChR2-mCherry (100 nl) into EN and performed whole-cell recording from GABAergic neurons in acute vCA1 slices in the presence of TTX (1 µM) and 4-AP (100 µM) to isolate monosynaptic connection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). To ensure the recording from GABAergic neurons, we used Vgat::Ai14 mice in which all GABAergic neurons are labeled with tdTomato (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E-G</xref>). We recorded from 3 to 4 GABAergic neurons located in different laminar position in distal vCA1 (Py-SR border, SR, SR-SLM border, or SLM) in the same slice to construct a “laminar profile” of EN◊vCA1 inputs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F and G</xref>). Whole-field LED stimulation evoked excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) in most GABAergic neurons recorded. However, contrary to the expectation, connection probability and strength were lowest in neurons in SLM compared to neurons in other layers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H-J</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate EN axons preferentially innervate the GABAergic neurons spanning across the Py-SR border to SR-SLM border in distal vCA1.</p>

<p>SLM also contains the apical tuft dendrite of pyramidal neurons, which could be a target of EN axons in addition to GABAergic neurons. To test this, we expressed ChR2 in EN axons but made whole-cell recording from pyramidal neurons in distal vCA1 in the presence of TTX and 4-AP. Since CA1 pyramidal neurons can be differentiated into superficial and deep layer neurons with distinct anatomy and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>), we recorded from neurons in each layer as well as nearby GABAergic neurons at the Py-SR and SR-SLM borders for the comparison (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>).

<p>Since EN axons innervated multiple GABAergic neurons across different layers, we hypothesized they may exert stronger inhibition onto pyramidal neurons through feed-forward inhibition. To test this, we recorded EPSC and inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) from superficial and deep pyramidal neurons using cesium-based internal solution in the brain slices expressing ChR2 in the EN axons (Methods). At the command potential of −70 mV, photo-stimulation of EN axons evoked EPSCs in majority of pyramidal neurons in both layers (7 out of 10 neurons in superficial and 5 out of 10 neurons in deep) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). At the command potential of +12 mV, the same stimulation evoked outward postsynaptic current in the same neurons, including those without EPSCs (10 out of 10 for superficial and deep) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). This outward current was abolished by application of TTX and 4-AP or gabazine (10 µM), indicating it is disynaptically driven and mediated by inhibitory GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). When relative strength of EPSCs and IPSCs were compared for each neuron, the strength of IPSCs overwhelmed the EPSCs in all cases (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>).

<p>Although EN<sup>vCA1-proj.</sup> activity was correlated with the behavior in pretest/familiarization and discrimination test better than sociability test, their causality is unclear.

<p>Apart from recognition memory, vCA1 is implicated in anxiety and associative fear memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>), thus, we tested contribution of EN<sup>vCA1-proj.</sup> neurons to these functions.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We characterized the circuit and function of EN neurons targeting specific subregions and layers of vCA1. In contrast to other parts of CLA complex, EN<sup>vCA1-proj.</sup> neurons were reciprocally connected with the piriform cortex representing a major downstream target of the olfactory bulb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). Since social odor information is crucial for discriminating conspecifics in rodents, this circuit motif may predict the predominant role of EN<sup>vCA1-proj.</sup> neurons in social recognition memory, given that social odor can engage multiple olfactory pathways innervating the piriform cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). However, we found that these neurons contributed to broader domains of recognition memory. This is supported by the observations that the inhibition of EN<sup>vCA1-proj.</sup> activity impaired both social and non-social discrimination.</p>
<p>In all phases of recognition memory test, EN <sup>vCA1-proj.</sup> activity was highly correlated with the time mice spent in given locations and this correlation was biased towards novel stimuli when mice were engaged in their exploration irrespective of the stimuli being social or non-social (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that the function of EN<sup>vCA1-proj.</sup> neurons was primarily related to the detection of and attention to novel stimuli. The recurrent connections within EN, which is another prominent feature of EN<sup>vCA1-proj.</sup> neurons’ network, potentially support these processes to help establish the recognition memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>).</p>

<p>Attentional processes mediated by EN<sup>vCA1-proj.</sup> neurons can be considered of particular relevance for memory-guided behavior, given that inhibition of EN<sup>vCA1-proj.</sup> activity selectively impaired conspecific/object discrimination but not innate exploratory behavior provoked by novelty as seen in pretest, sociability, and familiarization (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref>). The correlation of EN<sup>vCA1-proj.</sup> activity with novel object preference in the pretest nevertheless suggests that these neurons ‘represent’ the innate preference without driving it. This functional specialization, likely associated with its unique circuit connectivity to the limbic system, could differentiate EN from CLA.</p>
<p>Studies on EN are generally scarce, and the available evidence of EN projections to vCA1 suggests that these projections are sparse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Potential reasons include the difficulty in clearly delineating the EN from CLA complex and non-uniform distribution of EN<sup>vCA1-proj.</sup> neurons along antero-posterior axis. By leveraging contemporary circuit analysis tools, we demonstrated that the EN◊vCA1 circuit is non-trivial; EN<sup>vCA1-proj.</sup> neurons were more numerous than commonly studied vCA1 afferents, including those from the septum and amygdala. Moreover, these axons exhibited a potent disynaptic inhibition of distal vCA1 pyramidal neurons, indicating their major functional implications for vCA1 activity.</p>
<p>Our data indicated that although EN axons terminated at the SLM of distal vCA1, they exhibited stronger connections to GABAergic neurons spanning from the Py-SR border to the SR-SLM border than to SLM neurons. The detection of EN inputs from GABAergic neurons at the Py-SR border was surprising, considering the distance between soma position and the EN axons. However, there are several GABAergic cell types below SLM that extend their primary dendrites into SLM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>), likely explaining the observed connectivity pattern. Among these are chandelier cells found at the Py-SR border, which preferentially inhibits the axon initial segments of pyramidal neurons, and are thus well suited to exert the powerful feedforward inhibition of vCA1 pyramidal neurons observed in our recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>).</p>
<p>There are several potential circuit effects by which EN inputs could affect vCA1 function. One is the induction of non-linear events in vCA1 pyramidal neurons by acting in concert with other afferents (e.g., lateral entorhinal cortex targeting SLM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>) to generate a specific output pattern in pyramidal assemblies representing task-relevant stimuli. Alternatively, EN inputs may improve signal to noise ratio of the information conveyed through the lateral entorhinal cortex, CA2 (in the case of social context), and possibly other afferents (e.g., CA3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Another scenario is tuning of vCA1 pyramidal neurons’ response to familiar stimuli through dynamic combination of a weak monosynaptic excitatory input and strong disynaptic inhibitory input. Such mechanism suggests that at a milliseconds scale novelty (EN) and familiarity (vCA1) recognition might occur though alternating rather than simultaneous activity of brain microcircuits. Taken together, we propose a model for the role of EN<sup>vCA1-proj.</sup> neurons in recognition memory by balancing memory-guided attentional responses to familiarity and novelty through combination of feedforward inhibition of vCA1 (a node for recognition of familiarity) and the recurrent circuits that contribute to sustain attention to novelty (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B</xref>).</p>
<p>The model of promoting novelty detection by suppressing familiarity responses is consistent with previous observations showing that vCA1 pyramidal neurons predominantly respond to familiar stimuli whereas novelty response can only occur through activation of vCA1 interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). Nevertheless, alternating activation of EN and vCA1 could prove essential for the behavioral relevance of EN activity associated with recognition memory, without affecting innate exploratory behavior to novelty. Accordingly, the latter behavior is primarily associated with the prefrontal cortex and amygdala, areas that are only weakly targeted by EN<sup>vCA1-proj.</sup> neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2P</xref>, <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">S2C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to advancing our understanding of the basic organization and function of brain circuits underlying higher cognitive processes, our findings suggest dysfunction of EN<sup>vCA1-proj.</sup> neurons could be a key contributing factor to the deficits in CLA complex function and recognition memory found in neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Discrete EN populations can thus emerge as pathophysiological substrate, but also as important treatment targets of key symptoms of these disorders.</p>

<title>Stereotaxic injections</title>
<p>Stereotaxic injections were performed using a stereotaxic frame (Model 940, Kopf). Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and were subcutaneously injected with buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) and metacam (1.5 mg/Kg) for post-operative pain relief. After incising the scalp over the cranium, a small hole was bored with a microdrill bit, and a beveled glass pipette (Wiretrol II, 5-000-2010, Drummond Scientific Company) back-filled with mineral oil and front-filled with the material to be injected was slowly inserted into a target coordinate. After injecting a small volume (50 - 100 nL) with a custom-made displacement injector (based on MO-10, Narishige), the pipette was left in place for 3 to 5 mins before slow retraction. The incision was closed with a nylon suture. The stereotaxic coordinates used were (relative to bregma, in mm): anteroposterior (AP) −3.0; mediolateral (ML) 3.12; dorsoventral (DV) 3.7 for ventral CA1; AP +2.0; ML 0.2; DV 1.5 and 2.5 for prefrontal cortex; AP 0.0; ML 0.2; DV 1.0 and 1.5 for anterior cingulate cortex; AP 0.0; ML 1.5; DV 0.3 and 0.7 for motor cortex; and AP −5.0; ML 3.0; DV 1.5 for dorsomedial entorhinal cortex. For endopiriform injection, we injected two sites from the following coordinates: AP −0.27, ML 3.2, DV 4.2; AP 0.0, ML 3.0, DV 4.2; or AP +1.0, ML 2.7, DV 4.0. Mice were thermally supported with a feedback-controlled heating pad maintained at ∼37 °C (ThermoStar Homeothermic system, RWD). Mice were used for experiments 3-5 weeks post injection.</p>

<p>Whole-cell recording was performed with an upright microscope (BX51WI, Olympus) equipped with a motor-controlled stage and focus (MP285A and MPC-200, Sutter instrument), differential interference contrast, coolLED (model pE300), and a monochrome camera (Moment, Teledyne). Neurons were visualized with a 60x lens (1.00 NA, LUMPlanFL N, Olympus) with the software Micro-Manager-2.0 gamma (US National Institutes of Health). Pipettes (4-5 MΩ) were pulled from thick-walled borosilicate capillary glass with a puller (model P-1000, Sutter instrument). For a voltage-clamp recording, the internal solution contained (in mM): 135 CsMeSO<sub>3</sub>, 10 HEPES, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, 8 Na<sub>2</sub>-Phosphocreatine, 3.3 QX-314 (pH was adjusted to 7.35 with CsOH). In some experiments, a biocytin (4 mg/mL) and Alexa488/586 (50 μM) were further added for morphological studies. Recordings and hardware control were performed with Wavesurfer (Janelia Farm). Signals were amplified and Bessel filtered at 4 kHz with an amplifier (MultiClamp 700B, Molecular Device), then sampled at 10 kHz with a data acquisition board (USB-6343, National Instrument). Recording with access resistance change of &gt; 20% from the baseline (∼30 MΩ or less) were discarded. Liquid junction potential was not corrected. All recordings were performed at ∼34 °C maintained with the inline heating system (TC-324C, Warner instrument).</p>
<p>To stimulated channelrhodopsin-2, a blue LED was delivered at a short pulse (5-msec) through a 4x objective lens (0.16 NA, UPlanSApo, Olympus). The light power (measured at the focal plane) was 20 mW for the recordings in normal ACSF and 40 mW for the recordings in the presence of tetrodotoxin and 4-aminopyridine. Photo-stimulation was repeated 3 to 6 times (at intervals of 10 or 20 sec) to obtain an average response trace. Photo-evoked responses less than 2 standard deviations of the baseline were considered as a “zero” response. The mean amplitudes indicate mean amplitudes between LED stimulus-onset to 50 ms of average responses.</p>

<title>Quantification of presynaptic neurons</title>
<p>Mice were deeply anaesthetized with a ketamine (120 mg/kg) and xylazine (24 mg/kg) mixture and were transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The brains were extracted and immersed in 4% PFA overnight followed by 20 and 30% sucrose solution for a cryoprotection. The brains were subsequently embedded in O.C.T compound (Tissue TEK, Sakura) in a mold and frozen on the dry ice. Coronal slices (100 µm) of entire brain were cut with Cryostat (CM3050S, Leica) and were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before DAPI staining. All sections were mounted onto glass slides with a coverslip (thickness:0.13-0.17 mm, Hounisen) and mounting media (DAKO, S3023, Agilent Technologies).</p>

<p>For the visualization and quantification of presynaptic neuron distribution in a 3D mouse brain, epifluorescence images were acquired using a Slidescanner (4231 x 3462 pixels, 10x objective, Olympus VS120) and analyzed with the MATLAB-based program AMaSiNe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Specifically, for <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, coronal sections between AP +3 mm and −4 mm were registered in AMaSiNe, which semi-automatically detects fluorescently labeled presynaptic cells across all sections. To control for transfection variability (which may arise from slight difference in injection volume or site), we normalized the number of presynaptic neurons in the specified brain areas (shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>) by the total number of presynaptic neurons in those regions.</p>
<p>For the monosynaptic rabies tracing study in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, the brain areas containing over 1% presynaptic cells of total presynaptic cells were proceeded further analysis.

The sections were then washed with PBS and were further incubated with secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit conjugated with Alexa 488 or 568, 1:500) (A11008 or A11036, Thermo Fisher) for 1 hour at room temperature before mounting. A single plane image of CLA complex was acquired with confocal microscope (10x objective, 1024 x 1024 pixels, Zeiss). 2-4 images, range of AP: +1.4 to −0.2, were collected per brain. Fraction of double-labelled neurons (with different retrograde tracers) were calculated for each brain by dividing a total number of double-labeled neurons by the total number of vCA1-projecting neurons (labeled with one color).</p>

<title>Social memory test with chemogenetic inhibition of EN<sup>vCA1-proj.</sup> neurons</title>
<p>Social memory test is based on previous articles with slight modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>). All tested mice were habituated to the handling for 3 days. The water-soluble CNO purchased from Hellobio was dissolved by saline (final concentration was 0.1mg/ml). Prior to the test day, we divided subject mice into two groups. On the 1<sup>st</sup> test day (session 1), one group received chlozapine-N-oxide (CNO, 1 mg/kg, i.p.) and another group received a vehicle. After 30 mins, the subject mice were placed in a three-chamber box for 5 mins (habituation), then the same box with two pencil chambers containing the same object in opposite corners for 5 mins (pretest). After 5 mins break in their home cage, the subject mice were again placed in the same box, but this time, an object in one pencil chamber was replaced with different object and an object in another pencil chamber was replaced with a conspecific (3-4 weeks old male, habituated to the handling and pencil chamber for 3 days prior to the session 1). This “sociability test” lasted for 10 mins and was followed by social discrimination test after 30 mins break in the home cage. The social discrimination test lasted for 5 mins and consisted of the same setting as the sociability test except an object in a pencil chamber, which was replaced with a new conspecific (i.e., a novel mice). In the following day, CNO and saline treatments were swapped between the groups, and all mice went through the same series of tests (session 2) for the within-subject comparison of the CNO effect. The position of the pencil chamber including an object or a conspecific were counterbalanced. The tests were performed under 6-10 lx room light and video was recorded at 25 frames/sec with GigE camera (Basler ace acA1300-60gm, Basler) placed at the ceiling.</p>

<title>Trace fear conditioning</title>
<p>After one week of social memory test, subject mice were examined for their tone-associated fear memory and extinction. One group received CNO while another group received vehicle 45 mins before the test. In conditioning day, mice were placed in a box with a metal grid floor and ethanol odor (context A) and after 3 mins were delivered with 20-sec pure tone (2 kHz, 20 dB) followed by 18-sec time gap (trace) and 2-sec footshock (0.5 mA). The exposure to the same tone-trace-shock sequence was repeated 2 more times with inter-trial interval of 2 mins. In the following day, mice were re-exposed to the context A for 3 mins to assess their fear memory to the context. From day 3, mice were placed in a new context, the context B (smooth floor, breach odor), and went through the same protocol as in conditioning day but without shocks. The process was repeated over 5 days to assess the extinction of the fear memory to the tone and trace. All test was performed in dark (but infrared light was on), and behavior was video recorded at 25 frames/sec with infrared GigE camera (Basler ace acA1300-60gm, Basler).</p>

<title>Social memory test and novel object recognition test with <italic>in vivo</italic> fiber photometry</title>
<p>Optic probe implanted mice were habituated handling for 3 days prior the test. In test day, the subject mouse attached with patch code were placed in an open field box (50 x 50 cm) for 5 min (habituation). After habituation, the mouse was place in a home cage for resting and waiting following session. For pretest, pencil chambers containing the same objects were placed at the corners of the open field box. Pretest was tested for 5 min. For sociability test, a novel mouse (4 weeks old, male) or a novel object were placed in pencil chambers. Sociability test took 10 min. After sociability test, the subject mouse return to a home cage and rest for 20 min. After 20 min rest, the subject mouse was tested discrimination session for 5 min. In discrimination test, a novel mouse (4 weeks old, male) or a familiar mouse that was used as the stimulus mouse in sociability test were placed in pencil chambers. Both in sociability and discrimination test, positions of pencil chambers were counterbalanced between subject mice. The tests were performed under 6-10 lux room light and video was recorded at 60 frames/sec with GigE camera (Basler ace acA1300-60gm, Basler) placed at the ceiling.

<title>Behavior data acquisition and analysis</title>
<p>Ethovision (version 16 or 17, Noldus) was used for the hardware control and data acquisition and initial quantification for the behavior. Behavioral variables, including movement trajectory, times spent in predefined areas, total distance traveled, travelling velocity, and freezing were extracted and further analyzed/nested with custom functions in the Matlab (R2020b). For social memory test, interaction zones were defined as an area between the edge of pencil chamber and 3 cm away from the edge. When the nose of the subject mouse was in the zone, the time was counted as interaction time. Sociability index was calculated by dividing total interaction time with mouse by total interaction time with mouse and object. The discrimination index was calculated by dividing total interaction time with a novel mouse by total interaction time with a familiar mouse and a novel mouse. Data from mice were excluded if discrimination index was less than 0.5 during saline treatment. For trace fear conditioning test, mice were considered “freezing” if pixel change between frames was less than 0.1 % for more than 1 sec.</p>
<p>Deeplabcut (ver.2.3) was used for tracking of annotated body points of the subject mice connected with patch code for calcium imaging of EN<sup>vCA1-proj.</sup> neurons during social memory test and novel object recognition test.

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study offers insights into the function and connectivity patterns of a relatively unknown afferent input from the endopiriform to the CA1 subfield of the ventral hippocampus, suggesting a neural mechanism that suppresses the processing of familiar stimuli in favor of detecting memory guided novelty. The strength of evidence is <bold>convincing</bold>, with careful anatomical and electrophysiological circuit characterization. The work will be of broad interest to researchers studying the neural circuitry of behavior.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The anatomical connectivity of the claustrum and the role of its output projections has, thus far, not been studied in detail. The aim of this study was to map the outputs of the endopiriform (EN) region of the claustrum complex, and understand their functional role. Here the authors have combined sophisticated intersectional viral tracing techniques, and ex vivo electrophysiology to map the neural circuitry of EN outputs to vCA1, and shown that optogenetic inhibition of the EN→vCA1 projection impairs both social and object recognition memory. Interestingly the authors find that the EN neurons target inhibitory interneurons providing a mechanism for feedforward inhibition of vCA1.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strength of this study was the application of a multilevel analysis approach combining a number of state-of-the-art techniques to dissect the contribution of the EN→vCA1 to memory function.</p>
<p>In addition the authors conducted behavioural analysis of locomotor activity, anxiety and fear memory, and complemented the analysis of discrimination with more detailed description of the patterns of exploratory behaviour.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Yamawaki et al., conducted a series of neuroanatomical tracing and whole cell recording experiments to elucidate and characterise a relatively unknown pathway between the endopiriform (EN) and CA1 of the ventral hippocampus (vCA1) and to assess its functional role in social and object recognition using fibre photometry and dual vector chemogenetics. The main findings were that the EN sends robust projections to the vCA1 that collateralise to the prefrontal cortex, lateral entorhinal cortex and piriform cortex, and these EN projection neurons terminate in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare (SLM) layer of distal vCA1, synapsing onto GABAergic neurons that span across the Pyramidal-Stratum Radiatum (SR) and SR-SML borders. It was also demonstrated that EN input disynaptically inhibits vCA1 pyramidal neurons. vCA1 projecting EN neurons receive afferent input from piriform cortex, and from within EN. Finally, fibre photometry experiments revealed that vCA1 projecting EN neurons are most active when mice explore novel objects or conspecifics, and pathway-specific chemogenetic inhibition led to an impairment in the ability to discriminate between novel vs. familiar objects and conspecifics.</p>
<p>This is an interesting mechanistic study that provides valuable insights into the function and connectivity patterns of afferent input from the endopiriform to the CA1 subfield of the ventral hippocampus. The authors propose that the EN input to the vCA1 interneurons provides a feedforward inhibition mechanism by which memory-based novelty detection could be promoted. The experiments are carefully conducted, and the methodological approaches used are sound. The conclusions of the paper are supported by the data presented.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Yamawaki et al., conducted a series of neuroanatomical tracing and whole cell recording experiments to elucidate and characterise a relatively unknown pathway between the endopiriform (EN) and CA1 of the ventral hippocampus (vCA1) and to assess its functional role in social and object recognition using fibre photometry and dual vector chemogenetics. The main findings were that the EN sends robust projections to the vCA1 that collateralise to the prefrontal cortex, lateral entorhinal cortex and piriform cortex, and these EN projection neurons terminate in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare (SLM) layer of distal vCA1, synapsing onto GABAergic neurons that span across the Pyramidal-Stratum Radiatum (SR) and SR-SML borders. It was also demonstrated that EN input disynaptically inhibits vCA1 pyramidal neurons. vCA1 projecting EN neurons receive afferent input from piriform cortex, and from within EN. Finally, fibre photometry experiments revealed that vCA1 projecting EN neurons are most active when mice explore novel objects or conspecifics, and pathway-specific chemogenetic inhibition led to an impairment in the ability to discriminate between novel vs. familiar objects and conspecifics.</p>
<p>The authors have addressed most of my concerns, but a few weaknesses remain :</p>
<p>
(1) I expected to see the addition of raw interaction times with objects and conspecifics for each phase of social testing (pre-test, sociability test, social discrimination), as per my comment on including raw data. However, the authors only provided total distance traveled and velocity, and total interaction time in Figure S9, which is less informative.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologies for missing the request. We have added the raw interaction times in Fig. S9G.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors observed increased activity in vCA1-projecting EN neurons tracking with the preferred object during the pre-test (object-object exploration) phase of the social tests, and the summary schematic (Figure 9A) depicts animals as showing a preference for one object over the other (although they are identical) in both the social and object recognition tests. However, in the chemogenetic experiment, the data (Fig S9B) indicate that animals did not show this preference for one object over another, making the expected baseline for this task unclear. This also raises an important question of whether the lack of effect from chemogenetic inhibition of vCA1-projecting EN neurons could be attributed to the absence of this baseline preference.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the comments. In Fig. S9B, although the group median at baseline (pretest) showed no preference for one object, individual subjects displayed a preference for one object (i.e., each data point deviated positively or negatively from 0.5) in saline condition. Therefore, we do not think that a lack of baseline preference accounts for the absence of the inhibition effect in the pretest.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Additionally, the finding that vCA1-projecting EN activity is associated with the preferred object exploration appears to counter the authors' argument that novelty engages this circuit (since both objects are novel in this instance). This discrepancy warrants further discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an interesting point. One possibility is that during the pretest, EN activity simply &quot;reports&quot; or &quot;represents&quot; the interaction time without driving exploratory preference. This aligns with our DREADD experiment data, which show that inhibition of EN neurons produced no overall behavioral effect. Innate exploratory behavior has been attributed to various circuits, including the medial preoptic area → PAG circuit (Ryoo et al., 2021, Front. Neuro.) and the Septal → VTA circuit (Mocellin et al., 2024, Neuron). We found no direct projection from these areas to EN (Fig. 6), but such connections could be established di- or polysynaptically. Moreover, these circuits could be driven by common inputs, such as the locus coeruleus or the cholinergic system for arousal, with only specific downstream targets, excluding EN, playing a key role in driving innate exploration and preference.</p>
<p>We have inserted the following sentence in discussion (line 253-255):</p>
<p>“The correlation of ENvCA1-proj. activity with novel object preference in the pretest nevertheless suggests that these neurons 'represent' the innate preference without driving it.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Line 209: Please remove the reference to neural activity 'predicting' behavior, as correlation analysis does not imply predictive power.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now have changed the phrase to “Although EN<sup>vCA1-proj.</sup> activity was correlated with the behavior…”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 236: It is unclear what is meant by: 'This circuit motif may predict the predominant role of ENvCA1-proj. neurons in social recognition memory'</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have changed the sentence to the following for the clarity:</p>
<p>“Since social odor information is crucial for discriminating conspecifics in rodents, this circuit motif may predict the predominant role of ENvCA1-proj. neurons in social recognition memory, given that social odor can engage multiple olfactory pathways innervating the piriform cortex.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Fig 7 title: insert 'with' after correlates: 'Activity of ENvCA1-proj. neurons correlates social/object discrimination performance'</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Corrected.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Fig S1 title: 'Projecing' typo.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Corrected.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Fig S8: Please rephrase for clarity: 'In pretest, the object was aligned by longer interaction time (preferred object is plotted in right side)'</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now have rephrased the sentence to:</p>
<p>“In the pretest plot, the object that the mice interacted with more is placed on the right side.”</p>
