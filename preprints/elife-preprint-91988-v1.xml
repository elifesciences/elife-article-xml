<title>Abstract</title><p>Many cell fate decisions are determined transcriptionally. Accordingly, some fate specification is prevented by Inhibitor of DNA binding (Id) proteins that interfere with certain master regulatory transcription factors. We report that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Id protein Extra macrochaetae (Emc) also affects developmental decisions by regulating caspase activity. Emc, which prevents proneural bHLH transcription factors from specifying neural cell fate, also prevents homodimerization of another bHLH protein, Daughterless (Da), and thereby maintains expression of the <italic>Death-Associated Inhibitor of Apoptosis</italic> (<italic>diap1</italic>) gene. Multiple effects of <italic>emc</italic> mutations, on cell growth and on eye development, were all caused by reduced Diap1 levels and corresponding activation of caspases. These effects included growth of unspecified imaginal disc cells, acceleration of the morphogenetic furrow, failure of R7 photoreceptor cell specification, and delayed differentiation of non-neuronal cone cells. Within <italic>emc</italic> mutant eye clones, morphogenetic furrow speed was increased by elevated Notch signaling, while decreased Notch signaling inhibited R7 specification and cone cell differentiation. This was all due to caspase-dependent increase in levels of Delta protein, a transmembrane ligand that both trans- activates and cis-inhibits Notch. Thus, <italic>emc</italic> mutations reveal the importance of restraining caspase activity, even in non-apoptotic cells, to prevent abnormal development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Certain families of master regulatory transcription factor control major developmental decisions in metazoa. This includes the bHLH proteins encoded by proneural genes, which were discovered in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and control neural fate specification and differentiation from sponges to humans(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Weinberger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Baker &amp; Brown, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Dennis, Han, &amp; Schuurmans, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Johnson, 2020</xref>). One of the ways proneural gene activities are regulated, thereby modulating the location and timing of neurogenesis, is through Inhibitor of DNA binding proteins (Id proteins), which are HLH proteins lacking basic DNA-binding sequences. Using their HLH domains, Id proteins form inactive heterodimers with proneural bHLH proteins, preventing DNA binding and transcriptional regulation of target genes by the resulting heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Benezra, Davis, Lockshon, Turner, &amp; Weintraub, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ellis, Spann, &amp; Posakony, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Garrell &amp; Modolell, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Cabrera, Alonso, &amp; Huikeshoven, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ellis, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Norton, 2000</xref>). Accordingly, mutations in Id protein genes, of which there are 4 in mammals and one in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, permit enhanced proneural bHLH function, deregulating neurogenesis at many developmental stages and in many tissues. Mammalian Id gene expression is particularly associated with proliferative and stem cell states, and is frequently affected in cancer(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Ling, Kang, &amp; Sun, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Wang &amp; Baker, 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Roschger &amp; Cabrele, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Oproescu, Han, &amp; Schuurmans, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>An outstanding question has been whether heterodimerization with proneural bHLH proteins represents the only mechanism of Id protein function. This question arises because not all phenotypes of Id gene mutations obviously represent gain of proneural gene function.</p>
<p>Interpretation is complicated in mammals by the number of proneural bHLH genes and of Id protein genes, both functionally redundant so that single mutant phenotypes reflect only subsets of protein function(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Ling et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Wang &amp; Baker, 2015a</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, it is clear that mutating the sole Id protein gene <italic>extra macrochaetae</italic> (<italic>emc</italic>) affects some tissues where no proneural gene is known to function. The first example noted was the requirement for <italic>emc</italic> for normal growth of imaginal discs(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Garcia-Alonso &amp; Garcia-Bellido, 1988</xref>). Imaginal discs are larval progenitors of adult tissues and remain proliferative and undifferentiated until late in the final larval instar; no proneural gene is active in these proliferating cells. A second example is that <italic>emc</italic> is required for ovarian follicle cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adam &amp; Montell, 2004</xref>), which does not depend on proneural bHLH genes. Further examples are noted in <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye development. The <italic>emc</italic> gene is required to restrain the rate at which the morphogenetic furrow, a wave of fate specification that traverses across the eye imaginal disc as retinal patterning and differentiation begin(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Brown, Sattler, Paddock, &amp; Carroll, 1995</xref>). <italic>emc</italic> is also required for the specification of the R7 photoreceptor cells and the non-neuronal cone cells, neither of which depends on any known proneural bHLH gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Bhattacharya &amp; Baker, 2009</xref>). Most recently, <italic>emc</italic> was also found to be required for left-right asymmetry of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> gut(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ishibashi et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, <italic>Drosophila</italic> provides opportunities to investigate how at least one Id protein functions independently of proneural bHLH proteins, and potentially reveal new mechanisms of developmental regulation.</p>
<p>Insights into how Emc acts independently of proneural genes have progressively emerged from several studies. The first concerned the proper proliferation of imaginal disc cells(Garcia- Alonso &amp; Garcia-Bellido, 1988). Independence of imaginal disc growth from proneural bHLH genes is confirmed by the lack of requirement for <italic>da</italic>, the only E protein in <italic>Drosophila</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Bhattacharya &amp; Baker, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Andrade-Zapata &amp; Baonza, 2014</xref>). E proteins are ubiquitously-expressed bHLH proteins that are heterodimer partners for proneural bHLH proteins. In Drosophila, proneural bHLH proteins cannot function without Da, so normal growth of <italic>da</italic> mutant cells implies independence from all Da heterodimer partners. Remarkably, it is actually ectopic Da activity that causes poor growth in <italic>emc</italic> mutant cells, normal growth being restored in <italic>emc da</italic> doubly mutant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Bhattacharya &amp; Baker, 2011</xref>). Without <italic>emc</italic>, Da levels are elevated and by themselves activate transcription of <italic>expanded</italic> (<italic>ex</italic>), a component of the Salvador-Hippo-Warts (SHW) tumor suppressor pathway. This increased SHW pathway activity is what inhibits growth of imaginal disc cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Wang &amp; Baker, 2015b</xref>). Thus, one role of <italic>emc</italic> is to restrain Da(Reddy, Bhattacharya, &amp; Baker; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Bhattacharya &amp; Baker, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Wang &amp; Baker, 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Li &amp; Baker, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>In the course of these studies, we noticed that <italic>ex</italic> mutations affected the number of sensory organ precursor (SOP) cells in the thorax(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Wang &amp; Baker, 2015b</xref>). We showed that this was due to activity of Yorkie (Yki), the transcription factor target of SHW signals, in the <italic>ex</italic> mutant cells. This in turn increased transcription of a direct Yki target gene, <italic>Death-Associated Inhibitor of Apoptosis 1</italic> (<italic>diap1</italic>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Wang &amp; Baker, 2019</xref>). Diap1 is a ubiquitin ligase that prevents accumulation of a processed form of Dronc, an apical caspase in <italic>Drosophila</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Muro, Hay, &amp; Clem, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Wilson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Yan, Wu, Chai, Li, &amp; Shi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Li, Wang, &amp; Shi, 2011</xref>). Caspases are proteases that are well known for driving apoptosis by cleaving cellular substrates. They are expressed as inactive zymogens that are then activated by signals (initiator caspases) or by cleavage by caspases (effector caspases) in a feed-forward process that is expected to kill cells rapidly once a threshold of caspase activity has been crossed(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Fuchs &amp; Steller, 2011</xref>). Many studies show that caspases can also mediate non-apoptotic processes, although what differentiates apoptotic from non-apoptotic outcomes is uncertain, as the same caspase cascade of initiator and effector caspases seems to be involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Yamaguchi &amp; Miura, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Aram, Yacobi-Sharon, &amp; Arama, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Nakajima &amp; Kuranaga, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Baena-Lopez, Arthurton, Xu, &amp; Galasso, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Colon-Plaza &amp; Su, 2022</xref>). Non-apoptotic caspase activities are of particular interest because of their contributions to multiple diseases(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Su, 2020</xref>). In <italic>ex</italic> mutants, the increased <italic>diap1</italic> transcription does not affect cell death much, but causes an increase in <italic>wg</italic> signaling activity in the thorax(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Wang &amp; Baker, 2019</xref>). Wg signaling promotes SOP cell determination in the thorax, and it has been shown previously that Wg signaling is antagonized by caspases, through a mechanism that is non-apoptotic but whose direct target is not yet certain(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baker, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Kanuka et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Wang &amp; Baker, 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Since <italic>emc</italic> mutations elevate <italic>ex</italic> expression(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Wang &amp; Baker, 2015b</xref>), we wondered whether <italic>emc</italic> also changes Diap1 levels and affects caspase activities. Increased <italic>ex</italic> expression in <italic>emc</italic> mutants would be expected to reduce transcription of the <italic>diap1</italic> gene and potentially increase caspase activity, the opposite of what occurs in <italic>ex</italic> mutants. This predicts that caspases could contribute to aspects of the <italic>emc</italic> mutant phenotype, especially those that do not depend on proneural bHLH genes. Remarkably, we found that caspase activity was responsible for all the aspects of the <italic>emc</italic> phenotype that we tested. This included reduced growth of imaginal disc cells, accelerated morphogenetic furrow progression, and loss of R7 and cone cells fates in the eye. The effects on eye development all reflected caspase-dependent expression of the Notch ligand Delta, which is known to contribute to morphogenetic furrow progression, and R7 and cone cell fate specification. Thus, caspase-dependent non-apoptotic signaling underlies multiple roles of <italic>emc</italic> that are independent of proneural bHLH proteins.</p>

<title>Caspase activity causes growth defects in <italic>emc</italic> mutants</title>
<p>To determine the contribution of caspases to growth inhibition in <italic>emc</italic> mutant cells, we used the FLP/FRT system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Xu &amp; Rubin, 1993</xref>) to generate clones of <italic>emc</italic> mutant cells that were unable to activate caspases normally. We achieved this by homozygously deleting the linked <italic>reaper</italic> (<italic>rpr</italic>), <italic>head involution defective</italic> (<italic>hid</italic>) and <italic>grim</italic> genes using <italic>Df(3L)H99</italic>. Rpr, Hid and Grim proteins promote Diap1 degradation in response to apoptotic stimuli and allow activation of initiator caspases such as <italic>dronc</italic> to start apoptosis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Yoo et al., 2002</xref>). By removing all three pro-apoptotic proteins, <italic>Df(3L)H99</italic> affects both apoptotic and non-apoptotic caspase functions in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">White et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Tapadia &amp; Gautam, 2011</xref>). Thus, clones of <italic>emc Df(3L)H99</italic> mutant cells should be defective for caspase activation. In addition, we also made clones of <italic>emc</italic> mutant cells further mutated for <italic>dronc</italic>, which encodes the main initiator caspase in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that is necessary for most developmental apoptosis (C. J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Hawkins et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Meier, Silke, Leevers, &amp; Evan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Quinn et al., 2000</xref>). Dronc contributes to non-apoptotic caspase functions as well, so <italic>emc dronc</italic> mutant cells should also show reduced non-apoptotic and well as apoptotic caspase functions.</p>
<p>In comparison to neutral clones, which grew equivalently to their twin-spot controls, <italic>emc</italic> mutant clones showed greatly reduced growth in eye or wing imaginal discs, as described previously (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A-D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Garcia-Alonso &amp; Garcia-Bellido, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Bhattacharya &amp; Baker, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Andrade-Zapata &amp; Baonza, 2014</xref>). By contrast, <italic>emc</italic> mutant clones that were also mutant for <italic>dronc</italic>, or <italic>emc Df(3L)H99</italic> clones that lacked the <italic>rpr</italic>, <italic>grim</italic> and <italic>hid</italic> genes, grew more like their twin spot controls in both eye and wing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1E-H</xref>).

<p>Not only the position of the morphogenetic furrow, but also the overall pattern of retinal differentiation revealed by labeling for Senseless, which is specific for R8 photoreceptor cells, and Elav, which labels all neuronal photoreceptor cells, appeared so normal in these genotypes that we deemed it necessary to confirm that the supposedly <italic>emc dronc</italic> mutant and <italic>emc Df(3L)H99</italic> mutant clones were indeed mutated for <italic>emc</italic>. This was confirmed by lack of staining by an antibody against Emc protein, similar to plain <italic>emc</italic> mutant clones that did affect the morphogenetic furrow (<xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 Figure supplement 1C-E</xref>). We also found that <italic>emc dronc</italic> and <italic>emc Df(3L)H99</italic> clones upregulated Da protein expression to a comparable degree to plain <italic>emc</italic> mutant clones (<xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 Figure Supplement 1C-E</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Bhattacharya &amp; Baker, 2011</xref>). This further confirmed the absence of <italic>emc</italic> function from <italic>emc dronc</italic> mutant and <italic>emc Df(3L)H99</italic> genotypes, and also showed that cell death pathways were not required for the regulation of Da protein levels by <italic>emc</italic>.</p>

<p>To test whether reduced Diap1 expression promoted apoptosis and thereby accelerated the morphogenetic furrow, we assessed apoptosis levels by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) of eye discs containing mutant clones. We found almost no cell death posterior to the furrow in <italic>emc</italic> clones (<xref rid="figs2b" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 2B</xref>), and cell death in <italic>emc</italic> clones anterior to the furrow was comparable to controls and less than that of cells surrounding the clones (<xref rid="figs2b" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 2A</xref>).

<title>Wingless and Dpp signaling are unaffected by <italic>emc</italic></title>
<p>To understand how caspases could affect the speed of the morphogenetic furrow, we analyzed pathways known to contribute. Hedgehog (Hh) and Decapentaplegic (Dpp) signaling drive this differentiation wave, along with a contribution from Notch signaling (U. Heberlein, T. Wolff, &amp; G. M. Rubin, 1993; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Ma, Zhou, Beachy, &amp; Moses, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Borod &amp; Heberlein, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Baonza &amp; Freeman, 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Fu &amp; Baker, 2003</xref>). A negative regulator of morphogenetic furrow progression is Wingless (Wg), which is expressed at the dorsal and ventral eye disc margins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Maurel-Zaffran &amp; Treisman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Lee &amp; Treisman, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Because we found that <italic>ex</italic> mutations affected thoracic bristle patterning through a caspase-dependent non-apoptotic effect on Wg signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Wang &amp; Baker, 2019</xref>), we looked first to see whether <italic>emc</italic> mutations reduced Wg signaling in the eye. We used Frizzled-3 RFP (Fz3- RFP) as a reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Sato, Kojima, Ui-Tei, Miyata, &amp; Saigo, 1999</xref>). In control eye discs, the Fz3- RFP recapitulates the pattern of endogenous Wg signaling activity at the wing margins (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Treisman &amp; Rubin, 1995</xref>). Frizzled-3 RFP expression was not changed in <italic>emc</italic> clones (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). We then used a mutation in <italic>naked cuticle</italic> (<italic>nkd</italic>), encoding a negative feedback regulator of Wg signaling, to modulate Wg signaling(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Zeng et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Chang, Chang, Barolo, &amp; Cadigan, 2008</xref>). If the morphogenetic furrow was accelerated in <italic>emc</italic> mutant clones due to reduced Wg signaling, more normal development should occur in <italic>emc nkd</italic> clones. The morphogenetic furrow was still accelerated in <italic>emc nkd</italic> clones, however (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>).

Notably, it has been suggested previously that <italic>emc</italic> mutations affect the morphogenetic furrow by activating Hedgehog signaling, because <italic>emc</italic> mutant cells accumulate Ci protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Spratford &amp; Kumar, 2013</xref>).

By inhibiting this processing, Hh prevents repression of target genes by Ci75 and promotes transcriptional activation downstream of Ci155.</p>
<p>Accordingly, Ci155 accumulation is a feature of cells receiving Hh signals(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Motzny &amp; Holmgren, 1995</xref>).</p>

<p>We noticed that Ci155 levels were elevated in <italic>emc</italic> mutant clones in the posterior, differentiating eye disc, as well as in and ahead of the morphogenetic furrow (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). This is significant, because Ci155 is not affected by Hh-dependent Cul1 processing posterior to the morphogenetic furrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Ou, Lin, Chen, &amp; Chien, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Baker, Bhattacharya, &amp; Firth, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Ci155 accumulation posterior to the furrow suggests a Hh-independent mechanism.</p>
<p>To test whether Ci155 accumulation in <italic>emc</italic> clones indicates elevated Hh target signaling, we looked at the transmembrane receptor Patched (Ptc) which is a transcriptional target of Hh signaling, acting in a negative feedback loop(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Hepker, Wang, Motzny, Holmgren, &amp; Orenic, 1997</xref>).

<p>To test definitively whether Ci155 is responsible for accelerating the furrow in <italic>emc</italic> clones, we generated <italic>emc ci</italic> double mutant clones. To achieve this, a genomic transgene that rescues <italic>ci<sup>94</sup></italic> flies to adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Little, Garcia-Garcia, Sul, &amp; Kalderon, 2020</xref>), was introduced into chromosome arm 3L where it is linked to the wild type <italic>emc</italic> locus, so that mitotic recombination in the <italic>ci<sup>94</sup></italic>null background leads to <italic>emc ci</italic> double mutant clones. For unknown reasons, <italic>emc ci</italic> double mutant clones were small and difficult to obtain, even in the Minute background. In all the <italic>emc ci</italic> double mutant clones we found that spanned the morphogenetic furrow; eye differentiation was still accelerated (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). These data might not exclude a quantitative contribution of Ci to more rapid morphogenetic furrow progression in the absence of <italic>emc</italic> but are sufficient to show that <italic>emc</italic> regulates the speed of the morphogenetic furrow through at least one other caspase target.</p>

<p>To test whether elevated Notch signaling was required to accelerate the morphogenetic furrow in <italic>emc</italic> mutants, we examined <italic>emc psn</italic> double mutant clones. Presenilin (Psn) is the enzymatic component of γ-secretase that releases the intracellular domain of Notch during active Notch signaling, and the <italic>psn</italic> gene is linked to <italic>emc</italic>. Loss of <italic>psn</italic> function leads to a Notch loss of function phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Struhl &amp; Greenwald, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Ye, Lukinova, &amp; Fortini, 1999</xref>). Accordingly, <italic>psn</italic> clones lead to a neurogenic phenotype in the eye, without affecting the progression of the morphogenetic furrow (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Li &amp; Baker, 2001</xref>). The position of the morphogenetic furrow was also not affected in <italic>emc psn</italic> clones (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Thus, the furrow was not accelerated in <italic>emc</italic> mutant clones also defective for Notch signaling.</p>
<p>These two results together indicated that <italic>emc</italic> mutants promoted Notch signaling in the morphogenetic furrow, acting through caspase signaling on a step prior to γ-secretase cleavage of the intracellular domain of Notch. Accordingly, we decided to check Delta (Dl) protein levels.</p>
<p>We found that Dl protein levels were clearly elevated cell-autonomously throughout <italic>emc</italic> clones, both posterior and anterior to the furrow (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). Importantly, this includes the region just ahead of the morphogenetic furrow that lacks Delta expression in normal development(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Parks, Turner, &amp; Muskavitch, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Baker &amp; Yu, 1998</xref>)(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). By contrast, levels of Dl protein in <italic>emc dronc</italic> clones and <italic>emc Df(3L)H99</italic> clones were similar to those of wild type controls (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A,C</xref>,D).

<p>Because Dl activates Notch signaling cell non-autonomously, we wondered whether the effect of <italic>emc</italic> mutant clones was cell-autonomous. We note that, in all the experiments reported here, and in all the previous studies of <italic>emc</italic> mutant clones affecting morphogenetic furrow movement, the morphogenetic furrow is maintained as a continuous groove across the eye disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Brown et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Bhattacharya &amp; Baker, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Spratford &amp; Kumar, 2013</xref>). That is, the advanced front of retinal differentiation within <italic>emc</italic> clones is always smoothly continuous with the normal morphogenetic furrow outside the clones, implying a progressive gradual increase in morphogenetic furrow speed near the lateral edges of <italic>emc</italic> mutant clones (eg <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B</xref>, 4B, 4D, 5A, 6A). Clones of <italic>Su(H)</italic> null mutants, which act cell-autonomously, provide a contrasting example. Complete loss of <italic>Su(H)</italic> accelerates the morphogenetic furrow due to loss of default Su(H) repression of Notch targets(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Li &amp; Baker, 2001</xref>). The boundaries of <italic>Su(H)</italic> null clones exhibit a clear discontinuity between the rates of differentiation within and outside the clones (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). This difference between <italic>Su(H)</italic> and <italic>emc</italic> mutant clones is consistent with the idea that <italic>emc</italic> affects morphogenetic furrow progression non-autonomously.</p>

<p>The Inhibitor of DNA binding (Id) proteins are important regulators of differentiation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Massari &amp; Murre, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Ling et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Wang &amp; Baker, 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Roschger &amp; Cabrele, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Singh et al., 2022</xref>). They are well known to antagonize proneural basic helix- loop-helix (bHLH) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Benezra et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ellis et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Garrell &amp; Modolell, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Cabrera et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ellis, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Norton, 2000</xref>). It has been uncertain whether this is their only function, as in <italic>Drosophila</italic> it is clear that <italic>emc</italic> mutations affect processes that are independent of proneural genes. Here, we report that multiple effects of <italic>emc</italic> mutations that occur independently of proneural bHLH genes, and are due to the loss of restraint on <italic>da</italic> function in <italic>emc</italic> mutant cells, are caused by caspase-dependent non-apoptotic processes that result from reduced expression of Diap1 protein.</p>
<p>One known effect of <italic>emc</italic> is that it restrains the <italic>Drosophila</italic> E protein Da. Da is expressed ubiquitously and is the obligate heterodimer partner of proneural bHLH proteins in neurogenesis.</p>
<p>In undifferentiated progenitor cells, most or all Da is thought to be sequestered in inactive heterodimers with Emc(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Li &amp; Baker, 2018</xref>). In <italic>emc</italic> mutant cells, Da levels rise and become functional, potentially as homodimers(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Bhattacharya &amp; Baker, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In the context of imaginal disc cell growth, <italic>emc</italic> mutant cells experience <italic>da</italic>-dependent over-expression of the <italic>ex</italic> gene(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Wang &amp; Baker, 2015b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">2018</xref>). Although most study of <italic>ex</italic> has focused on its role in growth control through the SHW pathway, <italic>ex</italic> was recently shown to influence patterning through Yki-dependent transcription of <italic>diap1</italic>, an important regulator of cell death pathways. This was in the developing thorax, where <italic>ex</italic> mutations affect bristle patterning through <italic>diap1</italic> and a non-apoptotic effect of caspases on Wg signaling(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Wang &amp; Baker, 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>This observation led us to explore whether aspects of the <italic>emc</italic> phenotype could reflect reduced <italic>diap1</italic> expression and elevated caspase activity.</p>
<p>Remarkably, we found that all four features of the <italic>emc</italic> phenotype we examined depended on the caspase-mediated cell death pathway. The normal growth of imaginal disc cells, normal speed of the morphogenetic furrow, specification of R7 photoreceptor cells, and timing of non- neuronal cone cell development were all restored when caspase activation was prevented, which was achieved by inactivating the initiator caspase Dronc, deleting the proapoptotic <italic>rpr</italic>, <italic>grim</italic>, and <italic>hid</italic> genes, over-expressing <italic>diap1</italic>, or over-expressing baculovirus p35. These appeared to be non-apoptotic effects, because no elevation in apoptosis was apparent in <italic>emc</italic> mutant cells, because generating apoptosis by another means did not mimic the effects, and because the effects were mediated by elevated Dl protein expression in cells that were not apoptotic. They appeared to be effects of caspase activity, because they depended in part on <italic>dronc</italic>, an initiator caspase that cleaves and activates effector caspases, because they were suppressed by baculovirus p35, a caspase inhibitor that is a caspase pseudo-substrate, and because they were suppressed by Diap1, a ubiquitin ligase that inhibits caspases and targets them for degradation. The effects may depend on the full caspase cascade of initiator and effector caspases, because sensitivity to p35 indicates that caspases other than Dronc are necessary, and because mutating dronc alone gave lesser degrees of rescue than deleting <italic>rpr</italic>, <italic>grim</italic>, and <italic>hid</italic>. This is consistent with many other studies that describe the pathways for apoptotic and non-apoptotic caspase functions as similar(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Kanuka et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Kuranaga &amp; Miura, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Aram et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Nakajima &amp; Kuranaga, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Baena-Lopez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Su, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Colon-Plaza &amp; Su, 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Whereas non-apoptotic caspase activity promotes Wg signaling during specification of thoracic bristles(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Kanuka et al., 2005</xref>), in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye the non-apoptotic caspase target was Notch signaling, due to elevated Delta protein levels. We do not know whether Delta is the direct caspase target. The Delta protein sequence contains multiple predicted caspase target sites, as do many proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Only one candidate site lies in the intracellular domain, where it would potentially be accessible to caspases (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B</xref>). Truncation of the Dl intracellular domain is usually associated with loss of Dl function, not stabilization and enhanced function, however (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Daskalaki et al., 2011</xref>). Another possibility is that a regulator of Dl expression or stability and function is the direct caspase target.</p>

<caption><title>Model of <italic>emc</italic> effects on <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye development.</title>
<p>A) Loss of <italic>emc</italic> allows Da protein to form heterodimers and activate <italic>ex</italic> transcription, increasing SHW pathway activity. SHW activity reduces DIAP1 expression, thereby derepressing caspase activity. In the eye, non- apoptotic caspase activity increases expression of the Notch ligand Delta. Elevated Delta expression accelerates morphogenetic furrow progression, while cis-inhibiting Notch signaling posterior to the morphogenetic furrow, inhibiting R7 cell specification and cone-cell differentiation. B) Like many proteins, Delta has multiple potential caspase cleavage sites, here predicted suing Cascleave 2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). None are high-confidence predictions and only one is in the intracellular domain where caspase access is plausible (position 675, predicted score 0.647). The intracellular domain is required for Delta signaling. Cleavage at position 675 would remove the main ubiquitylation site required for signaling, as well as the binding site for <italic>mindbomb</italic>, so is not anticipated to enhance signaling activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Daskalaki et al., 2011</xref>).</p></caption>

<p>Notably, <italic>emc</italic> mutations accelerate the morphogenetic furrow by enhancing Notch signaling, apparently cell-autonomously, but inhibit R7 and cone cell differentiation through cell-autonomously reduced N signaling(Reddy et al.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Bhattacharya &amp; Baker, 2009</xref>). These contrasts may be explained through the dual functions of the Notch ligand Delta in trans- activation and in cis-inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Micchelli, Rulifson, &amp; Blair, 1997</xref>; Jacobsen, Brennan,</p>
<p>Martinez-Arias, &amp; Muskavitch, 1998; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Li &amp; Baker, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Bray, 2016</xref>). The eye disc region ahead of the morphogenetic furrow lacks Delta expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Parks et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Baker &amp; Yu, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Ectopic Dl expression here is sufficient to activate N non-autonomously and drive morphogenetic furrow progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Baonza &amp; Freeman, 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Li &amp; Baker, 2001</xref>). Within the R7 equivalence group, Delta is expressed early in R1 and R6 photoreceptor precursors, protecting them from N activation through cis-inhibition, and establishing the distinction between R1,6 and R7 precursor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Miller, Lyons, &amp; Herman, 2009</xref>). Ectopic Dl expression posterior to the morphogenetic furrow has cis-inhibitory effect. Elevated Dl levels within <italic>emc</italic> mutant clones may render potential R7 and cone cell precursors cell-autonomously resistant to N activation, as normally seen in R1/6 precursor cells.</p>
<p>A previous study suggested that <italic>emc</italic> mutations might affect Hh signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Spratford &amp; Kumar, 2013</xref>). Our data point much more clearly to an effect on Notch signaling. Although the Hh target Ci155 accumulates in <italic>emc</italic> mutant cells, increased Hh signaling is not the only possible cause of this. Ci155 is cytoplasmic, and thought to be only a precursor for a labile nuclear activator molecule(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Ohlmeyer &amp; Kalderon, 1998</xref>). Preventing activation and nuclear translocation of Ci155 by mutating the kinase <italic>fused</italic> also leads to Ci155 accumulation, without activating Hh signaling. Presumably Ci155 accumulates because it is more stable than its activated derivative(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Ohlmeyer &amp; Kalderon, 1998</xref>). Significantly, <italic>emc</italic> mutant cells have been reported to over-express the <italic>fused</italic> antagonist <italic>su(fu)</italic>, providing a potential alternative explanation of Ci155 accumulation in <italic>emc</italic> mutant cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Spratford &amp; Kumar, 2013</xref>). Analyzing <italic>emc ci</italic> double mutant cells suggested that <italic>ci</italic> was not required to accelerate the morphogenetic furrow in <italic>emc</italic> mutant clones.</p>
<p>Da protein binds to and potentially regulates hundreds of genes throughout the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Li et al., 2008</xref>). Accordingly, Da activity in <italic>emc</italic> mutant cells might be expected to lead to non-specific and pleiotropic effects. Contrary to this expectation, multiple aspects of proneural bHLH-independent <italic>emc</italic> mutant phenotypes have a simple common basis, ie reduced <italic>diap1</italic> expression and elevated caspase activity. Remarkably, mutating <italic>emc</italic> may be the most general way to activate non-apoptotic caspase activities yet discovered.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> work presents data showing that all non-proneural phenotypes of the Inhibitor of DNA binding (Id) protein emc are mediated through inappropriate non-apoptotic caspase activity. Using the developing Drosophila retina as a model the authors <bold>convincingly</bold> show that emc acts by transcriptionally regulating the Death-Associated Inhibitor of Apoptosis 1 (diap1) gene, which impacts on Notch signaling by caspase-dependent increase of Delta protein. These findings are interesting for the caspase/apoptosis field as they add more non-apoptotic functions of caspases to the list, as well as for the Id field, which examines how Id proteins inhibit cell differentiation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The extra macrochaetae (emc) gene encodes the only Inhibitor of DNA binding protein (Id protein) in Drosophila. Its best-known function is to inhibit proneural genes during development. However, the emc mutants also display non-proneural phenotypes. In this manuscript, the authors examined four non-proneural phenotypes of the emc mutants and reported that they are all caused by inappropriate non-apoptotic caspase activity. These non-neuronal phenotypes are: reduced growth of imaginal discs, increased speed of the morphogenetic furrow, and failure to specify R7 photoreceptor neurons and cone cells during eye development. Double mutants between emc and either H99 (which deletes the three pro-apoptotic genes reaper, grim, and hid) or the initiator caspase dronc suppress these mutant phenotypes of emc suggesting that the cell death pathway and caspase activity are mediating these emc phenotypes. In previous work, the authors have shown that emc mutations elevate the expression of ex which activates the SHW pathway (aka the Hippo pathway). One known function of the SHW pathway is to inhibit Yorkie which controls the transcription of the inhibitor of apoptosis, Diap1. Consistently, in emc clones the levels of Diap1 protein are reduced which might explain why caspase activity is increased in emc clones giving rise to the four non-neural phenotypes of emc mutants. However, this increased caspase activity is not causing ectopic apoptosis, hence the authors propose that this is non-apoptotic caspase activity. In the last part of the manuscript, the authors ruled out that Wg, Dpp, and Hh signaling are the target of caspases, but instead identified Notch signaling as the target of caspases, specifically the Notch ligand Delta. Protein levels of Delta are increased in emc clones in an H99- and dronc-dependent manner. The authors conclude that caspase-dependent non-apoptotic signaling underlies multiple roles of emc that are independent of proneural bHLH proteins.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Overall, this is an interesting manuscript and the findings are intriguing. It adds to the growing number of non-apoptotic functions of apoptotic proteins and caspases in particular. The manuscript is well written and the data are usually convincingly presented.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
1. One major concern I have is the observation by the authors in Figure 3C in which protein levels of Diap1 are still reduced in emc H99 double mutant clones. If Diap1 is still reduced in these clones, shouldn't caspases still be de-repressed? Given that emc H99 double mutants rescue all emc phenotypes examined, the observation that Diap1 levels are still reduced in emc H99 clones is inconsistent with the authors' model. The authors need to address this inconsistency.</p>
<p>2. Are Diap1 protein levels reduced in all emc clones, including clones anterior to the furrow? This is difficult to see in Figure 3B. it is also recommended to look in emc mosaic wing discs.</p>
<p>3. The authors speculate that Delta may be a direct target of caspase cleavage (Figure 9B), but then rule it out for a good reason. However, I assume that the increased protein levels of Delta in emc clones (Figure 7) are the results of increased transcription. In that case, shouldn't caspases control the transcriptional machinery leading to Delta expression?</p>
<p>4. How does caspase activity in emc clones cause reduced growth? Is this also mediated through Delta signaling?</p>
<p>5. Figure 1M: Is there a similar result with emc dronc mosaics?</p>

<p>Id proteins are thought to function by binding and antagonizing basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors but new findings demonstrate roles for emc including in tissues where no proneural (Drosophila bHLH) genes are known to function. The authors propose a new mechanism for developmental regulation that entails restraining new/novel non-apoptotic functions of apoptotic caspases.</p>
<p>Specifically, the data suggest that loss of emc leads to reduced expression of diap1 and increased apoptotic caspase activity, which does not induce apoptosis but elevates Delta expression to increase N activity and cause developmental defects. Indeed, many of the phenotypes of emc mutant clones can be rescued by a chromosomal deficiency that reduces caspase activation or by mutations in the initiator caspase Dronc. A related manuscript that shows that loss of emc results in increased da, linked previously to diap1 expression, provides supporting data. There is increasing appreciation that apoptotic caspases have non-apoptotic roles. This study adds to the emerging field and should be of interest to readers.</p>
<p>The data, for the most part, support the conclusions but I do have concerns about some of the data and the interpretations that should be addressed.</p>

<p>The work extends earlier studies on the Drosophila Id protein EMC to uncover a potential pathway that explains several tissue-scale developmental abnormalities in emc mutants. It also describes a non-apoptotic role for caspases in cell biology.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The work adds to an emerging new set of functions for caspases beyond their canonical roles as cell death mediators. This novelty is a major strength as well as its reliance on genetic-based in vivo study. The study will be of interest to those who are curious about caspases in general.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The manuscript relies on imaging experiments using genetic mosaic imaginal discs. It is for the most part a qualitative analysis, showing representative samples with a small number of mutant clones in each. Although the senior author has a long track record of using experiments like this to rigorously discover regulatory mechanisms in this system, it is straightforward in 2023 to use Fiji and other image analysis tools to measure fluorescence. Such measurements could be done for all replicate clones of a given genotype as well as genetic control sampling. These could be presented in plots that would not only provide quantitative and statistical measurements, but will be more reader-friendly to those who are not fly people.</p>
<p>Likewise, more details are needed to describe how clone areas were measured in Figure 1. Did they measure each clone and its twin spot, and then calculate the area ratio for each clone and its paired twin spot? This would be the correct way to analyze the data, yielding many independent measurements of the ratio. And doing so would obviate the need to log transform the data which is inexplicable unless they were averaging clones and twins within a disc and making replicates. More explanation is needed and if they indeed averaged, then they need to calculate the ratios pairwise for each clone and twin.</p>
