<title>Backgroud</title>
<p>Recurrent joint bleeding in hemophilia patients frequently results in hemophilic arthropathy (HA). Drastic degradation of articular cartilage is a major characteristic of HA, but its pathological mechanisms has not yet been clarified. Here, we conducted a genome-wide DNA methylation study with the goal of identifying critical genes for HA cartilage degeneration.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>DNA was isolated from human osteoarthritis (N = 5) and HA (N = 5) articular cartilages and analyzed using the Infinium Human Methylation 850 BeadChip array. Adeno-associated virus-mediated shRNA and siRNA were used to knock down Tenascin XB (TNXB) <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, respectively. Then histopathological analysis, qPCR, Western blotting and immunofluorescence assays were conducted to detected chondrocyte homeostasis and HA progression.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>We found that DNMT1 and DNMT3A protein levels were increased in cartilages from HA patients compared with OA patients. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis identified 1228 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with HA. Functional enrichment analyses then revealed that DMR genes (DMGs) were related to extracellular matrix organization. Among these DMGs, TNXB protein expression was down-regulated in human and mouse HA cartilages. Further, the loss of <italic>Tnxb</italic> in F8<sup>â/â</sup> mouse cartilage provides a disease-promoting role in HA by augmenting cartilage matrix degeneration and subchondral bone loss. <italic>Tnxb</italic> knockdown also promoted chondrocyte apoptosis and inhibited phosphorylation of AKT. Importantly, AKT agonist showed a chondroprotective effect following <italic>Tnxb</italic> knockdown.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>our study demonstrated that TNXB is a central mediator of cartilage matrix degradation following joint bleeding, which functions by regulating the activation of AKT. These mechanistic insights allow targeted development of potentially new strategies for cartilage protection in HA.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hemophilia A and B are inherited bleeding disorders caused by a deficiency in coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) or factor IX (FIX), respectively. Joint bleeding (hemarthrosis) is the most common clinical manifestation in patients with severe hemophilia (i.e., plasma FVIII or FIX &lt; 1 U/dl) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Recent evidence also indicates that hemarthrosis may occur spontaneously in patients with moderate (plasma factor levels of 1â 5 UI/dl) or mild disease (plasma factor levels of &gt;5 UI/dl) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Repeated episodes of hemarthrosis eventually result in hemophilic arthropathy (HA), a debilitating and irreversible condition. HA often starts at an early age and characterized by joint impairment, chronic pain, and reduced quality of life <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Current efforts to prevent the development of HA are mainly focused on management of acute joint bleeding and optimizing prophylactic replacement therapy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. However, many hemophilia patients still experience the joint disease later in life, despite adequate prophylaxis, suggesting that pathological changes in soft tissue and bone, caused by breakthrough and/or sub-clinical bleeding of joint, accumulate over time, ultimately leading to joint deformities and HA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Given no disease modifying therapy available to intervene in the HA perpetuating process, HA remains a persistent problem and challenge for hemophilia patients. Thus, to understand the pathogenesis of HA and subsequently explore possible targets for therapy is necessary.</p>
<p>One distinctive pathophysiological manifestation of HA is cartilage degeneration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Cartilage is a rather inert tissue, consisting of matrix proteins and only one cell type, chondrocytes that are responsible for production of matrix synthesis and rely on synovial fluid for nutrients as cartilage lacks blood supply <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, recurrent intra-articular bleeding creates a âtoxicâ environment to cartilage, by inducing synovial inflammation, hemosiderin accumulation and excessive mechanical stress <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. As a consequence, dysregulation of metabolism and abnormal apoptosis occur in chondrocytes, ultimately resulting in deterioration of the cartilage matrix <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>DNA methylation, a core epigenetic mechanism, is high dynamic and susceptible to cues from the environment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group to the cytosine residue of DNA molecules, which is catalysed by DNA methyl transferase (DNMT) family of proteins that is comprised of three members: DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b. DNA methylation is mainly located in the gene regulatory region, usually repressing gene expression by blocking the transcriptional accessibility of regulatory genomic regions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Recently, multiple studies confirmed the important role of abnormal DNA methylation in the pathogenesis of arthritis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. However, the epigenetic mechanisms underlying HA-related cartilage degradation have not been explored.</p>
<p>In this study, we conducted a genome-wide DNA methylation study with the goal of identifying differentially methylated genes (DMGs) and pathways for HA. Further, we knocked down <italic>Tnxb</italic>, a key DMG, in primary mouse chondrocytes and hemophilia A (F8<sup>â/â</sup>) mice. The biological function and underlying mechanisms of TNXB in HA progression were also investigated <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Our findings provide a new mechanism for articular cartilage lesion in HA, which may lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of HA.</p>

<title>Cartilage specimen collection</title>
<p>In this study, 5 HA and 5 osteoarthritis knee cartilage specimens were collected from patients undergoing total knee replacement surgery. Knee cartilage tissues were dissected and then rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen or fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. All subjects were Chinese Han and their demographic characteristics were listed in Supplementary table 1. The human cartilage samples were obtained from Department of Orthopedic Surgery at The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University (2019-ZX-004-02).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling</title>
<p>Genomic DNA was prepared from cartilage specimens using QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Germany) according to the manufacturerâs instructions and was stored at â80 Â°C until used. Then bisulfite treatment of genomic DNA was performed with the EZ DNA methylation kit (Zymo Research) according to manufacturerâs procedure. Genome-wide DNA methylation patterns were evaluated by Infinium Human Methylation 850 K BeadChips (Illumina), which determine the methylation levels of 853,307 CpG sites. R/Bioconductor (version 3.3.3) package ChAMP was used to process the Illumina intensity data (IDAT) files from the chip. DNA methylation level of each CpG site was described as a Î² value, ranging from zero (representing fully unmethylated) to one (representing fully methylated). Probes that had a detection <italic>P</italic> value of &gt; 0.01 and those located on the X and Y chromosome were filtered away. We also removed SNP-related probes and all multi-hit probes. BMIQ (Beta MIxture Quantile dilation) algorithm was used to correct for the Infinium type I and type II probe bias. Furthermore, the regression models were adjusted for age and sex. Differentially methylated probes (DMPs) at significance of <italic>P</italic> &lt;â¡0.05 after the Benjamini &amp; Hochberg correction for multiple testing. Differentially Methylated Regions (DMRs) were identified by Bumphunter with default settings. Additionally, we annotated the DMR-related genes (DMGs), and then performed Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes (KEGG) pathway analysis by using the online tool DAVID (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/">http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/</ext-link>). The significant pathway/ GO term was identified with <italic>P</italic> value &lt; 0.05.</p>

<title>Mouse</title>
<p>The FVIII target gene knockout hemophilia (F8<sup>â/â</sup>) mouse were purchased from the Shanghai Laboratory Animal Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. All mouse were kept in the Laboratory Animal Center of Zhejiang University of Chinese Medicine. The animals were placed in the controlled environmental condition with relatively constant air humidity and temperature as well as manual control of day and night replacement for 12h. The experiment was approved by the Experimental Animal Ethics Committee of Zhejiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (LZ12H27001).</p>

<title>The mouse experimental model of HA</title>
<p>The HA model is constructed according to the description of Hakobyan et al <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. F8<sup>â/â</sup> mouse were induced with 3% isoflurane, and 1% isoflurane was maintained under anesthesia. The right knee joint capsule of mouse was pierced with a 30g needle for bleeding modeling, and the left knee of each animal was used as a control group. Mouse were sacrificed at 4 and 8 weeks after injury, and knee joints were collected for further experiments.</p>

<title>Intra-articular injection</title>
<p>F8<sup>â/â</sup> mouse were induced with 3% isoflurane, and 1% isoflurane was maintained under anesthesia. The right knee joint capsule of mouse was pierced with a 30g needle for bleeding modeling. The needle of the insulin syringe was sagittally inserted into the intercondylar area of the mouse right knee joint, where 10 Î¼l of AAV-Tnxb (GenePharma) or AAV-NC was injected. After 4 weeks, mouse was sacrificed, respectively, and the right knee joints were collected for further experiments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Micro-computed tomography (Î¼CT) analysis</title>
<p>Micro-computed tomography (Î¼CT) (Skyscan 1176, Bruker Î¼CT, Kontich, Gelgium) was used to analyze the knee joints. The area between the proximal tibia growth plate and the tibial plateau was chosen as the region of interest. The parameters collected form Î¼CT were percent bone volume (BV/TV, %), Trabecular thickness (Tb.Th, mm), Trabecular number (Tb.N, 1/mm) and Trabecular Spacing(Tb.Sp, mm).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2g">
<title>Histological analysis</title>
<p>The human cartilage samples were successively fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 days, decalcified with 14% EDTA solution for 3 months, and the mouse samples were successively fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 3 days, decalcified with 14% EDTA solution for 14 days. These samples subsequently embedded in paraffin. Then 3-Î¼m thick sections at the medial compartment of the joints were cut for Alcian blue hematoxylin/Orange G (ABH) or Toluidine Blue staining to analyze the gross cartilage structural changes. Histomorphometric analysis was performed through Osteomeasure software (Decatur, GA).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2h">
<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>The immunohistochemistry was examined to observe the expressions of protein in cartilage. Briefly, the deparaffinized sections were soaked in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide to block the activity of endogenous peroxidase, then blocked with normal goat serum (diluted 1:20) for 20 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the primary antibodies were added and incubated overnight at 4Â° C. The next day, the sections were treated with secondary antibodies for 30 min and positive staining was visible by using diaminobenzidine solution (Invitrogen, MD, United States). Then counterstaining was performed with hematoxylin for 5 s. Anti-Col2a1 (Abcam, ab34712, 1:200), Anti-Mmp13 (Abcam, ab39012, 1:300), Anti-Tnxb (Proteintech, 13595-1-AP, 1:50), Anti-Bax (Huabio, ET1603-34, 1:200), Anti-Bcl-2 (Huabio, ET1702-53, 1:200), Anti-p-Akt1 (Abclonal, AP0140, 1:200), Dnmt1(Abcam, ab188453, 1 : 200), Dnmt3a (Abcam, ab2850, 1 : 200), Dnmt3b (Abcam, ab2851, 1 : 200) were used in this study.</p>

<sec id="s2i">
<title>Cell isolation and culture</title>
<p>Primary mouse chondrocytes were obtained from the femoral head of 2-week-old C57BL/6J mouse purchased from the Experimental Animal Center of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University. Mouse were sacrificed and disinfected with 75% ethyl alcohol. Specimens were isolated and rinsed by Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) 3 times. Then the cartilage tissues were digested with 0.25% collagenase P at 37 Â°C for 4h. Chondrocytes were cultured in DMEM/F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% streptomycin/penicillin in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37 Â°C for further experiment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2j">
<title>Tunel assay</title>
<p>To evaluate the apoptotic cells in the chondrocytes, we performed a Tunel assay according to the manufacturerâs guideline (Beyotime, catalog C1088). Briefly, following deparaffinage and rehydration, sections were permeabilized with DNase-free Proteinase K (20 Î¼g/mL) for 15 minutes at 37Â°C. Subsequently, slides were treated with Tunel solution and incubated at 37Â°C for 1 hour in a dark environment and counterstained with DAPI (1:1000; Solarbio) for 10 minutes. Finally, TUNEL positive cells were detected by fluorescence microscope.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2k">
<title>Transfection of siRNA-<italic>Tnxb</italic></title>
<p>Chondrocytes were transiently transfected with siRNA targeting <italic>Tnxb</italic> (GenePharma) or negativeâ¡control siRNA (scrambled; GenePharma) using Xâ¡tremeGENE siRNA transfection reagent (Sigma) following the manufacturerâs instructions. All experiments were performed 72 hours after transfection, and the most effective single siRNA was used for further experiments. The effectiveness of transfection was determined by qPCR and western blotting assay. After transfection for 48 h, cells were treated with SC79 (10Î¼M, Selleck) for 24 h.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2l">
<title>Cell Immunofluorescence</title>
<p>The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and blocked with goat serum for 1 hour. Then, cells were incubated with Col2a1 antibody (1:200; Abcam) and Mmp13 antibody (1:100; Abcam) overnight. The next day, the knee joints samples and Chondrocytes with goat antiâ¡rabbit antibody (1:1000; Invitrogen) conjugated with Alexa FluorTM 488 for 1 hour. Cells were stained with DAPI (1:1000; Solarbio).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2m">
<title>Western blot analysis</title>
<p>Total proteins were extracted by RIPA buffer, and concentration of protein was determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA, Beyotime, Shanghai, China). Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were then blocked with 5% skim milk for 1 h, and were incubated with primary antibodies (Col2a1, Abclonal, A1560, 1:1500), (Mmp13, Abclonal, A11755, 1:1000), (Tnxb, Abclonal, A2535, 1:1000), (p-Akt1, Abclonal, AP0140, 1:1000), (Akt1, Huabio, ET1609-47, 1:1000), (Bcl-2, Huabio, ET1702-53, 1:1000), (Bax, Huabio, ET1603-34, 1:1000), (active-pro caspase-3, Huabio, ET1608-64, 1:1000) overnight at 4Â°C. The membranes were washed 3 times, and then cultured with the secondary antibody for 1 h. The immunoreactivity was detected with the ECL substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States) on an Image Quant LAS 4000 (EG, United States). The grey value was calculated by the software of Image J. <italic>Î²-actin</italic> was used as an internal control in all western blot analysis.</p>

<title>Articular cartilages of HA patients show severe damage and aberrant elevations of DNMT1 and DNMT3A</title>
<p>In this study, we collected cartilage samples in tibial plateau from osteoarthritis and HA patients undergo total knee replacement (TKR) surgery. Consistent with previous reports, the HA cartilage exhibited severe damage and significant hemosiderin deposition, compared with that of osteoarthritis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). MRI analysis revealed the subchondral bone loss in HA patients (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). ABH staining further assessed the cartilage degeneration, and detected a substantial sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) depletion in HA cartilages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1, C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). As expected, comparing to osteoarthritis, HA cartilages showed prominent decrease in cartilage matrix protein COL2A1 and increase in expression of MMP13, the primary enzymes responsible for cartilage degeneration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1, E</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). Additionally, obvious increase in DNMT1 and DNMT3A protein levels was also detected in HA cartilages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1, G</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">H</xref>), whereas no significant changes were found in DNMT3B (Supplemental Figure 1). These data confirmed the severe damage in articular cartilage and subchondral bone of HA patients.</p>

<title>Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis reveals the epigenetic landscape of HA cartilage</title>
<p>To understand the methylation profile associated with HA cartilage degeneration, genome-wide DNA methylation alterations were examined in 10 subjects (5 osteoarthritis cartilages and 5 HA cartilages) by using 850K ChIP. The methylation levels of whole genome-wide CpGs were in a classic bimodal distribution where most CpGs were either slightly or highly methylated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Of note, global DNA methylation levels exhibited systematic differences between HA and osteoarthritis (OA), as illustrated by their separation pattern in principle component analysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Overall, 1228 significant differentially methylated regions (DMRs) (<italic>P</italic>â¡&lt;â¡0.05 after the Benjamini &amp; Hochberg correction for multiple testing) were identified, with a mean fold change in methylation difference of 0.90 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, and Supplemental Table 3). Compared with the OA, 69.95% and 30.05% DMRs were hypermethylated and hypomethylated in HA, respectively (Supplemental Figure 2A). Given the specificity of DMR, we then determined whether the identified DMRs were preferentially colocalized with some specific genomic features. The large majority (93.49%) of these DMRs were located in gene promoters, 5â-UTRs, 3â-UTRs, and exons, with only 6.51% overlapping intergenic regions (Supplemental Figure 2B).</p>

<p>To determine the biological functions of these significant DMRs, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis were performed on DMR-related genes (DMGs). GO analysis revealed enrichment for terms largely related to extracellular matrix (ECM) organization, skeletal system development (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, Supplementary Table 4). The top two KEGG pathways were ECM-receptor interaction (<italic>P</italic> value = 5.2Ã10<sup>â6</sup>) and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway (<italic>P</italic> value = 5.3Ã10<sup>â4</sup>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>, Supplementary Table 5).

<title>Decreased expression of Tnxb is associated with cartilage degradation by joint bleeding in F8<sup>â/â</sup> mice</title>
<p>To assess the potential relevance of TNXB in HA <italic>in vivo</italic>, we established a mouse model for HA, in which F8<sup>â/â</sup> mice received a needle puncture injury to the knee joint <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.

IHC staining further demonstrated lower expression of Col2a1 and increased expression of Mmp13 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3, C-F</xref>). Next, micro-CT was used to assess the influence of hemarthrosis in osteogenesis. An obvious osteopenia was detected in subchondral bone at 4 and 8 weeks post injury (Supplemental Figure 3, B-E). As expected, the above histopathological changes in F8<sup>â/â</sup> mice following needle puncture were similar with what we observed in Human HA. Meanwhile, decreased expression of Tnxb and increased expressions of Dnmt1 were showed in articular cartilages 4 and 8 weeks following injury (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3, G-J</xref>). Above results suggest that TNXB might be protective against HA and its cartilage suppression is closely related to HA development.</p>

<p>It is well known that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway regulates apoptosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, and our KEGG analysis and IHC staining confirmed the involvement of this pathway in HA cartilage degeneration (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5, M</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">N</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>HA, a common manifestation of hemophilia, is typical characterized by dramatic cartilage degradation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Thus, the goal of our work was to provide a novel insight into pathogenic mechanisms underlying HA cartilage degeneration. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 G</xref> summarized our findings. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis revealed the DNA methylation changes in cartilages from hemophilia patients and identified <italic>TNXB</italic> gene associated with HA. The decreased expression of TNXB protein was also confirmed in both human and mouse HA cartilages. Further, <italic>Tnxb</italic> knockdown promoted ECM catabolism and chondrocyte apoptosis, and eventually accelerated the development of HA in F8<sup>â/â</sup> mice. Meanwhile, decreased TNXB expression inhibited the activation of Akt <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Notably, AKT agonist enhanced ECM synthesis and suppressed apoptosis in <italic>Tnxb</italic>-KD chondrocytes. From these findings, it could be hypothesized that abnormal methylation and decreased expression of TNXB are responsible for disruption of cartilage homeostasis in HA.</p>
<p>In hemophlia patients, recurrent joint bleeding creates a toxic environment including multifaceted processes such as hemosiderin deposition, inflammatory response and mechanical pressure overload <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. DNA methylation is a dynamic epigenetic modification in response to environment. Using genome-wide DNA methylation analysis, we found 1228 significant DMRs associated with HA with 69.95% hypermethylated, which was also supported by a corresponding increase in DNMT1 and DNMT3A protein levels in HA cartilages. DNA methylation at gene promoter region is one of the important epigenetic mechanisms in the regulation of gene expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. The identified HA-related DMRs showed high proportion in transcriptional start sites. These data suggest that DNA methylation is a critical mediator in the pathology of HA. Nevertheless, due to limited HA cartilage specimens, the mRNA transcription levels of DMR-related genes were not explored in this study. Further studies using additional HA samples will be conducted to investigate the possible transcriptional alteration of identified genes as well as their potential roles in HA development.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our enrichment analysis showed that DMR-related genes were significantly enriched in ECM organization and ECM-receptor interaction terms. It is consistent with previous reports that ECM acts as an epigenetic informational entity capable of transducing and integrating intracellular signals via ECM-receptor interaction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. DMR-related genes enriched in these terms, many are known to be critical compositions of cartilage matrix, such as <italic>COMP</italic>, <italic>COL1A1</italic> and <italic>COL1A2</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. In Articular cartilage, ECM provides nutrients and mechanical support for chondrocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, and its age-related stiffening epigenetically regulates gene expression and compromises chondrocyte integrity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Above findings highlight that ECM-related genes are potential candidates for HA.</p>
<p>Tenascin-X (TNXB), an ECM glycoprotein, is the top differentially methylated gene in HA cartilages. Its expression was downregulated in human and mouse HA cartilages by IHC staining. TNXB belongs to tenascin family, whose members (TNC, TNR, TNXB, and TNW) share a similar domain pattern: an N-terminal oligomerization domain, a series of epidermal growth factor-like repeats, a variable number of fibronectin-type III (FNIII) repeats and a C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Emerging evidence suggests the involvement of TNC in cartilage development and degeneration in arthritis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Here, we prove for the first time a role of TNXB in cartilage homeostasis <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Specifically, <italic>Tnxb</italic> knockdown contributed to an increase in Mmp13 expression and decrease in Col2a1 expression in chondrocytes. In agreement with these findings, knockdown of <italic>Tnxb</italic> in cartilages of F8<sup>â/â</sup> mice resulted in accelerated HA-like lesions. The FNIII repeats domain of TNXB undergoes alternative splicing to interact with different ECM proteins and growth factors, and then affects ECM network formation and three-dimensional collagen matrix stiffness <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Thus, future study would benefit from exploring the effect of the FNIII repeats domain in HA development to further clarify the specific mechanisms of TNXB.</p>
<p>The process of HA development is accompanied by the chondrocyte apoptosis which in part promotes the ECM degeneration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. We also observed remarkably increased apoptosis following joint bleeding in F8<sup>â/â</sup> mice. Interestingly, <italic>Tnxb</italic> knockdown could significantly induce apoptosis in chondrocytes <italic>in vitro</italic>, and even aggravate apoptosis in mouse HA cartilage, by enhancing expression of markers associated pro-apoptosis (Bax, C-Caspase3) and suppressing anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2). In TNXB family, TNC was reported to inhibit human chondrosarcoma cell apoptosis by activation of Akt <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. PI3K signaling pathway regulated Akt phosphorylation to suppress apoptosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Our KEGG ananlysis of DMGs showed the potential association of PI3K/Akt signaling with HA. We then detected much lower phosphorylation level of Akt in <italic>Tnxb</italic>-KD chondrocytes and HA models. In addition, AKT agonist effectively restored the abnormal Mmp13 expression and apoptosis induced by <italic>Tnxb</italic> knockdown. As evidenced by prior studies, AKT signaling can also affect cartilage metabolism by regulating Mmp13 expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. These findings indicate that AKT activation mediates the effect of TNXB on HA chondrocytes apoptosis and ECM catabolism. Thus, therapeutic effect of AKT agonist on HA development deserves further study.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Conclusively, our study provides the first comprehensive methylation profile in the progression of knee HA, and shows that abnormal expression of TNXB is important in HA cartilage degeneration by suppressing the activation of AKT. These findings provide a new insight into mechanisms responsible for HA disease and suggest TNXB as a potentially novel therapeutic target for HA treatment.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Chen and colleagues first compared the cartilage tissues collected from OA and HA patients using histology and immunostaining. Then, a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was performed, which informed the changes of a novel gene, TNXB. IHC confirmed that TNXB has a lower expression level in HA cartilage than OA. Next, the authors demonstrated that TNXB levels were reduced in the HA animal model, and intraarticular injection of AAV carrying TNXB siRNA induced cartilage degradation and promoted chondrocyte apoptosis. Based on KEGG enrichment, histopathological analysis, and western blot, the authors also showed the relationship between TNXB and AKT phosphorylation. Lastly, AKT agonist, specifically SC79 in this study, was shown to partially rescue the changes of in vitro-cultured chondrocytes induced by Tnxb knock-down. Overall, this is an interesting study and provided sufficient data to support their conclusion.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
(1) Both human and mouse samples were examined.</p>
<p>
(2) The HA model was used.</p>
<p>
(3) Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was performed.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
(1) In some experiments, the selection of the control groups was not ideal.</p>
<p>
(2) More details on analyzing methods and information on replicates need to be included.</p>
<p>
(3) Discussion can be improved by comparing findings to other relevant studies.</p>
<p>
(4) The use of transgenic mice with conditional Tnxb depletion can further define the physiological roles of Tnxb.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This manuscript mainly studied the biological effect of tenascin XB (TNXB) on hemophilic arthropathy (HA) progression. Using bioinformatic and histopathological approaches, the authors identified the novel candidate gene TNXB for HA. Next, the authors showed that TNXB knockdown leads to chondrocyte apoptosis, matrix degeneration, and subchondral bone loss in vivo/vitro. Furthermore, AKT agonists promoted extracellular matrix synthesis and prevented apoptosis in TNXB knockdown chondrocytes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
In general, this study significantly advances our understanding of HA pathogenesis. The authors utilize comprehensive experimental strategies to demonstrate the role of TNXB in cartilage degeneration associated with HA. The results are clearly presented, and the conclusions appear appropriate.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Additional clarification is required regarding the gender of the F8-/- mouse in the study. Is the mouse male or female?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The manuscript by Dr. Chen et al. investigates the genes that are differentially methylated and associated with cartilage degeneration in hemophilia patients. The study demonstrates the functional mechanisms of the TNXB gene in chondrocytes and F8-/- mice. The authors first showed significant DNA methylation differences between hemophilic arthritis (HA) and osteoarthritis through genome-wide DNA methylation analysis. Subsequently, they showed a decreased expression of the differentially methylated TNXB gene in cartilage from HA patients and mice. By knocking down TNXB in vivo and in vitro, the results indicated that TNXB regulates extracellular matrix homeostasis and apoptosis by modulating p-AKT. The findings are novel and interesting, and the study presents valuable information in blood-induced arthritis research.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors adopted a comprehensive approach by combining genome-wide DNA methylation analysis, in vivo and in vitro experiments using human and mouse samples to illustrate the molecular mechanisms involved in HA progression, which is crucial for developing targeted therapeutic strategies. The study identifies Tenascin XB (TNXB) as a central mediator in cartilage matrix degradation. It provides mechanistic insights into how TNXB influences cartilage matrix degradation by regulating the activation of AKT. It opens avenues for future research and potential therapeutic interventions using AKT agonists for cartilage protection in hemophilic arthropathy. The conclusions drawn from the study are clear and directly tied to the findings.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
(1) The study utilizes a small sample size (N=5 for both osteoarthritis and hemophilic arthropathy). A larger sample size would enhance the generalizability and statistical power of the findings.</p>
<p>
(2) The use of an animal model (F8-/- mouse) to investigate the role of TNXB may not fully capture the complexity of human hemophilic arthropathy. Differences in the biology between species may affect the translatability of the findings to human patients.</p>
<p>
(3) The study primarily focuses on TNXB as a central mediator, but it might overlook other potentially relevant factors contributing to cartilage degradation in hemophilic arthropathy. A more holistic exploration of genetic and molecular factors could provide a broader understanding of the condition.</p>
