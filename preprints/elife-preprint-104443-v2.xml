<title>Abstract</title>
<p>In brain regions featuring ongoing plasticity, the task of quickly encoding new information without overwriting old memories presents a significant challenge. In the rodent olfactory bulb, which is renowned for substantial structural plasticity driven by adult neurogenesis and persistent turnover of dendritic spines, we show that by synergistically combining both types of plasticity this flexibility-stability dilemma can be overcome. To do so, we develop a computational model for structural plasticity in the olfactory bulb and show that it is the maturation process of adult-born neurons that enables the bulb to learn quickly and forget slowly. Particularly important are the transient enhancement of the plasticity, excitability, and susceptibility to apoptosis that characterizes young neurons. The model captures many experimental observations and makes a number of testable predictions. Overall, it identifies memory consolidation as an important role of adult neurogenesis in olfaction and exemplifies how the brain can maintain stable memories despite ongoing extensive neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The learning and subsequent retention of information are fundamental tasks of the brain. Thus, plasticity during learning must allow for the rapid acquisition of new memories without quickly overwriting existing ones. When memories differ in valence, e.g. by an associated reward, more important memories can be specifically protected against overwriting by less important new information. Often, however, an animal is continually presented with new information without such distinguishing cues. In these situations, the brain faces the “flexibility-stability dilemma” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Grossberg (1982</xref>): it has to flexibly encode new memories while preserving the stability of previous ones.</p>
<p>The flexibility-stability dilemma can classically be resolved through the process of systems consolidation where memories are rapidly encoded by the hippocampus and gradually transferred to the neocortex where they remain quite stable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">McClelland et al. (1995)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Roxin and Fusi (2013</xref>). In systems where consolidation is restricted to the very circuit that encoded the information in the first place, it is not yet well understood how this issue is combated. It has previously been addressed in models built on theoretical, complex synapses that are characterized by cascades of depressed and potentiated states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Fusi et al. (2005)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Benna and Fusi (2016</xref>); however, detailed experimental evidence for systems in which this local mechanism resolves this issue without making use of systems consolidation is not yet available.</p>
<p>Here, we address this issue by considering perceptual learning in the olfactory system. Perceptual learning is a form of continual learning in which an animal learns to discriminate between similar stimuli through repeated exposure to the stimuli without the stimuli being associated with any explicit rewards or aversions that may modulate plasticity and thus prioritize or protect specific memories. In the olfactory system, certain types of perceptual learning have been shown to occur in the olfactory bulb (OB) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">McNamara et al. (2008)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Gschwend et al. (2015</xref>), which is renowned for its high degree of structural plasticity, most notably through adult neurogenesis. Experiments have demonstrated that adult neurogenesis is necessary for this learning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Moreno et al. (2009)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Li et al. (2018</xref>), and computational modeling provides some understanding of the underlying mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Chow et al. (2012)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adams et al. (2019)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Shani-Narkiss et al. (2020)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Kersen et al. (2022</xref>). However, these behavioral observations could also be explained by synaptic plasticity alone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Sailor et al. (2016)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Meng and Riecke (2022</xref>). What, then, is the purpose of adding large numbers of new neurons? And why remove a sizable fraction of them again later?</p>
<p>Using a computational model of the OB, we demonstrate that the synergistic interaction between adult neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity can provide a massive computational advantage in olfactory memory by ameliorating the flexibility-stability dilemma. Importantly, it is not the adding of neurons as such but the maturation process of the adult-born neurons that achieves this goal: the experimentally observed heightened excitability and plasticity of newly arrived young cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Kelsch et al. (2009)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Nissant et al. (2009)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Wallace et al. (2017</xref>) allow them to rapidly store new memories when they are young; the memories then stabilize as the aging neurons become less plastic. Furthermore, the transiently increased excitability of new neurons is important for helping them integrate into the network, while on longer time scales, their higher rate of apoptosis is needed to remove unnecessary neurons that would interfere with the ability of newer neurons to integrate when learning new odors.</p>
<p>Our biophysically motivated model captures a host of recent experimental observations, including how adult-born neurons are preferentially recruited to process new odors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Moreno et al. (2009)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Forest et al. (2019</xref>, 2020), and how the silencing of these neurons extinguishes memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Forest et al. (2020</xref>). Additionally, young neurons are highly sensitive to retrograde interference and die if a new odor is presented without the previously presented odor still being present in the environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Forest et al. (2019</xref>). Moreover, our model makes multiple experimentally testable predictions including that the rapid re-learning of a forgotten odor pair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Sultan et al. (2010</xref>) is enabled by the sensory-dependent dendritic elaboration of neurons that initially encoded the odors, and that the observed rapid re-learning would occur even if neurogenesis was blocked following the first enrichment and even though the initial learning did require neurogenesis. Furthermore, long time periods without odor enrichment or without apoptosis are predicted to negatively impact the subsequent ability to learn new odors.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We studied the effects of adult neurogenesis in a structurally constrained computational model that was designed to include many important, specific biological aspects of the olfactory bulb. Previous theoretical work has found conflicting results regarding the effects of new neurons on old memories, and the findings seem to depend sensitively on the implementation of neurogenesis, network architecture, and task <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Aimone and Gage (2011</xref>). Although simpler models could be used to investigate adult neurogenesis, to gain biological insight it is therefore essential to study neurogenesis in a model derived from the relevant biological processes and tasks.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Formulation of the model</title>
<p>We considered an OB network comprising two distinct layers of neurons: the primary layer consisting of excitatory mitral cells (MCs) and the secondary layer composed of inhibitory granule cells (GCs), the preeminent neurogenic population in the OB. We omit preprocessing in the glomerular layer, although it also involves adult-neurogenesis, but on a much smaller scale <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Lledo et al. (2006</xref>). In each timestep, new adult-born granule cells (abGCs) were added to the GC layer. The MCs received sensory input via glomerular activation patterns, forming representations of the stimuli in terms of the MC activity. These representations were shaped by inhibition from GCs, mediated through fully reciprocal synapses—each connection from a MC to a GC was paired with a reciprocal connection from that GC back onto the same MC. This bidirectional connectivity allowed GCs to both integrate and modulate MC activity, thereby reformatting sensory representations before they were projected to the olfactory cortex for further processing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) MCs relay stimuli to cortex. Reciprocal synapses with GCs can be functional or non-functional (cf. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1C</xref>).

<p>The sparse structural characteristics of the dendritic networks were incorporated within both the MC and GC populations by allowing each GC to form synaptic connections with only a subset of MCs, which we refer to as the dendritic field of the GC. The MC-GC synaptic network was persistently modified by activity-dependent structural synaptic plasticity in which synapses located on GC dendrites were formed and eliminated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Livneh and Mizrahi (2012)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Sailor et al. (2016</xref>). Because such structural plasticity is known to rely on the local calcium concentration at the spine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Kasai et al. (2021</xref>), we adapted a previously published model that approximates the calcium concentration at each synapse as a function of pre- and post-synaptic activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Graupner and Brunel (2012</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and Synaptic Plasticity in Methods)</p>
<p>The synaptic dynamics were modeled with a Markov chain consisting of three states: non-existent, unconsolidated, and consolidated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Non-existent synapses represent locations where a synapse between an MC and a GC is geometrically possible but not realized. Unconsolidated synapses represent filopodia, silent synapses, or unconsolidated spines that provide a foundation for a functional synapse but do not yet generate a postsynaptic response. Finally, consolidated synapses represent fully functional connections. We assumed that synapses transition between the unconsolidated and non-existent states at a constant rate, independent of activity. Conversely, transitions between unconsolidated and consolidated synapses occured with an activity-dependent rate so that sensory experience shapes the functional connectivity of the network. This assumption arises from experimental findings that GC spine dynamics depend on GC activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Breton-Provencher et al. (2014</xref>, 2016); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Saha et al. (2021</xref>).</p>
<p>In the OB, apoptosis is activity-dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Benson et al. (1984)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Yamaguchi and Mori (2005)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Lin et al. (2010)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Yokoyama et al. (2011</xref>) with young abGCs more susceptible than mature GCs <xref rid="c103" ref-type="bibr">Yam-aguchi and Mori (2005</xref>). Furthermore, the survival of abGCs has been shown to be modulated by behavioral state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Yokoyama et al. (2011)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Yamaguchi et al. (2013)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Komano-Inoue et al. (2014</xref>) and impacted by enrichment with novel, but not with familiar odors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Veyrac et al. (2009</xref>). Therefore as a minimal model of apoptosis, we assumed that fully mature GCs had a low threshold of activity required for survival, while young abGCs had a higher threshold. In addition, the latter were susceptible to an apoptotic signal that was triggered by olfactory enrichment, which further raised the threshold, similar to the two-stage model for GC elimination proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Yokoyama et al. (2011)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Yamaguchi et al. (2013)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Komano-Inoue et al. (2014</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate the role of the aforementioned transient properties of newly arrived abGCs (summarized in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>), we evaluated the network’s performance in a perceptual learning task where the network learns to discriminate between two similar stimuli purely through brief, repeated exposure to these stimuli (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). In the olfactory bulb, it has been established that adult neurogenesis is required for such a task <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Moreno et al. (2009</xref>), but not if there is reward <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Imayoshi et al. (2008</xref>). This suggests that a major function of neurogenesis lies not in reinforcement-based behavior, but in refining sensory representations through mere experience. To simulate this implicit learning, the network is repeatedly presented with brief, alternating, similar artificial stimuli (“enrichment”) and assessed in its ability to discriminate between these stimuli by comparing their MC-representations. We quantified this discriminability in terms of the Fisher discriminant (Discrimination in Supplementary Information). The enhancement in discriminability parallels the formation of an odor-specific network structure. We therefore quantified the memory in terms of the specificity of that connectivity (cf. Memory in Methods).</p>

<title>Age-dependent plasticity and excitability reconcile flexibility and stability of memory</title>
<p>In order to establish what can be gained from the addition of new neurons alone, we initially disregarded apoptosis and the transient properties of abGCs, resulting in a baseline model of adult neurogenesis where a homogeneous population of GCs grew over time. We define a neurogenic network as one in which the number of GCs grows linearly over time, and a non-neurogenic network as one with a fixed GC population size corresponding to the size of the neurogenic network at initialization. In <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> we simulated the perceptual learning experiment using neurogenic (solid lines) or non-neurogenic (dashed lines) networks comprising either uniformly fast (green) or slow (blue) synapses. There was no significant difference between the results of the neurogenic and non-neurogenic models, so neurogenesis alone did not impact learning or memory.</p>
<p>Due to the pivotal roles of plasticity rates in memory encoding, we first explored the impact of the differing rates of synaptic plasticity in young and old GCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The rates of spine turnover were calibrated to align with empirical data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Sailor et al. (2016</xref>) (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>). This transiently enhanced plasticity partially resolved the flexibility-stability dilemma, as the age-dependent network encoded memories more swiftly than the network of slow synapses while maintaining greater stability than the network with fast synapses (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, red curves). Thus, the heightened plasticity of young abGCs allowed them to rapidly encode new memories and retain them as the neurons matured and their plasticity rate decreased.</p>
<p>In addition to the stronger plasticity abGCs exhibit increased excitability during their critical period. Mechanistically, excitability and plasticity are distinct: excitability governs a neuron’s likelihood of firing in response to input, whereas plasticity determines the rate and extent of synaptic change given that activation occurs. To assess the impact of the increased excitability, we repeated the simulations incorporating it in addition to the enhanced plasticity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Now, the model achieved a higher initial memory strength, which was on par with that reached by the fast network, while retaining the stability of the slow network (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>, red curve). Importantly, this only occurred in conjunction with age-dependent plasticity and not in the networks with constant plasticity rates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>, blue and green curves). Thus, the increased excitability in young abGCs cooperates with their increased plasticity to improve the initial memory of the OB.</p>
<p>Models of adult neurogenesis often have a common drawback: as the networks grow, their performance tends to decrease due to greater interference by the accumulating adult-born neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Meltzer et al. (2005)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Aimone et al. (2011)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Kudithipudi et al. (2022</xref>). We hypothesized that the increased excitability of young abGCs may mitigate this effect by raising the activity of abGCs that would otherwise be quieted through lateral inhibition from the vast population of mature GCs. To test this, we conducted a simulation where the onset of enrichment was progressively delayed, allowing an increasing number of GCs to accumulate in the OB (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). We carried this out in cases with and without enhanced excitability of young abGCs. In keeping with previous results, accumulation of adult born neurons eventually prevents the network from learning (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Here, this is due to excessive inhibition that suppresses the activity of new abGCs, preventing them from becoming selectively tuned to stimuli (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>). However, the network featuring age-dependent excitability substantially outperformed the network without this feature. Thus, the transiently enhanced excitability of abGCs contributed to maintaining the learning flexibility of the OB in the face of persistent neurogenesis.</p>
<p>To better understand how memories were encoded in the OB, we analyzed the MC-GC connectivity immediately following enrichment. We performed hierarchical clustering on the columns of the connectivity matrix, in order to cluster GCs into groups of similar connectivity. There were two distinct clusters: a large portion of GCs were non-specifically connected (purple in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>), while others exhibited an increased total number of synapses and were preferentially connected with MCs that responded strongly to the enrichment odors (orange in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). Thus, due to the reciprocal nature of all synapses, the mutual disynaptic inhibition was enhanced among the odor-responsive MCs. Cluster membership was then sorted by GC birthdate relative to enrichment, which revealed that abGCs that were young at the beginning of the enrichment period (yellow shaded area) were preferentially recruited to the learning cluster (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). While the degree of overall recruitment was similar, the degree of preferential recruitment was increased through the transient hyperexcitability (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>). Thus, age-dependent excitability leads to the greater preferential recruitment of young, rapidly learning adult-born neurons which in turn strengthens initial memories. Separately, as a result of this learning, synapses of odor-responding MCs were redistributed from the non-learning cluster to the learning cluster (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>, vertical MC degree bar plots). This is similar to findings in the hippocampus that young adult-born neurons both add new synapses to the network and replace existing synapses formed by mature GCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Adlaf et al. (2017</xref>). Notably, even with increased initial excitability abGCs that arrived in the OB during the enrichment phase (blue area) made only a minimal contribution to the memory (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I,J</xref>). This conflicted explicitly with the experimental finding that the silencing of these abGCs extinguishes this memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Forest et al. (2019</xref>, 2020). We therefore asked whether this discrepancy could be reconciled by considering additional known developmental properties of abGCs.</p>

<title>The dendritic structure of abGCs latently encodes memories</title>
<p>An important aspect of GC development is the period of dendritic development when newborn neurons are integrating silently into the OB. Because of experimental evidence that the elaboration of distal dendrites of abGCs depends on sensory input <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Saghatelyan et al. (2005)</xref>; <xref rid="c105" ref-type="bibr">Yoshihara et al. (2012</xref>, <xref rid="c106" ref-type="bibr">Yoshihara et al. 2016</xref>), we biased the dendritic field of abGCs such that abGCs were more likely to have potential synapses with MCs that were more active when the GC was 8-14 days old (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). While this did not substantially affect flexibility or stability of the network (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A</xref>), it allowed the model to achieve strong memories even when the GCs could only connect to a small fraction of all MCs, consistent with the sparse connectivity of the bulb (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). More importantly, it led to the preferential recruitment of abGCs that arrived in the OB and were still developing during enrichment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, blue areas) over those that were already in their critical period (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, yellow area).

<p>We also examined the savings effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ebbinghaus (1885</xref>) in which the re-learning of forgotten information occurs more rapidly than the initial learning. This effect has been observed in an olfactory associative learning task, where abGCs seem to be playing a significant role <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Sultan et al. (2010</xref>). We examined this in our perceptual learning framework by simulating a similar relearning experiment and exploring what happens if neurogenesis is blocked during relearning (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). The model predicts that GCs that initially encoded the memory are re-recruited to the odors during reenrichment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). While these GCs were no longer as highly excitable or plastic as young GCs, they had the advantage that their dendritic fields overlapped strongly with MCs that are excited during enrichment, allowing them to efficiently re-establish their synaptic connections. This led to savings where the memory increased more rapidly during the re-enrichment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, despite the fact that neurogenesis is typically required for learning, the model predicts that savings will be seen even if neurogenesis is blocked during the second enrichment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E, F</xref>). Importantly, these observations did not occur without the activity-dependent dendritic elaboration of young abGCs (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3B</xref>), meaning the dendrites encoded “latent memories” that facilitated the rapid re-expression of a previously encoded memory upon re-exposure to the stimulus.</p>

<title>Targeted apoptosis maintains flexibility</title>
<p>The final property of GC development that we investigated is the death of GCs through apoptosis, which is heightened for abGCs in their critical period (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). This critical period of survival led to two noteworthy phenomena. First, when tracking the growth of the OB, the number of GCs initially grew approximately linearly, while growth eventually started to slow down (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), as observed experimentally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Platel et al. (2019</xref>). Second, there was a high rate of apoptosis in older young abGCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, yellow area) in response to olfactory enrichment but not in abGCs that arrived in the OB during enrichment (blue area) or mature GCs (unshaded area). This is similar to experimental results that show enhanced death of ‘middle-aged’ abGCs, but not young or more mature abGCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Mouret et al. (2008</xref>).</p>

<p>What are the potential implications of apoptosis on memory encoding? One known outcome is that it subjects newly formed memories to retrograde interference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Forest et al. (2019</xref>). In these experiments, there were two enrichment periods with odors that activated largely non-overlapping sets of GCs. If the second enrichment occurred while abGCs that encoded the memory of the first enrichment were still in their critical period, then these abGCs succumbed to apoptosis and the memory was extinguished. Our model captured this and identified that the dissimilarity of the odors is essential (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>): because the connectivity developed by the odor-encoding GCs during the first enrichment was odor-specific, these GCs were inactive during the second enrichment and therefore more susceptible to apoptosis. If, alternatively, there was a long enough gap between the enrichment periods, or if the odors from the first enrichment were present during the second enrichment, then the abGCs encoding the first memory survived and the memory was consolidated in both the model and experiments. This highlights how apoptosis can selectively remove abGCs, and how only naive, young abGCs are available to encode new odors.</p>
<p>Yet the question still remains if apoptosis can facilitate the formation of new memories rather than exclusively eliminate old ones. Based on the observation in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref> that the growing inhibition from persistent neurogenesis restricts the ability to form new memories, we hypothesized that apoptosis may help maintain the flexibility of memory formation. To test how well the network learned under different levels of apoptosis, in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D,E</xref> the network was enriched with a variable frequency of enrichments, with each new enrichment consisting of a new, sparse, random pair of odors (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A</xref>). Because enrichment eliminated a large portion of abGCs that were late in their critical period at enrichment onset (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), we expected to see more apoptosis and thus improved learning in trials with greater enrichment frequency. Indeed, with high frequency, the network flexibly learned all odors similarly well (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>), but with low frequency, the initial memory strength of later odors decreased substantially as neurons accumulated in the OB (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4D</xref>). As a result, the model predicts that long periods without olfactory enrichment or with apoptosis blocked negatively impact the ability to learn new odors.</p>

<title>Adult neurogenesis supports life-long learning</title>
<p>To study the capacity of the OB to continually encode new stimuli, we simulated an experiment where we sequentially enriched the OB network on twenty-five sparse, random odor pairs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>) and measured how the properties of the memories change over time. Our full model of the OB supported the flexible encoding of stable memories (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Learning flexibility, measured as the initial memory of the enrichment odors, was strongest at the start of the simulation; but it declined only slightly in subsequent enrichments and approached a steady value when the growth of the network started to saturate (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6</xref>). Additionally, memories remained stable: the decay of the individual memory traces was barely affected by subsequent, interfering enrichments. This resulted in multiple odors having substantial memories at the final time of measurement, and these memories were graded according to the time of acquisition.</p>

</fig>
<p>To show what properties of the OB are required to produce these results, we repeated the simulations under several different model conditions. First, in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, we blocked apoptosis. While memories still remained stable, flexibility suffered greatly as the network eventually failed to learn. Notably, the memories of early enrichments were not strongly impacted, indicating that short-term suppression of apoptosis should not affect learning, consistent with observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Mouret et al. (2009</xref>). Next, we additionally removed the enhanced excitability of young abGCs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Not only did flexibility decline more substantially, but memory stability also suffered as larger drops (see arrow) were evident in the individual memory traces during later enrichments. Finally, we considered a non-neurogenic network featuring only synaptic plasticity and none of the transient properties of abGCs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). While this network could flexibly form new memories, they were not stable as each subsequent enrichment led to the overwriting of old memories, severely limiting the memory capacity.</p>
<p>To evaluate quantitatively how the memory that was formed in the first enrichment deteriorated due to the ongoing encoding of new odors, we compared the memory traces of the first enrichment in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B-E</xref> to the memory trace of the same odor, but without any subsequent enrichments. Taking the ratio between these two traces shows the extent to which new stimuli overwrote old memories (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). The non-neurogenic model displayed the most overwriting, with prominent overwriting events during the first few enrichments. Next, the network without the transiently enhanced excitability of young abGCs featured a moderate amount of overwriting, as young abGCs were no longer preferentially recruited to learn new odors. Finally, the full model and the model without apoptosis featured similarly low levels of overwriting, indicating that apoptosis is required for memory flexibility but not stability.</p>
<p>Because of the low degree of overwriting occurring in our full model of the OB, memory decay was primarily due to spontaneous synaptic changes. A large degree of spine turnover has been observed at MC-GC synapses in response to spontaneous activity alone, even on mature GCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Livneh and Mizrahi (2012)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Sailor et al. (2016</xref>). We investigated the implications of this by comparing the results of the full model (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>) to those of a model of the OB in which plasticity was instead completely prevented in older GCs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). In this model, new memories briefly decayed due to spontaneous plasticity in young abGCs, but then were maintained for the duration of the simulation. Although there was explicitly no synaptic overwriting, the memories still featured a slow decay due to the apoptosis of odor-encoding GCs. Apoptosis was more prominent in this network because the odor-encoding neurons featured a larger number of synapses (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>) that would otherwise be reduced through spontaneous plasticity. Thus, there was a greater degree of inhibition in the network, reducing GC survival (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6</xref>). Importantly, these excess synapses lead to more interference, which degraded the flexibility in this network (cf. initial memories in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B, G</xref>). This suggested that the strong synaptic fluctuations among mature GCs served to increase flexibility by removing potentially interfering, un-maintained memories of odors. Of course, this strategy has the drawback that memories are less stable, but this drawback is mitigated by the latent memories of the odors being stored in the dendrites of abGCs, which allow for their rapid re-acquisition if the odors are once again present in the environment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we showed a clear computational advantage of adult-neurogenesis in ongoing memory encoding. In a computational model of the OB, the increased plasticity exhibited by abGCs in their critical period allowed them to rapidly encode new information, while their subsequent development and the resulting decrease in plasticity rate ensured that the memories they encode remain stable. Meanwhile, the increased excitability of young abGCs enhanced their preferential recruitment in learning new information, while also helping maintain the flexibility of the system as new neurons accumulate in the OB. Apoptosis similarly helped maintain learning flexibility through the targeted removal of abGCs that fail to learn the odors presented during their critical period. Furthermore, the activity-dependent dendritic elaboration of juvenile abGCs led to pre-configured sub-networks of similarly aged abGCs that enabled the rapid re-acquisition of memory. All of these elements were required to reproduce the relevant experimental results.</p>

<title>Other models addressing the flexibility-stability problem</title>
<p>From a signal-theoretic perspective, both initial strength and duration of a new memory should improve as synapses are added to the network. Due to the metabolic cost of forming and removing synapses it is important to use them efficiently. This is especially true for neurogenic systems in which the increase in the number of synapses is associated with the addition of new neurons. The efficiency of the system can be characterized by how strongly its memory performance increases when the number <italic>N</italic> of synapses is increased.</p>
<p>To assess this efficiency, we adapted a framework proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Fusi et al. (2005)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Roxin and Fusi (2013</xref>) to analyze how memories degrade in response to ongoing plasticity (Supplementary Information SI2). In systems where both learning and forgetting occur on the same, fast time scale the overall memory capacity grows only logarithmically with <italic>N</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Amit and Fusi (1994)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Fusi and Abbott (2007</xref>). However, our computational model predicted that a network with age-dependent plasticity rates can have a vastly larger memory capacity on the order of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="583153v4_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> (cf. Supplementary Information SI2). This emphasizes not only that the augmented capacity of the model predominantly arises from the transiently increased plasticity rather than the mere addition of synapses, but also that this model efficiently uses the new synapses provided by adult neurogenesis.</p>
<p>These results are commensurate with earlier models specifically designed to address the flexibility-stability dilemma, particularly the classical cascade model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Fusi et al. (2005</xref>) and the partitioned-memory model of systems consolidation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Roxin and Fusi (2013</xref>) (<xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Figure S8</xref>). However, our model does not yield an increase in memory duration that is linear in <italic>N</italic> as demonstrated by the more complex bidirectional cascade model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Benna and Fusi (2016</xref>). This difference underscores the intricate interplay of synaptic plasticity mechanisms and their impact on memory consolidation.</p>

<title>Why neurogenesis?</title>
<p>If there exist alternative methods that are theoretically demonstrated to consolidate memory with comparable effectiveness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Fusi et al. (2005)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Roxin and Fusi (2013)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Benna and Fusi (2016</xref>), why does the OB opt for adult neurogenesis? Adult neurogenesis is a rare phenomenon in mammals, but more common in organisms with less complex nervous systems, such as reptiles, birds, and fish. This contrast suggests an evolutionary pressure to reduce neurogenesis that is resisted by the OB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Aimone (2016</xref>). To understand why neurogenesis is nevertheless favored in the OB, it is crucial to examine the specific function of the OB and its constituent GCs.</p>
<p>There have been numerous studies that propose different theories for the function of the MC-GC network in processing odors. In particular, both processes implementing Bayesian inference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Grabska-Barwinska et al. (2016)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Tootoonian et al. (2022</xref>) and sparse incomplete representations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Koulakov and Rinberg (2011</xref>) have been proposed, with each offering a computational rationale for how the olfactory bulb (OB) might achieve pattern separation — an effect that has been experimentally observed in the OB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Gschwend et al. (2015</xref>). This pattern separation is supported by recurrent inhibition between MCs that is mediated by GCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Wick et al. (2010)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Wiechert et al. (2010)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Koulakov and Rinberg (2011</xref>). This processing is similar to contrast enhancement and edge enhancement that is performed in visual processing already in the retina. Although the OB and retina differ in their anatomical organization, (e.g. the retina lacks the reciprocal connectivity found in the OB), both systems employ lateral inhibition between neurons with correlated activity. In natural visual stimuli correlations are high among neighboring ‘pixels’, reflecting the contiguity of physical objects. For such stimuli, local lateral inhibition among neighboring ‘pixels’ is sufficient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Hartline and Ratliff (1957</xref>) and the connectivity does not need to adapt to specific visual scenes.</p>
<p>Olfactory stimuli, however, lack this topographic correlation structure and are extremely high-dimensional. Thus, even if similar odors were to differ only in neighboring ‘olfactory pixels’ in this high-dimensional space, their projection onto the two-dimensional arrangement of glomeruli results in ‘fragmented’ activation patterns, wherein the relevant ‘olfactory pixels’ are widely distributed across large portions of the bulbar surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Cleland and Sethupathy (2006)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Soucy et al. (2009</xref>). While initial contrast enhancement can then still be performed locally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Cleland and Sethupathy (2006</xref>), computations that aim to incorporate the correlation structure of the stimuli require specific lateral connectivity over larger distances, as provided by GCs.</p>
<p>Only a subset of odors is innately relevant to a species and can likely be processed with a fixed, pre-wired connectivity. However, many odors are not experienced for the first time until later in life and must then be learned on demand. For instance, mother sheep encounter the odors that allow them to recognize their off-spring only after that off-spring is born <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Brennan and Keverne (1997</xref>). The OB must therefore allow for life-long learning, where the flexible learning of new stimuli while maintaining the stability of old memories is crucial. Our modeling demonstrates that neurogenesis and the development of abGCs provide exactly this. However, we also showed that both the survival of too many memories and of too many GCs can harm the flexibility of the network. This raises the question of which memories and GCs should endure and for how long. Previous experiments and our modeling show that after an odor is learned, the abGCs recruited to that odor are subject to retrograde interference during their critical period: unless the initial odor is maintained in the environment the learning of a new memory decreases the survival of the abGCs associated with the earlier odor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Forest et al. (2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Past their critical period, the abGCs are much more stable. Nevertheless, the animals lose the memory of the learned odor over the course of 30-40 days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Forest et al. (2019</xref>). However, at that point they can re-acquire that memory faster than they had learned it initially <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Sultan et al. (2010</xref>). This is consistent with the relevant synaptic connections being lost, reflecting the strong spontaneous formation and removal of GC spines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Sailor et al. (2016)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Meng and Riecke (2022</xref>), while the relevant GCs are still present and provide - through their stable dendrites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Mizrahi (2007)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Sailor et al. (2016</xref>) - a latent memory that can quickly be reactivated by reforming the relevant synapses. While experiments have shown that cortical feedback and neuromodulation in response to different environmental or behavioral states may provide an apoptotic signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Yokoyama et al. (2011)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Komano-Inoue et al. (2014</xref>), what precisely controls the survival of GCs is not quite clear. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Sultan et al. (2010</xref>) the GCs die over the course of 90 days in the absence of the odor they memorized. In the experiments of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Platel et al. (2019</xref>), however, in which animals were not exposed to any tasks, little if any cell death is reported. From a functional point of view, the long-term survival of odor-encoding abGCs in the absence of further exposure to the memorized odor is expected to be controlled by the need to avoid interference with new odors while accommodating the possibility that the same odor will reappear at some later point in time.</p>
<p>Thus, our modeling suggests that the high dimension of odor space, together with the need for animals to learn specific novel odors quickly but stably, strongly favors structural plasticity through adult neurogenesis and apoptosis.</p>

<title>Relation to adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus</title>

<p>In our model, while abGCs born after learning cause interference in the network and perturb MC responses, only a vast increase of the post-learning neurogenesis rate would significantly alter the memory duration (<xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7</xref>). Our research suggests a different role for adult neurogenesis: the age-dependent properties of the abGCs can stabilize memories for more than a month that would otherwise decay over the course of a week (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2B</xref>). In view of the metabolic costs of neurogenesis, this would seem to be a better investment than memory clearance.</p>

<title>The development of birthdate-dependent subnetworks</title>
<p>A key outcome of our model is the development of birthdate-dependent odor-specific subnetworks. This applies not only to the synaptic networks, but also to the underlying dendritic networks. In the model, this is because abGCs born in a similar time window begin development in a similar environment. We therefore predict that the rapid re-learning observed in an olfactory associative learning task <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Sultan et al. (2011</xref>) would also occur in a perceptual learning experiment and would still be present even if neurogenesis was blocked after the initial enrichment.</p>
<p>This would be notable for two reasons. First, it has been shown that neurogenesis is required for perceptual learning of fine odor discrimination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Moreno et al. (2009</xref>). Therefore, if re-learning were to occur without neurogenesis, then it would indicate that there is some structure storing a latent memory that is not expressed behaviorally. Second, the fast re-learning was not seen in the model without activity-dependent dendritic elaboration, so it would suggest that the dendritic tree may be a substrate of this latent memory. Importantly, these latent memories only persist as long as the neurons encoding them survive. It remains to be seen if periodic re-exposure to stimuli after learning can extend the lifetime of odor-encoding abGCs, as would be expected in a model where the OB predominantly eliminates GCs that encode extraneous information.</p>
<p>Similar results of birthdate-dependent subnetworks have been observed experimentally as a result of embryonic neurogenesis in the hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Huszár et al. (2022</xref>). In this study, place cells in CA1 were observed to form assemblies where neurons were more likely to be in the same assembly with other neurons born on the same day compared to those born on different days. Importantly, in a place alternation task, these cells have also been observed to remap together, maintaining sub-assemblies across environments. In this sense, the hippocampal neurons exhibited a set of pre-configured activity patterns dependent on their birth-date, reminiscent of the latent memories we describe in our model.</p>

<title>The role of apoptosis in learning</title>
<p>In addition to predictions about relearning, the model predicts that apoptosis helps maintain the flexibility of the OB and that reduced apoptosis would lead to memory deficits (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). In standard, non-enriched laboratory conditions, the observed rate of apoptosis of abGCs after they have established themselves in the OB network is low <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Platel et al. (2019</xref>). In such conditions, the model predicts that abGCs that fail to encode any relevant information accumulate in the OB and add non-specific inhibition to the OB, making it more difficult for new abGCs to integrate into the OB when new odors are presented.</p>
<p>Olfactory enrichment eliminates many abGCs that are late in their critical period that may otherwise survive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Forest et al. (2019)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Mouret et al. (2008</xref>). At the same time, it also enhances the number of abGCs that survive until they start integrating into the network, despite the unchanged proliferation rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Rochefort et al. (2002</xref>). The latter mechanism has not been built into the model, making it natural to wonder if this would impact the results in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>. To address this, we doubled the number of new neurons available to integrate into the network during enrichment (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4</xref>) and found this did not qualitatively change the results.</p>
<p>We expect that the enhanced flexibility due to apoptosis would likely be most pronounced in mice between six and twelve months, when olfactory perceptual memory deficits start to appear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Greco-Vuilloud et al. (2022</xref>) and the growth of the granule cell layer starts to slow down <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Platel et al. (2019</xref>). Indeed, very recently it has been observed that long-term olfactory enrichment improves memory in this cohort of mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Terrier et al. (2024</xref>).</p>
<p>Importantly, there are many other modulators of abGC survival beyond olfactory enrichment. For example, apoptosis can be induced by a variety of behavioral states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Yokoyama et al. (2011)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Yamaguchi et al. (2013)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Komano-Inoue et al. (2014</xref>). In the natural world we would therefore expect to see a more substantial degree of apoptosis, which the model predicts to preserve the flexibility of the OB.</p>

<title>Model assumptions and outlook</title>
<p>In developing the computational model we have made a number of assumptions that are consistent with current experimental observations, but for which the underlying biophysical mechanisms are still poorly understood. The model therefore points to aspects of neurogenesis the experimental exploration of which would be particularly important in order to understand the functional relevance of adult neurogenesis.</p>
<p>We have assumed that MC-GC connectivity is fully reciprocal; however this is not the case in the biological system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Egger and Kuner (2021</xref>). Previous work from our group suggests that the result presented here would be robust to moderate drops in reciprocity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Chow et al. (2012</xref>). Additionally, an important aspect of olfactory processing is the spike timing of MCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Wilson et al. (2017)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Bolding and Franks (2017)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Chong et al. (2020</xref>). The relative timing of spikes from a few select MCs can have an outsized effect on olfactory perception <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Chong et al. (2020</xref>). Capturing these timing aspects would require more complex spiking models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Gilra and Bhalla (2015)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Li and Cleland (2017</xref>), rather than simple rate models. Notably, it has been shown that MC-GC connections alter MC spike timing and phase information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Gilra and Bhalla (2015)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Egger and Kuner (2021</xref>), highlighting connectivity as a key quantity in the quantification of memory. This motivates our ideal observer approach, which focuses on network connectivity rather than neuronal activity. Depending on how the memory is represented in the neuronal activity, only a subset of the connectivity may be needed to support a given memory. Assuming that learning novel unrelated odors will overwrite the learned connectivity randomly, that subset of the connectivity is expected to persist or deteriorate in proportion to the memory strength we associate with the full connectivity. We therefore expect that our modeling captures the essentials of the memory persistence, independent of how odors are encoded in neuronal activity.</p>
<p>A prominent feature of olfaction is the extensive top-down input to the OB, which can be through glutamatergic input to specific bulbar neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Boyd et al. (2015)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Otazu et al. (2015)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Wu et al. (2020</xref>), or can act diffusely via neuromodulators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Mandairon et al. (2006</xref>). These inputs can provide additional information to the OB about the context of the sensory input <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Mandairon et al. (2014</xref>), its valence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Lindeman et al. (2024</xref>), or the internal state of the animal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Boyd et al. (2015</xref>). They can arise from the piriform cortex or the anterior olfactory nucleus and modulate mostly the activity of mitral or of tufted cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Chae et al. (2022</xref>).</p>
<p>In the context of memory formation, a key aspect is whether this additional input can prioritize certain stimuli over others. This could occur through a top-down reward signal for a specific odor or through neuromodulatory input signifying something akin to attention or novelty <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Veyrac et al. (2007</xref>). In this case, the top-down input could modify the learning process in an odor-specific way to protect the memory of important stimuli against overwriting by memories of less important stimuli.</p>
<p>In this study, however, we are concerned with perceptual learning where animals learn to distinguish between similar stimuli through repeated exposure, but without any cues indicating the relative importance of each stimulus. Notably, although no explicit reinforcement is provided, this form of learning has been shown to require noradrenaline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Veyrac et al. (2007</xref>, 2009), in contrast to associative learning which can occur independently of noradrenergic signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Veyrac et al. (2009</xref>). Based on this, in our model we assume that the noradrenergic system is active during the learning process, but that it does not differentiate between stimuli. This could be implemented as a stimulus-independent bias in neural and synaptic properties and our current model should suffice regardless of the specific implementation. In this case, the top-down input would be the same for all stimuli in question and the system would still face the stability-flexibility dilemma.</p>
<p>If, however, specific stimuli are associated with specific non-olfactory contexts, e.g. visual inputs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Mandairon et al. (2014</xref>), top-down inputs could mark some stimuli as more important to retain. Such top-down input would need to be modeled explicitly. An earlier computational model of adult neurogenesis suggests that in such situations the GCs develop odor-specific receptive fields with respect to their sensory and their top-down inputs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adams et al. (2019</xref>). As a result, the top-down inputs associated with a given stimulus selectively activate GCs that, through their reciprocal connections, inhibit predominantly MCs coding for that stimulus. This gives the top-down inputs very specific control of the bulbar response to the associated odor and enhances or reduces odor discrimination depending on the non-olfactory input.</p>
<p>The combined neurogenic and synaptic plasticity investigated in the current paper leads to a bulbar network structure that is similar to the bulbar component generated by the top-down model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adams et al. (2019</xref>). A straightforward extension of the combined model along the lines pursued in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adams et al. (2019</xref>) would most likely also reveal specific cortical control of bulbar odor processing by top-down inputs, which could include modification of the learning process depending on non-olfactory information transmitted by the top-down input, as observed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Wu et al. (2020</xref>). Such feedback might not only alter the plasticity of existing circuits but also bias the recruitment of abGCs toward particular stimulus features, thereby shaping the composition of the resulting engram. Indeed, different learning paradigms have been shown to recruit distinct cohorts of abGCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Mandairon et al. (2018)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Wu et al. (2020</xref>), suggesting that task structure directly influences how and where information is stored. However, when the different stimuli in question do not differ in their contextual or valence information, as is the case in basic perceptual learning, the system still has to deal with the stability-flexibility dilemma. While it is expected that the age-dependent properties of the abGCs will alleviate that issue also in this more complex scenario, answering this question definitively would require further studies.</p>

<p>Because a GC can only form synapses with MCs whose dendrites come physically close to its own dendrites, we impose the restriction that GCs can only make synapses with a predetermined set of <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>conn</italic></sub> MCs. Since the MC dendrites extend across large portions of the olfactory bulb, we allowed connections between cells independent of the physical distance between somata. For neonatal GCs, this subset was randomly chosen. For abGCs, however, starting in Section “The dendritic structure of abGCs latently encodes memories”, this subset was chosen in a semi activity-dependent manner to reflect the activity-dependent and -independent mechanisms which guide dendritic growth in developing cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Wong and Ghosh (2002)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Saghatelyan et al.

<title>Synaptic plasticity</title>
<p>We model synaptic dynamics as a Markov chain with three states: non-existent, unconsolidated, and consolidated. We include the unconsolidated state, since experimentally it is found that a substantial fraction of spines that are identified optically is lacking PSD-95 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Saha et al.

We assume state transitions from non-existent to unconsolidated occur randomly with a constant rate <italic>α</italic> and state transitions from unconsolidated to non-existent with constant rate <italic>β</italic>. Meanwhile, state transitions to and from the consolidated state rely on pre- and post-synaptic activity.

We further assume that each synaptic state is associated with a fixed weight value.

(2009</xref>). It has also been shown that apoptosis is more commonly observed during certain behavioral states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Yokoyama et al. (2011)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Yamaguchi et al. (2013)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Komano-Inoue et al. (2014</xref>), and, when triggered, is enhanced in GCs receiving fewer sensory inputs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Yokoyama et al. (2011</xref>). Moreover, GC survival can be increased by increasing the intrinsic excitability of the cells and relies on NMDARs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Lin et al. (2010</xref>). Together, these results indicate that apoptosis depends on activity and age of GCs, as well as the environment and internal state of the animal. Therefore, to parsimoniously capture these results, we assume a “removal signal” occurs during enrichment that can cause young abGCs to be even more susceptible to apoptosis, raising the <italic>G</italic><sub>0</sub> value for young cells further (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). This mechanism is similar to the two-stage model for GC elimination proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Yokoyama et al. (2011)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Yamaguchi et al.

<title>Memory</title>
<p>To assess the ability of the model to learn, we introduce an anatomic memory measure that is based on the network connectivity. Using an ideal observer approach, we assume that we have access to all synaptic strengths in the network. While the brain is unlikely to use such specific information to express memories, this gives us a limit on memory strength and duration and allows us to analyze how the OB network changes in response to olfactory enrichment.</p>
<p>We characterize the memory strength<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="583153v4_inline24.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> with which odor pair <italic>s</italic> is ‘memorized’ by GC <italic>i</italic> by the similarity (scalar product) between the average activity of MCs in response to that odor pair and the inhibition levied on those MCs by a unit activation of the GC <italic>i</italic>,

First we compared the distance between the two largest clusters in the data with the null distribution of distances between the largest clusters of shuffled data.

<title>Robustness and parameters</title>
<p>The full list of parameters of the model and their default values is found in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> and <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The parameters <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>pre</italic></sub> and <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>post</italic></sub> were fit using the genetic algorithm <monospace>ga</monospace> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">The MathWorks Inc. (2022)</xref> to optimize memory following enrichment (<xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">Figure S9A</xref>). The parameters <italic>α, β</italic>, and <italic>p</italic> were fit to match the rates of spine turnover in young and mature abGCs found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Sailor et al. (2016</xref>). Meanwhile, other parameters were tuned by hand to be consistent with more coarse experimental evidence. For example, <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> controls memory decay due to spontaneous synaptic changes and was chosen such that memories endure for up to 30 days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Forest et al.

Additionally, the number of abGCs added each day, <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>add</italic></sub> was chosen so that the ratio<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="583153v4_inline27.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>matched experimental estimates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kaplan et al. (1985</xref>). Still, several parameters had to be chosen without any available experimental support. Below is a discussion of a few selected parameters and their impact on the simulations.</p>
<table-wrap id="tbl2" orientation="portrait" position="float">
<label>Table 2.</label>
<caption><title>Age independent parameters. Parameter values used in the simulation of the model unless stated otherwise.</title></caption>

</table-wrap>
<p>The first parameters that we assessed were those associated with the abGC critical period (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The initial memory was robust to changes in the enhanced level of excitability of young abGCs, <italic>r</italic>, although learning declined slightly for the largest values we tested (<xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">Figure S9B</xref>). We next examined the model’s dependence on the survival threshold of young abGCs, <italic>G</italic><sub>0</sub> (<xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">Figure S9G</xref>). Increasing this parameter led to larger drops in the survival of abGCs that were already in their critical period at enrichment onset (yellow shaded area) without affecting the survival of most younger abGCs (blue shaded area), or the initial memory formed during enrichment.</p>
<p>We next explored the ramifications of other parameters associated with adult neurogenesis, starting with the neurogenesis rate, <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>add</italic></sub> . Unsurprisingly, reducing the neurogenesis rate leads to weaker memories, but as <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>add</italic></sub> is increased, the memory saturates (<xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">Figure S9C</xref>). Our choice of <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>add</italic></sub> is in the saturated regime. We then looked at the noise parameter <italic>ϵ</italic> that represents the activity-independent component of dendritic elaboration (<xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">Figure S9D</xref>). As would be expected, the amount of noise is inversely related to the memory of the network. More significantly, for low levels of noise, the dendritic elaboration was dominated by MC activity, such that GCs predominantly connected to MCs driven by the enrichment even if the spine dynamics were independent of activity. Such specificity in the dendritic network may be unlikely, so we chose a level of noise that allows the memory to decay to zero. This parameter also influences relearning (<xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">Figure S9H</xref>). In the range we explored, relearning remained faster than the initial learning on average, but the degree to which relearning was faster was much larger in trials with less noise. Likewise, the size of the dendritic network also affects relearning (<xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">Figure S9I</xref>). When we doubled the size of this network, GCs did not need the sensory-dependent dendritic elaboration to learn the odors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), and thus did not leverage the advantage this mechanism provides unless the amount of noise was low. In this scenario however, abGCs that had already fully developed their dendrites at the onset of enrichment were responsible for learning, inconsistent with experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Forest et al. (2019</xref>, 2020) and the results of <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>.</p>
<p>The final parameters we tested were involved in the synaptic plasticity rule. First we looked at the relative rate of consolidation to deconsolidation. Within the range we tested, we saw no significant change in learning ability (<xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">Figure S9E</xref>), suggesting that this parameter does not substantially affect any of the results. Finally we tested the parameter <italic>k</italic> in the sliding threshold<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="583153v4_inline28.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. Compared to other parameters shown, small changes in <italic>k</italic> resulted in more significant changes. If <italic>k</italic> was too small, GCs did not prune synapses that were not beneficial to processing the odors, leading to non-specific connectivity and poor learning (<xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">Figure S9F</xref>). Alternatively, if <italic>k</italic> was too large, neurons started to have difficulty consolidating beneficial synapses, also harming learning.</p>

<title>Discriminability</title>
<p>In addition to using a connectivity-based learning measure, we use an activity-based learning measure to characterize to what extent learning enhances the ability of downstream cortical neurons to discriminate between the odors based on their read-out of the MC activities. Because the MC rate model does not include any fluctuations in activity that would limit discriminability, we assume that the rates represent the mean values of independent Poisson spike trains for which the variance is given by their mean. We assume a linear read-out of the MC activities with the weights chosen optimally and characterize the discriminability of stimuli <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic> in terms of the optimal Fisher discriminant <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>opt</italic></sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adams et al. (2019</xref>),
<disp-formula id="eqn1a">
<graphic xlink:href="583153v4_eqn1a.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Thus, it can be seen that <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>opt</italic></sub> will increase with the addition of MCs, reflecting the fact that even poorly discriminating MCs provide some additional information about the odors.</p>
<p>To verify that our connectivity-based measure of memory aligns with the function of the OB, we calculated the time course of the Fisher discriminant using the data that generated the results in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B</xref>). Indeed, both measures yield qualitatively similar results, with the fast network learning and forgetting quickly, the slow network learning and forgetting slowly, and the age-dependent network learning quickly and forgetting slowly. Likewise, the neurogenic and non-neurogenic networks performed similarly.</p>
<p>In this study, we focused on the changes in the network connectivity rather than changes in MC activity. We therefore assessed the behavior of the system mostly in terms of the connectivity-based memory. This measure for the memory is agnostic with respect to the odor code, i.e. it does not depend on the type of read-out of the OB activity used by the animal (e.g. rate-based or timing-based <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Wilson et al.

<title>Comparison with other methods resolving the flexibility-stability dilemma</title>
<p>Previous theoretical work has established a general framework in order to track the memory of an arbitrary stimulus in a stream of random uncorrelated stimuli based only on the properties of the network, without explicitly modeling neuronal activity. It has been used to evaluate models that confront the flexibility-stability dilemma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Fusi et al. (2005)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Roxin and Fusi (2013)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Benna and Fusi (2016)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Fusi (2021</xref>). In networks with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="583153v4_inline29.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> simple synapses where plasticity occurs on a uniformly fast time scale, the initial memory grows as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="583153v4_inline30a.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> while overall memory capacity grows only logarithmically with <italic>N</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Amit and Fusi (1994)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Fusi and Abbott (2007</xref>). Meanwhile, the complex synapses of the cascade model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Fusi et al. (2005</xref>) and the bidirectional cascade model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Benna and Fusi (2016</xref>) as well as the heterogeneity and structure of the partitioned memory system model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Roxin and Fusi (2013</xref>) have been shown to allow the network to achieve far greater capacity. In the case of the cascade model and the partitioned memory system model, memory capacity on the order of<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="583153v4_inline30.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>can be achieved, and in the case of the bidirectional cascade model memory capacity on the order of <italic>N</italic> can be achieved, though the latter requires a great degree of complexity in the synapses.</p>
<p>To understand the scaling properties of our model and how they compare with other models, we situated it within this framework. More specifically, we consider a network initially with <italic>N</italic> binary synapses. At each time step, each synapse is independently presented with a plasticity event, which attempts to flip the synapse depending on the presented stimulus and is accepted with probability <italic>q</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, the plasticity rate of synapse <italic>i</italic> (<xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Figure S8A</xref>). To quantify memory performance, we tracked the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a single arbitrary stimulus previously encoded by the network (<xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Figure S8B</xref>). We report the flexibility as the SNR immediately after stimulus presentation (the “initial memory” SNR(0)). The stability we characterize in terms of the time <italic>T</italic> that it took for the SNR to decay to the value of 1 due to the storage of subsequent memories (the “memory lifetime”), which can be interpreted as the memory capacity. The presented stimuli are random and uncorrelated. Thus, on average the initial memory signal <italic>μ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic> = 0) of a stimulus associated with synapse <italic>i</italic> is <italic>q</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> and the total initial memory signal <italic>μ</italic>(0) of the network is
<disp-formula id="eqn2a">
<graphic xlink:href="583153v4_eqn2a.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as this is a system of binomially distributed variables, the variance of the signal can be roughly approximated as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="583153v4_inline30b.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Roxin and Fusi (2013</xref>), leading to a signal-to-noise ratio <italic>SNR</italic>(0) of

</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Roxin and Fusi (2013</xref>) show, the dynamics of the signal to noise ratio of the memory can be described by
<disp-formula id="eqn4a">
<graphic xlink:href="583153v4_eqn4a.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>

</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>To incorporate the key element of our plasticity model, we extend this model by making the plasticity rates <italic>q</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> depend on the ages of the cells such that
<disp-formula id="eqn6a">
<graphic xlink:href="583153v4_eqn6a.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>q</italic><sup><italic>f ast</italic></sup> ≫ <italic>q</italic><sup><italic>slow</italic></sup> and <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> is the duration of the critical period during which the synapse is highly plastic. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Fusi et al. (2005</xref>), we choose <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="583153v4_inline31.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. If, at the time of the stimulus presentation, the fraction of synapses on young GCs is <italic>k</italic>, then according to Eq.3 the <italic>SNR</italic> of that memory is given by
<disp-formula id="eqn7a">
<graphic xlink:href="583153v4_eqn7a.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>If <italic>kq</italic><sup><italic>f ast</italic></sup> ≫ <italic>q</italic><sup><italic>slow</italic></sup>, the initial memory is controlled by the fast plasticity rate, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="583153v4_inline31a.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. Indeed, in the rat brain the total number of GCs is a few million, while roughly 10,000 more are born on each day <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kaplan et al. (1985</xref>). Since the critical period lasts about 14 days, about 140,000 GCs have enhanced plasticity, so <italic>k</italic> is on the order of 0.1. Thus assuming <italic>N</italic> ∼ 10<sup>8</sup>, <italic>kq</italic><sup><italic>f ast</italic></sup> ≈ 10<sup>−1</sup> ≫ <italic>q</italic><sup><italic>slow</italic></sup> ≈ 10<sup>−4</sup> is a valid assumption.</p>
<p>The memory duration is determined by the time <italic>T</italic> at which <italic>SNR</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) falls below some fixed threshold <italic>θ</italic><sub><italic>SNR</italic></sub>. Solving Eqs.3-6, we have that for <italic>t</italic> ≥ <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>, <italic>SNR</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) is given by
<disp-formula id="eqn8a">
<graphic xlink:href="583153v4_eqn8a.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>We use this to solve for the memory duration <italic>T</italic> where <italic>SNR</italic>(<italic>T</italic>) = <italic>θ</italic><sub><italic>SNR</italic></sub>. Again, using<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="583153v4_inline32.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>and <italic>q</italic><sup><italic>f ast</italic></sup> ∼𝒪 (1) we get
<disp-formula id="eqn9a">
<graphic xlink:href="583153v4_eqn9a.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>For large <italic>N</italic>, memory duration scales approximately as<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="583153v4_inline33.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, where the leading<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="583153v4_inline34.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>arises from the inverse of <italic>q</italic><sup><italic>slow</italic></sup>. This shows that while initial memory is controlled by the fast plasticity of immature synapses, memory duration is controlled by the slow plasticity rate of mature synapses.</p>
<p>We verified these results computationally. First we compared the memory decay of our model to those of homogeneous models as well as the cascade model and the partitioned memory system model for a network of approximate size to the rat OB (<xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Figure S8C</xref>). We show our model (red) has a similar initial memory and memory duration as the cascade model (blue) and the partitioned memory system model (green), all of which far outpace the initial memory of the slow-synapse model (grey) and the memory duration of the fast-synapse model (black). Notably, this reiterates that the increased memory capacity provided by neurogenesis is due to the age-dependent properties of adult-born neurons rather than the addition of neurons alone, and that this age-dependence can most efficient utilize the new synapses provided by adult neurogenesis.</p>
<p>Finally, we examine how the initial memory and the memory duration scale with <italic>N</italic> (<xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Figure S8D</xref>). We confirm that both the initial memory (<xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Figure S8E</xref>) as well as the memory lifetime approximately follow<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="583153v4_inline35.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>(<xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Figure S8F</xref>). Thus, like the cascade model and the partitioned-memory model, our age-dependent model robustly resolves the plasticity-flexibility dilemma, simultaneously achieving the greatest initial memory and memory duration possibly afforded by the homogeneous network with constant plasticity.</p>

<caption><title>(Related to <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) Effects of increased abGC survival during enrichment.</title>
<p>(A) Example sparse, random stimuli. For each stimulus pair, 20% of MCs were randomly selected to be stimulated. Of these MCs, half were highly stimulated and half were moderately stimulated for the first stimulus in the pair. For the second stimulus, the MCs that were previously highly stimulated were moderately stimulated and those that were previously moderately stimulated became highly stimulated. This was to ensure the stimuli in the pair are difficult to discriminate. (B,C) Simulations in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D,E</xref> were repeated while doubling the number of new, fully functional abGCs on each day of enrichment to mimic the established results that olfactory enrichment increases the number of abGCs that survive until they start integrating into the network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Rochefort et al. (2002</xref>). This functional doubling of neurogenesis slightly increases the initial memory of each enrichment (see also <xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">Figure S9D</xref>), but does not impact the prediction that more frequent enrichment improves memory.

<p>The experiments in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Forest et al. (2019</xref>) were simulated for different pairs of artificial stimuli. (A-C) Experimental protocols in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Forest et al. (2019</xref>). There were two enrichment periods with two different pairs of stimuli separated by either a 4 (A,C) or 14 (B) day interval. In (C) the odors from the first enrichment were also presented during the second enrichment period in addition to the new odors. (i-iii) Enrichment stimuli. In (i) the enrichment odors were largely non-overlapping. For (ii) and (iii), moderately and highly overlapping stimuli were generated, respectively, by using for stimulus 2 correspondingly cyclically shifted versions of stimulus 1. Line plots show the memory traces resulting from the enrichment protocol marked with the corresponding color in the same row and the stimuli in the same column. Lines: mean over eight trials, shaded areas: range of values. Bar plots show the percentage of GCs that encoded the first enrichment that survived at the end of the simulation. Odor-encoding GCs were determined by clustering the connectivity of GCs at the end of the first enrichment (cf. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2</xref>). Bars indicate the mean and error bars show the standard deviation. (Ai) The memory of the first enrichment was extinguished during the second enrichment and there was a significant level of apoptosis among odor-encoding GCs. (Bi) The second enrichment did not substantially affect the initial memory, and there was little apoptosis among odor-encoding GCs. (Ci) The initial memory and the GCs that encoded that memory persist through the second enrichment. (Aii) There is a significant decline in the initial memory during the second enrichment, although the odor-encoding GCs survive throughout the simulation, indicating the memory decline is a result of overwriting rather than apoptosis. (Bii) A slight memory decline occurs during the second enrichment. (Cii) The initial memory is maintained, but the network struggles to encode the second memory. (Aiii-Ciii) The second enrichment does not lead to any deficit in the initial memory, and there is no significant apoptosis.</p></caption>

<p>(A) We assume there exists an optimal configuration that can process a given stimulus. In this framework, the network directly encodes this configuration stochastically according to the plasticity rate at each synapse, and at each time point a new stimulus is presented to the network. We track the memory of the network as the degree of overlap between the optimal network for a given stimulus and the current configuration of the network (see Supplementary Information “Comparison with other methods resolving the flexibility-stability dilemma”).

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Sakelaris and Riecke used computational modeling to explore how neurogenesis and sequential integration of new neurons into a network support memory formation and maintenance. They focus on the integration of granule cells in the olfactory bulb, a brain area where adult neurogenesis is prominent. Experimental results published during recent years provide an excellent basis to address the question at hand by biologically constrained models. The study extends previous computational models and provides a coherent picture of how multiple processes may act in concert to enable rapid learning, high stability of memories, and high memory capacity. This computational model generates experimentally testable predictions and is likely to be valuable to understand roles of neurogenesis and related phenomena in memory. One of the key findings is that important features of the memory system depend on transient properties of adult-born granule cells such as enhanced excitability and apoptosis during specific phases the development of individual neurons. The model can explain many experimental observations, and suggests specific functions for different processes (e.g., importance of apoptosis for continual learning). While this model is obviously a massive simplification of the biological system, it conceptualizes diverse experimental observations into a coherent picture, it generates testable predictions for experiments, and it and will likely inspire further modeling and experimental studies.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- The model can explain diverse experimental observations</p>
<p>- The model directly represents the biological network</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- As many other models of biological networks, this model contains major simplifications.</p>

<p>The manuscript is focused on local bulbar mechanisms to solve the flexibility-stability dilemma in contrast to long range interactions documented in other systems (hippocampus-cortex). The network performance is assessed in a perceptual learning task: the network is presented with alternating, similar artificial stimuli (defined as enrichment) and the authors assess its ability to discriminate between these stimuli by comparing the mitral cell representations quantified by Fisher discriminant analysis. The authors use enhancement in discriminability between stimuli as function of the degree of specificity of connectivity in the network to quantify the formation of an odor-specific network structure which as such has memory - they quantify memory as the specificity of that connectivity.</p>
<p>The focus on neurogenesis, excitability and synaptic connectivity of abGCs is topical, and the authors systematically built their model, clearly stating their assumptions and setting up the questions and answers. In my opinion, the combination of latent dendritic representations, excitability and apoptosis in an age-dependent manner is interesting and as the authors point out leads to experimentally testable hypotheses.</p>
<p>In the revised manuscript, the authors have systematically addressed my previous concerns. In particular, they now refer to previous work on granule cells-mitral cell interactions more generally, they explain the pros and cons for usage of specificity in connectivity as a proxy for memory capacity, and the biological plausibility of the model.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p>
<p>(1) Figure 2 and related text: it would be useful to explain more explicitly what is meant by &quot;neurogenic&quot; and &quot;non-neurogenic&quot; models. I presume that the total number of neurons in non-neurogenic models is lower than in neurogenic models because no new neurons are added. It would be useful to plot the number of GCs as a function of timesteps.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have clarified the distinction between neurogenic and non-neurogenic models in the text (Lines 142-145), explicitly noting that in non-neurogenic models, no new GCs are added, resulting in a lower total neuron count over time. In response to the reviewer’s suggestion, we generated a plot showing the number of GCs over time (see below). Because the neurogenic model exhibits a simple linear increase, we found this plot not especially informative for inclusion in the manuscript. However, we agree with the reviewer’s later comments that similar plots are useful for interpreting specific results, and we have included those where appropriate.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Figure 2F, G: memory declines dramatically when the number of GCs at enrichment onset increases beyond an optimum. Why?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have explained the reasoning more thoroughly in the text (Lines 174-177) and added a new supplemental figure to support this reasoning (Figure S2). As the number of GCs increases, the network becomes overly inhibited and the response of abGCs to the stimuli decreases (Fig S2A). This leads to a smaller population of GCs being able to integrate with the stimulus (Fig S2B) which is expected given the activity-dependent plasticity rule. Moreover, it can be seen in Fig S2C that for networks with increasing size, the GCs that do learn only connect to MCs that are driven strongest by the stimuli until they struggle to connect to any MCs at all.</p>
<p>In principle, a homeostatic mechanism like synaptic scaling could reduce activity to restore balance, but such a mechanism would also likely disrupt existing memories. Alternatively, we suggest activity-dependent apoptosis as a superior homeostatic mechanism because it leads to a stable level of activity without substantially erasing existing memories.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The paragraph describing synaptic connectivity of abGCs (related to Figure 2H) is confusing. What is the directionality of synapses considered here: mitral-to-granule, or granule-to-mitral? The text is opaque here. Connectivity matrix in Figure 2H: who is presynaptic, who is postsynaptic? If I understand correctly, these questions are actually irrelevant because all mitralgranule synapses in the network are reciprocal. This should be pointed out explicitly in the figure legend. Generally: the fact that the network is fully reciprocal (if I understand correctly) is very important but not stated with sufficient emphasis. It should be stated very explicitly in the text that connectivity matrices are fully reciprocal, and an equation clarifying this point should be included in Methods.</p>
<p>(6) Connectivity matrix: to what degree was connectivity between mitral and granule cells reciprocal (fraction of connections in either direction that were paired with a connection in the opposite direction between the same cell pair)? Was connectivity shaped by experience (enrichment) reciprocal?</p>
<p>(7) Directly related to the above: it would be useful to show the disynaptic connectivity matrix between mitral cells and analyze its symmetry. For the symmetric component, it should then be analyzed what fraction of this can be attributed to the reciprocal synapses, and what fraction is contributed by connectivity via different granule cells. This should then be compared to models with biologically realistic fractions of reciprocal connections. Is the model proposed here consistent with a biologically realistic fraction of reciprocal synapses between mitral-granule cell pairs?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate these insightful and detailed comments. We agree that the assumption that MC-GC synapses were fully reciprocal was not clearly stated. We now explicitly state this in the main text (lines 90-94, 369-370, Figure 2 caption) and methods (line 561), emphasize its importance. As the reviewer points out, this is a simplifying assumption and does not fully reflect the biology because not all synapses are reciprocal in the true system. We also note that our synaptic plasticity model does not break the reciprocity assumption: all connections added or pruned during learning remain reciprocal. As a result, the disynaptic connectivity matrix (Bottom panel below, MCs sorted by stimulus as shown in the top panel) is always symmetric.</p>
<p>We have now made these statements explicit in the main text and in the methods. Regarding functional consequences of this assumption, earlier work by our group has examined the impact of the degree of reciprocity of MC-GC synapses in a similar OB model (Chow, Wick &amp; Riecke, Plos Comp Bio 2012). The study examined three different changes in reciprocity by (1) redirecting a fraction of the inhibitory connections of each GC to randomly chosen MCs instead of the MCs that drive that GC, (2) allowing heterogeneity in reciprocal weights so that there is no relationship between the strength of the MC -&gt; GC synapse and the GC -&gt; MC synapse, (3) reducing the level of self-inhibition a MC receives from the GCs that it excites. The model was found to be quite robust to each of these manipulations, suggesting that our present model likely remains functionally relevant even if biological reciprocity is partial. We reference this work now in the discussion, lines 490-492.</p>

<p>(4) How were mitral cells sorted in Figure 2H? This needs to be explained.</p>
<p>(5) Directly related to the point above: the text mentions that synaptic connectivity between GCs of the &quot;learning cluster&quot; and mitral cells (which direction?) is increased for mitral cells responding by enrichment odors, but this is not shown in the figure. This statement suggests that mitral cells sorted to the bottom of the y-axis respond more strongly to enrichment odors, but the information is not given directly. Please provide more information to back up your statements.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed as the reviewer inferred, MCs in Figure 2H were sorted so that those that receive the strongest stimulation from the odor were at the bottom of the y-axis. We have clarified this in the Figure 2 caption and added a subplot to Figure 2H showing the average MC input to make this more explicit.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Apoptosis (Figure 4 and related text): paragraph 231ff is somewhat difficult to comprehend because the &quot;number&quot; of enrichments should really be the &quot;frequency&quot; of enrichments. In Figure 4, it is not mentioned explicitly that each enrichment is with different random new odors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the term “number” of enrichments was imprecise and have revised the text to refer instead to the frequency of enrichment events (Lines 255-267). We also clarified that in Figure 4, each enrichment corresponds to a different set of randomly sampled odors, and we now state this explicitly in both the Figure 4 legend and main text (Lines 260-261).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) Apoptosis: apoptosis improves memory but the underlying reason remains opaque. A simple prediction of the data in Figure 4D and 4E is that the number of GCs in 4E. It would be helpful to show this. Furthermore, an obvious question that arises is whether a higher frequency of enrichments improves memories because the total number of granule cells is kept low, or because granule cells are removed specifically based on their activity (or both). This could be addressed easily by artificially removing a random subset of granule cells in a simulation such as 4E to match granule cell numbers to the case in 4D.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Apoptosis improves learning is because it reduces the total inhibition in the network by removing GCs and thus prevents deficits in learning that occur in Fig. 2G as GCs accumulate in the network. As the reviewer inferred, the number of GCs in Figure 4D is lower than in 4E and this is now clarified in the text. This difference was shown implicitly in Supplementary Figure S4D (previously S3D), but we now explicitly reference this plot to support this point as well (Line 266).</p>
<p>As the reviewer notes, there is a question in whether increased enrichment frequency improves memory because it limits the total number of GCs, or because apoptosis selectively removes GCs based on their activity, or both. Our model supports both mechanisms. Importantly, simply reducing GC numbers through random deletion will degrade existing memories: random removal erodes memory representations encoded by those GCs. In contrast, our age and activity dependent apoptosis rule targets a specific cohort of adult-born GCs. This selective removal minimizes damage to existing memories encoded by GCs outside of this cohort while keeping GC numbers within a regime that supports robust learning (as shown in Figure 2G).</p>
<p>However, we note that if enrichment frequency becomes too high, even recent memories can be lost due to premature pruning of GCs that have not yet stabilized their synaptic connections. This tradeoff has been shown experimentally (Forest et al., Nat Comm 2019) which we reproduce in our model (Figure S4).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) Text related to Figure 5: &quot;Learning flexibility...approached a steady state when the growth of the network started to saturate&quot;. Please show the growth (better: size) of the network (total number of GCs) for these simulations (and other panels in Figure 5). It would also be useful to show the total number of GCs in other figures (e.g. Figure 4; see above).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now added a supplementary figure (Figure S6) that shows the total number of GCs over time for the simulations presented. This confirms that the network size approaches a steady state around the same time that learning flexibility begins to plateau, as noted in the original text (now line 275), and highlights the large number of GCs without apoptosis as well as the slightly reduced number of GCs in the permanent encoding model (line 312).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(11) As much as I appreciate the comprehensive discussion of the results in a broader context, I feel that the discussion can be somewhat shortened. The section on lateral inhibition is not fully valid given that synaptic connectivity is reciprocal. I also feel that much of the final section (Model assumptions and outlook) can be dropped (except for the last paragraph), not because anything is irrelevant, but because these points have been made, onen repeatedly, in the text above.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the discussion could be streamlined and have revised the manuscript accordingly. Specifically, we have shortened the section on lateral inhibition and clarified that the OB relies predominantly on reciprocal connectivity (Line 370). We also agree that parts of the final section were repetitive and have removed these. However, to address comments by Reviewer 3, we also expanded on some of the model assumptions. We thank the reviewer for helping us improve the clarity and focus of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(12) Figure 5: bolding every 5th curve is confusing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have adjusted our figure accordingly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(13) &quot;...we biased the dendritic field...&quot;: it would be helpful to explain the idea of a &quot;dendritic field&quot; in a bit more detail prior to this sentence.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now noted that GC’s &quot;dendritic field&quot; refers to the subset of MCs with which it is capable of forming synaptic connections when we initially describe the model (Line 97).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p>
<p>(1) The authors find that a network with age-dependent synaptic plasticity outperforms one with constant age-independent plasticity and that having more GC per se is not sufficient to explain this effect. In addition, having an initial higher excitability of GCs leads to increased performance. To what degree the increased excitability of abGCs is conceptually necessarily independent of them having higher synaptic plasticity rates / fast synapses?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this question, as the difference between excitability and plasticity rate in memory formation is something we intended to highlight in this study. We have updated the (Lines 157-198) to clarify this.</p>
<p>At the cellular level, a neuron's excitability and its rate of synaptic plasticity are mechanistically distinct: excitability is governed by factors such as ion channel expression or membrane resistance, whereas plasticity rates are influenced by molecular pathways involved in synapse and dendritic spine formation and remodeling. While these are independent properties, they are functionally coupled: most synaptic plasticity rules are activity-dependent, so greater excitability can increase the likelihood of plasticity being induced but does not itself guarantee learning.</p>
<p>Our model reflects this distinction. Increased excitability biases which neurons become activated and thus eligible to undergo plasticity, but actual learning still depends on the plasticity rate itself. This can be seen by comparing the model constant plasticity and excitability (solid blue and green curves in Figure 2C) to the model with only transient excitability (solid blue and green lines in Figure 2E). In both cases, the strength and duration of the memory remain limited by the plasticity rate. We note additionally that, in this network, neurons compete to learn new stimuli: as GCs start to learn, they suppress MC activity through recurrent inhibition which suppresses learning in other GCs who otherwise would have been in position to learn the odor. As a result there is not a significant increase in the overall number of neurons recruited to learn (Figure 2J). In a different network architecture, such as a feedforward network, we would not expect this to be the case; greater excitability in a population of neurons would likely increase the memory by increasing the number of neurons recruited to learn. Transiently enhanced excitability biases which neurons join the memory engram (Figure 2J), but the extent and rate of learning still depend on the plasticity rates themselves. We did note in the original text (now lines 284-286) that this bias in recruitment subtly increases memory stability, but the extent is not great. In principle, a model can be engineered to rely on transiently increased excitability to encode memories in orthogonal subpopulations of neurons and that this could resolve the flexibility-stability dilemma. However, in that case, the number of memories that can be stored within a short time would be bounded by the size of this subpopulation such that even if a large number of odors are presented, mature GCs cannot become part of the engram and the network would likely fail to learn the stimuli. However, when this was tested experimentally (Forest et al. Cereb Cor. 2020), it was found that mature GCs participated in the engram when the number of odors was sufficiently high. Our results are consistent with these experiments: for complex odor environments, neonatal GCs, which are mature during odor exposure, and abGCs both participate in the engrams.</p>

</fig>
<p>In sum, transiently increased excitability alone will not make learning any faster, so a fast learning system must have a high plasticity rate. If this plasticity rate stays high, then memories stored in these neurons, even if no longer highly excitable, will be vulnerable as the neurons can still be driven above their plasticity threshold by moderately interfering stimuli and will thus be quickly forgotten. Conversely, if the reviewer is wondering if a greater increase in the plasticity rate of new neurons can compensate for a lack of excitability, this is not the case: if a newborn neuron is not sufficiently driven by the stimulus it will not learn regardless of how high its plasticity rate is.</p>

<p>(2) The authors do not mention previous theoretical work on the specificity of mitral to granule cell interactions from several groups (Koulakov &amp; Rinberg - Neuron, 2011; Gilra &amp; Bhalla, PLoSOne, 2015; Grabska-Bawinska...Mainen, Pouget, Latham, Nat. Neurosci. 2017; Tootoonian, Schaefer, Latham, PLoS Comput. Biol., 2022), nor work on the relevance of top-down feedback from the olfactory cortex on the abGC during odor discrimination tasks (Wu &amp; Komiyama, Sci. Adv. 2020), or of top-down regulation from the olfactory cortex on regulating the activity of the mitral/tuned cells in task engaged mice (Lindeman et al., PLoS Comput. Biol., 2024), or in naïve mice that encounter odorants (in the absence of specific context; Boyd, et al., Cell Rep, 2015; Otazu et al., Neuron 2015, Chae et al., Neuron, 2022). In particular, the presence of rich topdown control of granule cell activity (including of abGCs) puts into question the plausibility of one of the opening statements of the authors with respect to relying solely on local circuit mechanisms to solve the flexibility-stability dilemma. I think the discussion of this work is important in order to put into context the idea of specific interactions between the abGCs and the mitral cells.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for these detailed and thorough comments, and whole-heartedly agree that it is important to discuss the listed studies in order to contextualize our work through the broader lens of how information is processed in the OB. We have expanded our discussion to further acknowledge and integrate insight from previous theoretical and experimental work cited by the reviewer. (Lines 361-366, 493-550)</p>
<p>Regarding the importance of top-down feedback, we of course recognize that in practice cortical inputs play a critical role in abGC survival and synaptic integration. However, its nature is not quite clear and is likely variable across behavioral seungs. In the paradigm that we study in the manuscript, there is likely no key reward value or contextual signal that is relayed to the OB. One plausible interpretation is that in this task, cortical feedback provides a random, variable baseline excitatory drive to GCs. This would likely be consistent with many of the listed studies, e.g.</p>
<p>(1) Glomerular layer targeting of feedback would be explicitly unrelated to glomerular odor specificity, as in Boyd et al.</p>
<p>(2) GC activity would decrease if these cortical inputs were silenced, resulting in stronger MC responses as in Otazu et al., Chae et al.</p>
<p>(3) Silencing PCx during learning would prevent GCs from reaching activity-dependent plasticity thresholds, resulting in decreased spine density as in Wu &amp; Komiyama.</p>
<p>Likewise activating PCx would lead to increased spine density.</p>
<p>In this interpretation, the effect of top-down input could be captured implicitly by adjusting model parameters such as activity or plasticity thresholds. For the purposes of our study, we opted to neglect these inputs in favor of model simplicity.</p>
<p>Critically, even if top-down inputs play a substantially larger role, by perhaps even going as far as providing signals to abGCs to modulate their development, the core solution to the flexibility-stability dilemma that we describe stays local: we predict that the memory persists in the same network in which it was formed.</p>

<p>(3) To what the degree of specific connectivity reflects a specific stimulus configuration, and is a good proxy for determining the stimulus discriminability and memory capacity in terms of temporal activity patterns (difference in latency/phase with respect to the respiration cycle, etc.) which may account to a substantial fraction of ability to discriminate between stimuli? The authors mention in the discussion that this is, indeed, an upper bound and specific connectivity is necessary for different temporal activity patterns, but a further expansion on this topic would help in understanding the limitations of the model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. Indeed, there have been several recent experimental studies indicating that much of the information needed for olfactory discrimination is encoded in the temporal activity patterns of mitral and tuned cells. Our model does not explicitly simulate these dynamics. It was for this reason that we defined memory in terms of the learned structure of the network rather than by firing rate activity. This is motivated by the idea that learned patterns of connectivity constrain the space of neural activity the network can support, and thus shape stimulus responses. We now make this limitation more explicit in the discussion and clarify that the specific MC–GC connectivity we analyze should be seen as a structural substrate that constrains the possible temporal transformations the network could support (Lines 492-506).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Reward or reward prediction error signals are not considered in the model. They however are ubiquitous in nature and likely to be encountered and shape the connectivity and activity patterns of the abGC-mitral cell network. Including a discussion of how the model may be adjusted to incorporate reward/error signals would strengthen the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion and agree that reward and reward prediction error signals are critical components of many learning paradigms. We deliberately chose not to model associative learning, reward signals or top-down neuromodulation in this work. Our goal is to investigate the role of adult neurogenesis in a regime where its contribution has been shown to be experimentally necessary. Specifically, we focused on an unsupervised perceptual learning paradigm where adult neurogenesis is required for successful odor discrimination (Moreno et al. PNAS, 2008). In contrast, when the same odors are used in a rewarded learning paradigm, performance remains intact even when adult neurogenesis is ablated (Imayoshi et al., Nat. Neuro., 2008). This dissociation suggests that neurogenesis is dispensable in contexts where reward can guide learning. As such, we argue that isolating the contribution of local circuit dynamics in an unsupervised setting is critical to understanding what neurogenesis is uniquely enabling, especially given the evolutionary cost of maintaining it.</p>
<p>We agree that extending this work to incorporate reward-driven plasticity or neuromodulatory influences would be a valuable direction for future research. In particular, it could help clarify how different learning paradigms engage distinct abGC cohorts (e.g., Mandairon et al., eLife 2018; Wu &amp; Komiyama, Sci. Adv. 2020), and how task structure shapes memory allocation and engram composition. We have incorporated this into the discussion regarding extending our model to include top down feedback (lines 539-553).</p>

<p>Specific comments</p>
<p>(1) Lines 84-86; 507-509; Eq(3): Sensory input is defined by a basal parameter of MCs spontaneous activity (Sspontaneus) and the odor stimuli input (Siodor) but is not clear from the main text or methods how sensory inputs (glomerular patterns) were modeled</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now clarify in the Methods section &quot;Stimulus model&quot; how the sensory inputs were modeled. Specifically, odor-evoked inputs to mitral cells (Siodor) were generated either as Gaussian profiles across the mitral cell population (Figs. 2,3) or as sparser random patterns (Figs. 4,5). In Figures 2 and 3, the denser Gaussian stimuli require more GCs to learn the odors, aiding in visualization of the connectivity matrix (Figure 2H) and abGC recruitment plots (Figure 2I,J; Figure 3C,E). However, real olfactory stimuli activate a sparse set of MCs, so in Figures 4 and 5 where we address learning of many stimuli, we utilize sparser, binary, stimuli delivered to only 10% of MCs, in range of experimental data (Wachowiak and Cohen, Neuron, 2001). The fact that the stimuli are binary, however, is not realistic and leads to denser representations. This leads to a worst-case scenario for the model as denser memory representations are easier to overwrite. These points has been added explicitly to the Methods section &quot;Stimulus model&quot; to improve clarity.</p>

<p>(2) Lines 118-122: The used perceptual learning task explanation is done only in the context of the discriminability of similar artificial stimuli using the Fisher discriminant and &quot;Memory&quot; metric. A detailed description of the logic of the perceptual learning task methods and objective, taking into account Comment 1, would help to better understand the model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out had not adequately described the task and have updated the main text (lines 125-132) and included a new methods section &quot;Perceptual learning task&quot; to describe it more explicitly. The experiments that inspired the simulation followed an ecological model of discrimination learning (Moreno et al. PNAS 2009): For one hour a day over a ten day &quot;enrichment period&quot;, two tea balls containing similar but distinct odors were suspended from the lid of each mouse's home cage. The mice engaged with the stimuli under self-directed conditions, therefore learning through natural experience. As a result the mice use olfactory information to discriminate between the similar stimuli, a skill potentially relevant for navigation or social behaviors.</p>
<p>In our simulations, we model these experiments as follows. During the enrichment period, the model is stimulated with a randomly selected stimulus chosen from a set of two similar stimuli, corresponding to a mouse choosing to sniff one of the tea balls. During enrichment, in between these bouts of &quot;sniffing&quot;, the model only receives spontaneous activity, reflecting the temporal sparsity of sensory input even over the enrichment period. Outside of enrichment, the model again receives only spontaneous input.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Rapid re-learning of forgotten odor pair is enabled by sensory-dependent dendritic elaboration of neurons that initially encoded the odors and the observed re-learning would occur even if neurogenesis was blocked following the first enrichment and even though the initial learning did require neurogenesis. When this would ever occur in nature? The re-learning of an odor period? Why is this highlighted in the study?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We believe that this sort of learning is certainly relevant in nature. To clarify: by “learning,” we do not refer to the memory of an entire “odor period”, but simply an altered mapping of specific stimuli. Therefore, forgeung could occur if these specific stimuli are absent from the environment for a period of time, and re-learning would occur when these stimuli are re-encountered. Natural odor environments are highly dynamic, as environmental conditions and social contexts change over time. The odors an animal encounters also depend strongly on its own behavior; as it explores different environments, it may be exposed to particular odors intermittently: it could encounter them in one location, then not return to that location for some time before returning again.</p>
<p>Such natural variability in odor exposure makes the ability to forget and re-learn especially valuable, allowing the animal to prioritize relevant information while maintaining flexibility. To this end, we show in Figure 5G that the synaptic forgetting of odors is beneficial to the performance of the model because it reduces interference in the network. Therefore we highlight that re-learning enabled by adult neurogenesis is a highly efficient strategy for memory storage and retrieval, which is why he emphasize it in this study.</p>

<p>(5) Figure 2B: Clarify how the two-dimensional arrays are arranged to represent the patterns shown. Does each point of the array represent one neuron? If so, are these neurons re-arranged to help the readers visually differentiate patterns A and B? Are the patterns of activity of MCs in the model spatially and temporally sparse as observed in experimental work?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In Figure 2B, each point in the two-dimensional array represents the activity of a single mitral cell. The layout is purely for visualization—neurons are re-arranged to make the differences between odor patterns A and B visually apparent. This ordering does not reflect anatomical position or model architecture. We revised the Figure 2 caption to say this explicitly.</p>
<p>Regarding spatial sparseness, as we mentioned in the response to the reviewer’s comment (1), the activity of mitral cells in response to odors is spatially sparse in the model. Regarding temporal sparseness, while the model is not spiking and does not include temporal dynamics within the timescale of the breath, however, odor input is delivered in discrete, odorspecific epochs interleaved with periods of no input, which leads to temporally structured activity patterns. This information has been made explicit in the new methods sections &quot;Stimulus model&quot; and &quot;Perceptual learning task&quot;</p>
