<title>Abstract</title><p>In birds and insects, the female uptakes sperm for a specific duration post-copulation known as the ejaculate holding period (EHP) before expelling unused sperm and the mating plug through sperm ejection. In this study, we found that <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> females shortens the EHP when incubated with males or mated females shortly after the first mating. This phenomenon, which we termed <underline>m</underline>ale-induced <underline>E</underline>HP <underline>s</underline>hortening (MIES), requires Or47b+ olfactory and ppk23+ gustatory neurons, activated by 2-methyltetracosane and 7-tricosene, respectively. These odorants raise cAMP levels in pC1 neurons, responsible for processing male courtship cues and regulating female mating receptivity. Elevated cAMP levels in pC1 neurons reduce EHP and reinstate their responsiveness to male courtship cues, promoting re-mating with faster sperm ejection. This study established MIES as a genetically tractable model of sexual plasticity with a conserved neural mechanism.</p>

<title>Significance Statement</title>
<p>Sexual plasticity, the adaptation of reproductive behavior to social changes, was explored in the fruit fly, a genetically tractable model insect. Our findings revealed that inseminated females, encountering another courting male post-mating, shorten the ejaculate holding period (EHP). Specific olfactory and gustatory pathways regulating this phenomenon were identified, converging on the pC1 neurons in the brain-a conserved neural circuit that regulates female mating activity. Odors associated with EHP shortening increased the second messenger cAMP. The transient elevation of cAMP heightened the excitability of pC1 neurons, facilitating the prompt removal of the male ejaculate and subsequent re-mating . This study established a behavioral model of sexual plasticity and provided a framework for understanding the neural circuit processes involved.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sexual plasticity, the ability to modify sexual state or reproductive behavior in response to changing social conditions, is observed in both vertebrates and invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). In rodents, exposure to unfamiliar males often leads to the sudden termination of pregnancy, known as the Bruce effect. It is induced by male urinary peptides, such as MHC I peptides, activating the vomeronasal organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). This effect enhances reproductive fitness of both sexes, by eliminating the offspring of competing males and enabling females to select better mates even after conception. Many species also adapt their reproductive behavior in response to the social sexual context change (SSCC), involving encounters with new sexual partners or competitors. Understanding the neural circuit mechanisms behind female responses to SSCC emerges as a central focus of neuroscience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Drosophila melanogaster,</italic> the fruit fly, displays various social behaviors like aggregation, aggression, and sexual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Similar to rodents, they primarily use the olfactory system to communicate socially through pheromones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Some of these pheromones act as aphrodisiacs, while others regulate aggression or foster aggregation. For instance, cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA) attracts females but repels males and promotes aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). 7-Tricosene (7-T), a cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) present in males, is an aphrodisiac to females and affects social interactions between males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). On the other hand, 7,11-heptacosadiene (7,11-HD), a related female-specific pheromone, functions as an aphrodisiac to males, triggering courtship behavior and involving species recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>).</p>
<p>The fruit fly’s chemo-sensory organs, located in various parts of the body, detect these pheromones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) in the sensilla of the antennae and maxillary palp are responsible for the detection of long-range volatile pheromones like cVA, while short-range pheromones like 7-T are sensed by neurons on the fore-legs and labellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>).</p>
<p>The olfactory receptor Or47b, expressed ORNs located in at4 trichoid sensilla on the third antennal segment, is involved in several socio-sexual interactions, including male mating success, mate preference, and female aggression toward mating pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). In males, Or47b senses fatty acid methyl esters and fatty acids that affect mating competition and copulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). While the role of Or47b in female aggression is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>), its involvement in female sexual behavior is uncertain. In both sexes, Or47b ORNs project to VA1v glomeruli, where VA1v projection neurons receive their signal and project to the mushroom body calyx and lateral horn. Male Or47b neurons connect to neurons such as aSP5, aSP8, and aSP9, which express a male-specific transcription factor Fru<sup>M</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>).</p>
<p>CHC pheromones, which function as short-range pheromones, are detected primarily by neurons on the fore-legs and the labellum that express gustatory receptors (GR), ionotropic receptors (IR), or the ppk/DEG-ENaC family of sodium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). CHCs like 7-T and 7,11-HD are sensed by <italic>ppk23</italic>-expressing M and F cells in the tarsi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). 7-T and cVA are sensed by M cells expressing <italic>ppk23</italic>, whereas 7,11-HD and 7,11-nonacosadiene (7,11-ND) are sensed by F cells expressing <italic>ppk23</italic>, <italic>ppk25</italic>, and <italic>ppk29</italic>. In males 7-T or 7,11-HD affects the neuronal activity of the Fru<sup>M</sup>-expressing P1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). However, how these CHCs signal in the female brain remains unknown.</p>
<p>Sperm ejection is a process by which females can remove the male ejaculate or the mating plug after copulation. This phenomenon has been observed in several animal species including feral fowl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>), black-legged kittiwake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>), and dunnock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). In the fruit fly, it typically occurs approximately 90 minutes after mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). This specific interval, referred to as ejaculate holding period (EHP), is thought to affect sperm usage and fecundity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). The neurosecretory neurons in the brain pars intercerebralis (PI) that produce diuretic hormone 44 (Dh44), an insect orthologue of the corticotropin-releasing factor, regulate EHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). There is evidence that <italic>Drosophila</italic> females sense the social-sexual context through sperm ejected by other females. For instance, females were likely to lay more eggs when placed on a food patch containing male ejaculate deposited by other females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). However, it remains unknown whether the SSCC influences sperm ejection and EHP.</p>
<p>Female pC1 neurons, which express a specific transcription factor Dsx<sup>F</sup>, integrate olfactory and auditory cues associated with male courtship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). The pC1 neurons, their male counterparts (i.e., P1 neurons), and the ventrolateral subdivision of ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl) neurons in mice share conserved circuit configurations and demonstrate functional similarity in coordinating social and sexual behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). There are 14 Dsx-positive pC1 neurons in each hemisphere of the brain, responsive to the male sex-pheromone cVA and courtship songs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). Connectome analyses identified 10 pC1 neurons that fall into five subtypes, with pC1a, b, and c subtypes associated with mating behavior and pC1d and e subtypes associated with aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). Although direct evidence connecting pC1 neurons to sperm ejection is limited, they are promising candidates for regulating sperm ejection or EHP, because sperm ejection allows females to eliminate the mating plug and male ejaculate, thereby restoring sexual attractiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrated that two male pheromones, 2-methyltetracosane (2MC) and 7-T, significantly reduced the EHP through <italic>Or47b</italic> neurons and <italic>ppk23</italic> neurons, respectively. These pheromone pathways converge on pC1 neurons, where they increase cAMP levels. The elevated cAMP in pC1 neurons resulted in a reduction of the EHP to a degree that was comparable to the effects of the male pheromones. It also enhanced the excitability of pC1 neurons, making them more responsive to both olfactory and auditory male courtship cues and promoting further mating following the earlier removal of the mating plug. These findings establish a novel behavioral paradigm that sheds light on the intricate molecular and neuronal pathways underlying female sexual plasticity.</p>

<title>Male-induced EHP shortening (MIES) is dependent on olfaction</title>
<p>To investigate the impact of changes in the social sexual context on the EHP, we compared the EHP of post-mating females isolated from any male presence to those exposed to naive wild-type <italic>Canton-S</italic> (<italic>CS</italic>) males immediately after copulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Notably, the EHP of females incubated with naive males was approximately 30 minutes shorter than that of females left in isolation after mating (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, 1B). We refer to this phenomenon as male-induced EHP shortening (MIES). In contrast, little difference in EHP was observed between females incubated with virgin females and those isolated after mating (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>

<p>Male fruit flies employ various sensory signals to attract females during courtship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). To assess the role of the visual signal in MIES, we examined MIES under dim red light conditions and observed that limited illumination had a marginal impact on MIES (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Next, we examined MIES in post-mating females incubated with decapitated <italic>CS</italic> males. These males could serve as a source of olfactory or gustatory signals, but not for auditory or visual signals. Again, no reduction in MIES was observed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). This strongly suggests that olfactory or gustatory cues are the key signals responsible for MIES. This is further supported by the observation that females deficient in the odorant receptor co-receptor (<italic>Orco</italic><sup>1</sup>) did not exhibit MIES (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). Thus, it is highly likely that male odorant(s), especially those detected by olfactory receptors (Or), induce MIES.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>MIES is dependent on the <italic>Or47b</italic> receptor and <italic>Or47b</italic>-expressing ORNs</title>
<p>In the fruit fly antenna, the trichoid sensilla and their associated olfactory receptor neurons are known to detect sex pheromones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). To investigate the contribution of ORNs located in the trichoid sensilla to MIES, we silenced 11 different ORN groups found in the trichoid and intermediate sensilla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>) by expressing either the active or inactive form of Tetanus toxin light chain (TNT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). Our results showed that silencing ORNs expressing <italic>Or13a</italic>, <italic>Or19a</italic>, <italic>Or23a</italic>, <italic>Or47b</italic>, <italic>Or65c</italic>, <italic>Or67d</italic> or <italic>Or88a</italic> significantly affected MIES (Fig. S1A).</p>
<p>We then focused on the analysis of <italic>Or47b</italic>-positive ORNs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), which, in contrast to the others, exhibited almost complete abolition of MIES when silenced. Activation of these neurons with the thermogenetic activator dTRPA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>) resulted in a significant EHP shortening, even in the absence of male exposure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Subsequently, we examined whether restoring Orco expression in <italic>Or47b</italic> ORNs in Orco-deficient females would restore MIES. Our results confirmed that this is indeed the case (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). To establish the necessity of the <italic>Or47b</italic> receptor gene for MIES, we examined Or47b-deficient females (<italic>Or47b<sup>2</sup>/Or47b<sup>3</sup></italic>) and observed a complete absence of MIES, whereas heterozygous controls exhibited normal MIES (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Furthermore, the reintroduction of <italic>Or47b</italic> expression in <italic>Or47b</italic> ORNs of <italic>Or47b</italic>-deficient females almost completely restored MIES (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Based on these observations, we concluded that MIES depends on the <italic>Or47b</italic> receptor gene and Or47b-expressing ORNs.</p>

<title>2-Methyltetracosane (2MC) induces MIES via <italic>Or47b</italic> and <italic>Or47b</italic> ORNs</title>
<p>Previous studies have shown that methyl laurate (ML) and palmitoleic acid (PA) can activate <italic>Or47b</italic> ORNs only in the presence of a functional <italic>Or47b</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). However, in our investigation, none of these odorants induced significant EHP shortening, even when applied at concentrations as high as 1440 ng (Fig. S2). This prompted us to search for a new pheromone capable of activating Or47b ORNs and thereby shortening the EHP.</p>
<p>Oenocytes produce a significant portion of the cuticular hydrocarbons or pheromones. We asked whether the male pheromone responsible for MIES is produced by oenocytes (Fig. S3A). Indeed, incubation with females engineered to produce male oenocytes significantly shorten EHP, strongly suggesting that male oenocytes serve as a source for the MIES pheromone. Unexpectedly, however, incubation with males possessing feminized oenocytes also resulted in significant EHP shortening (Fig. S3A). This raises the possibility that oenocytes may not be the sole source of the MIES pheromone, implying the involvement of more than one pheromone, for instance one from oenocytes and another from an alternate source, in MIES.</p>
<p>The genus <italic>Drosophila</italic> exhibits distinct CHC profiles, with certain CHC components shared among closely related species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>). We found that incubation with males of other closely related species, such as <italic>D. simulans</italic>, <italic>D. sechellia</italic>, and <italic>D. erecta,</italic> also induced EHP shortening, whereas incubation with <italic>D. yakuba</italic> males did not (Fig. S3B).</p>
<p>The EHP was therefore measured in females incubated in a small mating chamber containing a piece of filter paper perfumed with male CHCs, including 2-methylhexacosane, 2-methyldocosane, 5-methyltricosane, 7-methyltricosane, 10Z-heneicosene, 9Z-heneicosene, and 2MC at various concentrations (not shown). Among these, 2MC at 750 ng was the only one that significantly reduced EHP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>; Fig. S4). 2MC was mainly found in males, but not in virgin females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Notably, it is present in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>D. simulans</italic>, <italic>D. sechellia</italic>, and <italic>D. erecta</italic>, but not in <italic>D. yakuba</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>).</p>

<p>Moreover, the 2MC-induced EHP shortening was not observed in Orco- or Or47b-deficient females (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, 3C), but was restored when Orco expression was reinstated in <italic>Or47b</italic> ORNs in Orco-deficient mutants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Our behavioral observations strongly suggest that 2MC acts as an odorant ligand for Or47b and shortens the EHP through this receptor.</p>

<title>7-Tricosene (7-T) shortens EHP through <italic>ppk23</italic> neurons</title>
<p>In contrast to incubation with virgin females, incubation with mated females resulted in a significant shortening of EHP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Mated females carry male pheromones, including 7-T and cVA, which are transferred during copulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). This raised the possibility that these male pheromones might also induce EHP shortening. Indeed, our experiments revealed that incubation with a piece of filter paper perfumed with 150 ng of 7-T significantly shortened the EHP. Conversely, incubation with cVA and 7-pentacosene, a related CHC, did not produce the same effect (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, 4C; Fig. S5A-5B). The concentrations of 7-T capable of inducing EHP shortening appear to be physiologically relevant. 7-T has been found at levels of 432 ng in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>), 25 ng in virgin females, and 150 ng in mated females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). Although the receptors for 7-T remain unknown, <italic>ppk23</italic>-expressing tarsal neurons have been shown to sense these compounds and regulate sexual behavior in males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>). Subsequently, we silenced <italic>ppk23</italic> neurons, and as a result, MIES was almost completely abolished, underscoring the pivotal role of 7-T in MIES (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). However, DEG/ENac channel genes expressed in <italic>ppk23</italic> neurons, including <italic>ppk23</italic> and <italic>ppk29</italic>, were found to be dispensable for MIES (Fig. S5C-5E).

<title>The pC1 b and c neurons regulate EHP and MIES</title>
<p>The neuropeptide Dh44 determines the timing of sperm ejection or EHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). The same study found that Dh44 receptor neurons involved in EHP regulation also express <italic>doublesex</italic> (<italic>dsx</italic>), which encodes sexually dimorphic transcription factors. A recent study has revealed that pC1 neurons, a specific subgroup of <italic>dsx</italic>-expressing central neurons in the female brain, do indeed express Dh44 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). With these findings, we set out to investigate the role of pC1 neurons in the regulation of EHP and MIES. The pC1 neurons comprise five distinct subtypes. Of these, the pC1a, b, and c subtypes have been implicated in mating receptivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>), while the remaining pC1d and e subtypes have been implicated in female aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). To investigate the role of these subtypes in EHP, we employed GtACR1, an anion channel activated by blue light in the presence of all <italic>trans</italic>-retinal (ATR), to silence specific pC1 subtypes immediately after mating. Our experiments revealed that silencing of the pC1 subset comprising the pC1a, b and c subtypes with GtACR1 led to an increase in EHP (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>), whereas silencing of the pC1d and e subtypes had a limited effect on EHP (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). We further analyzed the roles of pC1b, c neurons along with pC1a neurons separately. We generated a subtype-specific split-Gal4 for pC1a and found that, as expected, silencing pC1a with this split-Gal4 almost completely suppressed mating receptivity (Fig. S6).</p>

<title>2MC and 7-T increase cAMP levels in pC1 b and c neurons</title>
<p>Our recent research has shown that pC1 neurons exhibit elevated cAMP levels during sexual maturation, and that this increase in cAMP is closely related to heightened excitability of pC1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). The same study also showed that a mating signal (i.e., sex peptide in the male seminal fluid) reduces cAMP levels in pC1 neurons. Thus, we hypothesized that male odorants responsible for inducing MIES, such as 2MC or 7-T, would elevate cAMP levels in pC1b, c neurons in newly mated females. This, in turn, would lead to increased excitability of pC1 neurons and, as a consequence, a reduction in the EHP. To monitor cAMP levels in these neurons, we prepared females that express a CRE-luciferase reporter selectively in pC1b, c neurons. Indeed, when exposed to 2MC or 7-T, pC1b, c neurons exhibited a significant increase in CRE-luciferase activity, indicating that these neurons produce higher levels of cAMP in response to these odorants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). Notably, CRE-luciferase activity appeared to peak at specific odorant concentrations that induced significant shortening of the EHP (Fig. S7).</p>
<p>In contrast, when we examined other pC1 subsets, such as pC1a, and pC1d and e, we detected no evidence of increased CRE-luciferase reporter activity upon exposure to 2MC or 7-T treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). Notably, CRE-luciferase reporter activity in the pC1a neurons appears to be dependent on the mating status, as it reaches levels similar to those of pC1b, c neurons in virgin females (Fig. S8). This observation aligns well with connectome data suggesting that SAG neurons, which are responsible for relaying SP-dependent mating signals, synapse primarily with the pC1a subtype and to a much lesser extent with other pC1 subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>).</p>
<p>To further test the role of Or47b in 2MC detection, we generated Or47b-deficient females with pC1 neurons expressing the CRE-luciferase reporter. Females with one copy of the wild-type Or47b allele, which served as the control group, showed robust CRE-luciferase reporter activity in response to either 2MC or 7-T. In contrast, <italic>Or47b</italic>-deficient females showed robust CRE-luciferase activity in response to to 7-T, but little activity in response to 2MC. This observation suggests that the odorant receptor Or47b plays an essential role in the selective detection of 2MC (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>).</p>

<title>Elevated cAMP in pC1 neurons shortens the EHP, while increasing re-mating</title>
<p>Having shown that MIES-inducing male odorants, 2MC or 7-T, increase cAMP levels in pC1b, c neurons from mated females, we next asked whether this induced elevation of cAMP levels in pC1b, c neurons would shorten EHP, leading to MIES. We employed the photoactivatable adenylate cyclase (PhotoAC), which increases cellular cAMP levels upon exposure to light. Indeed, the induced elevation of cAMP levels in pC1b, c neurons significantly shortened EHP, whereas the same treatment applied to pC1a or pC1d and pC1e had no such effect (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>).

</fig>
<p>Next, we asked whether the expression of Dh44R1 and Dh44R2, GPCRs that increase cellular cAMP in response to their ligand Dh44, in pC1b, c neurons is necessary for MIES. However, double knockdown of Dh44R1 and Dh44R2 in pC1 neurons seemed to have a limited impact on MIES (Fig. S9). This suggests that Dh44R signaling in pC1 neurons is not essential for the regulation of EHP or MIES, raising the possibility that other GPCRs may be involved in the up-regulation of cAMP levels in pC1 neurons in response to 2MC or 7-T.</p>
<p>Lastly, we investigated how increased cAMP levels affect the physiological activity of pC1 neurons. pC1 neurons from virgin females exhibit robust Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in response to male courtship cues, such as the male pheromone cVA and the courtship pulse song (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). In contrast, those from mated females display significantly diminished Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). When examined shortly after mating, a decrease in pC1 responsiveness to cVA was observed. However, immediately after PhotoAC activation in pC1 neurons, pC1 neurons from freshly mated females became more excitable and exhibited stronger Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in response to cVA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). It is important to note that this PhotoAC-induced increase in pC1 excitability is transient and rapidly declines within 10 minutes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). Nevertheless, these findings suggest that the increased cAMP levels in pC1 neurons would not only promote MIES but also facilitate re-mating in post-mating females, which typically engage in re-mating at a low frequency. To test this hypothesis, we examined the re-mating frequency of freshly mated females paired with naive males while inducing a cAMP increase in pC1 neurons. As expected, PhotoAC activation in pC1b, c neurons substantially increased the re-mating rate compared to the control group (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). Therefore, we concluded that male odorants that stimulate cAMP elevation in pC1 neurons expedite the removal of the mating plug, consequently leading to increased instances of re-mating (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>).</p>

This phenomenon, referred to as MIES in this study, is followed by a second mating with the new partner.

These odorants increase cAMP levels in pC1b, c neurons, enhancing their responsiveness to male courtship cues and increasing mating receptivity.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Males employ a diverse range of strategies to enhance their reproductive fitness. One such strategy involves the formation ‘f a ’mating’plug’, a mechanism that prevents females from engaging in further mating, thereby increasing fertilization success rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>). As a means of intra-sexual competition, rival males often promote the removal or precocious expulsion of the mating plug. The evolution of this strategy is driven by intersexual interactions with polyandrous females, who often remove the mating plug to engage in additional mating with males of superior traits or higher social status than their previous partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>). In the dunnock <italic>Prunella modularis</italic>, a small European passerine bird, the male often engages in cloacal pecking of mated females, inducing the expulsion of the previous ’mate’s sperm and mating plug, thereby increasing their chances of successful mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). In this study, we discovered that in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, freshly mated females exhibit an earlier removal of the mating plugs or a shorter EHP when kept with actively courting males. This behavior is primarily induced by the stimulation of females via male sex pheromones. In addition, our study has revealed that the neural circuit that processes male courtship cues and controls mating decisions plays an important role in regulating this behavior. This fly circuit has recently been proposed to be homologous to VMHvl in the mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). By delving into the molecular and neuronal mechanisms underlying MIES, our study provides valuable insights into the broader aspect of behaviors induced by changes in the social sexual context.</p>
<p>Our findings highlight the involvement of the Or47b receptor and Or47b ORNs in MIES. These OR and ORNs have been implicated in a range of social and sexual behaviors in both male and female fruit flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Methyl laurate and <italic>trans</italic>-palmitoleic acid are odorant ligands for Or47b that account for many of these functions particularly in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). In this study, we provide compelling evidence that 2MC induces cAMP elevation in pC1 neurons and EHP shortening via both the Or47b receptor and Or47b ORNs, suggesting that 2MC functions as an odorant ligand for Or47b. Notably, gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of cuticular hydrocarbons from 4-day-old wild-type <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> revealed the presence of 2MC exclusively in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Surprisingly, however, unlike 2MC, neither methyl laurate nor <italic>trans</italic>-palmitoleic acid affected EHP. The reason for this paradoxical result remains unclear. A plausible interpretation is that the EHP shortening induced by 2MC may require not only Or47b but also other as yet unidentified ORs. With the establishment of a behavioral and cellular assessment of 2MC activity, the search for additional odorant receptors responsive to 2MC is now feasible. Another important avenue for further research is whether 2MC can also elicit behaviors previously associated with methyl laurate or <italic>trans</italic>-palmitoleic acid, such as promoting male copulation and courtship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>).</p>
<p>We observed that both 2MC and 7-T exhibit both cellular and behavioral activity within a specific concentration range (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">S5</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">S7</xref>). This observation is of particular interest, given the multitude of environmental and biological factors that influence the levels of 2MC and 7-T, potentially affecting the capacity of males to induce MIES. For instance, exposure to low temperatures during development has been linked to increased production of both 2MC and 7-T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>). Similarly, mutation of the desiccation stress gene CG9186, which encodes a protein associated with lipid droplets, has been found to impact 2MC levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>). Furthermore, 2MC levels rise with age in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>). Thus, we propose that levels of 2MC, and possibly 7-T, may serve as indicators of male age and resilience to environmental stress in a complex manner.</p>
<p>In mated females, treatment with 2MC or 7-T increases cAMP levels in pC1b, c neurons but not in pC1a neurons. In contrast, pC1a neurons in virgin females are fully responsive to both male pheromones, showing increases in cAMP levels that are similar to those of pC1b,c neurons (Fig. S8). The absence of cAMP levels in pC1a neurons in mated females likely results from the mating signal (i.e., sex peptide) silencing pC1a neurons. Connectome and electrophysiology data support this interpretation, as SAG neurons, which relay sex peptide signals, have the strongest synaptic connection with the pC1a among five pC1 subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). However, the activity of SAG neurons may also influence pC1c neurons, as they also have substantial synaptic connections with pC1c neurons, as seen in the hemibrain connectome dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>). Future studies are needed to understand the role of SAG neurons in the regulation of EHP.</p>
<p>We found that increased cAMP levels cause pC1b, c neurons in mated females, which are typically unresponsive to male courtship cues like cVA and pulse song, to become responsive and exhibit strong Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. Since pC1b, c neurons play a role in generating sexual drive and increasing female receptivity to male courtship, the 2MC- or 7-T-induced increases in cAMP are likely to control the removal of the mating plug and the engagement of mated females in further mating (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). This hypothesis aligns well with the previous report that mating reduces the sensitivity of Or47b ORNs, which we found to be responsive to 2MC, leading to an increased preference for pheromone-rich males after mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, the finding that 2MC and 7-T induce cAMP levels in pC1b, c neurons in virgin females suggests that virgin females may also use 2MC and 7-T as odorant cues to assess male quality during their first mating. Indeed, females seem to evaluate male quality by the amount of 7-T, as increased 7-T promotes mating receptivity and shortens mating latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>).</p>
<p>Physiological factors like the nutritional status of females prior to mating and the nutritional status of their mates have been shown to influence EHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>), and therefore potentially MIES. Hence, it is highly probable that MIES is regulated by additional central neurons such as Dh44-PI neurons that regulate these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether and how Dh44-PI neurons and pC1 neurons interact to modulate EHP and MIES. The observation that double knockdown of Dh44R1 and Dh44R2 has only a marginal effect on MIES suggests that Dh44-PI neurons may also function independently of pC1 neurons, raising the possibility that multiple independent central circuits may contribute to the production of MIES.</p>
<p>Our initial screening of ORNs responsible for MIES revealed the involvement of Or47b ORNs, as well as several other ORNs. In addition to 2MC, which acts through Or47b-expressing ORNs, our findings indicate that 7-T and <italic>ppk23</italic> neurons, which are capable of detecting 7-T, also play a role in MIES induction. In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and other related species, food odors typically serve as volatile long-range signals that attract both males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>), suggesting that specific food odors may also influence EHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). The involvement of multiple ORNs in the regulation of EHP predicts that pC1 neurons may process multiple odorants, not limited to those associated with mating behavior, including food odors. Future studies will explore the full spectrum of odorants processed by pC1 neurons in the regulation of EHP.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have identified a circuit that, via the detection of a novel male pheromone, potentially signals male quality and governs the female’s decision to remove the mating plug of her last mate and mate again.</p>

<title>Behavior assays</title>
<p>For mating behavior assays, we followed the procedures described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>). Individual virgin females and naive <italic>CS</italic> males were paired in 10 mm diameter chambers and were recorded using a digital camcorder (SONY, HDR-CX405 or Xiaomi, Redmi Note 10) for either 30 minutes or 1 hour for the mating assay and 6 hours for the re-mating assay. In the re-mating assay, females that completed their initial mating within 30 minutes were subsequently paired with naive <italic>CS</italic> males.</p>
<p>To measure EHP, defined as the time elapsed between the end of copulation and sperm ejection, we used the following procedure: Virgin females were individually mated with <italic>CS</italic> males in 10 mm diameter chambers. Following copulation, females were transferred to new chambers, either with or without a <italic>CS</italic> male or pheromone presentation, and their behavior was recorded using a digital camcorder (SONY, HDR-CX405). Typically, females that completed copulation within 30 minutes were used for analysis. The sperm ejection scene, in which the female expels a white sac containing sperm and the mating plug through the vulva, was directly observed by eye in the recorded video footage. For pheromone presentation, females were individually housed in 10 mm diameter chambers containing a piece of Whatman filter paper (2 mm x 2 mm) treated with 0.5 μl of the pheromone solution and air dried for 1 minute. For thermogenetic activation experiments, females were incubated at the indicated temperatures immediately after the end of copulation. For light activation experiments, a custom-made light activation setup was used with a ring of 104 multi-channel LED lights (NeoPixel, Cat# WS2812; red light, 620-625 nm, 390-420 mcd; green light, 522-525 nm, 660-720 mcd; blue light, 465-467 nm, 180-200 mcd). Females were individually placed in 10 mm diameter chambers, and the chamber was illuminated with light at an intensity of 1100 lux across the chamber during the assay, as measured by an HS1010 light meter. Flies used in these experiments were prepared by culturing them immediately after eclosion in food containing vehicle (EtOH) or 1 mM all <italic>trans</italic>-retinal (ATR). They were kept in complete darkness for 3-4 days until the assay was conducted. To prevent the accumulation of residual pheromones, all behavioral chambers were cleaned with 70% water/ethanol or acetone before and after the experiment.</p>

<p>We followed the procedures described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>). Following copulation, freshly mated female flies were temporarily immobilized using ice anesthesia, and their heads were attached to a custom-made thin metal plate with a 1-mm diameter hole using photo-curable UV glue (ThreeBond, A16A01). An opening in the fly’s head was created using a syringe needle under saline (108 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 8.2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 5 mM trehalose, 10 mM sucrose, 5 mM HEPES pH 7.5).

Metamorph software (Molecular Devices, RRID:SCR_002368) was used for image analysis. The Syntech Stimulus Controller (Type CS-55) was used to deliver the male pheromone using an airflow. 2 μl of pheromone solution was applied to a piece of Whatman filter paper (2 mm x 1 mm), which was then inserted into a glass Pasteur pipette after solvent evaporation.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> work unravels how female Drosophila can assess their social context via chemosensory cues and modulate the sperm storage process after copulation accordingly. A <bold>compelling</bold> set of rigorous experiments uncovers specific pheromones that influence the excitability of the female brain receptivity circuit and their propensity to discard inseminate from a mating. This insight into neuronal mechanisms of sexual behavior plasticity is of general interest to scientists working in the fields of animal behavior, neuroscience, evolution, and sexual selection, as well as insect chemosensation and reproduction.</p>

<p>Yun et al. examined the molecular and neuronal underpinnings of changes in Drosophila female reproductive behaviors in response to social cues. Specifically, the authors measure the ejaculate-holding period, which is the amount of time females retain male ejaculate after mating (typically 90 min in flies). They find that female fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, display shorter holding periods in the presence of a native male or male-associated cues, including 2-Methyltetracosane (2MC) and 7-Tricosene (7-T). They further show that 2MC functions through Or47b olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) and the Or47b channel, while 7-T functions through ppk23 expressing neurons. Interestingly, their data also indicates that two other olfactory ligands for Or47b (methyl laurate and palmitoleic acid) do not have the same effects on the ejaculate-holding period. By performing a series of behavioral and imaging experiments, the authors reveal that an increase in cAMP activity in pC1 neurons is required for this shortening of the ejaculate-holding period and may be involved in the likelihood of remating. This work lays the foundation for future studies on sexual plasticity in female Drosophila.</p>
<p>The conclusions of this paper are supported by the data and the authors have revised the manuscript in accordance with comments of the reviewers. This revised version also contains the expression pattern of the lines used for modulating individual pC1 subtypes. These data and reagents open interesting avenues for future studies on female receptivity and mate choice.</p>

<p>The work by Yun et al. explores an important question related to post-copulatory sexual selection and sperm competition: Can females actively influence the outcome of insemination by a particular male by modulating storage and ejection of transferred sperm in response to contextual sensory stimuli? The present work is exemplary for how the Drosophila model can give detailed insight in basic mechanism of sexual plasticity, addressing the underlying neuronal circuits on a genetic, molecular and cellular level.</p>
<p>Using the Drosophila model, the authors show that the presence of other males or mated females after mating shortens the ejaculate-holding period (EHP) of a female, i.e. the time she takes until she ejects the mating plug and unstored sperm. Through a series of thorough and systematic experiments involving the manipulation of olfactory and chemogustatory neurons and genes in combination with exposure to defined pheromones, they uncover two pheromones and their sensory cells for this behavior. Exposure to the male specific pheromone 2MC shortens EHP via female Or47b olfactory neurons, and the contact pheromone 7-T, present males and on mated females, does so via ppk23 expressing gustatory foreleg neurons. Both compounds increase cAMP levels in a specific subset of central brain receptivity circuit neurons, the pC1b,c neurons. By employing an optogenetically controlled adenyl cyclase, the authors show that increased cAMP levels in pC1b,c neurons increase their excitability upon male pheromone exposure, decrease female EHP and increase the remating rate. This provides convincing evidence for the role of pC1b,c neurons in integrating information about the social environment and mediating not only virgin, but also mated female post-copulatory mate choice.</p>
<p>Understanding context and state-dependent sexual behavior is of fundamental interest. Mate behavior is highly context-dependent. In animals subjected to sperm competition, the complexities of optimal mate choice have attracted a long history of sophisticated modelling in the framework of game theory. These models are in stark contrast to how little we understand so far about the biological and neurophysiological mechanisms of how females implement post-copulatory or so-called &quot;cryptic&quot; mate choice and bias sperm usage when mating multiple times.</p>
<p>The strength of the paper is decrypting &quot;cryptic&quot; mate choice, i.e. the clear identification of physiological mechanisms and proximal causes for female post-copulatory mate choice. The discovery of peripheral chemosensory nodes and of neurophysiological mechanisms in central circuit nodes will provide a fruitful starting point to fully map the circuits for female receptivity and mate choice during the whole gamut of female life history.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Yun et al. examined the molecular and neuronal underpinnings of changes in Drosophila female reproductive behaviors in response to social cues.

By performing a series of behavioral and imaging experiments, the authors reveal that an increase in cAMP activity in pC1 neurons is required for this shortening of the ejaculate-holding period and may be involved in the likelihood of remating. This work lays the foundation for future studies on sexual plasticity in female Drosophila.</p>
<p>The conclusions of this paper are mostly supported by the data, but aspects of the lines used for individual pC1 subtypes and visual contributions as well as the statistical analysis need to be clarified.</p>
<p>(1) The pC1 subtypes (a - e) are delineated based on their morphology and connectivity. While the morphology of these neurons is distinct, they do share a resemblance that can be difficult to discern depending on the imaging performed. Additionally, genetic lines attempting to label individual neurons can easily be contaminated by low-level expression in off-target neurons in the brain or ventral nerve cord (VNC), which could contribute to behavioral changes following optogenetic manipulations. In Figures 5C - D, the authors generated and used new lines for labeling pC1a and pC1b+c. The line for pC1b+c was imaged as part of another recent study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2310841121">https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2310841121</ext-link>). However, similar additional images of the pC1a line (i.e. 40x magnification and VNC expression) would be helpful in order to validate its specificity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have included the high-resolution images of the expression of the pC1a-split-Gal4 driver in the brain and the VNC in the new figures S6A and S6B.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The author's experiments examining olfactory and gustatory contributions to the holding period were well controlled and described. However, the experiments in Figure 1D examining visual contributions were not sufficiently convincing as the line used (w1118) has previously been shown to be visually impaired (Wehner et al., 1969; Kalmus 1948). Using another wild-type line would have improved the authors' claims.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is evident that w1118 flies are visually impaired and are able to receive a limited amount of visual information in dim red light. Nevertheless, they are able to exhibit MIES phenotypes, which further supports the dispensability of visual information in MIES. In a 2024 study, Doubovetzky et al. (1) found that MIES in ninaB mutant females, which have defects in visual sensation, was not altered. This further corroborates our assertion that vision is likely to be of lesser importance than olfaction in MIES.</p>

<p>(3) When comparisons between more than 2 groups are shown as in Figures 1E, 3D, and 5E, the comparisons being made were not clear. Adding in the results of a nonparametric multiple comparisons test would help for the interpretation of these results.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewing Editor (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>While appreciating the quality of the work the reviewers had a few key concerns that would greatly improve the manuscript. These are:</p>
<p>(1) In some cases the specific statistical analyses are not clear. Could the authors please clarify what comparisons were made and the specific tests used?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have clarified the comparisons made in the multiple comparison analysis and specified the tests used in figures 1E, 3D, 5E.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Could the authors please include data that verify the expression patterns of their new reagent for pC1a, which will be useful for the community?</p>

<p>Figure S6 was revised to include the expression of the pC1a-split-Gal4 gene in the brain (Fig. S6A) and the VNC (Fig. S6B).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) A figure summarising their findings in the context of known circuitry will be useful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A new Figure 7 has been prepared, which provides a summary of our findings.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The SAG data are interesting. Do the authors wish to consider moving it to the main text or removing it if too preliminary?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The supplementary figure 10 and related discussions in the discussion section have been removed.</p>
<p>In the revised version of this manuscript, we present new evidence that the Or47b gene is required for 2MC-induced cAMP elevation in pC1 neurons, but not for 7T-induced one (see Fig. 5F). This observation supports that Or47b is a receptor for 2MC.</p>
<p>The following paragraph was inserted at line 248 to provide a detailed description of the new findings: &quot;To further test the role of Or47b in 2MC detection, we generated Or47b-deficient females with pC1 neurons expressing the CRE-luciferase reporter. Females with one copy of the wild-type Or47b allele, which served as the control group, showed robust CRE-luciferase reporter activity in response to either 2MC or 7-T. In contrast, <italic>Or47b</italic>-deficient females showed robust CRE-luciferase activity in response to to 7-T, but little activity in response to 2MC. This observation suggests that the odorant receptor Or47b plays an essential role in the selective detection of 2MC (Fig. 5F).”</p>
<p>In addition, the following sentence was inserted at line 308 in the discussion section: “In this study, we provide compelling evidence that 2MC induces cAMP elevation in pC1 neurons and EHP shortening via both the Or47b receptor and Or47b ORNs, suggesting that 2MC functions as an odorant ligand for Or47b.”</p>
<p>Relative CRE-luciferase reporter activity of pC1 neurons in females of the indicated genotypes, incubated with a piece of filter paper perfumed with solvent vehicle control or the indicated pheromones immediately after mating. The CRE-luciferase reporter activity of pC1 neurons of Or47b-deficient females (<italic>Or47b2/2</italic> or <italic>Or47b3/3</italic>) was observed to increase in response to 7-T but not to 2MC. To calculate the relative luciferase activity, the average luminescence unit values of the female incubated with the vehicle are set to 100%. Mann-Whitney Test (n.s. <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05; **<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; ***<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; ****<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Gray circles indicate the relative luciferase activity (%) of individual females, and the mean ± SEM of data is presented.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) There was a discrepancy between the text and the figures. Based on the asterisks above the data in Figure S5A, the data supports only 150 ng of 7-T shortening the ejaculation holding period. However, the text states that (line 190) &quot;150 or 375 ng of 7-T significantly shortened EHP.&quot; It would be helpful if the authors clarified this discrepancy.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The sentence has been revised and now reads as follows: ‘150 ng of 7-T significantly shortened EHP’.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Based on the current organization of the text, it was not clear how 2MC was identified and its concentrations were known to be physiologically relevant. It would be helpful if the authors could expand on this in lines 178 - 179.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The following sentences were inserted into the revised version of the manuscript at line 178: The EHP was therefore measured in females incubated in a small mating chamber containing a piece of filter paper perfumed with male CHCs, including 2-methylhexacosane, 2-methyldocosane, 5-methyltricosane, 7-methyltricosane, 10Z-heneicosene, 9Z-heneicosene, and 2MC at various concentrations (not shown). Among these, 2MC at 750 ng was the only one that significantly reduced EHP (Fig. 3A; Fig. S4). 2MC was mainly found in males, but not in virgin females (30). Notably, it is present in <italic>D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. sechellia, and D. erecta</italic>, but not in <italic>D. yakuba</italic> (30, 60).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The inset pie chart image illustrating MIES in Figure 1A was difficult to interpret. It would be helpful if the authors used a different method for representing this (i.e. a timeline).</p>

<p>Figure 1A was revised as suggested.</p>

<p>(1) Summary figure</p>
<p>The story is quite comprehensive and contains a lot of detail regarding the interaction of signaling pathways, internal state, and sensory stimuli. I believe a schematic summary figure bringing together all findings could be very helpful and would make it much easier to understand the discussion!</p>

<p>Figure 7 has been prepared, which provides a summary of the findings and an explanation of the current working model.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Figure S10/effect on SAG activation of EHP</p>
<p>At the moment, the quite interesting and relevant result that SAG activation shortens EHP shown in Figure S10 is only referred to in the discussion. Maybe move this to the results and give it a bit more attention? Actually, I believe this is a very exciting finding that could also be the basis for some more interesting speculations about physiological relevance. Since SAG is silenced upon seminal fluid/sex peptide exposure after mating, a mating with failed SAG silencing (i.e. unusually high post-mating SAG activity) could indicate to the female that there was low or failed sex peptide/seminal fluid transfer. In such a case it would be probably advantageous for the female to decrease EHP and quickly remate, as females need the &quot;beneficial&quot; effects of seminal fluid on ovulation and physiology adaptation. SAG could therefore represent another arm of sensing male quality- here not via external pheromones, but internally, via sensing male sex peptide levels.</p>
<p>If this is a bit preliminary and rather suited to start a new study, Figure S10 could also be removed from the current manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figure S10 and associated text were removed in the revised version of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) PhotoAC experiments in pC1b,c: the authors find that raising cAMP levels in pC1b,c leads to a decrease in EHP. They argue that increased cAMP levels lead to higher excitability of pC1b,c. This implies that the activity of pC1b,c promotes mating plug ejection. I assume the authors have also tried activating pC1b,c directly by optogenetic cation channels? What is the outcome of this? If different from elevating cAMP levels: why so?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We employed CsChrimson, a red light-sensitive channelrhodopsin, to investigate the effect of optogenetic activation of each pC1 subset on EHP. Optogenetic activation of pC1a, pC1d, or pC1e had little effect on EHP; however, optogenetic activation of pC1b, c significantly increased EHP. This observation was puzzling because optogenetic silencing of the same neurons also increased EHP. In this experiment, females expressing CsChrimson were exposed to red light for the entire period of EHP measurement. Therefore, we suspect that prolonged activation of pC1b and pC1c neurons depleted their neurotransmitter pool, resulting in a silencing effect, but this requires further testing.</p>

<p>In general, the manuscript is very well-written, clear, and easy to follow. I recommend small edits of the text and correction of typos in some places:</p>
<p>l.92: &quot;Drosophila females seem to signal the social sexual context through sperm ejection.&quot; This sentence could give the impression that the main function of sperm ejection was to signal to conspecifics.

<p>The sentence (lines 299-301) has been revised for clarity to read &quot;In addition, our study has revealed that the neural circuit that processes male courtship cues and controls mating decisions plays an important role in regulating this behavior. This fly circuit has recently been proposed to be homologous to VMHvl in the mouse brain (45, 46).”</p>
