<title>Abstract</title><p>Diurnal rhythms influence insect behavior, physiology, and metabolism, optimizing their performance by adapting to daily changes in the environment. While their impact on agricultural pests has been briefly explored, our understanding of how these rhythms drive adaptative responses in pest biology and influence host colonization remains elusive. Here, we show that a notorious global aphid pest, <italic>Rhopalosiphum padi</italic>, exhibits distinct diurnal patterns in feeding behavior, with elevated honeydew excretion at night and extended phloem salivation during early nighttime. Temporal aphid transcriptome profiling reveals four diurnally rhythmic clusters, two of which peak at night, exhibiting enrichment in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. Beyond the established role in manipulating host responses and allowing sustained feeding, our study reveals the first evidence in any insect species for cyclical fluctuations in salivary effector expression. Silencing key effector genes, peaking in expression during the increased nighttime salivation, results in a more pronounced reduction in aphid feeding activity on host plants during the night compared to the day, a phenomenon not observed on artificial diets. A better understanding of aphid diurnal rhythms and their roles on host colonization provides a promising avenue to refine and optimize pest management, granting a strategic advantage for minimizing crop damage.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The recurring cycles of day and night caused by Earth’s daily rotation profoundly influence all life, including plants and their pests. All living organisms have evolved internal biological clocks (i.e., circadian clocks) to anticipate and respond to cyclical changes in their environments by orchestrating various behavioral and physiological processes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Diurnal and circadian rhythms entail daily biological cycles, with circadian rhythms representing a subset characterized by internally sustained oscillations that persist in the absence of external cues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Our understanding of these rhythms has led to profound insights into mechanisms governing the intricate biological processes that shape various daily and seasonal behavioral patterns in diverse taxa, including insects and plants. Despite a significant body of knowledge on diurnal rhythms in model organisms and host-parasite interactions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, research on agricultural pests and their interactions with plant hosts remains underexplored. Given the significant threat pests pose to crop production, deciphering the temporal aspects of their behavior, physiology, and gene expression is a crucial step toward developing more effective pest control strategies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Aphids are among the most devastating pests worldwide, causing significant damage to various economically important crops through their consumption of sugar-rich phloem sap, delivery of phytotoxic salivary secretions, transmission of plant-pathogenic viruses, and promoting the growth of sooty-mold on their sugar-rich excrement <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Studies on circadian clock-regulated plant defenses against arthropod pests reveal that pests strategically anticipate and exploit plant rhythms. For example, the cabbage looper (<italic>Trichoplusia ni</italic>), a generalist herbivore, shows rhythms in feeding, with peak feeding occurring during the latter part of the day <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Conversely, cell-content feeders like spider mites (<italic>Tetranychus urticae</italic>) exploit a nighttime &quot;lull&quot; in jasmonate-induced defenses, causing more damage during the night <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Given that aphids rely entirely on acquiring phloem sap from plants for their reproduction and survival, they likely need to anticipate, respond to, and counteract the challenges posed by daily rhythms in their hosts. Notably, green peach aphids (<italic>Myzus persicae</italic>) feeding on Arabidopsis plants exhibit peak honeydew droplet excretion during the day <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. These diurnal patterns in aphids extend beyond honeydew excretion, encompassing aspects such as locomotion, larviposition, sex hormone release, egg hatching, and feeding <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. While these studies have begun to broaden our understanding of aphid diurnal rhythms, our knowledge about how aphids regulate their rhythmic behaviors and interact with their hosts over daily cycles is lacking.</p>
<p>The high energy demand for aphid reproduction and the ‘nitrogen and sugar barrier’ in phloem sap necessitate aphids to feed incessantly from their host plants <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. To facilitate this continuous feeding, aphids synthesize watery saliva in their salivary glands and secrete it into plant cells. This watery saliva comprises a complex blend of proteins with enzymatic activity, including cell-wall degrading enzymes, proteases, polyphenol oxidases, oxidoreductases, and peroxidases, as well as diverse calcium-binding proteins, and many others with unknown functions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Collectively termed effectors, these salivary proteins modify plant defense and physiology to better facilitate aphid feeding, survival, and reproduction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. With the advancement in omics technologies, numerous salivary effector candidates have been identified in several aphid species <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. An early and renowned example is C002, a protein with an unknown function that is essential for continuous feeding from sieve elements <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Silencing C002 expression results in lethal outcomes in the pea aphid, <italic>Acyrthosiphon pisum</italic>, and diminished fecundity in the green peach aphid, <italic>Myzus persicae</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Despite the pivotal roles of salivary effectors in the aphid colonization of host plants, knowledge about whether their expression or function undergoes diurnal rhythms is unknown.</p>
<p>Another consequence of a sugar-rich diet is that aphids must process and excrete excess sugar to maintain an appropriate osmotic balance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Aphid osmoregulation involves physiological processes such as the breakdown of sucrose into glucose and fructose, their polymerization and expulsion as honeydew, and the rapid cycling of water between the midgut and hindgut <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Additionally, aphids feed during the night when phloem sugar content is lower <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> and occasionally drink dilute sap from the xylem, a behavior hypothesized to contribute to rehydration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. At the molecular level, several genes involved in osmoregulation have been identified in aphids, and their silencing has been shown to elevate osmotic pressure in aphid hemolymph and impair performance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. A prior study also showed periodic variations in the expression of osmoregulatory genes throughout a 24 h period in the bird cherry-oat aphid, <italic>Rhopalosiphum padi</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Although diurnal fluctuation in phloem sap composition and its impact on aphid performance has been reported <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, an in-depth investigation into diurnal variation of aphid osmoregulation at the behavioral and molecular level is currently lacking.</p>
<p>Here, our study shows the diurnal rhythmicity of feeding behavior and gene expression in <italic>R. padi</italic>, a serious global pest of cereals, and its implications for aphid-host interactions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. We demonstrate diurnal variations in honeydew excretion and specific feeding activities, notably the salivation process into the phloem. Our temporal analysis of the aphid transcriptome reveals diurnally rhythmic gene clusters with unique expression patterns and pathway enrichment, rationalizing the observed diurnal changes in our aphid feeding assays. Significantly, diurnally rhythmic putative salivary effectors were identified, with many showing peak expression during the increased nighttime salivation. By integrating behavioral and molecular experiments, we unveil a significant time-oriented role of osmoregulatory and salivary effector genes in aphids feeding on host plants. These findings provide novel insights into the diurnal regulation of aphid behavior, metabolism, and salivary effectors, highlighting their crucial roles in colonizing host plants.</p>

<title>Diurnal rhythmicity in <italic>R. padi</italic> feeding behaviors</title>
<p>Diurnal variation of honeydew excretion in <italic>R. padi</italic> was investigated under a 12L:12D cycle for 48 h on wheat plants. Our study found that the number of honeydew droplets produced per aphid was higher during nighttime (12.09 ± 0.75, mean ± standard error of mean) as opposed to daytime (8.42 ± 0.57) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). The experiment was repeated on an artificial diet to determine if the observed patterns were independent of plant-derived cues. Although fewer honeydew droplets were produced on the diet overall, a higher number of honeydew droplets was consistently produced per aphid on the diet during the night (0.23 ± 0.05) compared to the day (0.09 ± 0.03) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p>

<p>The diurnal feeding behavior of <italic>R. padi</italic> was further elucidated using the electrical penetration graph (EPG) technique by measuring feeding at 4 h intervals over a 24 h period (12L:12D). Significant differences were observed in various aphid feeding activities over each timepoint (Supplementary Data 1), including the phloem salivation (E1) phase. Adult <italic>R. padi</italic> spent the longest time in E1 between 12-16 zeitgeber time (zt, refers to an environmental agent or event that provides the stimulus to set or reset a biological clock) and the shortest time between 0-4zt, each of which represents the time period directly following the removal or introduction of the light cues, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). We also identified a diurnal rhythm in the total duration of E1, with an acrophase (the estimated time in a rhythmic cycle when a peak or maximum value occurs) occurring at 9.8zt (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, Supplementary Table 1). Interestingly, despite the higher honeydew excretion at night (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>), the total time spent in phloem ingestion (E2 phase) did not differ over the 24 h period. No diurnal rhythm was detected for the E2 phase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesize that the observed day-night variations in salivation and honeydew excretion are associated with diurnally regulated genes involved in the expression of salivary effectors and metabolic pathways linked to aphid feeding, such as osmoregulation.</p>

<title>Temporal gene expression patterns in <italic>R. padi</italic> reveal diurnal rhythmicity</title>
<p>Temporal transcriptome profiles were collected from <italic>R. padi</italic> whole bodies over a 24 h period to identify diurnal rhythms in gene expression. A total of 49,486 transcripts were assembled with an average sequence length of 2,204 bp. The overall read mapping rate against the <italic>R. padi</italic> reference genome and Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) score for complete sequences were 97% and 99%, respectively (Supplementary Table 2). Of the total assembled transcripts, 4,460 (9.2%) showed significant diurnal rhythmicity over a 24 h period (Supplementary Data 2). 2,913 and 1,547 rhythmic transcripts were identified to have acrophases during the day (0-12zt) and night (12-24zt), respectively. Most transcripts displayed acrophases between 4-8zt and 17-19zt, representing midday and midnight periods, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>).</p>

<p>Soft-clustering analysis classified rhythmic transcripts into four discrete clusters (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Of the total rhythmic transcripts, 95% were clustered, with 1288, 431, 1143, and 1388 sequences assigned to clusters 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively (Supplementary Data 3). Most rhythmic transcripts in clusters 1 and 4 showed acrophases during the day at ∼4-5zt and ∼6-8zt. Cluster 2, containing the least number of transcripts (10% of clustered rhythmic transcripts), was represented by sequences with acrophases occurring during the late night-early morning transition (∼21-1zt). Cluster 3 was mainly represented by transcripts with acrophases during the night at ∼16-20zt.</p>
<p>Pathway enrichment analysis showed that cluster 1 was enriched in the pathways for the spliceosome, DNA replication, and basal transcription factors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, Supplementary Data 3), indicating the active regulation of mRNA and protein production during the day. Cluster 2 did not show significant pathway enrichment but exhibited significant gene ontology (GO) terms related to small molecule, lipid, and carbohydrate metabolic processes (Supplementary Fig. 1). Cluster 3 displayed enrichment in pathways associated with lysosome and various biochemical processes involved in starch, sugar, nitrogen, and amino acid metabolism, indicating higher night-time carbohydrate and amino acid metabolic activities in aphids. Cluster 4 was notably enriched in pathways related to purine metabolism, thiamine metabolism, and multiple pathways associated with human neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<title>Silencing diurnally rhythmic osmoregulatory genes impacts aphid performance</title>
<p>Osmoregulation is an important physiological activity to tolerate sugar-rich phloem sap during aphid feeding. Three osmoregulatory genes, <italic>aquaporin 1</italic> (AQP1) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, <italic>gut sucrase 1</italic> (SUC1) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, and <italic>gut sugar transporter 4</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, were previously reported to display diurnal patterns in <italic>R. padi</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. In our study, all three genes were confirmed to be diurnally rhythmic, with acrophases occurring at 15-22zt (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2d-e</xref>, Supplementary Table 3). To determine whether the osmoregulatory genes contributed to diurnal variations in honeydew excretion, AQP1, and SUC1 were silenced by injecting aphids with dsRNA targeting each gene. A significant silencing of AQP1 and SUC1 was confirmed 24 hours post-injection (hpi) (Supplementary Fig. 2a-b) with a knockdown efficiency of 44% and 50%, respectively. Silencing AQP1 and SUC1 increased aphid mortality over time, and reduced nymph production by 31% and 66% at 96 hpi, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f-g</xref>). Moreover, silencing the two genes markedly reduced honeydew excretion and abolished rhythms in the number of honeydew droplets produced by aphids between the day and night (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h</xref>). This affirms their significant roles in the diurnal regulation of honeydew excretion and osmoregulation.</p>

<p>Given the observed diurnal rhythm in the E1 salivation phase, we sought to determine the presence of diurnal rhythms in the expression of aphid salivary effectors. Previously, 156 genes were identified as putative salivary effectors in <italic>R. padi</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Our study retrieved 93% of putative effectors (145 genes represented by 264 transcripts) by searching all transcripts against the <italic>R. padi</italic> putative effector dataset (Supplementary Data 4). Among them, 42 exhibited diurnal rhythmicity, with 28 exhibiting acrophases at 6-8zt during the day and 14 with acrophases at 18-19zt and 22-23zt at night (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, Supplementary Table 4).</p>

<p>The expression levels of these rhythmic putative effectors were further examined in <italic>R. padi</italic> heads compared to the bodies (body samples excluded tissue from heads and unborn nymphs). We confirmed that the expressions of all rhythmic putative effectors were significantly higher in the heads, except for the putative effector MSTRG.15390.2, which lacked assigned count values across head and body samples (Supplementary Fig. 3). Hierarchical clustering of the rhythmic putative effectors identified four main clades, each showing distinct times of peak expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). Transcripts in clades 1 and 2 peaked in expression at the transition from day to night and the early portion of mid-day, respectively. In contrast, transcripts within clade 3 exhibited peak expressions at the end of the night and early morning, while clade 4 consisted of transcripts with expression peaking towards the end of the night. Notably, 43% of rhythmic putative effectors with peak expressions occurring at 12-16zt in clade 1 and 4 coincided with the timing of increased E1 salivation, including a well-characterized salivary effector - C002 (AphidBase accession - g12266.t1).</p>
<p>GO enrichment analysis highlighted two significantly enriched terms for all putative effectors: extracellular region and chitin-binding (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). The former supports a secretory role for these effectors, and the latter implies their potential time-dependent functions in evading or interfering with chitin-triggered plant immunity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. These findings provide evidence of diurnal rhythms in salivary effector expression, with a subset peaking in expression at the same time as increased nighttime salivation. It also suggests that different blends of salivary effectors are secreted into the plants at different times of the day and represents the first report of diurnal rhythmicity in salivary effector gene expression in any aphid species.</p>

<title>Key salivary effectors identified for functional analysis</title>
<p>To elucidate the functions of diurnally rhythmic salivary effectors in aphid-plant interactions, we selected C002 and a novel effector, E8696 (AphidBase accession -g8696.t1), based on their high amplitude values (i.e. half the difference between the highest and lowest points of a rhythmic cycle), positioning them among the top five compared to other rhythmic putative effectors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>, Supplementary Table 4). According to our soft-clustering analysis, C002 and E8696 were assigned to cluster 3 with membership scores of 0.895 and 0.979, respectively (Supplementary Data 3). Their high membership scores designate them as core members within the cluster <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>.

<title>Disrupting diurnally rhythmic salivary effectors alters feeding dynamics and performance</title>
<p>We further determined the role of C002 and E8696 in aphid feeding and performance through RNA interference. A significant knockdown of C002 and E8696 expression was confirmed at 24 hpi, with significant C002 silencing sustaining until 48 hpi (Fig. S2c-d). Silencing efficiencies at 24 and 48 hpi were 37% and 27% for C002 and 29% and 26% for E8696, respectively. Silencing C002 reduced aphid survivorship and fecundity on wheat (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e-f</xref>), consistent with previous findings <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Specifically, C002 silencing caused 29% aphid mortality and a 56% reduction in fecundity at 96 hpi compared to dsGFP control. Similarly, silencing of E8696 reduced aphid survivorship and fecundity, causing a 79% mortality and 86% reduction in fecundity at 96 hpi. To uncouple the influence of plant-derived cues on aphid feeding, we also assessed aphid performance on artificial diets after silencing the two effector genes. In contrast to the results observed on wheat plants, silencing either gene did not affect aphid survivorship and fecundity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g-h</xref>).</p>
<p>On plants, silencing either effector gene reduced overall honeydew excretion, with only C002 silencing disrupting the diurnal rhythm in honeydew excretion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4i</xref>). Nighttime honeydew excretion decreased by 1.7- and 1.4-fold compared to the day after silencing C002 (4.1 vs 2.4) and E8696 (4.1 vs 2.9). In contrast, silencing had no impact on honeydew excretion on artificial diets, and aphids consistently generated more honeydew droplets at night than during the day (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4j</xref>). Furthermore, we found no diurnal variation in nymph production post-silencing on both plant and diet (Supplementary Fig. 5). However, the overall number of nymphs was markedly lower compared to dsGFP controls on the plant, but not on the diet. These findings emphasize the time-oriented roles of these effectors in aphid feeding on plants.</p>
<p>Disturbed aphid feeding activities were also confirmed using EPG after silencing E8696. Aphids exhibited an increase in the average duration (total duration/number of each event) of the salivation phase (E1), accompanied by a concurrent decrease in the phloem ingestion phase (E2) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4k</xref>, Supplementary Data 5). These findings support our hypothesis that aphid feeding behavior and performance are tightly linked to and influenced by the diurnal expression of salivary effectors.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The cyclical patterns of environmental cues, dictated by the earth’s light-dark cycle, significantly influence the physiology and behavior of organisms, including crop plants and their pests <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. While studies have begun to show the prevalence of diurnal rhythms among aphid pests, critical knowledge gaps persist regarding how these rhythms facilitate interactions between aphids and their hosts. Our study aimed to fill these knowledge gaps by exploring diurnal rhythms in behavior and gene expression in the bird-cherry oat aphid (<italic>R. padi</italic>), a major pest on cereals worldwide. We further characterized the impact of diurnally rhythmic osmoregulatory and salivary effector genes on <italic>R. padi</italic> behavior and performance.</p>
<p>Here, we found that aphids exhibited diurnal rhythms in feeding behaviors, particularly in honeydew excretion and the duration of phloem salivation (E1 phase). Contrary to previously documented patterns <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, <italic>R. padi</italic> excreted more honeydew droplets on wheat plants during the nighttime. This divergence in honeydew excretion patterns implies species-specific adaptations of aphids to host plants, possibly indicating differences in aphid osmoregulatory rhythms in response to phloem quality across host species. Notably, the diurnal honeydew excretion patterns persisted in <italic>R. padi</italic> on artificial diets, devoid of plant-derived cues, suggesting a potential internal circadian clock-driven mechanism. However, it should be noted that these experiments were only conducted in the absence of plant-derived cues. To determine the involvement of the circadian clock in regulating the rhythms uncovered in our study, all cues, including plant, light, and temperature, would need to be removed.</p>
<p>Remarkably, the pronounced nighttime increase in phloem salivation suggests that aphids may be responding to changes in plant defenses or phloem quality, both of which are known to exhibit diurnal variation in numerous plant species <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. We also found that the duration of phloem and xylem sap ingestion (E2 and G phases, respectively) showed no significant differences over a 24 h cycle. The desire for aphids to quickly reach and remain in the E2 phase regardless of timepoint, coupled with the strong diurnal variation in honeydew excretion, might suggest that aphids do not modulate feeding behavior as a tool for osmoregulation but rather rely on metabolic mechanisms to process and excrete excess sugar. The low occurrence and the lack of diurnal variation in the G phase further suggests that increased metabolism of ingested phloem sap, resulting in higher honeydew excretion, constitute the primary mechanism for aphid osmoregulatory function over a 24 h period, with xylem ingestion only occurring in aphids that are severely dehydrated. These findings align with the nutritional and reproductive strategy of aphids, emphasizing the importance of acquiring sufficient sugar and amino acids for population growth and survival.</p>
<p>Our time-course profiling of aphid transcriptome revealed that approximately 9% of the total assembled transcripts displayed diurnal rhythms. Most rhythmic transcripts showed acrophases 6 h after the start and end of the light cue (noon or 4zt and midnight or 16zt, respectively). The bimodal pattern of these acrophases suggests that noon and midnight are periods of high activity in aphids, with multiple physiological and behavioral processes occurring at or around these times. Similar diurnal rhythmicity in gene expression was observed in Drosophila and the malaria mosquito (<italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>), estimating rhythmic expression in 10% and 15.8% of genes linked to various biological functions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>, respectively. Clustered rhythmic transcripts, showing peak expressions at specific times of the day, point to a transcriptional control mechanism, possibly by the circadian clock. Our enrichment analysis highlights the functional diversity within the different rhythmic gene clusters, particularly in metabolic activities between the day and night. Notably, the night-peaking clusters 2 and 3 were enriched in pathways related to the metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, lipids, and other small molecules. The upregulation of these metabolic pathways at night corresponds with the observed diurnal rhythms in honeydew excretion, suggesting a correlation between these metabolic processes and the regulation of honeydew excretion.</p>
<p>Previous studies show that silencing AQP1 and SUC1 in <italic>M. persicae</italic> led to elevated hemolymph osmotic pressure, accompanied by a decrease in aphid weight and fecundity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. In our study, a parallel decline in aphid performance was observed, where the silencing of AQP1 and SUC1 in <italic>R. padi</italic> resulted in increased mortality and diminished fecundity. Notably, both genes exhibit a pronounced diurnal rhythm, suggesting their peak osmoregulatory activities at specific times of day, potentially linked to changes in phloem sap composition. An important aspect of osmoregulation in aphids is the excretion of excess sugar in the form of oligosaccharides in honeydew <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. The overall reduction in quantity and the abolition of rhythms in honeydew excretion upon the silencing of AQP1 and SUC1 confirm their pivotal roles in shaping diurnal behavior of aphid honeydew excretion.</p>
<p>While we found that <italic>R. padi</italic> spent similar amounts of time feeding from the phloem cells during both day and night, a significant increase in salivation was observed at the beginning of the night. This suggests that time-of-day variations in the host plant may prompt aphids to modulate host responses through salivation and the introduction of specific effectors. Indeed, we found clear evidence showing diurnal rhythms in the expression of several salivary effector genes, including C002. The dynamic expression patterns of these rhythmic effectors suggest that different blends of effectors may be introduced into the plant for modulating time-of-day specific host plant responses.</p>
<p>To further confirm the time-dependent role of these rhythmic effectors in aphid-plant interactions, we silenced the C002 and E8696 effector genes, both showing peak expression at night. Silencing these two genes caused high mortality and reduced fecundity in aphids when feeding on host plants. However, no such trend was observed when the same experiment was performed on artificial diets, which underscores the crucial role of these effectors in facilitating the successful colonization of host plants by aphids. Strikingly, silencing these two effectors also resulted in a more pronounced reduction in nighttime honeydew excretion compared to the day on host plants. However, it had no impact on diurnal honeydew excretion on artificial diets. This affirms their significant roles in optimizing aphid feeding strategies and potentially enhancing their adaptation to the host plant’s physiological changes during the night. Future research is warranted to elucidate whether the rhythmic activity of these effectors is driven by the aphid’s circadian clock, phloem sap compositions, plant defenses, environmental changes across the diurnal period, or some combination of these factors.</p>
<p>In summary, our findings demonstrate significant alterations in the behavior and physiology of a major agricultural pest throughout the day. Exploring the daily variations in insect pests offers a new perspective for understanding the molecular, behavioral, and ecological factors that shape insect-plant interactions. Furthermore, the knowledge gained by these experiments holds great potential to inform the development of innovative pest control strategies. By strategically leveraging the daily rhythms that mark periods of strength and vulnerability in both crop plants and their pests, we envision entering an era of &quot;chronoculture,&quot; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> where harnessing circadian rhythms contributes significantly to enhancing crop yield and promoting sustainability.</p>

Nymph count and honeydew droplet production were recorded at the onset of day and night over 48 h, adhering to a 12L:12D photoperiod. Discrete honeydew droplets were counted instead of using a staining and area calculation method. This choice was made because droplets exhibit uniform size and were easily visible to the naked eye.

The recordings were performed every 4 h over a 24 h period starting at 0zt (a total of six time periods). Age-synchronized adult <italic>R. padi</italic> were starved for 1 h before wiring. Next, plant electrodes were inserted into the soil, and insect probes were adjusted to ensure contact between the plant surface and the insect. Aphids were only allowed to feed from the leaf 2, and only one aphid was recorded per plant. For recordings that were initiated in the night or scotophase (0zt, 16zt, and 20zt), all setup was performed with a red LED headlight (Energizer). The 0zt timepoint was set up in dark conditions while feeding behavior was recorded in light. The 12zt timepoint was set up in light conditions, with feeding behavior recorded in darkness. Photoperiod and the temperatures during the day and night were the same as those used for plant and aphid growing conditions. Both plants and aphids were discarded after each 4 h recording. EPG waveforms were analyzed using the Stylet+ software (v01.25, EPG systems, Wageningen, the Netherlands). The analysis of each feeding experiment aimed to determine the time allocation across four primary phases: the pathway or probing phase (C), non-probing phase (NP), salivation phase (E1), phloem sap ingestion phase (E2), and xylem phase (G).

The dsRNA sequence region of each gene was amplified with the gene-specific primer pair using Q5 high-fidelity PCR (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA). The sense and antisense dsRNA sequence fragments conjugated with the T7 promoter sequence were amplified separately using the previous PCR amplicons as templates. All PCR products were confirmed for unique and accurate amplification in agarose gels and purified using GeneJET PCR Purification Kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). dsRNA was synthesized with 1 µg of purified PCR products using the T7 RiboMAX Express RNAi System, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). dsRNA targeting the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene was synthesized following the protocol described above and used as a negative control.

The glass needle, filled with 5 μl of dsRNA, was assembled onto a Nanoject III microinjector (Drummond Scientific Co., Broomall, PA). Age-synchronized aphids were immobilized on a sticky tape strip (ventral side up) and injected with 180 ng of dsRNA (40 nl of 4.5 μg/μl) through the flexible membrane between the coxa of the hind leg and thorax. Immediately after injection, aphids were carefully detached from the tape using a wet paintbrush and transferred to a feeding chamber containing wheat leaves. The injection process was repeated until the desired number of aphids was achieved. The same procedure was applied to the other dsRNA treatment groups. The injected aphids were incubated at 25°C, 12L:12D photoperiod. Each experiment was independently replicated three times.</p>

<title>Aphid performance and feeding assays on wheat and artificial diet after gene knockdown</title>
<p>RNA interference (RNAi) was used to functionally characterize two osmoregulatory genes, aquaporin 1 (AQP1) and gut sucrase 1 (SUC1). Nine aphids injected with dsRNA AQP1 (dsAQP1) or dsRNA SUC1 (dsSUC1) were placed into a feeding chamber containing wheat leaves (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). Aphid mortality and fecundity (cumulative nymph count) were recorded every 24 h for 4 days. Aphids injected with dsRNA GFP (dsGFP) were the negative control. The number of honeydew droplets produced by five dsRNA-injected aphids on wheat plants were recorded at the beginning of the day and night for 4 days under a short-day photoperiod as described previously (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). Similar experimental setups were replicated for two target salivary effector genes, C002 and E8696, to measure aphid mortality and fecundity. Additionally, five aphids injected with dsRNA C002 (dsC002) or dsRNA E8696 (dsE8696) were placed on an artificial diet (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>) and monitored for mortality and fecundity every 24 h for 4 days. To further assess daily changes in honeydew excretion and fecundity, five aphids after 24 h post-injection with dsC002 or dsE8696 were placed on a wheat leaf or artificial diet. The numbers of honeydew droplets and nymphs were recorded as previously described (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). All experiments were independently repeated three times. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated for dsRNA-injected aphids and compared for statistical differences by the Mantel-Cox log-rank test with Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate adjusted <italic>p</italic>-values (adjusted <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) using the Survminer v0.4.9.

<p>In this study, the authors found that a species of aphid that is a known agricultural pest salivated longer and produced more honeydew when feeding at night. The authors identified aphid genes with diurnal expression patterns, including potential saliva-related genes. Silencing these genes reduced aphid performance only on real plants, suggesting a specific role in plant feeding. While this study is <bold>valuable</bold> for understanding plant-insect interactions in agriculture, it is currently <bold>incomplete</bold>, as further research is needed to elucidate the function of the identified genes.</p>

<p>Summary :</p>
<p>This study presents valuable data on diurnal patterns in aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi) feeding behavior and transcriptome profiles. The authors measured honeydew production by the aphids on plants and artificial diet during the day and night and conducted a comprehensive feeding behavior study using EPG with many biological replicates at 6 time-points in 24 hours. They also conducted transcriptome analyses of three samples of each 30 aphids at these time points. Differentially expressed transcripts were grouped into four clusters with distinct expression patterns. The expression of two genes found to be diurnally rhythmic was knocked down with RNAi and these aphids did less well, especially at night. They also analyzed the differential expression of candidate effector genes and found rhythmic ones to be enriched for more expression in aphid heads versus bodies - this pattern is expected given that effectors are most likely expressed in the salivary glands. Knockdown of a known effector (C002) that is diurnally rhythmic, and a novel effector gene, was found to alter aphid feeding dynamics and performance.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript was highly accessible, with clear writing, and the figures provided were both comprehensive and of good quality. The datasets generated from this research are valuable to the research field, especially the findings for honeydew secretion, EPG analysis, and transcriptome experiments.</p>
<p>The datasets generated in this study will be useful to scientists working on aphids and aphid-plant interactions and will inform similar studies on other insect species.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The weaknesses mainly relate to the (depth of) analyses and interpretation of the data. Also, some methods require more explanation, as follows:</p>
<p>In Figure 1, data show that aphids produce more honeydew at night than during the day. This suggests that the aphids ingest more phloem (E2 phase). However, in Figure 1d the duration of the E2 phase does not show obvious differences among the time points in the 24 hours. The authors contribute the explanation that the aphids may osmoregulate more during the night, leading to more honeydew secretion at night. This may be the case, but there could be other explanations. For example, the physiology, including regulation of water transport, of plants is known to change during night/day. The authors may focus this section more on the differences in the E1 phase, as this involves the delivery of aphid saliva and effectors into the plant phloem.</p>
<p>Transcriptome data shown in Figure 2 (and the experimental procedure of Figure 5b) appears to be based on three biological replicates. However, these replicates appear to have been harvested at the same time in the experiment, and this makes them technical replicates, not biological replicates. The inclusion of true biological replicates that include samples from time series experiments done on different days should be considered.</p>
<p>The authors conducted knockdown experiments targeting aquaporin 1 and gut sucrase 1 in aphids, resulting in reduced nymph production and decreased honeydew secretion. It is concluded that these results indicate significant roles of aquaporin 1 and gut sucrase 1 in diurnal regulation. However, it is essential to consider that these genes likely play crucial roles in aphid physiology beyond diurnal rhythms. Consequently, reduced expression would naturally impair aphid performance. The dsAQP1 and dsSUC1 aphids consistently produced less honeydew, regardless of the time of day, indicating a broader impact of gene knockdown. The observed increase of the phenotype at night may not be attributable to the specific roles of these genes in diurnal regulation but rather due to heightened aphid activity during that time (as evidenced by increased honeydew secretion) that could magnify the impact of the knockdown effect, making it easier to observe. Therefore, the knockdown of aquaporin 1 and gut sucrase 1 may exert a general negative influence on aphid fitness, independently of diurnal factors.</p>
<p>To analyze the roles of genes in diurnal regulation, additional controls should be incorporated. This could involve the knockdown of genes with essential functions that are not influenced by diurnal rhythms, providing a baseline comparison. Furthermore, consider including genes known to be involved in diurnal regulation in other insects, as documented in the existing literature, in the experimental design.</p>
<p>The same arguments as for aquaporin 1 and gut sucrase 1 above may be made for knockdown of effector genes (Figure 4). It has already been shown that knockdown of C002 impacts aphid performance, and the data herein may be explained by a general lower performance of aphids rather than a specific function of these effectors in diurnal regulation. It is also expected that knockdown of the effectors has less impact on aphids feeding from artificial diets. This does not necessarily indicate the role of the effectors in diurnal regulation.</p>
<p>In the abstract and elsewhere, the authors assert priority by stating, &quot;...the first evidence of...&quot;. However, it's important to note that priority claims are often challenging to verify across many fields. Instead of relying solely on claims of precedence, the evidence presented in the research could stand on its own merit.</p>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>The study presents intriguing new findings, particularly in the realms of honeydew analysis, EPG, and transcriptome analysis. However, the interpretation of subsequent studies employing gene knockdowns needs further consideration.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors conducted a time-course of whole-body transcriptional analysis of a pest aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi, and identified four major clusters of the genes that show diurnal rhythmicity in transcription. In addition, they conducted the analysis of aphid feeding behaviour and showed that aphids salivate longer from the end of the day toward the beginning of the night while their phloem feeding time does not change throughout the day. The genes up-regulated at night time were enriched with the genes involved in metabolic activities, collaborating with the results showing a higher number of honeydew excretion at night. The authors identified the list of candidate salivary genes that show diurnal rhythmicity in the transcription and silenced a salivary gene C002 and the candidate salivary gene E8696. Silencing of these genes reduced aphid fecundity and survival rate on the host plant but not on the artificial diet.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The time-course transcription study and its analysis will be of interest to researchers studying diurnal rhythms in insect biology. Also, the analysis of aphid feeding behaviour at different times of day is interesting. This study provides variable resources for those who study insect biology.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>It is not clear to me which data was used to define the putative salivary effectors for R. padi, but the candidate salivary gene list made by Thorpe et al consists of the aphid genes encoding secreted proteins that are up-regulated in the head samples compared to the body samples. Although some proteins were confirmed to be secreted into the aphid saliva, many genes in the list are not confirmed to be expressed in the aphid salivary glands, and their products are not confirmed to be secreted into the saliva and the plant. Is E8696 expressed in the aphid salivary glands and secreted into its host plant? Without the data confirming the expression of the gene in the salivary glands and its secretion into the saliva and into the host plant, we cannot call the protein a salivary protein. Furthermore, without the observation that E8696 has some effect on plant biology, we cannot call it an aphid effector. Therefore, I cannot agree with the parts of the manuscript that refer to E8686 as an aphid salivary effector.</p>
<p>It is interesting to know that some candidate salivary gene expression showed a diurnal rhythm. However, without the knowledge of the functions of the salivary effectors, especially their targets, it is not possible to conclude that the rhythmical expression is important for the aphid performance. In addition, I wonder whether the increase in gene expression is directly correlated with the increase of protein secretion into the saliva and the plant.</p>
<p>Finally, the authors examined aphid survival, fecundity, and feeding behaviour. Those are important for overall aphid performance, but they do not &quot;shape&quot; aphid colonization. Aphid colonisation is shaped by the mechanisms by which aphids find and select their host plant and start to feed on it. Therefore, I do not agree with the title of this manuscript and some parts of the discussion.</p>
<p>I would like the authors to develop how the knowledge of the diurnal rhythm of aphid feeding can contribute to optimise pest management. I see that there are some differences in aphid metabolism and feeding behaviour between day and night, but I would like to hear how such knowledge can optimise pest management strategies.</p>
