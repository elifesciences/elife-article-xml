<title>Summary</title><p>Cell migration is a key process in the shaping and formation of tissues. During sprouting angiogenesis, endothelial tip cells invade avascular tissues by generating actomyosin-dependent forces that drive cell migration and vascular expansion. Surprisingly, ECs can still invade if actin polymerization is inhibited. In this study, we show that endothelial tip cells employ an alternative mechanism of cell migration that is dependent on Aquaporin (Aqp)-mediated water inflow and increase in hydrostatic pressure. In the zebrafish, ECs express <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> in newly formed vascular sprouts in a VEGFR2-dependent manner. Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 loss-of-function studies show an impairment in intersegmental vessels formation because of a decreased capacity of tip cells to increase their cytoplasmic volume and generate membrane protrusions, leading to delayed tip cell emergence from the dorsal aorta and slower migration. Further inhibition of actin polymerization resulted in a greater decrease in sprouting angiogenesis, indicating that ECs employ two mechanisms for robust cell migration <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our study thus highlights an important role of hydrostatic pressure in tissue morphogenesis.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>The revised manuscript contains a series of new experiments and analyses to especially address: 1) the establishment of an osmotic gradient that drives the direction of water flow during endothelial cell migration, 2) the role of Aquaporins in endothelial cell proliferation and regulation of intersegmental vessel (ISV) diameter, and 3) the role of Aquaporins in regulating endothelial front-rear polarity. Additionally, we have performed experiments to investigate the effect of the Aqp1a.1 overexpression in endothelial tip cells to complement the loss-of-function study. As shown the revised Figure 5, the overexpression of Aqp1a.1 resulted in bigger tip cells, confirming the function of Aquaporins in mediating water inflow during migration.
We have also addressed all other concerns (citation and discussion of published literature, clarification of data, changes to figures etc.) that the reviewers have raised.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The blood vascular system is a dynamic, multicellular tissue that adapts to the metabolic demands of development, growth and homeostasis by altering its pattern and morphology. Macroscopic transformation in the vascular network is achieved by microscopic changes in endothelial cell (EC) behaviours. For example, vascular expansion through sprouting angiogenesis requires the coordination of EC migration, proliferation, anastomosis, lumen formation and cell rearrangements, all of which require specific cell shape changes. At the initial phase of sprouting angiogenesis, endothelial tip cells generate numerous membrane protrusions such as filopodia and lamellipodia that drive migration and anastomosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Figueiredo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gerhardt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Phng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Sauteur et al., 2017</xref>). During tubulogenesis, apical membranes deform by generating inverse blebs to expand lumens so that blood can be transported efficiently through the blood vascular network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gebala et al., 2016</xref>). However, following vessel perfusion, ECs become less dynamic and instead develop mechanoresistance to the deforming forces of blood pressure to maintain vessel morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kondrychyn et al., 2020</xref>). EC shape is therefore dynamic and changes depending on the morphogenetic state of vascular development.</p>
<p>It is well established that localized remodelling of actin cytoskeleton and non-myosin II contractility are instrumental in driving cell shape changes during tissue morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Clarke and Martin, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Munjal and Lecuit, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Murrell et al., 2015</xref>). More recently, there is an accumulating body of work implicating a role of water flow and the resulting increase in hydrostatic pressure as another mechanical mechanism of cell shape change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Choudhury et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chugh et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Li et al., 2020</xref>). For example, in the osmotic engine model of cell migration, polarized distribution of ion channels and transporters generate an osmotic gradient that drives water inflow at the leading edge and outflow at the rear, leading to forward translocation of tumour cells in confined microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Stroka et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, hydrostatic pressure from the extracellular environment can drive tissue morphogenesis, as demonstrated during mouse blastocyst formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dumortier et al., 2019</xref>), development of the otic vesicle in the zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Mosaliganti et al., 2019</xref>) and blood vessel lumen expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gebala et al., 2016</xref>). Hydrostatic pressure can therefore generate sufficient forces to shape tissues and organs to their proper form and size during development.</p>
<p>We have previously discovered that EC migration persists after the inhibition of actin polymerization and in the absence of filopodia to generate new blood vessels in the zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Phng et al., 2013</xref>). This observation suggests the existence of an alternative mechanism of migration independent of actin polymerization. In this study, we sought to determine whether hydrostatic pressure regulates EC migration during sprouting angiogenesis in the zebrafish by investigating the function of Aquaporins (Aqp), which are transmembrane water channels that increase water permeability of cell membranes to promote transcellular water flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Day et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Farinas et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kozono et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Preston et al., 1992</xref>). We discovered that ECs of newly formed intersegmental vessels (ISV) express <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> mRNA, and observed the enrichment of Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 proteins in the leading edge of migrating tip cells. Detailed single cell analyses showed that endothelial tip cells lacking <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> expression have reduced cell volume, membrane protrusions and migration capacity. As a result, there is defective sprouting angiogenesis and ISV formation in <italic>aqp1a.1;aqp8a.1</italic> double mutant zebrafish. Notably, when actin polymerization is inhibited in <italic>aqp1a.1</italic>;<italic>aqp8a.1</italic> double mutant zebrafish, there is a greater impairment in EC migration and sprouting angiogenesis, demonstrating the additive function of actin polymerization and hydrostatic pressure (that is elevated by water inflow) in generating membrane protrusions to drive EC migration <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title><italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> are differentially expressed by tip and stalk cells during sprouting angiogenesis</title>
<p>Of the 18 <italic>aquaporin</italic> genes that are expressed in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Tingaud-Sequeira et al., 2010</xref>), <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> mRNA have been detected in blood endothelial cells (ECs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Koun et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Rehn et al., 2011</xref>). We confirmed the endothelial expression of <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> at 30 hours post fertilization (hpf) and 2-, 3- and 4-days post fertilization (dpf) by whole-mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (WISH, Fig. S1). The two endothelial <italic>aqp</italic> genes, however, differ in spatial expression. While <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> is widely expressed in blood vessels of the head and trunk (dorsal aorta (DA), caudal artery (CA), ISVs, dorsal longitudinal anastomotic vessels (DLAV) and caudal vein plexus) at 30 hpf, <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> expression is absent in cerebral blood vessels and is restricted to the DA, CA and the ventral regions of ISVs in the trunk. After 1 dpf, <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> expression expands to the entire ISV and DLAV. Additionally, the expression of <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> gradually decreases in the DA and CA so that both are absent by 4 dpf. Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of ECs isolated at 24 hpf, 34 hpf and 3 dpf further confirmed the endothelial expression of <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> mRNA (Fig. S2 A - F), revealed differential expression of <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> mRNA in distinct endothelial clusters and highlighted higher <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> transcript expression in all endothelial subtypes compared to <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> (Fig. S2 E - H).</p>
<p>We next examined the expression pattern of <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> at the beginning of sprouting angiogenesis at higher resolution using RNAscope and confocal microscopy. At 20 hpf, <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> mRNA is highly expressed in the DA with little expression in the PCV (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A, C</xref> and Fig. S3). Closer inspection uncovered heterogeneous expression in the DA, with higher expression in ECs that would be specified as tip cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A, C</xref> and Fig. S3B). Indeed, tip cells of newly formed vascular sprouts express higher levels of <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> compared to adjacent ECs in the DA at 20 hpf (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A – C</xref>, Fig. S3B) and the majority of ISVs (61%) display higher <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> expression in tip cells than in trailing stalk cells at 22 hpf (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). <italic>Aqp8a.1</italic> expression is at first largely absent in the DA at 20 hpf (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B, D</xref> and Fig. S3C) but becomes detectable at 22hpf (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). Interestingly, unlike <italic>aqp1a.1</italic>, <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> expression is undetectable in tip cells of emerging ISVs at 20 hpf. At 22 hpf, it is expressed in 22 out of 23 tip cells analyzed with 78% of ISVs exhibiting higher <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> mRNA expression in stalk cells than tip cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). These observations highlight differential expression pattern of <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> in newly formed vascular sprouts, with <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> expression enriched in tip cells and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> expression in stalk cells.</p>

<title>VEGF-VEGFR2 signalling induces the expression of <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> mRNA</title>
<p>We next explored whether <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> expression is regulated by VEGFR2 signalling, which is highly activated in tip cells during sprouting angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gerhardt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Siekmann et al., 2013</xref>). To inhibit VEGFR2 activity, embryos were treated with 1 µM ki8751 from 20 hpf. Relative quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) experiments showed that <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> mRNA expression was suppressed by 52% (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and 17% (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0028), respectively, after 6 hours of ki8751 treatment when compared to DMSO-treated embryos (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). These results demonstrate that VEGFR2 activity upregulates the expression of <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic>. To examine whether VEGFR2 activity also regulates Aquaporin expression in human ECs, we treated cultured human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) with ki8751 for 6 hours and analyzed <italic>AQP1</italic> expression by qPCR. <italic>AQP8</italic> expression was not examined since it is not expressed in HAECs (data not shown). Inhibition of VEGFR2 activity with 1 nM and 10 nM ki8751 decreased <italic>AQP1</italic> mRNA expression by 31% (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0023, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>) and 40% (<italic>p</italic> = 0.1032, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>), respectively, demonstrating cross-species conservation of VEGFR2 activity in inducing <italic>Aqp1</italic> mRNA expression.</p>

<title>Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 proteins are enriched at the leading edge of migrating tip cells</title>
<p>To gain a better understanding of where within the cell Aquaporin protein functions, we generated stable <italic>Tg(fli1ep:aqp1a.1-mEmerald)<sup>rk30</sup></italic> and <italic>Tg(fli1ep:aqp8a.1-mEmerald)<sup>rk31</sup></italic>zebrafish lines in which ECs express Aqp1a.1 or Aqp8a.1 tagged with mEmerald, respectively. At 25 hpf, we observed an accumulation of Aqp1a.1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) and Aqp8a.1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>) in mCherryCAAX-positive membrane clusters in the cytoplasm and filopodia of tip cells. Notably, many of the Aqp1a.1- or Aqp8a.1-positive membrane clusters are located at the migrating front of the tip cell. Time-lapse imaging capturing the process of ISV formation between 24 to 30 hpf further showed sustained enrichment of Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 in clusters at the front of the tip cell as well as in filopodia (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">D</xref>, Movie S1 and S2), suggesting that Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 may promote localized water flux at the migrating edge of tip cells.</p>

<p>We subsequently proceeded to generate zebrafish <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> mutants to investigate the function of Aquaporin-mediated water flow in blood vessel development. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, we targeted the first exons of <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> genes. The CRISPR-generating allele <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28</sup></italic> carries a 14-bp deletion and an 8-bp insertion in the 5’ end of the gene leading to a premature termination codon at amino acid 76 after 1 missense amino acid (Fig. S4A-B). The <italic>aqp8a.1<sup>rk29</sup></italic> allele carries a 4-bp deletion in the 5’ end of the gene that leads to a frameshift after Thr15 and premature termination codon at amino acid 73 after 58 missense amino acids (Fig. S5A-B). Using whole-mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization and qPCR analysis, we demonstrated that <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> mRNA expression is significantly decreased in <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup></italic> (Fig. S4C-D) and <italic>aqp8a.1<sup>rk29/rk29</sup></italic> (Fig. S5C-D) zebrafish embryos, respectively, suggesting a rapid degradation of mutant mRNAs and as a result, the loss of Aquaporin protein expression.</p>
<p>Although <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup>;aqp8a.1<sup>rk29/rk29</sup></italic>embryos look morphologically normal when compared to wildtype or <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>+/rk28</sup>;aqp8a.1<sup>+/rk29</sup></italic>embryos (Fig. S8A-D), we observed defects in blood vessel formation and patterning at 1 to 3 dpf. Compared to 28 hpf control embryos whose ISVs have reached the dorsal roof of the neural tube and started to form the DLAV, ISVs of <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup>;aqp8a.1<sup>rk29/rk29</sup></italic>embryos are much less developed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">D</xref>) with significantly reduced length (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref> and Fig. S6H and K). Single deletion of <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref> and Fig. S6F and I) or <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref> and Fig. S6G and J) also led to defective ISV formation, although the defects are less severe compared to the loss of both <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> expression. Comparison of ISV length in <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup></italic>, <italic>aqp8a.1<sup>rk29/rk29</sup></italic> and <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup>;aqp8a.1<sup>rk29/rk29</sup></italic>embryos shows that the loss of <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> leads to a greater decrease in ISV length than the loss of <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>, Fig. S6I and J), and that the loss of both <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> results in the greatest reduction. These observations indicate an additive effect of Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 function in blood vessel development and implicate Aqp1a.1 as the more dominant Aquaporin protein in EC function, in line with the higher expression of <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> mRNA in tip cells.</p>

<p>We next examined the embryos at 3 dpf, a stage when arterial ISVs (aISVs) and venous (vISVs) are fully established and lumenized, connecting the DLAV to either the DA or PCV (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">G</xref>), respectively. Such fully established ISVs are significantly reduced in embryos when <italic>aqp1a.1</italic>, <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> or both <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> are deleted. Instead, these embryos display an increased number of aISVs and vISVs that fail to establish a connection to the DLAV, DA or PCV (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H – J</xref>). The number of incompletely formed or truncated ISVs per embryo in <italic>aquaporin</italic> mutants was variable, between 1 to 6, 1 to 16 and 1 to 22 truncated ISVs in <italic>aqp8a.1<sup>rk29/rk29</sup></italic>, <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup></italic> and <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup>;aqp8a.1<sup>rk29/rk29</sup></italic>embryos, respectively (Fig. S6A-D). We also found that truncated ISVs appear with higher frequency in the zebrafish trunk (ISV number 5 to 15) rather than in the tail (ISV number 16 to 27, Fig. S6E). Detailed analysis revealed that most of the truncated ISVs are vISVs that are connected to the PCV but not the DLAV (Class I in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3K</xref>), followed by the absence of aISV or vISV (Class II in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3K</xref>, Fig. S7A and B). A small fraction of the truncated vessels are aISVs that are not connected to the DA (Class IV in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3K</xref>, Fig. S7D) or DLAV (Class V in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3K</xref>, Fig. S7E), or vISVs that are not connected to the DLAV (Class VI in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3K</xref>, Fig. S7F). At some regions, there is a truncated aISV that is not connected to the DA and an incomplete vISV that is not connected to the DLAV (Class III in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3K</xref>, Fig. S7C).</p>
<p>As <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> is expressed in the brain vasculature during development (Fig. S1), we examined whether cerebral vasculature is also affected in <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup></italic> embryos. At 4 dpf, we found that the length of the dorsal longitudinal vein (DLV), a main blood vessel that supplies blood to the choroid plexus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bill and Korzh, 2014</xref>) was reduced in <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup></italic> embryos (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0098, Fig. S9A, B and E). Also, in 2 out of 21 <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup></italic> embryos, the DLV was undeveloped (Fig. S9C, D and F), a defect that is also observed in 50% of <italic>vegfab<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>vegfc<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Parab et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, our analyses show that in the absence of Aqp1a.1 and/or Aqp8a.1 function, there is an initial delay in ISV formation during primary sprouting angiogenesis. By 3 dpf, some ISVs are completely formed (Fig. S8K and M), connecting the DA or PCV to the DLAV. However, the number of completely formed ISVs is significantly decreased, with the loss of Aqp1a.1 having a more severe impact compared to the loss of Aqp8a.1, and the combined loss of Aqp1a.1 or Aqp8a.1 having a greater deleterious effect.</p>

<title>Aquaporins promote endothelial tip cell protrusion and migration</title>
<p>To gain a better understanding of why ISVs do not develop normally, we assessed EC number. By counting the number of nuclei in aISVs and vISVs, we found a significant reduction in EC number per vessel in 2 and 3 dpf <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup>;aqp8a.1<sup>rk29/rk29</sup></italic> embryos when compared to wildtype embryos (Fig. S10A and B), suggesting that the defective formation of ISVs may result from insufficient EC number. Quantification of endothelial mitotic events between 21 and 30 hpf shows that there is a similar number of tip and stalk cell division in <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>+/rk28</sup>;aqp8a.1<sup>+/rk29</sup></italic>embryos and <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup>;aqp8a.1<sup>rk29/rk29</sup></italic> embryos (Fig. S10C), indicating that decreased EC division is not the cause of reduced EC number in ISVs. We next explored whether EC migration from the DA is impaired by examining tip cell behaviour from 21 – 22hpf, when sprouting angiogenesis begins. In <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>+/rk28</sup>;aqp8a.1<sup>+/rk29</sup></italic> embryos, tip cells emerge from the DA between 20 and 24 hpf (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) and migrate dorsally between the somite boundaries over the notochord and neural tube to form primary ISVs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, Movie S3). However, in <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup>;aqp8a.1<sup>rk29/rk29</sup></italic>embryos, tip cell nuclei emerge between 22 and 28 hpf (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Furthermore, in some <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup>;aqp8a.1<sup>rk29/rk29</sup></italic> embryos, tip cell membrane protrusions do not extend dorsally in the direction of migration but retract back to the DA so that a primary ISV does not form at this location (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, Movie S4), potentially giving rise to the Class II phenotype at 3 dpf (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3K</xref> and Fig. S7B). These observations indicate that tip cell protrusion from the DA is significantly delayed in the absence of Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 function.</p>

<p>We have previously demonstrated that filopodia facilitate EC migration by serving as a template for lamellipodia formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Phng et al., 2013</xref>). Lamellipodia frequently emanate laterally from stable filopodia at the leading edge of tip cells, leading to rapid expansion of the filopodium, increase in volume and the formation of a stable protrusion in the direction of migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Phng et al., 2013</xref>). This was similarly observed in <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>+/rk28</sup>;aqp8a.1<sup>+/rk29</sup></italic> embryos (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref> and Movie S5) but not in <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup>;aqp8a.1<sup>rk29/rk29</sup></italic> embryos (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref> and Movie S6).

By tracking Lifeact-mCherry signal in filopodia, we determined that the average elongation rate of actin as 0.055 ± 0.013 µm per second in wildtype embryos and that this is significantly decreased by 47% to 0.029 ± 0.011 µm per second (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) in <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup>;aqp8a.1<sup>rk29/rk29</sup></italic>embryos. Analysis of time-lapse images of tip cell behaviour further showed slower tip cell membrane expansion at the leading edge (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4K</xref>), decreased nuclei displacement (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4L</xref>) and a significant reduction in tip cell migration velocity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4M</xref>) in <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup>;aqp8a.1<sup>rk29/rk29</sup></italic> embryos. To determine whether the slower EC migration is caused by a loss of front-rear polarity, we examined Golgi position relative to the nucleus in wildtype, <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup></italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1<sup>rk29/rk29</sup></italic>embryos at 24 - 26 hpf (Fig. S10D). This analysis shows that tip cell polarity is unperturbed in the absence of Aqp1a.1 or Aqp8a.1 function.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 regulate sprouting angiogenesis by promoting endothelial tip cell emergence from the DA, the formation and expansion of membrane protrusions and EC migration.</p>

<title>Tip cell volume regulation depends on Aquaporin-mediated water influx</title>
<p>Aquaporin channels permit bidirectional flow of water across the plasma membrane, with the direction of flow determined by the osmotic gradient between the extracellular environment and cell cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agre et al., 2002</xref>). We next sought to determine whether water flows in or out of tip cells during sprouting angiogenesis. We hypothesize that water flux across the cell membrane can lead to changes in tip cell volume, with water influx increasing the volume while outflow decreases. To quantify tip cell volume in the absence of Aquaporin function, we injected a plasmid encoding <italic>kdrl:mEmerald</italic> into 1-cell stage <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup>;aqp8a.1<sup>rk29/rk29</sup></italic>embryos to label ECs in a mosaic manner. We also investigated the effects of increasing Aqp1a.1 expression on tip cell volume by injecting a plasmid encoding <italic>Aqp1a.1-P2A-EGFP</italic> into wildtype embryos. As control, wildtype embryos were injected with the plasmid encoding <italic>kdrl:mEmerald</italic>. mEmerald/EGFP-positive tip cells were imaged and their volume measured at 24 to 25 hpf from 3D reconstructions of labelled cells. Wildtype ECs are on average 964.6 ± 270.2 µm<sup>3</sup> in size (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). In the absence of both Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 function (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>), tip cell volume significantly decreased by 26% to 709.8 ± 293.5 µm<sup>3</sup> (<italic>p</italic> = 0.015, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>) when compared to wildtype tip cells. The overexpression of Aqp1a.1 increased tip cell volume by 36% to 1313 ± 527.4 µm<sup>3</sup> when compared to wildtype tip cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">D</xref>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0069) and by 85% when compared to <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup>;aqp8a.1<sup>rk29/rk29</sup></italic>tip cells (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001).

<title>The anion channel, SWELL1, promotes EC migration and sprouting angiogenesis</title>
<p>As the direction of water flow is dictated by an osmotic gradient, with water flowing from low to high osmolarity, we next examined the function of ion channels in establishing an osmotic gradient. SWELL1, or LRRC8A, is a component of volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC) that mediates ions, especially chloride anions, and osmolyte efflux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Qiu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Voss et al., 2014</xref>). Recently, SWELL1 has been demonstrated to polarize at the trailing edge of migrating breast cancer cells to direct water efflux and confer confined migration direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). In the zebrafish, scRNAseq data shows that the gene encoding SWELL1, <italic>lrrc8aa</italic>, is expressed in a subset of ECs, with 12.32% of ECs coexpressing <italic>lrrc8aa</italic> and <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>) and 10.16% coexpressing <italic>lrrc8aa</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>).

Although <italic>lrrc8aa</italic> is expressed in surrounding somites and notochord (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>), we could also detect its expression in endothelial tip cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">E</xref>), suggesting that SWELL1 can establish an osmotic gradient in the vicinity of the developing ISVs and within tip cells to direct water flow. To address the function of SWELL1-generated osmotic gradient, we disrupted its activity by treating zebrafish with 5µM DCPIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gunasekar et al., 2022</xref>) for 6 hours from 20 hpf and observed a similar impairment in ISV formation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">G</xref>) as in <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup>;aqp8a.1<sup>rk29/rk29</sup></italic> embryos (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). SWELL1 inhibition resulted in shorter ISVs formed at 26 to 27 hpf (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H</xref>) due to impaired leading edge displacement of tip cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6I</xref>) and decreased tip cell velocity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6J</xref>). Further analysis of tip cell morphology showed a decrease in the number (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6K</xref>) and length (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6L</xref>) of filopodia formed and compromised elongation of tip cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6M</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">N</xref>, Movie S7) in DCPIB-treated embryos. In summary, these results suggest that chloride efflux through SWELL1 establishes an osmotic gradient, either within ECs or between EC and the surrounding interstitial tissue, to direct water flow and thereby modulate EC migration and sprouting angiogenesis.</p>

<title>Additive effects of actin polymerization and water influx in driving EC migration and sprouting angiogenesis</title>
<p>We have previously observed that ECs are still able to migrate and form ISVs after the inhibition of actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Phng et al., 2013</xref>). In these experiments, embryos were treated with a low concentration of Latrunculin B (Lat. B), an inhibitor of actin polymerization, that resulted in the suppression of filopodia formation. Under such conditions, ECs can generate small membrane protrusions and migrate in a directed manner at a reduced speed. How ECs are still able to migrate after the inhibition of actin polymerization was unclear. As our current study demonstrates a role of water inflow and hydrostatic pressure as another mechanism of cell migration, we hypothesize that ECs employ water influx to migrate when actin polymerization is compromised and that the depletion of both water influx and actin polymerization will result in a greater inhibition of EC migration.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, we examined ISV development in embryos with decreased actin polymerization and water inflow by treating <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup>;aqp8a.1<sup>rk29/rk29</sup></italic>embryos with Lat. B. At 28 hpf, ISVs of wildtype embryos treated with DMSO have reached the dorsal roof of the neural tube (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>) and show an average length of 104.1 ± 13.47 µm (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>). The treatment of wildtype embryos with 0.08 µg/ml Lat. B from 20 to 28 hpf (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>) resulted in a significant decrease in ISV length (61.53 ± 23.27 µm) compared to control embryos (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>). A similar decrease in ISV length was also observed in <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup>;aqp8a.1<sup>rk29/rk29</sup></italic> embryos treated with DMSO (63.75 ± 30.24 µm, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). When <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup>;aqp8a.1<sup>rk29/rk29</sup></italic> embryos were treated with 0.08µg/ml Lat.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we demonstrate that endothelial tip cells utilize two mechanisms of migration concurrently – actin polymerization and hydrostatic pressure - during sprouting angiogenesis in the zebrafish. The increase in hydrostatic pressure in endothelial tip cells is generated by Aqp1a.1- and Aqp8a.1-mediated water inflow. By performing detailed expression analyses, we showed that <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> are differentially expressed in newly formed vascular sprouts. <italic>Aqp1a.1</italic> is expressed earlier in the DA than <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> during development and in ECs destined to be tip cells. In newly formed ISVs, endothelial tip cells express higher <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> mRNA levels while stalk cells express higher <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> mRNA levels. In zebrafish harbouring mutations in both <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic>, there is delayed tip cell protrusion from the DA, decreased tip cell migration and increased occurrence of truncated ISVs at 3 dpf. We further discovered that <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> expression is upregulated by VEGFR2 activity, suggesting that VEGFA-VEGFR2 signalling employs Aquaporin function as one mechanism to drive sprouting angiogenesis.</p>
<p>Several lines of evidence implicate Aquaporins in facilitating water flow into endothelial tip cells during sprouting angiogenesis. First, timelapse imaging showed polarized localization of Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 proteins at the leading edge of migrating tip cells, suggesting that water flow occurs locally at the migrating front of the cell. Secondly, single cell analyses revealed Aqp1a.1- and Aqp8a.1-deficient tip cells have reduced cell volume, impaired expansion of cell membranes at the leading edge and decreased generation of stable cell protrusions. These observations implicate water flow into tip cells, leading to increased cell volume. This is confirmed by the overexpression of Aqp1a.1 in tip cells that resulted in increased cell volume. Due to the incompressible property of water within an enclosed compartment such as the cell, water influx will lead to elevation in hydrostatic pressure. At the leading edge of tip cells, increased hydrostatic pressure would expand and deform membranes to generate protrusions. Additionally, water influx can reduce cytoplasmic viscosity and increase spacing between the plasma membrane and the underlying actin cytoskeleton, promoting actin monomer diffusion, actin polymerization and the generation of membrane protrusions to facilitate cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Boer et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Loitto et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>A key finding in this study is the demonstration that endothelial tip cells employ hydrostatic pressure as a second mechanism of cell migration <italic>in vivo</italic>. In a previous study, we discovered that ECs continue to migrate when actin polymerization is inhibited and in the absence of filopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Phng et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we show that hydrostatic pressure can generate force for EC migration in the absence of actin-based force generation. When both mechanisms are perturbed, there is a greater impairment in EC migration (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). This finding highlights the importance of hydrostatic pressure as an additional mechanism that reinforces actin-based cell shape changes and motility to ensure robust migration and formation of new blood vessels in complex three-dimensional environments. Such dual mode migration is advantageous when blood vessels develop in physically confined spaces such as in the zebrafish trunk, where ECs must emerge from the DA and migrate between somite boundaries and over tissues such as the notochord and neural tube to form ISVs. Such dependence on water flow in cell migration under confined microenvironment has been reported in human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and mouse S180 sarcoma cells, which show cell migration persistence in narrow channels after inhibition of actin polymerization or myosin II-mediated contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Stroka et al., 2014</xref>). In this context, AQP5 mediates water flow and the decrease or increase in AQP5 expression suppresses or enhances, respectively, cancer cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chae et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jung et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Stroka et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Our findings on the endothelial function of zebrafish Aqp1a.1, which is homologous to mammalian AQP1, corroborate previous studies demonstrating a function of AQP1 in promoting cell migration. In tumour bearing AQP1-null mice, there is reduced tumour angiogenesis and AQP1-deficient ECs display reduced migration in an <italic>in vitro</italic> wound healing assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Maltaneri et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Saadoun et al., 2005</xref>). In chick, AQP1 expression levels affect neural crest cell migration speed and direction by regulating filopodia length and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">McLennan et al., 2019</xref>). The regulation of membrane protrusions has also been demonstrated for other Aquaporin proteins. For example, AQP9 weakens membrane-cytoskeleton anchorage and promote formation of membrane protrusions such as filopodia and blebs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Karlsson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Loitto et al., 2007</xref>). We also demonstrate for the first time a role of Aqp8a.1 in promoting EC migration and sprouting angiogenesis in the zebrafish. However, its mammalian ortholog, AQP8, was shown to inhibit colorectal cancer cell lines <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Wu et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting cell- and context-dependent function of AQP8 in the regulation of cell migration. The role of Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 has also been recently investigated in the zebrafish. However, the authors did not report defects in EC migration but instead observed altered ISV diameter in Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 knockout and overexpression experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen et al., 2024</xref>). While we corroborate a decrease in the diameter of aISVs and vISVs in <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup></italic>and <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup>;aqp8a.1<sup>rk29/rk29</sup></italic> zebrafish, we observed a slight increase in the diameter in <italic>aqp8a.1<sup>rk29/rk29</sup></italic>zebrafish at 2 dpf (Fig. S11A). Furthermore, unlike described in Chen et al, we could not detect a difference in ISV diameter between control and Aqp1a.1- or Aqp8a.1-overexpressing ECs (Fig. S11B). The disparity in phenotypes observed between our groups are likely a result of differences in the <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> mutations and the level of Aqp1a.1 or Aqp8a. overexpression generated in our respective zebrafish lines.</p>
<p>A central determinant of water movement is the osmotic gradient across the membrane, with water flowing in the direction of higher osmotic concentration to build up hydrostatic pressure. Given a crucial role of water flow in regulating cell volume, shape and migration, it is also important to understand the function and distribution of ion channels, exchangers and transporters and water channels that generate an osmotic gradient across the cell. This is reflected in a growing number of studies demonstrating a role of ion transporters in cell migration. In neutrophils, the increase in cell volume and potentiation of cell migration depend on the sodium-proton exchanger 1 (NHE1) and the chloride-bicarbonate exchanger 2 (AE2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Nagy et al., 2023</xref>). In T cells, chemokine-induced migration depends on ion influx via SLC12A1, and water influx via AQP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Boer et al., 2023</xref>). In tumour cells migrating in narrow channels, the establishment of a polarized distribution of Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> pumps and Aquaporin proteins in cell membranes is required for net inflow of ions and water at the leading edge and net outflow at the trailing edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Stroka et al., 2014</xref>). Although our study identifies a function of Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 in facilitating water inflow, it remains unknown which ion channels and transporters control ion flux across the cell membrane to modulate water flow in tip cells. Results from our study suggest a role of SWELL1 in generating an osmotic gradient that controls EC migration, since its inhibition resulted in reduced membrane protrusions, slower tip cell migration and defective sprouting angiogenesis. Due to the limitations of our experimental approach, we do not know whether the effect of inhibiting SWELL1 function is cell autonomous or a consequence of altered chloride flux in the neighbouring cells that would alter tissue osmolarity. It also remains to be clarified where SWELL1 is localized within migrating ECs, how it regulates the osmotic gradient within the EC (cellular) and between the EC and the surrounding interstitial tissue (extracellular) to control the direction of water flow, and whether other ion channels also work in concert to modulate overall cellular and extracellular osmolarity to direct EC migration.</p>
<p>We have also observed enrichment of Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 proteins in specific compartments of ECs, at the leading edge of migrating endothelial tip cells as well as apical membranes during lumen formation (not shown). This leads to the question of how Aquaporin localization is regulated as this will determine the site of increased water inflow and hydrostatic pressure. It has been shown that rapid changes in subcellular localization of mammalian Aquaporins upon stimulation occurs mainly via trafficking to and from the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Markou et al., 2022</xref>) to modulate the amount of protein in the plasma membrane. The regulation of AQP subcellular relocalization via calmodulin- and/or phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms has been implicated for AQP0-5 and AQP7-9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Markou et al., 2022</xref>). For example, rapid translocation of AQP1 to plasma membrane upon a hypotonic stimulus is dependent on calmodulin activation and phosphorylation by protein kinases C (PKC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Conner et al., 2012</xref>) and subcellular localization of AQP8 in hepatocytes is also regulated by PKA and PI3K signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gradilone et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">2003</xref>). Further work is needed to elucidate the mechanism of Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 protein distribution in ECs.</p>
<p>In this study, we have assumed that Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 regulate EC behaviours through their ability to control water permeation based on previous studies demonstrating that water molecules flow through mammalian AQP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Preston et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Zeidel et al., 1992</xref>) and AQP8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Ma et al., 1997</xref>) as well as through zebrafish orthologs Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Tingaud-Sequeira et al., 2010</xref>). However, AQP1 and AQP8 are not water-specific channels. AQP1 can conduct unpolar gases such as carbon dioxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Nakhoul et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Prasad et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Wang et al., 2007</xref>) and nitric oxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Herrera et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Herrera and Garvin, 2007</xref>), and in zebrafish, Aqp1a.1 also mediates the transfer for small gaseous molecules such as carbon dioxide and ammonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Talbot et al., 2015</xref>). AQP8 is permeable to ammonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jahn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Liu et al., 2006</xref>) and is present in the inner mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Calamita et al., 2005</xref>), where it is suggested to mediate ammonia transport rather than water fluxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Soria et al., 2010</xref>). Nevertheless, because water movement flows up an osmotic gradient, increased entry of ions into the cell through Aquaporins will also trigger water inflow.</p>
<p>In summary, our study highlights the role of water influx and hydrostatic pressure as another force-generating mechanism utilized by cells to build tissues during animal development. We demonstrate that endothelial tip cells employ both actin polymerization and hydrostatic pressure for robust sprouting angiogenesis. As morphogenetic events are governed by a coordination of cell shape changes, cell migration and rearrangements, we envision that the shaping and formation of other tissues will also depend on Aquaporin function and changes in hydrostatic pressure.</p>

We adapted manufacture’s protocol designed for samples mounted on slides and protocol developed for whole-mount embryo samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gross-Thebing et al., 2014</xref>). For each experimental point, 5 embryos were processed in one 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube. Briefly, 20 and 22 hpf old embryos were manually dechorionated and fixed in freshly prepared 4% methanol-free PFA in PBS for 1 hour at room temperature. After fixation, embryos were washed three times in PBS containing 0.01% Tween-20 (PBST), dehydrated stepwise in 5-min washes in a series of increasing methanol concentrations (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) in PBS and then stored in 100% methanol at -20<sup>0</sup>C before use them for hybridization. The methanol-stored embryos were incubated with 5% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in methanol for 20 min at room temperature and then rehydrated stepwise in 5-min washes in series of decreasing methanol concentrations (75%, 50%, 25%) in PBS, followed by three times 5-min washes in PBST. Embryos were permeabilized in 2 drops of RNAscope<sup>®</sup> Protease III for 15 min, rinsed three times with PBST and hybridized with RNAscope target probes overnight at 50<sup>0</sup>C in water bath. After hybridization probes were recovered and embryos were washed three times with 0.2x SSCT [0.01% Tween-20 in SSC] at room temperature, re-fixed with 4% PFA for 10 min, and washed three times with 0.2x SSCT. For RNA detection, the embryos were first hybridized with three different amplifier solution for 30 min (Amp1, and Amp2) and 15 min (Amp3) in a water bath at 40<sup>0</sup>C. After each hybridization step, the embryos were washed three times with 0.2x SSCT for 10 min at room temperature. To develop signal of each probe, the embryos were sequentially incubated in a water bath at 40<sup>0</sup>C with: (i) the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for 15 min, (ii) TSA fluorophore for 30 min and (iii) the HRP blocker for 15 min.

<p>RNAscope processed embryos were mounted on slide and imaged using Olympus FV3000 confocal microscope and Olympus UPlanXApo 60x/NA 1.42 oil immersion objective. Maximum intensity projection of z-stacks was used to determine the level of cellular fluorescence in ImageJ. The tip and stalk cells were selected using freehand selection tool, “mean grey value”, “area” and “integrated density” in each ROI were measured first for channel 1 (aqp1a.1). A region next to cell that has no fluorescence was selected as background and measured. The step was repeated for channel 2 (aqp8a.1) on the same ROIs. Two parameters were calculated for each channel, (i) the corrected total cell fluorescence, CTCF=Integrated Density – (Area of selected cell x Mean fluorescence of background) and (ii) ratio, R=CTCF of tip cell/CTCF of stalk cell. We consider that if R &lt;0.9, expression is lower in tip cell, if R=0.9-1.1, expression is equal in tip and stalk cells, if R&gt;1.1, expression is higher in tip cell.</p>

Further analyses were performed using Seurat package (version 4.3.0) in R software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.r-project.org">https://www.r-project.org</ext-link>). The expression matrices were first filtered by keeping genes that are expressed in a minimum of 3 cells and cells that expressed a minimum of 200 genes for downstream analysis. The data were then normalized using NormalizeData function which normalizes the gene expression for each cell by the total expression counts (with a scale factor 10,000). To correct for batch effect between the data from the two-time points, the rpca method in the Seurat package was applied to integrate the data. The top 2000 variable genes identified using the vst method in FindVariableFeatures function were used for principal component analysis in RunPCA function, and the first 30 principal components were used for visualization analysis with Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) method, and in FindNeighbors function analysis.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The paper details a study of endothelial cell vessel formation during zebrafish development. The results focus on the role of aquaporins, which mediate the flow of water across the cell membrane, leading to cell movement.

Moreover, NHE1 can drive water intake because the export of H+ leads to increased HCO3 due to reaction between CO2+H2O, which increases the cytoplasmic osmolarity (see Li, Zhou and Sun, Frontiers in Cell Dev. Bio. 2021). If NHE cannot be easily perturbed in zebrafish, it might be of interest to perturb Cl channels such as SWELL1, which was recently shown to work together with NHE (see Zhang, et al, Nat.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Kondrychyn and colleagues describe the contribution of two Aquaporins Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 towards angiogenic sprouting in the zebrafish embryo. By whole-mount in situ hybridization, RNAscope and scRNA-seq, they show that both genes are expressed in endothelial cells in partly overlapping spatiotemporal patterns. Pharmacological inhibition experiments indicate a requirement for VEGR2 signaling (but not Notch) in transcriptional activation.</p>
<p>To assess the role of both genes during vascular development the authors generate genetic mutations. While homozygous single mutants appear normal, aqp1a.1;aqp8a.1 double mutants exhibit defects in EC sprouting and ISV formation.</p>
<p>At the cellular level, the aquaporin mutants display a reduction of filopodia in number and length. Furthermore, a reduction in cell volume is observed indicating a defect in water uptake.</p>
<p>The authors conclude, that polarized water uptake mediated by aquaporins is required for the initiation of endothelial sprouting and (tip) cell migration during ISV formation. They further propose that water influx increases hydrostatic pressure within the cells which may facilitate actin polymerization and formation membrane protrusions.</p>
<p>In the revised version of the manuscript the authors have added data which show that inhibition of swell-induced chloride channels mimics aqp mutant phenotypes, giving credence to the model that water influx via aquaporins is driven by an osmotic gradient.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors provide a detailed analysis of Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 during blood vessel formation in vivo, using zebrafish intersomitic vessels as a model. State-of-the-art imaging demonstrates an essential role aquaporins in different aspects of endothelial cell activation and migration during angiogenesis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>With respect to the connection between Aqp1/8 and actin polymerization/filopodia formation, the evidence appears preliminary and the authors' interpretation is guided by evidence from other experimental systems.</p>
<p>After revision, the authors have addressed all other concerns</p>

<p>We thank Reviewer #1 for this very important comment and the suggestion to examine the function of ion channels in establishing an osmotic gradient to drive directional flow. We have taken on board the reviewer’s suggestion and examined the expression of NHE1 and SWELL1 in endothelial cells using published scRNAseq of 24 hpf ECs (Gurung et al, 2022, Sci. Rep.). We found that <italic>slc9a1a, slc9a6a, slc9a7, slc9a8, lrrc8aa</italic> and <italic>lrrc8ab</italic> are expressed in different endothelial subtypes. To examine the function of NHE1 and SWELL1 in endothelial cell migration, we used the pharmacological compounds, 5-(N-ethyl-Nisopropyl)amiloride (EIPA) and DCPIB, respectively. While we were unable to observe an ISV phenotype after EIPA treatment at 5, 10 and 50µM, we were able to observe impaired ISV formation after DCPIB treatment that was very similar to that observed in Aquaporin mutants. We were very encouraged by these results and proceeded to perform more detailed experiments whose results have yielded a new figure (Figure 6) and are described and discussed in lines 266 to 289 and 396 to 407, respectively, in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>Thank you for pointing out the deficiency in explaining how osmotic gradients drive water flow to build up hydrostatic pressure. We have clarified this in lines 50, 53 - 54 and 385.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The two recommendations listed above would improve the paper. They are however not mandatory. The paper would be acceptable with some clarifying rewrites. I am not an expert on zebrafish genetics, so it might be difficult to perturb ion channels in this model organism. Have the authors tried to perturb ion channels in these cells?</p>

<p>We hope that our attempts at addressing Reviewer’s 1 comments are satisfactory and sufficient to clarify the concerns outlined.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Directional migration is an integral aspect of sprouting angiogenesis and requires a cell to change its shape and sense a chemotactic or growth factor stimulus. Kondrychyn I. et al. provide data that indicate a requirement for zebrafish aquaporins 1 and 8, in cellular water inflow and sprouting angiogenesis. Zebrafish mutants lacking aqp1a.1 and aqp8a.1 have significantly lower tip cell volume and migration velocity, which delays vascular development. Inhibition of actin formation and filopodia dynamics further aggravates this phenotype. The link between water inflow, hydrostatic pressure, and actin dynamics driving endothelial cell sprouting and migration during angiogenesis is highly novel.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The zebrafish genetics, microscopy imaging, and measurements performed are of very high quality. The study data and interpretations are very well-presented in this manuscript.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Some of the mechanobiology findings and interpretations could be strengthened by more advanced measurements and experimental manipulations. Also, a better comparison and integration of the authors' findings, with other previously published findings in mice and zebrafish would strengthen the paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank Reviewer #2 for the critique that the paper can be strengthened by more advanced measurements and experimental manipulations. One of the technical challenges that we face is how to visualize and measure water flow directly in the zebrafish. We have therefore taken indirect approaches to assess water abundance in endothelial cells in vivo. One approach was to measure the diffusion of GEM nanoparticles in tip cell cytoplasm in wildtype and Aquaporin mutants, but results were inconclusive. The second was to measure the volume of tip cells, which should reflect water in/outflow. As the second approach produced clear and robust differences between wildtype ECs, ECs lacking Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 and ECs overexpressing Aqp1a.1 (revised Fig. 5), we decided to present these data in this manuscript.</p>
<p>We have also taken Reviewer 2 advice to better incorporate previously published data in our discussion (see below and lines 374 to 383 of the revised manuscript).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>I have a few comments that the authors may address to further improve their manuscript analysis, quality, and impact.</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>(1) Citation and discussion of published literature</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The authors have failed to cite and discuss recently published results on the role of aqp1a.1 and aqp8a.1 in ISV formation and caliber in zebrafish (Chen C et al. Cardiovascular Research 2024). That study showed a similar impairment of ISV formation when aqp1a.1 is absent but demonstrated a stronger phenotype on ISV morphology in the absence of aqp8a.1 than the current manuscript by Kondrychyn I et al. Furthermore, Chen C et al show an overall decrease in ISV diameter in single aquaporin mutants suggesting that the cell volume of all ECs in an ISV is affected equally. Given this published data, are ISV diameters affected in single and double mutants in the current study by Kondrochyn I et al? An overall effect on ISVs would suggest that aquaporin-mediated cell volume changes are not an inherent feature of endothelial tip cells. The authors need to analyse/compare and discuss all differences and similarities of their findings to what has been published recently.</p>
<p>We apologise for having failed and discussed the recently published paper by Chen et al. This has been corrected and discussed in lines 374 to 383.</p>
<p>In the paper by Chen et al, the authors describe a role of Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 in regulating ISV diameter (ISV diameter was analysed at 48 hpf) but they did not examine the earlier stages of sprouting angiogenesis between 20 to 30 hpf, which is the focus of our study. We therefore cannot directly compare the ISV phenotypes with theirs. Nevertheless, we recognise that there are differences in ISV phenotypes from 2 dpf. For example, they did not observe incompletely formed or missing ISVs at 2 and 3 dpf, which we clearly observe in our study. This could be explained by differences in the mutations generated. In Chen et al., the sgRNA used targeted the end of exon 2 that resulted in the generation of a 169 amino acid truncated aqp1a.1 protein. However, in our approach, our sgRNA targeted exon 1 of the gene that resulted in a truncated aqp1a.1 protein that is 76 amino acid long. As for the <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> zebrafish mutant that we generated, our sgRNA targeted exon 1 of the gene that resulted in a truncated protein that is 73 amino acids long. In Chen et al., the authors did not generate an <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> mutant but instead used a crispant approach, which leads to genetic mosaicism and high experimental variability.</p>
<p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we have now measured the diameters of arterial ISVs (aISVs) and venous ISVs (vISVs) in <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, <italic>aqp8a.1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>;<italic>aqp8a.1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> zebrafish. In our lab, we always make a distinction between aISVs and vISVs are their diameters are significantly different from each other. The results are in Fig S11A. While we corroborate a decrease in diameter in both aISVs and vISVs in single <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and double <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>;<italic>aqp8a.1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>.zebrafish, we observed a slight increase in diameter in both aISVs and vISVs in <italic>aqp8a.1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> zebrafish at 2 dpf. We also measured the diameter of aISV and vISV in <italic>Tg(fli1ep:aqp1a.1-mEmerald)</italic> and <italic>Tg(fli1ep:aqp8a.1-mEmerald)</italic> zebrafish at 2 dpf (Fig S11B) and unlike in Chen et al., we could not detect a difference in the diameter between control and aqp1a.1- or aqp8a.1-overexpressing endothelial cells.</p>
<p>We also would also like to point out that, because ISVs are incompletely formed or are missing in <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>;<italic>aqp8a.1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> zebrafish (Fig. 3G – L), blood flow is most likely altered in the zebrafish trunk of these mutants, and this can have a secondary effect on blood vessel calibre or diameter. In fact, we often observed wider ISVs adjacent to unperfused ISVs (Fig. 3J) as more blood flow enters the lumenized ISV. Therefore, to determine the cell autonomous function of Aquaporin in mediating cell volume changes in vessel diameter regulation, one would need to perform cell transplantation experiments where we would measure the volume of single <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>;<italic>aqp8a.1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> endothelial cells in wildtype embryos with normal blood flow. As this is beyond the scope of the present study, we have not done this experiment during the revision process.</p>

<p>(2) Expression of aqp1a.1 and aqp8a.1</p>
<p>The quantification shown in Figure 1G shows a relative abundance of expression between tip and stalk cells. However, it seems aqp8a.1 is almost never detected in most tip cells. The authors could show in addition, the % of Tip and stalk cells with detectable expression of the 2 aquaporins. It seems aqp8a1 is really weakly or not expressed in the initial stages. Ofcourse the protein may have a different dynamic from the RNA.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to clarify that <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> mRNA is not detected in tip cells of newly formed ISVs at 20hpf. At 22 hpf, it is expressed in both tip cells (22 out of 23 tip cells analysed) and stalk cells of ISVs at 22hpf. This is clarified in lines 107 - 109. We also include below a graph showing that although <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> mRNA is expressed in tip cells, its expression is higher in stalk cells.</p>

<p>In our analysis of <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> homozygous zebrafish, there is a slight _down_regulation in <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> expression (Fig. S5C). Because the loss of Aqp1a.1 leads to a stronger impairment in ISV formation than the loss of Aqp8a.1 (see Fig. S6F, G, I and J), we believe that Aqp1a.1 has a stronger function than Aqp8a.1 in EC migration during sprouting angiogenesis.</p>

<p>The data presented suggest that tip cells overexpressing aqp1a.1-mEmerald (Figure 2C) need more than 6 times longer to migrate the same distance as tip cells expressing aqp8a.1mEmerald (Figure 2D). How does this compare with cells expressing only Emerald? A similar time difference can be seen in Movie S1 and Movie S2. Is it just a coincidence? Could aqp8a.1, when expressed at similar levels than aqp1a, be more functional and induce faster cell migration? These experiments were interpreted only for the localization of the proteins, but not for the potential role of the overexpressed proteins on function. Chen C et al. Cardiovascular Research 2024 also has some Aqp overexpression data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The still images prepared for Fig. 2 C and D were selected to illustrate the localization of Aqp1a.1-mEmerald and Aqp8a.1-mEmerald at the leading edge of migrating tip cells. We did not notice that the tip cell overexpressing Aqp1a.1-mEmerald (Figure 2C) needed more than 6 times longer to migrate the same distance as the tip cell expressing aqp8a.1-mEmerald (Figure 2D), which the reviewer astutely detected. To ascertain whether there is a difference in migration speed between Aqp1a.1-mEmerald and Aqp8a.1-mEmerald overexpressing endothelial cells, we measured tip cell migration velocity of three ISVs from <italic>Tg(fli1ep:aqp1a.1-mEmerald)</italic> and <italic>Tg(fli1ep:aqp8a.1-mEmerald)</italic> zebrafish during the period of ISV formation (24 to 29 hpf) using the Manual Tracking plugin in Fiji. As shown in the graph, there is no significant difference in the migration speed of ECs overexpressing Aqp1a.1-mEmerald and Aqp8a.1-mEmerald, suggesting that Aqp8a.1-overexpressing cells migrate at a similar rate as Aqp1a.1-overexpressing cells. As we have not generated a <italic>Tg(fli1ep:mEmerald)</italic> zebrafish line, we are unable to determine whether endothelial cells migrate faster in <italic>Tg(fli1ep:aqp1a.1mEmerald)</italic> and <italic>Tg(fli1ep:aqp8a.1-mEmerald)</italic> zebrafish compared to endothelial cell expressing only mEmerald. As for the observation that tip cells overexpressing aqp1a.1mEmerald (Figure 2C) need more than 6 times longer to migrate the same distance as tip cells expressing aqp8a.1-mEmerald, we can only surmise that it is coincidental that the images selected “showed” faster migration of one ISV from <italic>Tg(fli1ep:aqp8a.1-mEmerald)</italic> zebrafish. We do not know whether the Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 are overexpressed to the same levels in <italic>Tg(fli1ep:aqp1a.1mEmerald)</italic> and <italic>Tg(fli1ep:aqp8a.1-mEmerald)</italic> zebrafish.</p>
<p>We would also like to point out that when we analysed the lengths of ISVs at 28 hpf in <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> zebrafish, ISVs were shorter in <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> zebrafish compared to <italic>aqp8a.1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> zebrafish (Fig. S6 F to J). These results indicate that the loss of Aqp1a.1 function causes slower migration than the loss of aqp8a.1 function, and suggest that Aqp1a.1 induces faster endothelial cell migration that Aqp8a.1.</p>

<p>The data on Aqps expression after the Notch inhibitor DBZ seems unnecessary, and is at the moment not properly discussed. It is also against what is set in the field. aqp8a.1 levels seem to increase only 24h after DBZ, not at 6h, and still authors conclude that Notch activation inhibits aqp8a.1 expression (Line 138-139). In the field, Notch is considered to be more active in stalk cells, where aqp8a.1 expression seems higher (not lower). Maybe the analysis of tip vs stalk cell markers in the scRNAseq data, and their correlation with Hes1/Hey1/Hey2 and aqp1 vs aqp8 mRNA levels will be more clear than just showing qRT-PCR data after DBZ.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As our scRNAseq data did not include ECs from earlier during development when ISVs are developing, we have analysed of scRNAseq data of 24 hpf endothelial cells published by Gurung et al, 2022 in Scientific Reports during the revision of this manuscript. However, we are unable to detect separate clusters of tip and stalk cells. As such, we are unable to correlate <italic>hes1/hey1/hey2</italic> expression (which would be higher in stalk cells) with that of <italic>aqp1a.1/aqp8a.1</italic>.

<p>(3) Role of aqp1a.1 and aqp8a.1 on cytoplasmic volume changes and related phenotypes</p>
<p>In Figure 5 the authors show that Aqp1/Aqp8 mutant endothelial tip cells have a lower cytoplasmic volume than tip cells from wildtype fish. If aquaporin-mediated water inflow occurs locally at the leading edge of endothelial tip cells (Figure 2, line 314-318), why doesn't cytoplasmic volume expand specifically only at that location (as shown in immune cells by Boer et al. 2023)? Can the observed reduction in cytoplasmic volume simply be a side-effect of impaired filopodia formation (Figure 4F-I)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We believe that water influx not only expands filopodia but also the leading front of tip cells (see bracket region in Fig. 4D), where Aqp1a.1-mEmerald/Aqp8a.1-mEmerald accumulate (Fig. 2), to generate an elongated protrusion and forward expansion of the tip cell. The decrease in cytoplasmic volume observed in the <italic>aqp1a.1;aqp8a.1</italic> double mutant zebrafish is a result of decreased formation of these elongated protrusions at the leading front of migration tip cells as shown in Fig. 4E (compare to Fig. 4D), not from just a decrease in filopodia number. In fact, in the method used to quantify cell volume, mEmerald/EGFP localization is limited to the cytoplasm and does not label filopodia well (compare mEmerald/EGFP in green with membrane tagged-mCherry in Fig. 5A - C). The volume measured therefore reflects cytoplasmic volume of the tip cell, not filopodia volume.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Do the authors have data on cytoplasmic volume changes of endothelial tip cells in latrunculin B treated fish? The images in Figures 6 A,B suggest that there is a difference in cell volume upon lat b treatment only.</p>

<p>No, unfortunately we have not performed single cell labelling and measurement of tip cells in Latrunculin B-treated embryos. We can speculate that as there is a decrease in actindriven membrane protrusions in this experiment, one would also expect a decrease in cell volume as the reviewer has observed.</p>

<p>(5) Aquaporins and their role in EC proliferation</p>
<p>In the study by Phnk LK et al. 2013, the authors have shown that proliferation is not affected when actin polymerization or filopodia formation is inhibited. However, in the current manuscript by Kondrychyn I. et al. this has not been analysed carefully. In Movie S4 the authors indicate by arrows tip cells that fail to invade the zebrafish trunk demonstrating a severe defect of sprouting initiation in these mutants. Yet, when only looking at ISVs that reach the dorsal side in Movie S4, it appears that they are comprised of fewer EC nuclei/ISV than the ISVs in Movie S3. At the beginning of DLAV formation, most ISVs in control Movie S3 consist of 3-4 EC nuclei, while in double mutants Movie S4 it appears to be only 2-3 EC nuclei. At the end of the Movie S4, one ISV on the left side even appears to consist of only a single EC when touching the dorsal roof. The authors provide convincing data on how the absence of aquaporin channels affects sprouting initiation and migration speed, resulting in severe delay in ISV formation. However, the authors should also analyse EC proliferation, as it may also be affected in these mutants, and may also contribute to the observed phenotype. We know that effects on cell migration may indirectly change the number of cells and proliferation at the ISVs, but this has not been carefully analysed in this paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting the lack of information on EC number and division in the aquaporin mutants. We have now quantified EC number in ISVs that are fully formed (i.e. connecting the DA or PCV to the DLAV) at 2 and 3 dpf and the results are displayed in Figure S10A and B. At 2 dpf, there is a slight but significant reduction in EC number in both aISVs and vISVs in <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> zebrafish and an even greater reduction in the double aqp1a. <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>/-</sup></italic>;<italic>aqp8a.1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> zebrafish. No significant change in EC number was observed in <italic>aqp8a.1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> zebrafish. EC number was also significantly decreased at 3 dpf for <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, <italic>aqp8a.1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>;<italic>aqp8a.1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> zebrafish. The decreased in EC number per ISV may therefore contribute to the observed phenotype.</p>
<p>We have also quantified the number of cell divisions during sprouting angiogenesis (from 21 to 30 hpf) to assess whether the lack of Aquaporin function affects EC proliferation. This analysis shows that there is no significant difference in the number of mitotic events between <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>+/-</sup></italic>; <italic>aqp8a.1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> and <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>;<italic>aqp8a.1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> zebrafish (Figure S10 C), suggesting that the reduction in EC number is not caused by a decrease in EC proliferation.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Kondrychyn and colleagues describe the contribution of two Aquaporins Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 towards angiogenic sprouting in the zebrafish embryo. By whole-mount in situ hybridization, RNAscope, and scRNA-seq, they show that both genes are expressed in endothelial cells in partly overlapping spatiotemporal patterns. Pharmacological inhibition experiments indicate a requirement for VEGR2 signaling (but not Notch) in transcriptional activation.</p>
<p>To assess the role of both genes during vascular development the authors generate genetic mutations. While homozygous single mutants appear normal, aqp1a.1;aqp8a.1 double mutants exhibit defects in EC sprouting and ISV formation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>At the cellular level, the aquaporin mutants display a reduction of filopodia in number and length. Furthermore, a reduction in cell volume is observed indicating a defect in water uptake.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors conclude, that polarized water uptake mediated by aquaporins is required for the initiation of endothelial sprouting and (tip) cell migration during ISV formation. They further propose that water influx increases hydrostatic pressure within the cells which may facilitate actin polymerization and formation membrane protrusions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors provide a detailed analysis of Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 during blood vessel formation in vivo, using zebrafish intersomitic vessels as a model. State-of-the-art imaging demonstrates an essential role in aquaporins in different aspects of endothelial cell activation and migration during angiogenesis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>With respect to the connection between Aqp1/8 and actin polymerization/filopodia formation, the evidence appears preliminary and the authors' interpretation is guided by evidence from other experimental systems.</p>

<p>According to the authors' model anterior localization of Aqp1 protein is critical. The authors perform transient injections to mosaically express Aqp fusion proteins using an endothelial (fli1) promoter. For the interpretation, it would be helpful to also show the mCherry-CAAX channel in separate panels. From the images, it is not possible to discern how many cells we are looking at. In particular the movie in panel D may show two cells at the tip of the sprout. A marker labelling cell-cell junctions would help. Furthermore, the authors are using a strong exogenous promoter, thus potentially overexpressing the fusion protein, which may lead to mislocalization. For Aqp1a.1 an antibody has been published to work in zebrafish (e.g. Kwong et al., Plos1, 2013).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to clarify that we generated transgenic lines - <italic>Tg(fli1ep:aqp1a.1-mEmerald)</italic> and <italic>Tg(fli1ep:aqp8a.1-mEmerald)</italic> - to visualize the localization of Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 in endothelial cells, and the images displayed in Fig. 2 are from the transgenic lines (not transient, mosaic expression).</p>
<p>To aid visualization and interpretation, we have now added mCherry-CAAX only channel to accompany the Aqp1a.1/Aqp8a.1-mEmerald channel in Fig. 2A and B. To discern how many cells there are in the ISVs at this stage, we have crossed <italic>Tg(fli1ep:aqp1a.1-mEmerald)</italic> and <italic>Tg(fli1ep:aqp8a.1-mEmerald)</italic> zebrafish to <italic>TgKI(tjp1a-tdTomato)<sup>pd1224</sup></italic> (Levic et al., 2021) to visualize ZO1 at cell-cell junction. However, because tjp1-tdTomato is expressed in all cell types including the skin that lies just above the ISV and the signal in ECs in ISVs is very weak at 22 to 25 hpf, it was very difficult to obtain good quality images that can properly delineate cell boundaries to determine the number of cells in the ISVs at this early stage. Instead, we have annotated endothelial cell boundaries based on more intense mCherryCAAX fluorescence at cell-cell borders, and from the mosaic expression of mCherryCAAX that is intrinsic to the  <italic>Tg(kdrl:ras-mCherry)<sup>s916</sup></italic> zebrafish line.</p>
<p>In Fig. 2D, there are two endothelial cells in the ISV during the period shown but there is only 1 cell occupying the tip cell position i.e. there is one tip cell in this ISV. Unlike the mouse retina where it has been demonstrated that two endothelial cells can occupy the tip cell position side-by-side (Pelton et al., 2014), this is usually not observed in zebrafish ISVs. This is demonstrated in Movie S3, where it is clear that one nucleus (belonging to the tip cell) occupies the tip of the growing ISV. The accumulation of intracellular membranes is often observed in tip cells that may serve as a reservoir of membranes for the generation of membrane protrusions at the leading edge of tip cells.</p>
<p>We agree that by generating transgenic <italic>Tg(fli1ep:aqp1a.1-mEmerald)</italic> and <italic>Tg(fli1ep:aqp8a.1mEmerald)</italic> zebrafish, Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 are overexpressed that may affect their localization. The eel anti-Aqp1a.1 antibody used in (Kwong et la., 2013) was a gift from Dr. Gordon Cramb, Univ. of St Andrews, Scotland and it was first published in 2001. This antibody is not available commercially. Instead, we have tried to several other antibodies against AQP1 (Alpha Diagnostic International , AQP11-A; ThermoFisher Scientific, MA120214; Alomone Labs, AQP-001) and AQP8 (Sigma Aldrich, SAB 1403559; Alpha Diagnostic International, AQP81-A; Almone Labs, AQP-008) but unfortunately none worked. As such, we cannot compare localization of Aqp1a.1-mEmerald and Aqp8a.1-mEmerald with the endogenous proteins.</p>

<p>No, the <italic>Tg(fli1:Lifeact-mCherry)</italic> line is not mosaic. The “missing” vessels are not because of mosaicism in transgene but because of truncated ISVs that is a phenotype of loss Aquaporin function. We have changed the magenta channel to grey and hope that by doing so, the reviewer will be able to see the shape of the blood vessels more clearly. We would like to leave the contralateral side in the images, as it shows that the defective vessel is only on one side of body. Furthermore, when we tried to remove it (reducing the number of Z-stacks) neighbour ISV looks incomplete because the embryos were not mounted flat. To clarify what the nucleus between the sprout and the DLAV is, we have indicated that it is that of the contralateral ISV.</p>

<p>L: I do not quite understand the significance of the different classes of phenotypes. Do the authors propose different morphogenetic events or contexts of how these differences come about?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Here, we report the different types of ISV phenotypes that we observe in 3 dpf <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>; <italic>aqp8a.1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> zebrafish (Fig. 3 and Fig. S7). As demonstrated in Fig. 4, most of the phenotypes can be explained by the delayed emergence of tip cells from the dorsal aorta and slower tip cell migration. However, in some instances, we also observed retraction of tip cells (Movie S4) and failure of tip cells to emerge from the dorsal aorta or endothelial cell death (see attached figure on page 14), which can give rise to the Class II phenotype. In the dominant class I phenotype (in contrast to class II), secondary sprouting from the posterior cardinal vein is unaffected, and the secondary sprout migrates dorsally passing the level of horizontal myoseptum but cannot complete the formation of vISV (it stops beneath the spinal cord). The Class III phenotype appears to result from a failure of the secondary sprout to fuse with the regressed primary ISV. In the Class IV phenotype, the ventral EC does not maintain a connection to the dorsal aorta. We did not examine how Class III and IV phenotypes arise in detail in this current study.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Based on previous studies (Loitto et al.; Papadopoulus et al.) the authors propose that also in ISVs aquaporin-mediated water influx may promote actin polymerization and thereby filopodia formation. However, while the effect on filopodia number and length is well demonstrated, the underlying cause is less clear. For example, filopodia formation could be affected by reduced cell polarization. This can be tested by using a transgenic golgi marker (Kwon et al., 2016).</p>
