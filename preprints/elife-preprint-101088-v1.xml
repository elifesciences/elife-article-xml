<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Polarization is crucial for the proper functioning of epithelial cells. Early polarization features include the trafficking and enrichment of polarity molecules to form the apical membrane (AM) or cell-cell junctions, as well as the apical positioning of the centrosome. However, the dependencies among polarity molecules, AM formation, and centrosome positioning remain poorly understood. In conventional Matrigel-cultured epithelial cells, <italic>de novo</italic> polarization can occur when a single cell divides. At the exit of mitosis, centrosomes move to the location where the apical membrane will form, raising the question of the role of the centrosome in epithelial polarization. We perturb centrosomes and polarity regulators in Matrigel-cultured cells and also manipulate polarity direction in non-conventional culture to examine the relationship between polarity features. Surprisingly, the centrosome is not essential for AM formation but promotes formation efficiency. The polarity regulator Par3, rather than the trafficking of AM components, affects centrosome positioning. In non-conventional cultures, the centrosome migration is opposite to that of the AM direction, and Par3 exhibits a different pattern from Matrigel culture. Taken together, our work shows that polarity indicated by centrosome position is not universal and elucidates the upstream-downstream relationship between centrosome positioning and other polarization features, providing insights into epithelial polarization.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cell polarity refers to spatial asymmetry in the shape, organization, and function of a cell. The development of cell polarity is a fundamental process in developmental and physiological biology, and aberrations in cell polarization can contribute to various developmental disorders and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hakanen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Halaoui &amp; McCaffrey, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Murdoch et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Royer &amp; Lu, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Schneeberger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Wilson, 2011</xref>). Although polarizations in different cell types present in different morphologies, they share evolutionarily conserved machinery components that mediate these processes. For example, the partitioning defective (PAR) complexes, Crumbs complexes, and Scribble complexes are known to be asymmetrically occupied in different cellular compartments to regulate cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Goldstein &amp; Macara, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Iden &amp; Collard, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">St Johnston &amp; Ahringer, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, the centrosome is always located at a specific position, resulting in the centrosome–nucleus axis aligning with the polarization axis, which may be crucial for various types of polarized cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Burakov &amp; Nadezhdina, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Tang &amp; Marshall, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The centrosome is a distinct organelle in cells, composed of a centriole pair surrounded by a multi-protein cloud called pericentriolar material (PCM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Conduit et al., 2015</xref>). The centrioles in the pair exhibit structural and functional asymmetry based on their generation, with the older, fully mature mother centriole carrying characteristic subdistal appendages (SDAs) and distal appendages (DAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bornens, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gomes Pereira et al., 2021</xref>). The SDAs anchor microtubules to the mother centriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Tateishi et al., 2013</xref>), while the DAs allow the mother centriole to dock to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Tanos et al., 2013</xref>). The PCM comprises hundreds of proteins, including the scaffold protein pericentrin (PCNT) and the γ-tubulin ring complex, which are required for microtubule nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Zimmerman et al., 2004</xref>). Because of its strong ability to nucleate microtubules, the centrosome functions as the primary microtubule organizing center and is considered to play a crucial role in regulating cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bornens, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">de Anda et al., 2005</xref>). Laser ablation of the pericentrosomal region alters the polarized cell shape and affects cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Wakida et al., 2010</xref>). Light inactivation or depletion of centrosomal proteins disrupts axon formation and neuronal migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">de Anda et al., 2010</xref>). Depletion of Par3 and dynein indirectly interferes with centrosome positioning and causes polarity defects in migrating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Schmoranzer et al., 2009</xref>). However, researchers have reported contradictory results in some cases. For instance, axons continue to grow when the centrosome in rodent hippocampal neurons is disrupted via laser ablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Stiess et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, the treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with centrinone, an inhibitor of centriole duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Wong et al., 2015</xref>), to deplete centrosomes does not affect the polarization of endothelial sprouting or cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Martin et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, the exact role of the centrosome in cell polarity requires further clarification.</p>
<p>In polarized epithelial cells, the centrosome is localized at the apical region during interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Buckley &amp; St Johnston, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Ching et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Rodriguez-Boulan &amp; Macara, 2014</xref>), which contributes to the construction of an asymmetric microtubule network conducive to polarized vesicle trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Feldman &amp; Priess, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Meiring et al., 2020</xref>). Establishing apical-basal polarity in epithelial cells requires the correct intracellular transportation of different polarity molecules to distinct domains of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jewett &amp; Prekeris, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Mellman &amp; Nelson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Roman-Fernandez &amp; Bryant, 2016</xref>). These processes have been extensively studied using <italic>in vitro</italic> three-dimensional (3D) cultures of vertebrate epithelial cells, such as Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells seeded in the extracellular matrix (ECM), which spontaneously form polarized cysts with central lumens to mimic tubular structures <italic>in vivo</italic>. According to this model, previous studies have found that the orientation of apical-basal polarity depends on ECM-mediated signaling. In suspended culture without ECM or inhibition of ECM protein laminin, its receptor β1-integrin, or downstream signaling molecule small GTPase Rac1, polarity reversal occurs, leading to failure in lumen formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">O’Brien et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Yu et al., 2005</xref>). Both integrin and Rac1 are necessary for laminin accumulation around the cyst and for inhibiting the RhoA-ROCK-mediated actomyosin on the basal side, which then enables the internalization of apical membrane proteins from the basolateral membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bryant et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Yu et al., 2008</xref>). Following ECM signaling, the well-known apical membrane marker Gp135 (also known as podocalyxin) begins to be internalized from the cell membrane into Rab11a-positive recycling endosomes when cells aggregate together or when a single cell undergoes cell division. These Gp135-positive vesicles containing Crumbs3 (Crb3) and Cdc42 are then delivered and tethered to the cell-cell contact site or cytokinesis site. Accumulation of these apical determinants forms the apical membrane initiation site (AMIS). Expansion of the apical membrane from the AMIS, combined with fluid pumping, generates a single lumen at the center of MDCK cysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bryant et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Galvez-Santisteban et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Klinkert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Mangan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Schluter et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Although numerous reports have been on the molecular networks involved in the <italic>de novo</italic> generation of the apical membrane and lumen, the sequential recruitment of apical determinants and the relative timing of centrosome positioning remain poorly characterized. The differences between cell-aggregation-derived polarization and cell-division-derived polarization are still critical in this field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Liang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Rathbun et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, the role of apical migration of centrosomes in epithelial polarization remains unclear. Interestingly, previous studies have demonstrated that centrosomes can move toward the cytokinesis bridge during the late stages of cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jonsdottir et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Krishnan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Piel et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, it is worthwhile to understand the coupling between the apical migration of centrosomes and cytokinesis.</p>
<p>In this work, we employed three major polarity indicators: (1) apical membrane protein recruitment, defined by Gp135 accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Meder et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Yu et al., 2007</xref>), (2) centrosome positioning, defined by the angles and relative distance between the nucleus and centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Burute et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Rodriguez-Fraticelli et al., 2012</xref>), and (3) organization of polarity regulators such as Par3, which controls tight junction assembly to partition the apical surface from the basolateral surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen &amp; Macara, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Horikoshi et al., 2009</xref>). Here, we elucidate the detailed coupling between these polarity indicators during cytokinesis-induced <italic>de novo</italic> epithelial polarization in Matrigel and other cell culture conditions, which allow us to impose different polarity states. Our findings indicate that cytokinesis-induced centrosome positioning promotes epithelial polarization. The tight-junction-localized component Par3 is considered the upstream regulator of centrosome positioning and polarized vesicle trafficking. The trafficking of apical membrane components is downstream of centrosome positioning. The position of the centrosome is not sensitive to the disruption of individual centrosome components. Migrating centrosomes promote Gp135 accumulation during <italic>de novo</italic> epithelial polarization. Our study clarifies the relationship between different polarity indicators and the role of the centrosome in epithelial polarization.</p>

<p>To capture the centrosome position and the distribution of Gp135 vesicles, we performed immunostaining at several stages in the transition from a single MDCK cell to a two-cell cyst. As a single non-polarized MDCK cell is embedded into Matrigel, most Gp135 proteins cluster around the interphase centrosome (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, i</xref>) and strongly co-localize with the Rab11a-labeled recycling endosomes (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). During mitosis, the Gp135 proteins are well dispersed in the cytosol at metaphase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, ii</xref>), weakly cluster near the centrosomes in early telophase (Telo, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, iii</xref>), and gradually accumulate at the centrosomes from late telophase to the stage of cytokinetic bridge pre-abscission (pre-Abs) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, iii-iv</xref>), when the acetyl-tubulin-labeled cytokinesis bridge condenses significantly. Cytokinesis in most animal cells begins in the middle point of anaphase and ends shortly after the completion of mitosis in telophase. Cytokinetic abscission leads to the physical cut of the cytokinetic bridge connecting the daughter cells and concludes cell division. After cytokinetic bridge abscission (post-cytokinesis), the Gp135-positive vesicles are transported to the middle membrane region, which will form the AMIS between the two daughter cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, v</xref>). Subsequently, exocytosis continues to expand the apical membrane and produces a lumen structure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, vi</xref>). The relative Gp135 signals near the centrosome regions of different stages show a clear maximum at the cytokinetic pre-abscission stage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A–C</xref>). Notably, before bridge abscission, we detected a stronger signal of Gp135-positive vesicles surrounding the centrosomes compared to the cytosol and cytokinetic bridge (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A–B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">D</xref>).</p>

<p>We quantify the degree of polarization by the centrosome positions using the following quantities. The center point between two nuclei is set as the origin (O), representing the cyst center. The polarity index is defined as the nucleus (N)–centrosome (C) distance, <italic>L<sub>N-C</sub></italic>, normalized by the average nuclear radius, <italic>r<sub>N</sub></italic>. In addition, the nucleus–centrosome orientation (<italic>θ<sub>N-C</sub>,</italic> the angle between the N-C and N-N axes) characterizes the movement of the centrosome (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, see Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Burute et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Rodriguez-Fraticelli et al., 2012</xref>). Compared to the non-polarized 1-cell stage, the polarity index gradually increases from the cytokinetic pre-abscission to the post-cytokinesis stage, reaching the highest level during the lumen-open (LO) stage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). A high <italic>θ<sub>N-C</sub></italic> value indicates that the centrosomes are located at the outside of two nuclei, which also corresponds to a larger <italic>L</italic><sub>O-C</sub> (origin–centrosome distance) and <italic>L<sub>IC</sub></italic> (inter-centrosomal distance) (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>). From telophase to post-cytokinesis, centrosomes move from outside to the inside of two nuclei, and thus <italic>θ<sub>N-C</sub></italic> decreases (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>).</p>
<p>Because recycling endosomes play a crucial role in trafficking apical membrane components such as Gp135, we examined other apical membrane components such as Crb3, Cdc42, and aPKC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bryant et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Klinkert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Schluter et al., 2009</xref>). We found that aPKC appears to diffuse in the cytoplasm during the M phase and concentrates at the AMIS only after cytokinesis (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). This result may be due to a lower aPKC concentration, contributing to a weak immunostaining signal. Nevertheless, the signals of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-Crb3 and EGFP-Cdc42 in MDCK cells exhibited similar patterns near the centrosome during cytokinetic pre-abscission and were transported to the AMIS from the centrosome in the post-cytokinesis stage, identical to Gp135 (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, our data suggest that the centrosome acts as a hub of apical recycling endosomes and centrosome migration during cytokinetic pre-abscission before apical membrane components are targeted to the AMIS. Thus, the center migration of centrosomes may facilitate the trafficking of apical recycling endosomes to the AMIS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>).</p>

<title>Centrosomes exhibit robust migration toward the center of two daughter cells after anaphase onset before Gp135 targeting the AMIS</title>
<p>To precisely define the hierarchy of centrosome migration, apical membrane formation, and apical-basal polarity establishment, we performed live cell imaging using MDCK cells that expressed fluorescently labeled centrosome protein, PACT-mKO1 (the PACT domain is a conserved centrosomal targeting motif of PCNT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gillingham &amp; Munro, 2000</xref>), and apical membrane protein, EGFP-Gp135, cultured in Matrigel. The onset of anaphase is set as 0:00 (h: min). Consistent with our fixation data, live cell imaging showed that EGFP-Gp135-positive vesicles did not surround PACT-labeled centrosomes during metaphase. When cleavage furrow ingression occurred, EGFP-Gp135-positive vesicles were recruited to a region surrounding the centrosome (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, 0:10). The movement of these EGFP-Gp135-positive vesicles followed the same path as centrosome migration (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, 0:20–0:40), with the vesicles finally fusing to the middle membrane of the cell doublet (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, 0:55).

<p>These results suggest that centrosomes migrate toward the center of the cell doublet during the initial 30 min following the onset of anaphase, followed by a stable phase with reduced movement. Intriguingly, we observed this type of centrosome movement only in 3D culture cells embedded in Matrigel. In contrast, in adherent two-dimensional (2D) culture cells grown on a cover glass, the centrosomes exhibited random migration patterns (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate the temporal process of apical membrane formation, we measured the intensity profile of EGFP-Gp135 along the line connecting the two nuclei; we took the central value as an indicator of the amount of Gp135 on the AMIS (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>, white arrows). The intensity continually increased after the onset of anaphase (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, the EGFP-Gp135 signal at the middle membrane of the cell doublet increased significantly after 30 min from the onset of anaphase, coinciding with a reduced movement of the centrosomes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C, D</xref>). These findings are consistent with our immunostaining results, indicating that centrosome migration precedes the targeting of Gp135 to the AMIS.</p>

<title>Centrosomes influence the efficiency of early polarization but are not essential for late-stage lumen formation</title>
<p>To investigate the role of centrosomes in guiding Gp135-labeled vesicle trafficking for polarization, we depleted centrosomes in MDCK cells by applying centrinone, a reversible inhibitor of PLK4 kinase for centriole duplication in vertebrate cells. Centrinone treatment effectively blocked centriole duplication in MDCK cells and progressively depleted centriole numbers during cell cycle progression (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>).

<p>Previous studies have reported that a loss of centrosomes in cells activates p53, followed by activation of p21, which causes cell cycle arrest in non-transformed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lambrus et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Meitinger et al., 2016</xref>). However, cell division is required in our experimental setup to initiate epithelial polarization. To overcome the problem of cell cycle arrest, we generated a p53 knockout (KO) line of MDCK cells using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 editing system (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). We found that the MDCK cells carry normal p53 activity and exhibit increased p21 protein levels after centrinone treatment (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E, F</xref>). As expected, the p53-KO MDCK cells do not induce p21 and continue proliferating after centrosome depletion (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Compared with wild-type (WT) cells, the p53-KO cells show no difference in polarity index, <italic>θ<sub>N-C</sub></italic>, or <italic>L</italic><sub>O-C</sub> during <italic>de novo</italic> polarization (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A–C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>), indicating that the loss of p53 does not interfere with centrosome movement.</p>
<p>Next, we treated the p53-KO MDCK cells with centrinone for three days, seeded them into Matrigel, and observed them by live cell imaging (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Our results showed that, in the absence of centrosomes, EGFP-Gp135 did not cluster in the cytoplasm at any time points (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), and the accumulation of EGFP-Gp135 at the middle membrane was significantly reduced (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A, D</xref>). Together, our time-lapse imaging and centrosome depletion studies suggest that centrosome depletion causes a reduction in Gp135 accumulation at the apical site due to a lack of Gp135 near the centrosome during cytokinesis. We then performed immunostaining, which supported our live cell imaging observations (<xref rid="fig3s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>).</p>
<p>We extended the observation time to 48 and 72 hours and found that more than 60% of centrosome-depleted p53-KO cells, which overcome the proliferation arrest, form cysts with a central lumen (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E, F</xref>). For both WT and p53-KO cells, the percentage of single-lumen cysts is higher than centrosome-depleted p53-KO cells at 24 hours, but the differences decrease over time (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E, F</xref>). However, the cell heights of the centrosome-depleted cysts are less uniform, and the Gp135 levels at the apical region remained lower than those of the controls (WT and p53-KO) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). Although p53-KO can overcome cell cycle arrest after centrosome depletion, its cell proliferation rate is still reduced (<xref rid="fig3s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). We, therefore, compared the percentage of lumen formation in two-cell stage cysts to eliminate the effect of proliferation variation. 24 hours after seeding in Matrigel, more than 50% of WT and p53-KO two-cell cysts formed a single central lumen. In contrast, only 30% of centrinone-treated p53-KO two-cell cysts exhibited a single central lumen (<xref rid="fig3s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Taken together, our data suggest that centrosome depletion primarily affects the early steps of epithelial polarization but not the later steps of lumen formation.</p>

These findings suggest that the timing of centrosome migration was not delayed in KO cells in which the SDA, DA, or PCM components of the centrosomes were individually disrupted. This observation may be attributed to the compensatory nature of microtubule anchoring and nucleation on centrosomes, which involve various molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gavilan et al., 2018</xref>).

<p>We next create inverted cysts by culturing suspended single cells in low-adhesion microwells (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Yu et al., 2005</xref>); in these conditions, the normal cell cycle progresses, but cells exhibit an inverted Gp135 polarity from cells in Matrigel culture. Immunostaining shows that Par3 proteins form a ring at the edge of the cell-cell interface (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>), distinct from the Par3 patch observed at the center of the cell-cell interface for cells in Matrigel (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1H</xref>).</p>
<p>Before and at the onset of anaphase (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>, −0:15–0:00), the centrosomes form two spindle poles at two sides of the nuclei. At this time point, there is a dispersed Gp135 signal inside the cytoplasm. When cleavage furrow ingression occurs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>, 0:05–0:20), Gp135 is concentrated at the furrow membrane between the two daughter cells. As cytokinesis progresses, Gp135 dissociates from the middle membrane and becomes concentrated around the migrating centrosomes and external membranes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>, 0:30, white and yellow arrows). While Gp135 spreads toward the outside membrane, the centrosomes migrate toward the center of the cell doublets (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>, 0:40–1:05, and H-J). Finally, Gp135 is concentrated at the membranes, corresponding to locations where cells are not in contact, and forms a polarization opposite to that of cysts in Matrigel. Taken together, our results identify an interesting condition in which the polarity indicated by the centrosome and nucleus is opposite to the apical-basal polarity. In this case, cytokinesis drives centrosome migration toward the center of the cell doublets, even in the absence of ECM and under conditions of inverted polarity.</p>
<p>Finally, we investigated the movement of centrosomes at the cytokinetic pre-abscission stage in highly polarized cysts (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and in an epithelial sheet (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D-E</xref>), of which both have apical-localized cytokinetic bridges. Both live cell imaging and immunostaining show that centrosomes are laterally localized at the mid-plane of the apical-basal axis in telophase cells and move apically during the cytokinetic pre-abscission stage (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6— figure supplement 1C–E</xref>). Like the <italic>de novo</italic> epithelial polarization, we found that centrosomes move toward the AMIS direction before bridge abscission (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C–F</xref>). Taken together, these findings indicate that the centrosome position is strongly associated with the cytokinesis site but not with the apical membrane.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Because the vector from the nucleus to the centrosome is often observed aligning with the axis of other polarization markers in various cells, the centrosome has long been hypothesized to play a crucial role in regulating cell polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bornens, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Burakov &amp; Nadezhdina, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Tang &amp; Marshall, 2012</xref>). Based on the significant movement of centrosomes during polarization derived from cell division, as well as the dependence of polarity molecules and apical membrane location on culture conditions, we designed a series of experiments to test the role of the centrosome. Our findings, which highlight the correlation between centrosome positioning and cell polarization, as well as the impact of altered centrosome function on the distribution of polarity markers, are summarized in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>.</p>

<caption><p>Summary of centrosome migration, apical membrane component trafficking, and Par3 recruitment in different experiments and culture conditions</p>
<p>(A) In conventional Matrigel culture, centrosomes move directionally toward AMIS following cell division (magenta arrow). Apical membrane components like Gp135, Crb3, and Cdc42 follow the centrosomes (green arrow). Par3 first emerges at the cytokinesis site, which regulates centrosome positioning and polarized vesicle trafficking during polarization.</p>
<p>(B) Loss of centrosomes diminishes the effectiveness of apical membrane component trafficking (smaller green arrow), yet Par3 still localizes to the cytokinetic bridge. Additionally, centrosome loss mainly impacts the initial stages of epithelial polarization rather than the later stages of lumen formation.</p>
<p>(C) Loss of Par3 results in randomized centrosome positioning, obstructs polarized trafficking, and traps apical membrane components around mislocalized centrosomes.</p>
<p>(D) Two-cell aggregates without cell division cannot effectively guide centrosome migration and polarized vesicle trafficking. Despite Par3 being recruited to the cell-cell interface, apical membrane components remain trapped around mislocalized centrosomes.</p>
<p>(E) MDCK cells suspended in the ECM-free condition. Centrosomes migrate to the center of cell doublets during cytokinesis (magenta arrow), while Apical membrane components transport in the opposite direction (green arrow). After mitosis, Par3 exhibits a pattern distinct from that observed in Matrigel culture.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>In Matrigel culture, where <italic>de novo</italic> epithelial polarity develops, our findings show that apical membrane components, including Gp135, Crb3, and Cdc42, accumulate around the centrosomes and follow the rapidly moving centrosomes to the AMIS during cytokinesis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Par3 first appears at the cytokinetic bridge, earlier than the positioning of the centrosome and the targeting of apical membrane components (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 — figure supplement 1H</xref>). The aligned direction of centrosome positioning, apical membrane protein trafficking, and Par3 localization significantly enhance the efficiency of polarization (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). The centrosome depletion experiments indicate that the loss of centrosomes still allows the formation of AMIS and lumen structures (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5F</xref>), similar to their dispensable role in cell division or spindle microtubule formation. Under p53-KO conditions, centrosome-depleted MDCK cells can form cysts with a single central lumen at a slower rate. However, due to decreased trafficking efficiency, the protein levels on the apical membrane are reduced (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). Previous studies have debated the role of centrosomes in various types of cell polarization. We determine that while the centrosome is not essential, it has a synergistic effect on apical membrane establishment.</p>
<p>Among all our experiments involving molecular perturbations to elucidate relationships between different polarity features, we have discovered that Par3 plays a pivotal role in upstream signaling during cytokinesis-induced polarization, which affects centrosome positioning and polarized trafficking (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). Par3 has been reported to regulate centrosome position through interaction with dynein in migrating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Schmoranzer et al., 2009</xref>) and functions as an exocyst receptor in epithelial cells, mediating the targeting of delivered proteins to specific domains of the plasma membrane through interaction with Sec8 and Exo70, two exocyst components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ahmed &amp; Macara, 2017</xref>). Depletion of Par3 leads to membrane proteins and Rab11a residing in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ahmed &amp; Macara, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Horikoshi et al., 2009</xref>). Consistent with these findings, we found that Rab11a-positive vesicles sometimes pause during delivery and become trapped around mislocalized centrosomes in Par3-depleted MDCK cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> and <xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Taken together, our findings support the concept that Par3 participates in centrosome positioning and mediates the transportation of proteins on the Rab11a-positive endosomes to AMIS during cytokinesis-induced polarization. Cultured conditions influence cellular polarization preferences. When cells aggregate in Matrigel, we observe recruitment of Par3 to the cell-cell interface, despite the absence of a division site to specify its location. However, both centrosome positioning and Gp135 transport are disrupted (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-E</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7D</xref>). It is necessary to determine the differences in the function of Par3 between cell aggregates and during cytokinesis, such as whether it also interacts with dynein and exocysts in these cell aggregates.</p>
<p>When MDCK cells are suspended in ECM-free conditions, they form inverted cysts after division, with Gp135 facing outward, while Par3 forms a ring at the edge of the cell-cell contact surface (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F-J</xref>). Intriguingly, the vector from the nucleus to the centrosome is opposite from the direction of the apical membrane (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). Notably, we found that centrosomes do not constantly localize near the apical surface. These diverse cultured conditions help us dissect the process of epithelial polarization and the relationships between different polarity indicators. During epithelial polarization, centrosome positioning, apical membrane component trafficking, and the recruitment of the polarity regulator Par3 appear to be executed through distinct mechanisms. It is known that apical membrane components undergo endocytosis and are transported by the Rab11a cascade to target in the opposite direction of the ECM contact side. However, the mechanisms for centrosome positioning and Par3 recruitment remain unclear. Based on our experimental observations, certain events during cytokinesis may promote Par3 recruitment and trigger centrosome migration. In conventional Matrigel cultures, these mechanisms align in the same direction, thereby synergizing and enhancing the efficiency of epithelial polarization.</p>
<p>We also explored the possibility of affecting the apical positioning of centrosomes by disrupting centrosomal components, such as the appendage structures and PCM proteins that link centrosomes to microtubules (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), as microtubules are believed to generate pulling or pushing forces to aid in centrosome positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hooikaas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kapitein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Yi et al., 2013</xref>). We found that individually disrupting centrosomal components does not affect centrosome positioning. Therefore, we hypothesize that either the connections between microtubules and centrosomes are very robust or the additional mechanisms play a role in centrosome positioning. For instance, recent studies have proposed that motor proteins transport centrosomes along microtubules as cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hannaford et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hannaford &amp; Rusan, 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>Although our investigation primarily focused on the 3D culture of epithelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, the insights gleaned from this study may have implications for understanding polarity establishment in various epithelial-like tissues <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>3D cell culture in Matrigel and drug treatment</title>
<p>MDCK (NBL-2) cells (Bioresource Collection and Research Center, Taiwan) were tested for mycoplasma, cultured in minimum essential medium (MEM) with glucose, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum, and supplemented with 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids and 1 mM sodium pyruvate, penicillin, and streptomycin. We conducted 3D cell culture assays for cyst formation using a previously described method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Martin-Belmonte et al., 2007</xref>). We trypsinized 70% of confluent cells to a single cell suspension of 4 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/mL in complete MEM containing 2% growth factor reduced Matrigel (356231, Corning, Glendale, AZ). We plated cells in 2% Matrigel medium (300 μL) in 8-well cover-glass chamber slides (80827, ibidi, Gräfelfing, Germany) pre-coated with 8 μL of 100% Matrigel. The cells were incubated for the indicated period, and the medium was changed every 2 days.</p>
<p>For the centrosome depletion assay, we pre-treated MDCK WT and p53-KO cells with 300 nM centrinone (LCR-263, HY-18682, MedChemExpress, Monmouth Junction, NJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Wong et al., 2015</xref>) for 3 days on a petri dish to achieve &gt;80% of cells without centrosomes. The centrosome-depleted cells were then trypsinized to a single-cell suspension and plated into a 3D culture in the continuous presence of 300 nM centrinone.</p>
<p>To assess cell aggregates, we treated MDCK cells with aphidicolin (Aphi) for 15 hours, arresting almost all cells in the S phase. Subsequently, we released these synchronized cells from the S phase and simultaneously cultured them in Matrigel. Based on past experience, MDCK cells require approximately 8 hours to progress from the S phase to the M phase. Therefore, we observed cell doublets at 6 hours after release to ensure that these cell doublets were formed through aggregation rather than cell division.</p>

<p>Cells were sterile-sorted by a cell sorter (FACSJazz, BD Biosciences) for GFP. Fluorescence-positive cells were serially diluted to pick single colonies and were expanded to pure clones. Genomic DNAs isolated from each clone were subjected to PCR and sequencing for verification. We examined protein expression levels in each clone via immunofluorescence microscopy or western blotting.</p>

<title>3D live cell imaging in ECM-free conditions</title>
<p>Following a previously published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Huang et al., 2020</xref>), we generated multiarray spherical microwells for an ECM-free suspension culture. In brief, 100 μL polyacrylamide (PA) solution containing 7% acrylamide monomer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), 0.35% bisacrylamide crosslinker (Bio-Rad), 0.15% N, N, N’, N’-tetramethylethylenediamine catalyst (Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.5% ammonium persulfate (Sigma-Aldrich) was sandwiched between an epoxy mold and 3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate silanized cover glass (22 × 22 mm). Waiting for the complete gelation of PA, we carefully separated the cover-glass-bound microwell substrate from the epoxy template. To avoid cell adhesion, we conjugated poly-L-lysine/polyethylene glycol to the PA substrate using the bi-functional crosslinker sulfo-SANPAH (ThermoFisher Scientific). We sterilized low-attachment microwell substrates with antibiotics and then seeded a single-cell suspension of MDCK stable lines onto the substrate surface. After cells fell into the microwells, we rinsed the PA substrate with the culture medium to remove excess cells outside the microwells. The samples were assembled into a rose chamber and imaged by a CSU22 spinning disk confocal microscope, as described above, for 3D live cell imaging in Matrigel.</p>

<title>Transwell-cultured 2D epithelial sheet</title>
<p>To grow polarized epithelial cell monolayers suitable for observation under an inverted microscope, we cultured MDCK cells on the outer surface of Transwell inserts (3470, Corning). Typically, 50 μL of a suspension containing 4.25 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL was seeded into each 6.5-mm Transwell insert. Cells were cultured for 3 days before immunofluorescence staining or live cell imaging. We mounted Transwell inserts in a custom-made glass-bottom chamber for confocal imaging. For live cell imaging, we stained epithelial cell monolayers with SiR-tubulin (500 nM, SC002, Spirochrome) and monitored the cells using LSM 980 confocal microscopy (Zeiss).</p>

<p>Wang et al's study addresses an <bold>important</bold> critical gap in our understanding of de novo epithelial polarization using MDCK cell doublets surrounded by ECM, providing <bold>convincing</bold> evidence through imaging and depletion studies on the role of conserved polarity proteins and the centrosome during this process. While the authors propose a clear hierarchical model, there is a need for further exploration of how microtubule organization contributes to this process. Specifically, live cell imaging of microtubules under mutants and their included ECM conditions, along with a more precise temporal mapping of microtubule dynamics in relation to proteins like Gp135, would strengthen the study's conclusions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Wang, Po-Kai, et al., utilized the de novo polarization of MDCK cells cultured in Matrigel to assess the interdependence between polarity protein localization, centrosome positioning, and apical membrane formation. They show that the inhibition of Plk4 with Centrinone does not prevent apical membrane formation, but does result in its delay, a phenotype the authors attribute to the loss of centrosomes due to the inhibition of centriole duplication. However, the targeted mutagenesis of specific centrosome proteins implicated in the positioning of centrosomes in other cell types (CEP164, ODF2, PCNT, and CEP120) did not affect centrosome positioning in 3D cultured MDCK cells. A screen of proteins previously implicated in MDCK polarization revealed that the polarity protein Par-3 was upstream of centrosome positioning, similar to other cell types.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The investigation into the temporal requirement and interdependence of previously proposed regulators of cell polarization and lumen formation is valuable to the community. Wang et al., have provided a detailed analysis of many of these components at defined stages of polarity establishment. Furthermore, the generation of PCNT, p53, ODF2, Cep120, and Cep164 knockout MDCK cell lines is likely valuable to the community.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Additional quantifications would highly improve this manuscript, for example it is unclear whether the centrosome perturbation affects gamma tubulin levels and therefore microtubule nucleation, it is also not clear how they affect the localization of the trafficking machinery/polarity proteins. For example, in Figure 4, the authors measure the intensity of Gp134 at the apical membrane initiation site following cytokinesis, but there is no measure of Gp134 at the centrosome prior to this.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors decoupled several players that are thought to contribute to the establishment of epithelial polarity and determined their causal relationship. This provides a new picture of the respective roles of junctional proteins (Par3), the centrosome, and endomembrane compartments (Cdc42, Rab11, Gp135) from upstream to downstream.</p>
<p>
Their conclusions are based on live imaging of all players during the early steps of polarity establishment and on the knock-down of their expression in the simplest ever model of epithelial polarity: a cell doublet surrounded by ECM.</p>
<p>The position of the centrosome is often taken as a readout for the orientation of the cell polarity axis. There is a long-standing debate about the actual role of the centrosome in the establishment of this polarity axis. Here, using a minimal model of epithelial polarization, a doublet of daugthers MDCK cultured in Matrigel, the authors made several key observations that bring new light to our understanding of a mechanism that has been studied for many years without being fully explained:</p>
<p>(1) They showed that centriole can reach their polarized position without most of their microtubule-anchoring structures. These observations challenge the standard model according to which centrosomes are moved by the production and transmission of forces along microtubules.</p>
<p>(2) (However) they showed that epithelial polarity can be established in the absence of centriole.</p>
<p>(3) (Somehow more expectedly) they also showed that epithelial polarity can't be established in the absence of Par3.</p>
<p>(4) They found that most other polarity players that are transported through the cytoplasm in lipid vesicles, and finally fused to the basal or apical pole of epithelial cells, are moved along an axis which is defined by the position of centrosome and orientation of microtubules.</p>
<p>(5) Surprisingly, two non-daughters cells that were brought in contact (for 6h) could partially polarize by recruiting a few Par3 molecules but not the other polarity markers.</p>
<p>(6) Even more surprisingly, in the absence of ECM, Par 3 and centrosomes could move to their proper position close to the intercellular junction after cytokinesis but other polarity markers (at least GP135) localized to the opposite, non-adhesive, side. So the polarity of the centrosome-microtubule network could be dissociated from the localisation of GP135 (which was believed to be transported along this network).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The simplicity and reproducibility of the system allow a very quantitative description of cell polarity and protein localisation.</p>
<p>(2) The experiments are quite straightforward, well-executed, and properly analyzed.</p>
<p>(3) The writing is clear and conclusions are convincing.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The simplicity of the system may not capture some of the mechanisms involved in the establishment of cell polarity in more physiological conditions (fluid flow, electrical potential, ion gradients,...).</p>
<p>(2) The absence of centriole in centrinone-treated cells might not prevent the coalescence of centrosomal protein in a kind of MTOC which might still orient microtubules and intracellular traffic. How are microtubules organized in the absence of centriole? If they still form a radial array, the absence of a centriole at the center of it somehow does not conflict with classical views in the field.</p>
<p>(3) The mechanism is still far from clear and this study shines some light on our lack of understanding. Basic and key questions remain:</p>
<p>
a) How is the centrosome moved toward the Par3-rich pole? This is particularly difficult to answer if the mechanism does not imply the anchoring of MTs to the centriole or PCM.</p>
<p>
b) What happens during cytokinesis that organises Par3 and intercellular junction in a way that can't be achieved by simply bringing two cells together? In larger epithelia cells have neighbours that are not daughters, still, they can form tight junctions with Par3 which participates in the establishment of cell polarity as much as those that are closer to the cytokinetic bridge (as judged by the overall cell symmetry). Is the protocol of cell aggregation fully capturing the interaction mechanism of non-daughter cells?</p>

<p>Here, Wang et al. aim to clarify the role of the centrosome and conserved polarity regulators in apical membrane formation during the polarization of MDCK cells cultured in 3D. Through well-presented and rigorous studies, the authors focused on the emergence of polarity as a single MDCK cell divided in 3D culture to form a two-cell cyst with a nascent lumen. Focusing on these very initial stages, rather than in later large cyst formation as in most studies, is a real strength of this study. The authors found that conserved polarity regulators Gp135/podocalyxin, Crb3, Cdc42, and the recycling endosome component Rab11a all localize to the centrosome before localizing to the apical membrane initiation site (AMIS) following cytokinesis. This protein relocalization was concomitant with a repositioning of centrosomes towards the AMIS. In contrast, Par3, aPKC, and the junctional components E-cadherin and ZO1 localize directly to the AMIS without first localizing to the centrosome. Based on the timing of the localization of these proteins, these observational studies suggested that Par3 is upstream of centrosome repositioning towards the AMIS and that the centrosome might be required for delivery of apical/luminal proteins to the AMIS.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, the authors generated numerous new cell lines and/or employed pharmacological inhibitors to determine the hierarchy of localization among these components. They found that removal of the centrosome via centrinone treatment severely delayed and weakened the delivery of Gp135 to the AMIS and single lumen formation, although normal lumenogenesis was apparently rescued with time. This effect was not due to the presence of CEP164, ODF2, CEP120, or Pericentrin. Par3 depletion perturbed the repositioning of the centrosome towards the AMIS and the relocalization of the Gp135 and Rab11 to the AMIS, causing these proteins to get stuck at the centrosome. Finally, the authors culture the MDCK cells in several ways (forced aggregation and ECM depleted) to try and further uncouple localization of the pertinent components, finding that Par3 can localize to the cell-cell interface in the absence of cell division. Par3 localized to the edge of the cell-cell contacts in the absence of ECM and this localization was not sufficient to orient the centrosomes to this site, indicating the importance of other factors in centrosome recruitment.</p>
<p>Together, these data suggest a model where Par3 positions the centrosome at the AMIS and is required for the efficient transfer of more downstream polarity determinants (Gp135 and Rab11) to the apical membrane from the centrosome. The authors present solid and compelling data and are well-positioned to directly test this model with their existing system and tools. In particular, one obvious mechanism here is that centrosome-based microtubules help to efficiently direct the transport of molecules required to reinforce polarity and/or promote lumenogenesis. This model is not really explored by the authors except by Pericentrin and subdistal appendage depletion and the authors do not test whether these perturbations affect centrosomal microtubules. Exploring the role of microtubules in this process could considerably add to the mechanisms presented here. In its current state, this paper is a careful observation of the events of MCDK polarization and will fill a knowledge gap in this field. However, the mechanism could be significantly bolstered with existing tools, thereby elevating our understanding of how polarity emerges in this system.</p>
