<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Membrane potential plays a crucial role in various cellular functions. However, existing techniques for measuring membrane potential are often invasive or have limited recording depth. In contrast, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers noninvasive imaging with desirable spatial resolution over large areas. This study investigates the feasibility of utilizing MRI to detect responses of cultured cells and <italic>in vivo</italic> rat cortex to membrane potential-modulating ionic solutions by measuring magnetic resonance parameters. Our findings reveal that depolarizing (or hyperpolarizing) ionic solutions increase (or decrease) the <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> relaxation time, while the ratio of bound to free water proton shows the opposite trend. These findings also suggest a potential approach to noninvasively detect changes in membrane potential using MRI.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Membrane potential is a fundamental property of all living cells, influencing crucial cell functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> such as neuronal and myocyte excitability, volume control, cell proliferation, and secretion. In the fields of neuroscience, membrane potential is of significant importance, as neural activities arise from the dynamic propagation of this electric potential. From a clinical perspective, deviations from normal membrane potential levels contribute to various diseases, including seizures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, arrhythmia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, and hypoglycemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Given its scientific and clinical importance, effective methods to detect changes in membrane potential have long been sought.</p>
<p>The intracellular recording technique using sharp glass electrodes is a commonly used method to detect changes in membrane potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. It provides real-time absolute recordings of membrane potential. Optical imaging is another major approach to detect changes in membrane potential. Voltage-sensitive dyes enable voltage imaging at the cellular level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Fluorescent calcium indicators detect calcium transients associated with neuronal activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Label-free optical imaging techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> utilize various contrast mechanisms such as cell membrane deformation, which are directly coupled with changes in membrane potential. Despite their efficacy, these methods have limitations when applied to intact biological systems due to their invasive nature, requiring procedures such as craniotomy.</p>
<p>As noninvasive techniques for directly or indirectly detecting brain activation <italic>in vivo</italic>, several imaging modalities have been developed, including electroencephalography (EEG)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, magnetoencephalography (MEG)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. EEG and MEG detect electric potentials on the scalp and extracranial magnetic fields, respectively, which are directly induced by neuronal activity in the brain. Although these techniques are noninvasive and provide excellent temporal resolution of milliseconds or less, they are constrained by shallow imaging depth and spatial localization challenges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In contrast, MRI enables noninvasive imaging with good spatial resolution of millimeters over a large brain volume, making it an appropriate tool for <italic>in vivo</italic> functional brain imaging. To date, the mainstream of functional MRI (fMRI) utilizes hemodynamic responses driven by brain activation, such as the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. However, while the BOLD contrast mechanism reflects dynamic changes in neuronal activity through neurovascular coupling, it provides inherently indirect and relatively slow, hemodynamic-responsive information of brain function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. On the other hand, many studies have attempted to explore the possibility of using MRI to directly detect neuronal activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. These studies utilized neuronal current-dependent signal phase shifts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> and magnitude decay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, the Lorentz effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, high temporal resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, ghost artifacts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, or cell swelling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, while concerns about sensitivity exist<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated the possibility of using MRI to detect membrane potential changes induced by modulating ionic solutions. Specifically, we explored how <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> relaxation time and magnetization transfer (MT) correlate with membrane potential changes, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo. In vitro</italic> experiments utilized two homogeneous and electrically non-active cells, i.e., neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) and leukemia (Jurkat) cell lines, providing a controlled environment free from hemodynamic effects. This aided in accurately evaluating changes in MR parameters with membrane potential. <italic>In vivo</italic> experiments, conducted on a rat model with a craniotomy-exposed cortex, aimed to reproduce the <italic>in vitro</italic> findings.</p>

<title><italic>In vitro</italic> changes in MR parameters induced by membrane potential</title>
<p>A non-excitable neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y, was selected to investigate the relationship between MR parameters and membrane potential modulated by ionic solutions. After culturing SH-SY5Y cells, they were suspended in extracellular media with various potassium ion concentrations ([K<sup>+</sup>]), while maintaining constant osmolarity by adjusting [Na<sup>+</sup>]. As the control condition, [K<sup>+</sup>] = 4.2 mM was selected. For depolarization conditions, [K<sup>+</sup>] = 20, 40, and 80 mM were used. For hyperpolarization conditions, [K<sup>+</sup>] = 0.2 and 1 mM were used. The suspended cells were concentrated with centrifugation in an acrylic container and scanned in a 9.4 T preclinical MRI system. The imaging slice was positioned 0.5 mm below the pellet-extracellular media interface to ensure that signals were acquired from cell pellet. Under each condition, <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> and MT parameters such as pool size ratio (PSR) and magnetization transfer rate (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>mf</italic></sub>) were measured (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The PSR value represents the ratio of hydrogen protons in macromolecules and free water, and <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>mf</italic></sub> represents the magnetization transfer rate of hydrogen protons from macromolecules to free water. In addition, the membrane potential of SH-SY5Y cells in each condition was separately measured via patch clamp recording.</p>

Conversely, during hyperpolarization induced by the lowest [K<sup>+</sup>] (0.2 mM, Î<italic>V</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> = â5.33 mV), <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> decreased by 4.40% (Î<italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> = â2.21 ms, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and PSR increased by 6.28% (ÎPSR = 0.00231, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0005). However, changes in <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>mf</italic></sub> were not significant across all conditions (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). These findings from <italic>in vitro</italic> SH-SY5Y cell experiments suggest that MR parameters, such as <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> and PSR, exhibit sufficient sensitivity to detect alterations in membrane potential induced by varying [K<sup>+</sup>], including both depolarization and hyperpolarization.</p>

<title>Using a K<sup>+</sup> channel blocker</title>
<p>In this experiment, we investigated whether depolarization induced by altering potassium permeability with barium ions (Ba<sup>2+</sup>) would affect MR parameters similarly to depolarization induced by varying [K<sup>+</sup>], thereby further validating our findings. For this purpose, we administered barium ions (Ba<sup>2+</sup>) at a concentration of 10 mM to induce depolarization while maintaining constant osmolarity by adjusting [Na<sup>+</sup>]. Ba<sup>2+</sup> was chosen because it inhibits several types of two-pore-domain potassium channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, which predominantly regulate the resting membrane potential. Previous studies have confirmed that Ba<sup>2+</sup> depolarizes the membrane potential in SH-SY5Y and Jurkat cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The Ba<sup>2+</sup>-induced depolarization condition was compared with K<sup>+</sup>-induced depolarization and hyperpolarization conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). To compare the effects of [Ba<sup>2+</sup>] and [K<sup>+</sup>] on MR parameters, a linear mixed-effect model was utilized. This model included MR parameters as dependent variables, Î<italic>V</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> and its interaction with a group variable (indicating whether Î<italic>V</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> was induced by [Ba<sup>2+</sup>] or [K<sup>+</sup>]) as fixed effects, and cell batch as a random effect. This analysis revealed no significant interactions for all MR parameters assessed (<italic>p</italic> = 0.182 for <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.788 for PSR, and <italic>p</italic> = 0.0890 for <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>mf</italic></sub>). These findings suggest that changes in <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> and PSR by membrane potential do not depend on the specific method of altering the membrane potential, whether by varying [K<sup>+</sup>] or applying [Ba<sup>2+</sup>]. This implies that if the changes in MR parameters observed with varying [K<sup>+</sup>] were not primarily due to membrane potential but were due to unique K<sup>+</sup>-related mechanism, then experiments using [Ba<sup>2+</sup>] would not result in similar changes.</p>

<title>Using another cell type</title>
<p>To investigate whether membrane potential-modulating ionic solutions produce similar changes in MR parameters across different cell types, we assessed another cell line, Jurkat, under the same experimental conditions applied to SH-SY5Y cells. These conditions included a control condition ([K<sup>+</sup>] = 4.2 mM), hyperpolarization under decreased [K<sup>+</sup>] conditions ([K<sup>+</sup>] = 0.2 and 1 mM), depolarization under increased [K<sup>+</sup>] conditions ([K<sup>+</sup>] = 20, 40, and 80 mM), and a Ba<sup>2+</sup>-induced depolarization condition ([Ba<sup>2+</sup>] = 10 mM), all maintaining consistent osmolarity by adjusting [Na<sup>+</sup>].</p>
<p>Each experimental condition was compared to the control using Dunnettâs test to account for multiple comparisons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). As observed with SH-SY5Y cells, Jurkat cells showed significant positive changes in <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> and negative changes in PSR under increased [K<sup>+</sup>] conditions. For example, at [K<sup>+</sup>] = 80 mM, <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> increased by 16.9% (Î<italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> = 9.26 ms, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), PSR decreased by 21.9% (ÎPSR = â0.00347, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). In contrast, during hyperpolarization at the lowest [K<sup>+</sup>] = 0.2 mM, <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> decreased by 18.1% (Î<italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> = â9.93 ms, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), whereas PSR increased by 17.6% (ÎPSR = 0.00280, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The depolarization induced by [Ba<sup>2+</sup>] = 10 mM resulted in a similar pattern, with <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> increasing by 11.5% (Î<italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> = 6.3 ms, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0005), although the decrease in PSR was not significant (ÎPSR = â0.00212, <italic>p</italic> = 0.211). Changes in <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>mf</italic></sub> remained non-significant across all conditions (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). In summary, these findings indicate that detecting membrane potential changes induced by ionic solutions using MR parameters such as <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> and PSR is not specific to a single cell type, although the magnitude of these changes may differ between cell types.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we demonstrated that MR parameters, specifically <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> relaxation time and pool size ratio (PSR), can detect responses to membrane potential changes modulated by ionic solutions. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments with cultured cells were designed to exclude physiological factors such as hemodynamic responses and respiration. We observed that depolarization increases <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> and decreases PSR, while hyperpolarization has the opposite effect. <italic>In vivo</italic>, we pharmacologically suppressed hemodynamic responses to minimize their impact on <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> measurements. The trend of <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> dependence on membrane potential <italic>in vivo</italic> was consistent with <italic>in vitro</italic> findings. However, the magnitude of <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> changes in rat cortex was approximately one-ninth of that observed in SH-SY5Y cells <italic>in vitro</italic> at [K<sup>+</sup>] = 80 mM.</p>
<p>Other studies have also reported MR-detectable changes in response to extracellular [K<sup>+</sup>] modulation. For instance, research on spreading depression, which was induced by significantly high [K<sup>+</sup>] (â¼1 M) applied topically to rat cortex, has revealed detectable changes in <italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub>, and magnetization transfer ratio changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>; and spin-lock fMRI signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Similarly, increased [K<sup>+</sup>] has been studied <italic>in vitro</italic> with brain slices, linking cell volume changes to proton density-weighted MR signal changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> mapping in Jurkat cells with increased [K+] conditions has also been investigated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> and linked to cell volume change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Our study complements these findings by employing direct membrane potential measurement via patch clamp, testing additional ionic agents such as Ba<sup>2+</sup>, and demonstrating the phenomenon <italic>in vivo</italic>. Further reinforcement of these findings could be achieved by simultaneous recording of cell volume and other cellular characteristics to elucidate the underlying mechanisms more completely.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the MR responses in Jurkat cells differed from those in SH-SY5Y cells. While SH-SY5Y cells showed a near-linear dependence of MR parameters on log [K<sup>+</sup>], Jurkat cells displayed more step-like behavior. The reasons for this discrepancy remain unclear, but it suggests that the relationship between membrane potential and MR parameters may not strictly follow a simple log [K+] relationship.</p>
<p>Several factors may contribute to discrepancies between <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> results. For instance, the actual extracellular [K<sup>+</sup>] experienced by cells in the rat cortex may be lower than that of the perfused aCSF due to diffusion-limiting barriers such as the leptomeninges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>, even after the removal of the dura mater. Additionally, removal of excessive K<sup>+</sup> by clearing mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> may further reduce the [K<sup>+</sup>] experienced by the cells. Partial volume effects and cell type differences may also contribute to the discrepancy.</p>
<p>From a biophysical perspective, the sensitivity of <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> and PSR to membrane potential likely arises from alterations in cell volume, hydration water, and bulk water. Depolarization or hyperpolarization can lead to cell swelling or shrinking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>, influencing the proportion of cellular contents within the imaging voxel and thereby affecting MR parameters. Notably, neuronal or glial cell swelling has been proposed as a possible mechanism underlying diffusion fMRI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> and previous MRI studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Although not as sensitive as <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub>, our supplementary <italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub> measurements (Supplementary Fig. S2â4) also exhibited similar trends in response to membrane potential changes. Moreover, hydration water, which has a significantly shorter <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> than bulk water due to slower re-orientational and diffusive motions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>, may contribute to the observed MR changes. In particular, the correlation between PSR and membrane potential indicates that depolarization decreases the density of hydration water on the cell membrane within a voxel, thereby reducing PSR and simultaneously increasing <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> due to a corresponding increase in free water, as well as cell swelling. Conversely, hyperpolarization may increase hydration water density, elevating PSR and lowering <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub>. These interpretations are supported by recent optical studies showing reduced membrane hydration water during depolarization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Several challenges and considerations in this study warrants discussion. First, maintaining the desired environment (37Â°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) for <italic>in vitro</italic> cells during MRI scans is challenging. In addition, intracellular accumulation of Ba<sup>2+</sup> in the Ba<sup>2+</sup>-induced depolarization experiment may affect cellular integrity. In this study, high cell viability (&gt; 97.6%) was confirmed using cell viability assays under experimental conditions (Supplementary Fig. S5). Second, differences in <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> value among the extracellular media may bias <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> measurements due to the partial volume effect. However, in this study, the differences in <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> among the extracellular media were found to be negligible compared to the observed <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> changes (Supplementary Fig. S6). Third, while our findings show that membrane potential-modulating ionic solutions can affect MR parameters, it is important to note that these changes do not measure the membrane potential itself. Fourth, other factors such as pH, energy depletion, or extracellular osmolarity may affect MR parameters by altering cell volume. To minimize the effects of these other contributors, we matched osmolarity across all conditions, provided sufficient glucose to prevent energy depletion, and regulated pH levels by buffering with HEPES. Additionally, to mitigate possible changes in intra/extracellular volume fraction changes caused by cell movements, potentially due to agitation, we centrifuged the cells and imaged the bottom portion of the cell pellet, where cell movement was restricted due to close packing. Fifth, in the <italic>in vivo</italic> study, we attempted to suppress hemodynamic responses through pharmacological means, using a combination of N<sub>Ï</sub>-Nitro-L-arginine and nifedipine, both of which are known to inhibit hemodynamic responses in different ways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>, but their effects were not directly confirmed in this study. Future studies that simultaneously evaluate hemodynamic responses would strengthen our conclusions. Finally, our experimental paradigm was based on clamping the membrane potential at a specific level, thus measuring changes in <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> and PSR during static depolarization or hyperpolarization rather than dynamic changes such as those seen during action potentials. Future research could explore temporally varying membrane potential to evaluate the dynamic correlation between membrane potential and MR parameters with high temporal resolution MRI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In summary, our study demonstrates that MR parameters such as <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> relaxation time can detect responses to membrane potential-modulating ionic solutions both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. This finding proposes a potential approach for noninvasively detecting changes in membrane potential using MRI.</p>

<p>For the <italic>in vivo</italic> MR images acquired with a MESE sequence, echo trains were matched with a simulated dictionary of decay curves of multi-echo spin-echo signals created with the stimulated echo and slice profile correction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup> to estimate <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> values. For the <italic>in vitro</italic> one-dimensional MR images acquired with the SESE sequence, signals were fitted to a mono-exponential function to estimate <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> values. For the <italic>in vitro</italic> one-dimensional MR images acquired with the IR-MESE sequence, signals were fitted to a bi-exponential function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup> to estimate MT parameters. 16 spin echoes acquired after each TI were averaged to improve SNR. The MT parameters such as PSR and <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>mf</italic></sub> were derived from this fitting process. The detailed procedure for calculating <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> and two MT parameters (i.e., PSR and <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>mf</italic></sub>) is provided in Supplementary Methods S1.1.</p>

<title>Patch clamp recordings</title>
<p>The membrane potential of SH-SY5Y cells was recorded at room temperature using the whole-cell mode of the patch clamp technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. The bath solution was the same as the extracellular medium used in the MRI experiment and was constantly perfused at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The composition of the pipette solution was as follows: KCl = 140 mM; NaCl = 5 mM; MgCl2 = 3 mM; HEPES = 10 mM; Mg-ATP = 1 mM; Na-GTP = 0.5 mM. The pH of the pipette solution was adjusted to 7.4 using KOH. Calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) were not included in the pipette solution to minimize Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent currents. The resistance of the electrode was 3â5 MÎ© with the internal solution filled. Recordings were performed with a patch amplifier (Axopatch-1D; Axon Instruments) and a current clamp was also used to monitor the membrane potential. The experiment was repeated three times, with cells replaced at each repetition.</p>

<p>The authors show MRI relaxation time changes that are claimed to originate from cell membrane potential changes. This would be a substantial contribution if true because it may provide a mechanism whereby membrane potential changes could be inferred noninvasively. However, the membrane potential manipulations applied here are performed on a slow time scale and are known to induce cell swelling. Cell swelling has been previously shown to affect relaxation time. Experiments could be performed to rule out this hypothesis, but the authors have chosen not to perform these experiments. The study is therefore <bold>useful</bold>, but the evidence is <bold>incomplete</bold>.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper examines changes in relaxation time (T1 and T2) and magnetization transfer parameters that occur in a model system and in vivo when cells or tissue are depolarized using an equimolar extracellular solution with different concentrations of the depolarizing ion K+. The motivation has been revised to state that the results suggest a potential approach to non-invasively detect changes in membrane potential using MRI.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors argue that the use of various concentrations of KCL in the extracellular fluid depolarize or hyperpolarize the cell pellets used, and that this change in membrane potential is the driving force for the T2 (and T1-supplementary material) changes observed. In particular, they report an increase in T2 with increasing KCL concentration in the extracellular fluid (ECF) of pellets of SH-SY5Y cells. To offset the increasing osmolarity of the ECF due to the increase in KCL, the NaCL molarity of the ECF is proportionally reduced. The authors measure the intracellular voltage using patch clamp recordings, which is a gold standard. With 80 mM of KCL in the ECF, a change in T2 of the cell pellets of ~10 ms is observed with the intracellular potential recorded as about -6 mv. A very large T1 increase of ~90 ms is reported under the same conditions. The PSR (ratio of hydrogen protons on macromolecules to free water) decreases by about 10% at this 80 mM KCL concentration. Similar results are seen in a Jurkat cell line and similar, but far smaller changes are observed in vivo, for a variety of reasons discussed. As a final control, T1 and T2 values are measured in the various equimolar KCL solutions. As expected, no significant changes in T1 and T2 of the ECF were observed for these concentrations.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the concepts presented are interesting, and the actual experimental methods seem to be nicely executed, the conclusions are not supported by the data for a number of reasons. This is not to say that the data isn't consistent with the conclusions, but there are other controls not included that would be necessary to draw the conclusion that it is membrane potential that is driving these T1 and T2 changes. The results are consistent with Stroman et al. Magn. Reson. in Med. 59:700-706 (increased T2 with KCL) as well as some other cited work. However all those authors emphasize that cell swelling is the mechanism, not cell membrane potentials.</p>
<p>It is well established that cells swell/shrink upon depolarization/hyperpolarization. Cell swelling is accompanied by increased light transmittance in vivo, and this should be true in the pellet system as well. In a beautiful series of experiments, Stroman et al. (2008) showed in perfused brain slices that the cells swell upon equimolar KCL depolarization and the light transmittance increases. The time course of these changes is quite slow, of the order of many minutes, both for the T2-weighted MRI signal and for the light transmittance. Stroman et al. also show that hypoosmotic changes produce the exact same timecourse as the KCL depolarization changes (and vice versa for the hyperosmotic changes - which cause cell shrinkage). Their conclusion therefore, was that cell swelling (not membrane potential) was the cause of the T2-weighted changes observed, and that these were relatively slow (on the scale of many minutes).</p>
<p>What are the implications for the current study? Well, for one, the authors cannot exclude cell swelling as the mechanism for T2 changes, as they have not measured that. It is however well established that cell swelling occurs during depolarization, so this is not in question. Water in the pelletized cells is in slow/intermediate exchange with the ECF, and the solutions for the two compartment relaxation model for this are well established (see Menon and Allen, Magn. Reson. in Med. 20:214-227 (1991). The T2 relaxation times should be multiexponential (see point (3) further below). The current work cannot exclude cell swelling as the mechanism for T2 changes (it is mentioned in the paper, but not dealt with). Water entering cells dilutes the protein structures, changes rotational correlation times of the proteins in the cell and is known to increase T2. The PSR confirms that this is indeed happening, so the data in this work is completely consistent with the Stroman work and completely consistent with cell swelling associated with depolarization. The authors should have performed light scattering studies to demonstrate the degree cell swelling or shrinkage. Measuring intracellular potential is not enough to clarify the mechanism.</p>
<p>So why does it matter whether the mechanism is cell swelling or membrane potential? The reason is response time. Cell swelling due to depolarization is a slow process, slower than hemodynamic responses that characterize BOLD. And in fact, cell swelling under normal homeostatic conditions in vivo is virtually non-existent. Only sustained depolarization events typically associated with non-naturalistic stimuli or brain dysfunction produce cell swelling. Membrane potential changes associated with neural activity, on the other hand, are very fast. In this manuscript, the authors have convincingly shown a signal change that is virtually the same as what was seem in the Stroman publication, but they have not shown that there is a response that can be detected with anything approaching the timescale of an action potential. So one cannot definitely say that the changes observed are due to membrane potential. One can only say they are consistent with cell swelling, regardless of what causes the cell swelling. The First line of the discussion still claims that T2 relaxation time and pool size ratio (PSR) can detect responses to membrane potential changes modulated by ionic solutions. However, in the absence of cell swelling controls, this cannot be stated.</p>
<p>For this mechanism to be relevant to measuring neuronal activity directly or explaining techniques such DIANA, one needs to show that the cell swelling changes occur within a millisecond, which has never been reported. If one knows the populations of ECF and pellet, the T2s of the ECF and pellet and the volume change of the cells in the pellet, one can model any expected T2 changes due to neuronal activity. I think one would find that these are minuscule within the context of an action potential, or even bulk action potentials.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The manuscript is well written and my previous methodological concerns have been clarified as well. There are no flaws in the experiments, but the interpretation really depends on simultaneous measurements of cell volume and membrane potential, which have yet to be done.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Min et al. attempt to demonstrate a mechanism whereby magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can reflect changes in neuronal membrane potentials. They approach this goal by studying how MRI contrast and cellular potentials together respond to treatment of cultured cells with ionic solutions that are known to depolarize or hyperpolarize excitable cells. The authors specifically examine two MRI-based measurements: (A) the transverse (T2) relaxation rate, which reflects microscopic magnetic fields caused by solutes and biological structures; and (B) the fraction or &quot;pool size ratio&quot; (PSR) of water molecules estimated to be bound to macromolecules, using an MRI technique called magnetization transfer (MT) imaging. They see that depolarizing K+ and Ba2+ concentrations lead to T2 increases and PSR decreases that vary approximately linearly with parallel measurements of voltage in a neuroblastoma cell line and that change similarly in a second cell type. They also show that depolarizing potassium concentrations evoke T2 increases in rat brains, and that these changes are reversed when potassium is renormalized. Min et al. argue that their results suggest a basis for noninvasive functional imaging of cellular voltage signals. If this were true, it would help validate a recent paper published by some of the authors (Toi et al., Science 378:160-8, 2022), in which they claimed to be able to detect millisecond-scale neuronal responses by MRI.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The discovery of a mechanism for relating cellular membrane potential to MRI contrast could yield an important means for studying functions of the nervous system. Achieving this has been a longstanding goal in the MRI community, but previous strategies have proven insufficient for neuroscientific or clinical applications. The current paper suggests that one of the simplest and most widely used MRI contrast mechanisms-T2 weighted imaging-may indicate correlates of membrane potential if measured in the absence of the hemodynamic signals that most functional MRI (fMRI) experiments rely on. The authors make their case using quantitative tests that include some controls for ion and cell type-specificity of their in vitro results and reversibility of MRI changes observed in vivo.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The major weakness of the paper is that it uses only slow correlational experiments to probe the relationship between MRI contrast and membrane potential. The authors do not examine effects on the subsecond time scale that is of greatest interest, and they do not adequately consider how biophysical factors with only loose relationship to electrophysiological variables could explain their imaging results. Notably, depolarizing ionic solutions that perturb membrane potential can also induce changes in cellular volume and tissue structure that in turn alter MRI contrast properties similarly to the results shown here. For example, a study by Stroman et al. (Magn Reson Med 59:700-6, 2008) reported reversible potassium-dependent T2 increases in neural tissue that correlate closely with light scattering-based indications of cell swelling. Phi Van et al. (Sci Adv 10:eadl2034, 2024) showed that potassium addition to one of the cell lines used here likewise leads to cell size increases and T2 increases. In their revised manuscript, the authors acknowledge that cell swelling might contribute to the MRI signals they report, but they do nothing to probe the contributions or characteristics of such effects. If cell swelling accounted for the author's MRI results, it would likely operate on a time scale far too slow to yield useful indications of membrane potential. Given these considerations and the absence of data demonstrating correspondence of electrophysiological measures with MRI readouts on a fast time scale, the paper fails to provide evidence that membrane potential changes can be meaningfully detected by MRI.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper examines changes in relaxation time (T1 and T2) and magnetization transfer parameters that occur in a model system and in vivo when cells or tissue are depolarized using an equimolar extracellular solution with different concentrations of the depolarizing ion K<sup>+</sup>. The motivation is to explain T2 changes that have previously been observed by the authors in an in vivo model with neural stimulation (DIANA) and to try to provide a mechanism to explain those changes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors argue that the use of various concentrations of KCL in the extracellular fluid depolarize or hyperpolarize the cell pellets used and that this change in membrane potential is the driving force for the T2 (and T1-supplementary material) changes observed. In particular, they report an increase in T2 with increasing KCL concentration in the extracellular fluid (ECF) of pellets of SH-SY5Y cells. To offset the increasing osmolarity of the ECF due to the increase in KCL, the NaCL molarity of the ECF is proportionally reduced. The authors measure the intracellular voltage using patch clamp recordings, which is a gold standard. With 80 mM of KCL in the ECF, a change in T2 of the cell pellets of ~10 ms is observed with the intracellular potential recorded as about -6 mv. A very large T1 increase of ~90 ms is reported under the same conditions. The PSR (ratio of hydrogen protons on macromolecules to free water) decreases by about 10% at this 80 mM KCL concentration. Similar results are seen in a Jurkat cell line and similar, but far smaller changes are observed in vivo, for a variety of reasons discussed. As a final control, T1 and T2 values are measured in the various equimolar KCL solutions. As expected, no significant changes in T1 and T2 of the ECF were observed for these concentrations.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>[Reviewer 1, Comment 1] While the concepts presented are interesting, and the actual experimental methods seem to be nicely executed, the conclusions are not supported by the data for a number of reasons. This is not to say that the data isn't consistent with the conclusions, but there are other controls not included that would be necessary to draw the conclusion that it is membrane potential that is driving these T1 and T2 changes. Unfortunately for these authors, similar experiments conducted in 2008 (Stroman et al. Magn. Reson. in Med. 59:700-706) found similar results (increased T2 with KCL) but with a different mechanism, that they provide definite proof for. This study was not referenced in the current work.</p>
<p>It is well established that cells swell/shrink upon depolarization/hyperpolarization. Cell swelling is accompanied by increased light transmittance in vivo, and this should be true in the pellet system as well. In a beautiful series of experiments, Stroman et al. (2008) showed in perfused brain slices that the cells swell upon equimolar KCL depolarization and the light transmittance increases. The time course of these changes is quite slow, of the order of many minutes, both for the T2-weighted MRI signal and for the light transmittance. Stroman et al. also show that hypoosmotic changes produce the exact same time course as the KCL depolarization changes (and vice versa for the hyperosmotic changes - which cause cell shrinkage). Their conclusion, therefore, was that cell swelling (not membrane potential) was the cause of the T2-weighted changes observed, and that these were relatively slow (on the scale of many minutes).</p>
<p>What are the implications for the current study? Well, for one, the authors cannot exclude cell swelling as the mechanism for T2 changes, as they have not measured that. It is however well established that cell swelling occurs during depolarization, so this is not in question. Water in the pelletized cells is in slow/intermediate exchange with the ECF, and the solutions for the two compartment relaxation model for this are well established (see Menon and Allen, Magn. Reson. in Med. 20:214-227 (1991). The T2 relaxation times should be multiexponential (see point (3) further below). The current work cannot exclude cell swelling as the mechanism for T2 changes (it is mentioned in the paper, but not dealt with). Water entering cells dilutes the protein structures, changes rotational correlation times of the proteins in the cell and is known to increase T2. The PSR confirms that this is indeed happening, so the data in this work is completely consistent with the Stroman work and completely consistent with cell swelling associated with depolarization. The authors should have performed light scattering studies to demonstrate the presence or absence of cell swelling. Measuring intracellular potential is not enough to clarify the mechanism.</p>

<p>[Reviewer 1, Response 1] We appreciate the reviewerâs comments. We agree that changes in cell volume due to depolarization and hyperpolarization significantly contribute to the observed changes in T2, PSR, and T1, especially in pelletized cells. For this reason, we already noted in the Discussion section of the original manuscript that cell volume changes influence the observed MR parameter changes, though this study did not present the magnitude of the cell volume changes. In this regard, we thank the reviewer for introducing the work by Stroman et al. (Magn Reson Med 59:700-706, 2008). When discussing the contribution of the cell volume changes to the observed MR parameter changes, we additionally discussed the work of Stroman et al. in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>In addition, we acknowledge that the title and main conclusion of the original manuscript may be misleading, as we did not separately consider the effect of cell volume changes on MR parameters. To more accurately reflect the scope and results of this study and also take into account the reviewer 2âs suggestion, we adjusted the title to âResponses to membrane potential-modulating ionic solutions measured by magnetic resonance imaging of cultured cells and in vivo rat cortexâ and also revised the relevant phrases in the main text.</p>
<p>Finally, when [K<sup>+</sup>]-induced membrane potential changes are involved, there seems to be factors other than cell volume changes that appear to influence T<sup>2</sup> changes. Our follow-up study shows that there are differences in volume changes for the same T<sup>2</sup> change in the following two different situations: pure osmotic volume changes versus [K<sup>+</sup>]-induced volume changes. For example, for the same T<sup>2</sup> change, the volume change for depolarization is greater than the volume change for hypoosmotic conditions. We will present these results in this coming ISMRM 2025 and are also preparing a manuscript to report shortly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>[Reviewer 1, Comment 2] So why does it matter whether the mechanism is cell swelling or membrane potential? The reason is response time. Cell swelling due to depolarization is a slow process, slower than hemodynamic responses that characterize BOLD. In fact, cell swelling under normal homeostatic conditions in vivo is virtually non-existent. Only sustained depolarization events typically associated with non-naturalistic stimuli or brain dysfunction produce cell swelling. Membrane potential changes associated with neural activity, on the other hand, are very fast. In this manuscript, the authors have convincingly shown a signal change that is virtually the same as what was seen in the Stroman publication, but they have not shown that there is a response that can be detected with anything approaching the timescale of an action potential. So one cannot definitely say that the changes observed are due to membrane potential. One can only say they are consistent with cell swelling, regardless of what causes the cell swelling.</p>
<p>For this mechanism to be relevant to explaining DIANA, one needs to show that the cell swelling changes occur within a millisecond, which has never been reported. If one knows the populations of ECF and pellet, the T2s of the ECF and pellet and the volume change of the cells in the pellet, one can model any expected T2 changes due to neuronal activity. I think one would find that these are minuscule within the context of an action potential, or even bulk action potential.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>[Reviewer 1, Response 2] In the context of cell swelling occurring at rapid response times, if we define cell swelling simply as an âincrease in cell volume,â there are several studies reporting transient structural (or volumetric) changes (e.g., ~nm diameter change over ~ms duration) in neuron cells during action potential propagation (Akkin et al., Biophys J 93:1347-1353, 2007; Kim et al., Biophys J 92:3122-3129, 2007; Lee et al., IEEE Trans Biomed Eng 58:3000-3003, 2011; Wnek et al., J Polym Sci Part B: Polym Phys 54:7-14, 2015; Yang et al., ACS Nano 12:4186-4193, 2018). These studies show a good correlation between membrane potential changes and cell volume changes (even if very small) at the cellular level within milliseconds.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the Response 1 above, this study does not address rapid dynamic membrane potential changes on the millisecond scale, which we explicitly mentioned as one of the limitations in the Discussion section of the original manuscript. For this reason, we do not claim in this study that we provide the reader with definitive answers about the mechanisms involved in DIANA. Rather, as a first step toward addressing the mechanism of DIANA, this study confirms that there is a good correlation between changes in membrane potential and measurable MR parameters (e.g., T<sup>2</sup> and PSR) when using ionic solutions that modulate membrane potential. Identifying MR parameter changes that occur during millisecond-scale membrane potential changes due to rapid neural activation will be addressed in the follow-up study mentioned in the Response 1 above.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>There are a few smaller issues that should be addressed.</p>
<p>[Reviewer 1, Comment 3] (1) Why were complicated imaging sequences used to measure T1 and T2? On a Bruker system it should be possible to do very simple acquisitions with hard pulses (which will not need dictionaries and such to get quantitative numbers). Of course, this can only be done sample by sample and would take longer, but it avoids a lot of complication to correct the RF pulses used for imaging, which leads me to the 2nd point.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>[Reviewer 1, Response 3] We appreciate the reviewerâs suggestion regarding imaging sequences. In fact, we used dictionaries for fitting in vivo T<sup>2</sup> decay data, not in vitro data. Sample-by-sample nonlocalized acquisition with hard pulses may be applicable for in vitro measurements. However, for in vivo measurements, a slice-selective multi-echo spin-echo sequence was necessary to acquire T<sup>2</sup> maps within a reasonable scan time. Our choice of imaging sequence was guided by the need to spatially resolve MR signals from specific regions of interest while balancing scan time constraints.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>[Reviewer 1, Comment 4] (2) Figure S1 (H) is unlike any exponential T2 decay I have seen in almost 40 years of making T2 measurements. The strange plateau at the beginning and the bump around TE = 25 ms are odd. These could just be noise, but the fitted curve exactly reproduces these features. A monoexponential T2 decay cannot, by definition, produce a fit shaped like this.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>[Reviewer 1, Response 4] The T<sup>2</sup> decay curves in Figure S1(H) indeed display features that deviate from a simple monoexponential decay. In our in vivo experiments, we used a multi-echo spin-echo sequence with slice-selective excitation and refocusing pulses. In such sequences, the echo train is influenced by stimulated echoes and imperfect slice profiles. This phenomenon is inherent to the pulse sequence rather than being artifacts or fitting errors (Hennig, Concepts Magn Reson 3:125-143, 1991; Lebel and Wilman, Magn Reson Med 64:1005-1014, 2010; McPhee and Wilman, Magn Reson Med 77:2057-2065, 2017). Therefore, we fitted the T<sub>2</sub> decay curve using the technique developed by McPhee and Wilman (2017).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>[Reviewer 1, Comment 5] (3) As noted earlier, layered samples produce biexponential T2 decays and monoexponential T1 decays. I don't quite see how this was accounted for in the fitting of the data from the pellet preparations. I realize that these are spatially resolved measurements, but the imaging slice shown seems to be at the boundary of the pellet and the extracellular media and there definitely should be a biexponential water proton decay curve. Only 5 echo times were used, so this is part of the problem, but it does mean that the T2 reported is a population fraction weighted average of the T2 in the two compartments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>[Reviewer 1, Response 5] We understand the reviewerâs concern regarding potential biexponential decay due to the presence of different compartments. In our experiments, we carefully positioned the imaging slice sufficiently remote from the pellet-media interface. This approach ensures that the signal predominantly arises from the cells (and interstitial fluid), excluding the influence of extracellular media above the cell pellet. We described the imaging slice more clearly in the revised manuscript. As mentioned in our Methods section, for in vitro experiments, we repeated a single-echo spin-echo sequence with 50 difference echo times. While Figure 1C illustrates data from five echo times for visual clarity, the full dataset with all 50 echo times was used for fitting. We clarified this point in the revised manuscript to avoid any misunderstanding.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Min et al. attempt to demonstrate that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect changes in neuronal membrane potentials. They approach this goal by studying how MRI contrast and cellular potentials together respond to treatment of cultured cells with ionic solutions. The authors specifically study two MRI-based measurements: (A) the transverse (T2) relaxation rate, which reflects microscopic magnetic fields caused by solutes and biological structures; and (B) the fraction or &quot;pool size ratio&quot; (PSR) of water molecules estimated to be bound to macromolecules, using an MRI technique called magnetization transfer (MT) imaging. They see that depolarizing K<sup>+</sup> and Ba2+ concentrations lead to T2 increases and PSR decreases that vary approximately linearly with voltage in a neuroblastoma cell line and that change similarly in a second cell type. They also show that depolarizing potassium concentrations evoke reversible T2 increases in rat brains and that these changes are reversed when potassium is renormalized. Min et al. argue that this implies that membrane potential changes cause the MRI effects, providing a potential basis for detecting cellular voltages by noninvasive imaging. If this were true, it would help validate a recent paper published by some of the authors (Toi et al., Science 378:160-8, 2022), in which they claimed to be able to detect millisecond-scale neuronal responses by MRI.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The discovery of a mechanism for relating cellular membrane potential to MRI contrast could yield an important means for studying functions of the nervous system. Achieving this has been a longstanding goal in the MRI community, but previous strategies have proven too weak or insufficiently reproducible for neuroscientific or clinical applications. The current paper suggests remarkably that one of the simplest and most widely used MRI contrast mechanisms-T2 weighted imaging-may indicate membrane potentials if measured in the absence of the hemodynamic signals that most functional MRI (fMRI) experiments rely on. The authors make their case using a diverse set of quantitative tests that include controls for ion and cell type-specificity of their in vitro results and reversibility of MRI changes observed in vivo.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>[Reviewer 2, Comment 1] The major weakness of the paper is that it uses correlational data to conclude that there is a causational relationship between membrane potential and MRI contrast. Alternative explanations that could explain the authors' findings are not adequately considered. Most notably, depolarizing ionic solutions can also induce changes in cellular volume and tissue structure that in turn alter MRI contrast properties similarly to the results shown here. For example, a study by Stroman et al. (Magn Reson Med 59:700-6, 2008) reported reversible potassium-dependent T2 increases in neural tissue that correlate closely with light scattering-based indications of cell swelling. Phi Van et al. (Sci Adv 10:eadl2034, 2024) showed that potassium addition to one of the cell lines used here likewise leads to cell size increases and T2 increases. Such effects could in principle account for Min et al.'s results, and indeed it is difficult to see how they would not contribute, but they occur on a time scale far too slow to yield useful indications of membrane potential. The authors' observation that PSR correlates negatively with T2 in their experiments is also consistent with this explanation, given the inverse relationship usually observed (and mechanistically expected) between these two parameters. If the authors could show a tight correspondence between millisecond-scale membrane potential changes and MRI contrast, their argument for a causal connection or a useful correlational relationship between membrane potential and image contrast would be much stronger. As it is, however, the article does not succeed in demonstrating that membrane potential changes can be detected by MRI.</p>

<p>[Reviewer 2, Response 1] We appreciate the reviewerâs comments. We agree that changes in cell volume due to depolarization and hyperpolarization significantly contribute to the observed MR parameter changes. For this reason, we have already noted in the Discussion section of the original manuscript that cell volume changes influence the observed MR parameter changes. In this regard, we thank the reviewer for introducing the work by Stroman et al. (Magn Reson Med 59:700-706, 2008) and Phi Van et al. (Sci Adv 10:eadl2034, 2024). When discussing the contribution of the cell volume changes to the observed MR parameter changes, we additionally discussed both work of Stroman et al. and Phi Van et al. in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>In addition, this study does not address rapid dynamic membrane potential changes on the millisecond scale, which we explicitly discussed as one of the limitations of this study in the Discussion section of the original manuscript. For this reason, we do not claim in this study that we provide the reader with definitive answers about the mechanisms involved in DIANA. Rather, as a first step toward addressing the mechanism of DIANA, this study confirms that there is a good correlation between changes in membrane potential and measurable MR parameters (although on a slow time scale) when using ionic solutions that modulate membrane potential. Identifying MR parameter changes that occur during millisecond-scale membrane potential changes due to rapid neural activation will be addressed in the follow-up study mentioned in the Response 1 to Reviewer 1âs Comment 1 above.</p>
<p>Together, we acknowledge that the title and main conclusion of the original manuscript may be misleading. To more accurately reflect the scope and results of this study and also consider the reviewerâs suggestion, we adjusted the title to âResponses to membrane potential-modulating ionic solutions measured by magnetic resonance imaging of cultured cells and in vivo rat cortexâ and also revised the relevant phrases in the main text.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>[Reviewer 1, Comment 7] The manuscript is well written. One thing to emphasize early on is that the KCL depolarization is done in an equimolar (or isotonic) manner. I was not clear on this point until I got to the very end of the methods. This is a strength of the paper and should be presented earlier.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>[Reviewer 1, Response 7] In response to the reviewerâs suggestion, we have revised the manuscript to present the equimolar characteristic of our experiment earlier.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>[Reviewer 1, Comment 8] In terms of experiments, the relaxation time measurements are not well constructed. They should be done with a CPMG sequence with hundreds of echos and properly curve fit. This is entirely possible on a Bruker spectrometer.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>[Reviewer 1, Response 8] As noted in our Response to Reviewer 1âs Comment 3, while a CPMG sequence with numerous echoes and straightforward curve fitting can be effective, it is less feasible for in vivo experiments. Our multi-echo spin-echo sequence was a balanced approach between spatial resolution, reasonable scan duration, and the need to localize signals within specific regions of interest.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>[Reviewer 1, Comment 9] Measurements of cell swelling should be done to determine the time course of the cell swelling. This could be with NMR (CPMG) or with light scattering. For this mechanism to be relevant to explaining DIANA, one needs to show that the cell swelling changes occur within a millisecond, which has never been reported. If one knows the populations of ECF and pellet, the T2s of the ECF and pellet and the volume change of the cells in the pellet, one can model any expected T2 changes due to neuronal activity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>[Reviewer 1, Response 9] We acknowledge the importance of further research to further strengthened the claims of this study through additional experiments such as cell volume recording. We will do it in future studies.</p>
<p>As noted in our Response 2 to Reviewer 1âs Comment 2, this study does not address rapid membrane potential changes on the millisecond scale, and we acknowledge that establishing the precise timing of cell swelling is crucial for fully understanding the mechanisms of DIANA. Our current work demonstrates that MR parameters (e.g., T<sup>2</sup> and PSR) correlate strongly with membrane potential-modulating ionic environments, but it does not extend to millisecond-scale neural activation. We recognize the importance of further experiments, such as direct cell volume measurements and plan to incorporate it in future studies to build on the insights gained from the present work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Here are a few comments, questions, and suggestions for improvement:</p>
<p>[Reviewer 2, Comment 2] I could not find much information about the various incubation times and delays used for the authors' in vitro experiments. For each of the in vitro experiments in particular, how long were cells exposed to the stated ionic condition prior to imaging, and how long did the imaging take? Could this and any other relevant information about the experimental timing please be provided and added to the methods section?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>[Reviewer 2, Response 2] We have included the information about the preparation/incubation times in the revised manuscript. For the scan time, it was already stated in the original manuscript: 23 minutes for the single-echo spin-echo sequence and 23 minutes for the inversion-recovery multi-echo spin-echo, for a total of 46 minutes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>[Reviewer 2, Comment 3] In what format were the cells used for patch clamping, and were any controls done to ensure that characteristics of these cells were the same as those pelleted and imaged in the MRI studies? How long were the incubation times with ionic solutions in the patch clamp experiment? This information should likewise be added to the paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>[Reviewer 2, Response 3] We have clarified in the revised manuscript that SH-SY5Y cells were patch clamp-measured in their adherent state. On the other hand, the cells were dissociated from the culture plate and pelleted, so the experimental environments were not entirely identical. The patch clamp experiments involved a 20â30 minutes incubation period with the ionic solutions. We have included this information in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>[Reviewer 2, Comment 4] Can the authors provide information about the mean cell size observed under each condition in their in vitro experiments?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>[Reviewer 2, Response 4] We did not directly quantify the mean cell size for each in vitro condition in this study, so we do not have corresponding data. However, we acknowledge that this information could provide valuable insights into potential mechanisms underlying the observed MR parameter changes. In future experiments, we plan to include direct cell-size measurements to further elucidate how changes in cell volume or hydration contribute to our MR findings.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>[Reviewer 2, Comment 5] The ionic challenges used both in vitro and in vivo could also have affected cell permeability, with corresponding effects that would be detectable in diffusion weighted imaging. Did the authors examine this or obtain any results that could reflect on contributions of permeability properties to the contrast effects they report?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>[Reviewer 2, Response 5] We did not perform diffusion-weighted imaging and therefore do not have direct data regarding changes in cell permeability. We agree that incorporating diffusion-weighted measurements could help distinguish whether the MR parameters changes are driven primarily by membrane potential shifts, cell volume changes, or variations in permeability properties. We will consider these approaches in our future studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>[Reviewer 2, Comment 6] Clearly, a faster stimulation method such as optogenetics, in combination with time-locked MRI readouts of the pelleted cells, would be more effective at demonstrating a useful relationship between cellular neurophysiology and MRI contrast in vitro. Can the authors present data from such an experiment? Is there any information they can present that documents the time course of observed responses in their experiments?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>[Reviewer 2, Response 6] In the current study, our methodology did not include time-resolved or dynamic measurements. While it may be possible to obtain indirect information about the temporal dynamics using T<sup>2</sup>-weighted or MT-weighted imaging, such an experiment was beyond the scope of this work. However, we agree that an optogenetic approach with time-locked MRI acquisitions could help directly link cell physiology to MRI contrast, and we will explore this in future studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>[Reviewer 2, Comment 7] The authors used a drug cocktail to suppress hemodynamic effects in the experiments of Figs. 5-6. What evidence is there that this cocktail successfully suppresses hemodynamic responses and that it also preserves physiological responses to the ionic challenges used in their experiments? Were analogous in vivo results also obtained in the absence of the cocktail?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>[Reviewer 2, Response 7] We appreciate the reviewerâs concern regarding pharmacological suppression of hemodynamic effects. Although each component is known to inhibit nitric oxide synthesis, we did not directly measure the degree of hemodynamic suppression in this study. In addition, we cannot definitively confirm that these agents preserved the physiological responses to the ionic challenges. We have clarified these points in the revised manuscript and identified them as limitations of the study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>[Reviewer 2, Comment 8] Why weren't PSR results reported as part of the in vivo experimental results in Fig. 5? Does PSR continue to vary inversely to T2 in these experiments?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>[Reviewer 2, Response 8] In our current experimental setup, acquiring the T<sup>2</sup> map four times required 48 minutes, and extending the scan to include additional quantitative MT measurements for PSR would have significantly prolonged the scanning session. Given that these experiments were conducted on acutely craniotomized rats, maintaining stable physiological conditions for such a long period of time was challenging. Therefore, due to time constraints, we did not perform MT measurements and focused on T<sub>2</sub> mapping.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>[Reviewer 2, Comment 9] The authors have established in vivo optogenetic stimulation paradigms in their laboratory and used them in the Toi et al. DIANA study. Were T2 or PSR changes observed in vivo using standard T2 measurement or T2-weighted imaging methods that do not rely on the DIANA pulse sequence they originally applied?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>[Reviewer 2, Response 9] Our current T<sub>2</sub> mapping experiments utilized a standard multi-echo spin-echo sequence, rather than the DIANA pulse sequence employed in our previous work. In this respect, the T<sub>2</sub> changes we observed in vivo do not rely on the specialized DIANA methodology.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>[Reviewer 2, Comment 10] In the discussion section, the authors state that to their knowledge, theirs &quot;is the first report that changes in membrane potential can be detected through MRI.&quot; This cannot be true, as their own Toi et al. Science paper previously claimed this, and a number of the studies cited on p.2 also claimed to detect close correlates of neuroelectric activity. This statement should be amended or revised.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>[Reviewer 2, Response 10] We appreciate the reviewerâs comment. We have revised the discussion section of the manuscript to reflect the points raised by the reviewer.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>[Reviewer 2, Comment 11] Because the current study does not actually demonstrate that changes in membrane potential can be detected by MRI, the authors should alter the title, abstract, and a number of relevant statements throughout the text to avoid implying that this has been shown. The title, for instance, could be changed to &quot;Responses to depolarizing and hyperpolarizing ionic solutions measured by magnetic resonance imaging of excitable cells and rat brains,&quot; or something along these lines.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>[Reviewer 2, Response 11] We appreciate the reviewerâs suggestions. We have revised the title, abstract, and relevant statements of the manuscript to clarify that our findings show MR-detectable responses to ionic solutions that are expected to modulate membrane potential, rather than demonstrating direct detection of membrane potential changes by MRI.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>[Reviewer 2, Comment 12] The axes in Fig. 3 seem to be mislabeled. I think the horizontal axes are supposed to be membrane potential measured in mV.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>[Reviewer 2, Response 12] Thank the reviewer for finding an error. We have corrected the axis labels in Figure 3 to indicate membrane potential (in mV) on the horizontal axis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>[Reviewer 2, Comment 13] Since neither the experiments in Jurkat cells (Fig. 4) nor the in vivo MRI tests (Fig. 5-6) appear to have made in conjunction with membrane potential measurements, it seems like a stretch to refer to these experiments as involving manipulation of membrane potentials per se. Instead, the authors should refer to them as involving administration of stimuli expected to be depolarizing or hyperpolarizing. The &quot;hyperpolarization&quot; and &quot;depolarization&quot; labels of Fig. 4 similarly imply a result that has not actually been shown, and should ideally be changed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>[Reviewer 2, Response 13] To prevent any misleading that membrane potential changes were directly measured in Jurkat cells or in vivo, we have revised the relevant text and figure labels.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>[Reviewer 2, Comment 14] The changes in T2 and PSR documented with various K<sup>+</sup> challenges to Jurkat cells in Fig. 4 seem to follow a step-function-like profile that differs from the results reported in SH-SY5Y cells. Can the authors explain what might have caused this difference?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>[Reviewer 2, Response 14] We currently do not have a definitive explanation for why Jurkat cells exhibit a step-function-like response to varying Kâº levels, whereas SH-SY5Y cells show a linear response to log [K<sup>+</sup>]. Experiments that include direct membrane potential measurements in Jurkat cells would help clarify whether this difference arises from genuinely different patterns of depolarization/hyperpolarization or from other factors. We have revised the revised manuscript to address this point.</p>
