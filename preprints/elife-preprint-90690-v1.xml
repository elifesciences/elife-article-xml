<title>Abstract</title><p>Amyloid β (Aβ) peptides accumulating in the brain are proposed to trigger Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, molecular cascades underlying their toxicity are poorly defined.</p>
<p>Here, we explored a novel hypothesis for Aβ42 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for γ-secretases. We hypothesized that the reported increases in Aβ42, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on γ-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events.</p>
<p>We show that human Aβ42 peptides, but neither murine Aβ42 nor human Aβ17-42 (p3), inhibit γ-secretases and trigger accumulation of unprocessed substrates in neurons, including C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP, p75 and pan-cadherin. Moreover, Aβ42 treatment dysregulated cellular homeostasis, as shown by the induction of p75-dependent neuronal death in two distinct cellular systems.</p>
<p>Our findings raise the possibility that pathological elevations in Aβ42 contribute to cellular toxicity via the γ-secretase inhibition, and provide a novel conceptual framework to address Aβ toxicity in the context of γ-secretase-dependent homeostatic signaling.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Γ-secretases are ubiquitously expressed intramembrane proteases best known for their pathogenic roles in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></italic>). Aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by γ-secretases leads to the production of longer, aggregation-prone amyloid β (Aβ) peptides that contribute to neurodegeneration (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>In addition, γ-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD) and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></italic>). The processing of multiple substrates links their activity to a broad range of downstream signaling pathways (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></italic>), including those critical for neuronal structure and function. It is noteworthy that treatment with γ-secretase inhibitors caused cognitive worsening in AD patients (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></italic>), while genetic inhibition of these enzymes led to neurodegenerative phenotypes in mice (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></italic>). The underlying mechanisms by which deficits in γ-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined.</p>
<p>Γ-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B) and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits. The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></italic>). In the amyloidogenic pathway the proteolytic processing of APP by β-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (β-CTF or APP<sub>C99</sub>) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></italic>). APP<sub>C99</sub> is then sequentially processed within the membrane by γ-secretase complexes (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></italic>). An initial endopeptidase (ε-) cut releases APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a <italic>de novo</italic> substrate (either Aβ49 or Aβ48 peptide) that undergoes successive γ-cleavages until a shortened Aβ peptide is released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) defines Aβ length: 37-43 amino acid long peptides, which vary in their aggregation and neurotoxic properties, are generated (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></italic>). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by α- and γ-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1-16 amino acids of Aβ (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>). Of note, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></italic>) despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation prone behavior. In fact, mutations promoting the amyloidogenic processing of APP are linked to AD (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></italic>), while those favoring the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></italic>).</p>

<caption><title>Human Aβ42 peptide inhibits γ-secretase-mediated proteolysis of APP<sub>C99</sub></title>
<p>(A) The scheme depicts the γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of APP, leading to the generation of Aβ and p3 peptides. In the non-amyloidogenic pathway α-secretase generates a soluble APP ectodomain and a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment of 83 amino acids in length (APP<sub>C83</sub>), which is then shortened by γ-secretase until a p3 peptide is released. In the amyloidogenic pathway, β-secretase generates a soluble APP ectodomain and a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment of 99 amino acids in length (APP<sub>C99</sub>), which becomes a substrate for γ-secretase.</p><p>The N-terminal sequence of APP<sub>C99</sub> /Aβ is shown in the lower panel. The differences in the amino acid sequence of human (hu) vs murine (mu) Aβ peptides and the positions of β’- and α-cleavages (that precede the generation of Aβ11-42 and p3 17-42 peptides, respectively) are indicated. The transmembrane domain is labelled in grey and the sequence of Aβ42 is presented within a rectangle. The initial γ-secretase endopeptidase cut may occur at one of two different positions on APP, generating two different <italic>de novo</italic> substrates that are further processed by carboxypeptidase-like cleavages as follows: Aβ49→Aβ46→Aβ43→Aβ40→Aβ37 or Aβ48 →Aβ45→Aβ42→Aβ38. Aβ38, Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides are the major products under physiological conditions. The triangles mark the sequential cleavage positions.</p><p>(B) The western blot presents AICD products generated <italic>de novo</italic> in detergent-based γ-secretase activity assays using APP<sub>C99</sub>-3xFLAG at 0.4 μM or 1.2 μM as substrate. To test the inhibitory properties of human Aβ1-42, the peptide was added to the activity assays at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 10 μM. DMSO at 2.5% was used as a vehicle control. The graphs present the quantification of the western blot bands corresponding to AICDs. The pink and green lines correspond to 0.4 μM and 1.2 μM substrate concentrations, respectively. The data are normalized to the AICD levels generated in the DMSO conditions, considered as 100%. The data are presented as mean ± SEM, N=6-16.</p><p>(C) Mass spectrometry-based analysis of <italic>de novo</italic> generated AICD levels in <italic>in vitro</italic> cell-free γ-secretase activity assays containing 3 μM human Aβ1-42 or vehicle (0.6% DMSO) indicate that human Aβ1-42 inhibits both product lines.</p><p>(D) The western blot presents <italic>de novo</italic> generated AICDs in detergent-based γ-secretase activity assays using 0.4 μM APP<sub>C99</sub>-3xFLAG as substrate and wild type γ-secretases composed of different PSEN (1 or 2) and APH1 (A or B) subunits in the presence of vehicle, human Aβ1-42 at 3 μM or GSI (InhX) at 10 μM concentration.</p><p>(E) The graph presents ELISA quantification of Aβ1-38 peptides generated in detergent- or detergent resistant membranes (DRM)-based γ-secretase activity assays using either human Aβ1-42 at 10 μM or APP<sub>C99</sub>-3xFLAG at 1.5 μM as substrates. The data are presented as mean ± SEM, N=3.</p><p>(F) The western blot presents <italic>de novo</italic> generated AICDs in detergent-based γ-secretase activity assays using 0.4 μM APP<sub>C99</sub>-3xFLAG as a substrate and γ-secretase immobilized on sepharose beads. During the first round, the activity assay was supplemented with 3 μM Aβ1-42, 10 μM GSI or DMSO vehicle. After this first round, the γ-secretase-beads were washed to remove the peptide and inhibitor, respectively, fresh substrate was added, and the reaction proceeded for the second round. The analysis demonstrates the reversibility of the Aβ1-42-mediated inhibition.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>In familial AD (FAD), mutations in PSENs or in APP/Aβ (i.e. changes impacting both the enzyme and its substrate) promote the generation of longer Aβ peptides, including Aβ42, but also Aβ43 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></italic>). These peptides accumulate in the brain and are a hallmark of AD, in both familial and sporadic forms. In the latter (SAD), the accumulation of longer, aggregation prone peptides results from their inefficient clearance (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></italic>). Irrespective of the mechanism, the accumulation of Aβ in the brain begins decades before the onset of clinical symptoms and is proposed to trigger toxic cascades via poorly understood mechanisms (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>Aggregation of Aβ42 into soluble toxic oligomers has been proposed as a prerequisite for its toxicity (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></italic>). However, given the broad spectrum of brain-derived Aβ peptides and their assemblies, it seems plausible that the pleiotropic nature of Aβ actions contribute via a number of mechanisms to AD pathogenesis. Of note, increasing evidence suggests that in addition to Aβ (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></italic>), its precursor, the 99 amino acid C-terminal fragment (i.e. APP<sub>C99</sub>) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></italic>) also mediates pathogenic mechanisms.</p>
<p>Herein, we explored a novel hypothesis for Aβ42 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for γ-secretases. We hypothesized that pathological increases in Aβ levels in the AD brain resulted in the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism, wherein Aβ1-42 competed with membrane-associated substrates for γ-secretase processing. This hypothesis is supported by our reported observations that Aβs with low affinity for γ-secretase, when present at relatively high concentrations, can compete with the longer, higher affinity APP<sub>C99</sub> substrate for binding and processing by the enzyme (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></italic>). This hypothetical inhibitory feedback would result in the accumulation of unprocessed γ-secretase substrates and reduced levels of their soluble intracellular domain (ICD) products, possibly disrupting downstream signaling cascades.</p>
<p>To test the hypothesis, we investigated whether Aβ peptides can exert product feedback inhibition on γ-secretase. Our kinetic analyses demonstrate that human Aβ1-42 inhibits γ-secretase-mediated processing of APP<sub>C99</sub> and other substrates. Strikingly, neither murine Aβ1-42 nor human p3 (17-42 amino acids in Aβ) peptides exerted inhibition under similar conditions. We also show that human Aβ1-42-mediated inhibition of γ-secretase activity results in the accumulation of unprocessed CTFs of APP, p75 and pan-cadherins. To evaluate the impact of the Aβ-driven inhibition on cellular signaling, we analyzed p75-dependent activation of caspase 3 in basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) and PC12 cells. These analyses demonstrate that, as seen for γ-secretase inhibitors (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></italic>), Aβ1-42 potentiates this marker of apoptosis. Our findings thus point to an entirely novel and selective role for the Aβ42 peptide, and raise the intriguing possibility that compromised γ-secretase activity against the CTFs of APP and/or other neuronal substrates contributes to the pathogenesis of AD.</p>

<title>Aβ1-42 inhibits γ-secretase-mediated proteolysis of APP<sub>C99</sub></title>
<p>Aβ peptides displaying a relatively low affinity for γ-secretase, when present at high concentrations, can compete with the higher affinity APP<sub>C99</sub> substrate for binding to the enzyme (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></italic>). Based on this observation, we hypothesized that increments in concentration of the AD-linked Aβ42 peptides may promote the establishment of a product feedback mechanism that involves the formation of ‘non-productive’ enzyme-Aβ42 complexes and results in the inhibition of γ-secretases. The Aβ42-mediated inhibition would lead to the accumulation of unprocessed γ-secretase substrates and decreased production of their intracellular domains, both possibly contributing to dysregulated downstream signaling.</p>
<p>As a first step, we investigated the effects of human Aβ1-42 (from now on referred to as Aβ42) on the processing of APP<sub>C99</sub> in well-controlled kinetic analyses (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></italic>). We incubated purified (wild type) γ-secretase enzyme with purified APP<sub>C99</sub>-3xFLAG substrate at the K<sub>M</sub> or saturating concentrations (0.4 μM and 1.2 μM, respectively) in the presence of human Aβ42 peptides at concentrations ranging from 0.5 μM to 10 μM. We then analyzed <italic>de novo</italic> generation of AICD-3xFLAG by quantitative western blotting <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary figure 1</xref>)</bold>. Methanol:chloroform extraction was performed to remove the excess of unprocessed substrates, the high levels of which could preclude quantitative analysis of ICDs. The analysis demonstrated that human Aβ42 inhibited γ-secretase-mediated proteolysis of APP<sub>C99</sub> in a dose dependent manner. The more pronounced peptide-driven inhibition at the lower substrate concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>=1.3 μM vs 3.6 μM for 0.4 and 1.2 μM APP<sub>C99</sub>, respectively) is consistent with a mechanism in which Aβ42 competes with the substrate for the enzyme. In addition, mass spectrometry analyses of the proteolytic reactions showed that Aβ42 inhibited the generation of both AICD product types (AICD<sub>50-99</sub> and AICD<sub>49-99</sub>) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>), indicating that Aβ42 inhibits both γ-secretase product lines. Next, we tested whether human Aβ42 exerts inhibition on all members of the γ-secretase family – i.e. irrespective of the type of PSEN (1 vs 2) and APH1 (A vs B) subunits (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></bold>). Quantitative western blotting analysis revealed a marked inhibition of total AICD production by all types of γ-secretases in the presence of 3 µM human Aβ42. These findings support a competitive mechanism wherein low-affinity substrates (normally acting as products) are able to re-associate with the protease and inhibit the processing of substrates when present at relatively high concentrations.</p>
<p>To gain further insight into the inhibitory mechanism, we investigated γ-secretase mediated processing of Aβ42 to Aβ38 under the conditions used to examine APP<sub>C99</sub>, using the latter as a positive control (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref></bold>). The results showed that, despite the use of relatively high concentrations of Aβ42 (10 µM), this peptide was not converted into Aβ38, while proteolytic reactions using APP<sub>C99</sub> (1.5 μM) resulted in the generation of Aβ38 (0.5-1 nM). We also tested whether Aβ42 served as a substrate in a native-like environment, i.e. detergent resistant membranes (DRMs) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref></bold>) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></italic>). As in detergent conditions, Aβ42 was barely converted into Aβ38. Of note, we have shown that γ-secretase processes Aβ43 into Aβ40 under similar conditions, even when this peptide was added at much lower concentrations (0.5-1 µM) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></italic>). These observations indicate that exogenous Aβ42, in contrast to Aβ43, does not act as a substrate in these conditions. Accordingly, Aβ42-driven inhibition of γ-secretases supports formation of non-productive enzyme-substrate (E-S) like complexes as an underlying mechanism. Nevertheless, a scenario wherein Aβ42 interacts with APP<sub>C99</sub> to reduce the amount of free APP<sub>C99</sub> substrate available for the enzymatic cleavage was not excluded by these data.</p>
<p>Whether or not the inhibitory effects of Aβ42 on γ-secretase were reversible was also evaluated. To this end, using a high affinity anti-NCSTN nanobody we conjugated purified γ-secretase complexes to beads and incubated the ‘enzyme-attached’ beads with 0.4 µM APP<sub>C99</sub>, in the absence or presence of 3 µM Aβ42, for 40 minutes at 37°C. This concentration of peptide substantially inhibited AICD generation (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>). As a control, 10 µM γ-secretase inhibitor X (GSI, Inh X) was included. After incubation we collected the supernatants, washed the beads in assay buffer and re-incubated them with 0.4 µM APP<sub>C99</sub> for 40 minutes at 37°C. Analysis of the levels of the <italic>de novo</italic> generated AICD products in the supernatant fractions collected after the first incubation indicated that Aβ42 inhibition of γ-secretase was fully reversible (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref></bold>). Collectively, our analyses support a model wherein Aβ42 forms non-productive E-S like complex with γ-secretase and its binding is reversible.</p>

<title>The N- and C-termini of Aβ play key roles in the inhibition of γ-secretase activity</title>
<p>We next investigated the structure-function relationships relevant for the Aβ42-driven inhibitory mechanism. The effects of mouse/rat (murine) Aβ42 and N-terminally truncated human Aβx-42 (11-42 and 17-42) peptides on γ-secretases activity were examined in cell-free assays using peptide concentrations ranging from 0.5 μM to 10 μM (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-C</xref></bold>). Quantification of the <italic>de novo</italic> AICD product levels showed that murine Aβ42 maximally inhibits γ-secretases activity by ∼20% (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). Because three amino acids in the N-terminal domain (R5G, Y10F and H13R) differentiate human and murine Aβ1-42 peptides (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>), the differences in inhibition thus defined the N-terminal domain of Aβ as contributing to the inhibitory mechanism. The analyses of other naturally occurring N-terminally truncated Aβx-42 peptides, generated by β-secretase (alternative) cleavage at position 11 or by α-secretase cut at position 17 in the Aβ sequence, demonstrated that relative to Aβ42, the truncated peptides presented reduced inhibitory potencies. The IC<sub>50</sub> values for Aβ11-42 were reduced 1.79- and 1.31-fold (K<sub>M</sub> and saturating substrate concentrations, respectively), relative to Aβ42 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>)</bold>, while the larger N-terminal truncation (of residues 1-16) abolished the inhibitory effect (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>). Collectively, these data assign a defining role for the N-terminal region of Aβ in mediating the inhibition of γ-secretase activity.</p>

<p>We next tested whether longer Aβ peptides (&gt;Aβ42), that form more stable interactions with the protease (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></italic>), also inhibit γ-secretase activity. In addition, we investigated whether shortening of the C-terminus diminishes the inhibitory properties. To this end, we evaluated a series of naturally occurring Aβ1-x peptides, ranging from 37 to 43 amino acids in length, at 1 µM final concentration, for their effects on γ-secretase proteolysis of APP<sub>C99</sub> (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></bold>). In these experiments reducing the DMSO (vehicle) concentration to 0.2% was attended by enhanced Aβ-mediated inhibition by ∼1.7 fold relative to the conditions shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>. We speculate that increased Aβ potency under these conditions is explained by a modest but measurable reduction in proteolysis by the higher concentration of DMSO used in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> assays (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></italic>). Relative to Aβ42, shorter Aβ species exerted progressively less or no inhibition on the <italic>de novo</italic> generation of AICD. Of note, peptides longer than Aβ42 serve as a substrate of γ-secretases in these conditions and might be converted into shorter, less potent species (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></italic>). Taken together, the data strengthen the conclusion that human Aβ42 inhibits γ-secretases and indicate that both Aβ C- and N-termini modulate the inhibitory mechanism.</p>

<title>Human Aβ42 inhibits endogenous γ-secretase activity in neurons</title>
<p>The consistent inhibitory properties of human Aβ42 demonstrated in cell-free systems motivated cellular studies to address the effects of this peptide on the processing of γ-secretase substrates in cellular context. We applied an established cell-based γ-secretase activity assay to test <italic>in situ</italic> the protease activity in primary mouse neurons (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></italic>) (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). This assay utilizes an APP<sub>C99</sub>-based fluorescent substrate (the C99 Y-T biosensor) to probe γ-secretase activity <italic>in situ</italic>. This biosensor comprises APP<sub>C99</sub> fused at the C-terminus with YPet, followed by a linker, Turquoise-GL and a membrane anchoring domain to stabilize the probe in the membrane. The cleavage of the APP<sub>C99</sub>-based probe by endogenous γ-secretases extends the distance between YPet and Turquoise-GL, and therefore results in a decrease in the efficiency of Fӧrster resonance energy transfer (FRET) for this pair. The ratiometric nature of the reporter, and its independence of α- and β-secretase activity and cellular degradation mechanisms, allow quantitative analysis of γ-secretase activity in living cells.</p>

While p3 peptides did not affect the FRET signal, significant increases in FRET efficiency (i.e. increased proximity between YPet and Turquoise-GL) in cells treated with human Aβ42 or GSI, relative to vehicle treated cultures, indicated increments in the levels of the full-length (uncleaved) fluorescent substrate, and thus reduced γ-secretase activity. These findings thus provided, in a cellular context, quantitative evidence supporting the inhibition of endogenous γ-secretases by human Aβ42, but not p3 17-42 peptides.</p>

<title>Aβ42 treatment leads to the accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments in neuronal cell lines and human neurons</title>
<p>We then reasoned that human Aβ42-driven inhibition of γ-secretase activity would lead to the accumulation of unprocessed γ-secretase substrates in cells: APP-CTFs in the case of APP. To test this possibility, we treated human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y, rat pheochromocytoma PC12 and human neural progenitor cells (ReNcell VM) with either human Aβ42 or p3 17-42 at 1 μM or 2.5 μM final concentrations, and analyzed the levels of APP-CTFs and full-length APP (APP-FL) by western blotting (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-C</xref></bold>). Treatment with GSI (InhX) at 2 μM was included as a positive control, and APP-FL amounts were used to normalize for the APP substrate availability. Human Aβ42 treatment increased the APP-CTF/FL ratio, a read-out of γ-secretase activity. In contrast, treatment with p3 peptide had no effect. To control for overall cellular toxicity of Aβ42 peptides, we performed two cellular toxicity assays (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D-E</xref></bold>). In the first, we quantified the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released by cells into medium upon plasma membrane damage. In the second, we detected cellular ATP as a reporter of viability.

<title>Aβ peptides derived from biological sources trigger APP C-terminal fragment accumulation</title>
<p>We next asked if Aβ from disease-relevant biological sources would recapitulate the effects of recombinant Aβ42. For these studies we used culture medium conditioned by human iPSC-derived neurons expressing APP wild type or the KM670/671NL (SWE) variant. The APP SWE mutation increases total Aβ production by promoting the amyloidogenic processing of APP. ELISA-based quantification of Aβ content estimated a total concentration in the low nanomolar range (0.5-1 nM). Conditioned medium (WT or SWE) was applied to PC12 cells either directly or after Aβ depletion (delSWE) using the anti-APP 3D6 (epitope Aβ 1-5) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref></bold>). After a 24h incubation at 37°C, the APP-CTF/FL ratio was measured. Cells incubated in control, unconditioned media were used as a reference control. We observed significant increments in the APP-CTF/FL ratio in cells treated with SWE conditioned media, relative to control cells. Aβ immunodepletion from the SWE medium (delSWE-CM) lowered the APP-CTF/FL ratio to the levels observed in the control cells. These data provide evidence that Aβ peptides derived from biological sources induce accumulation of APP-CTFs even when present at low nM concentrations, and thus point to this biological source of Aβ peptides as being far more potent than recombinant Aβ42.</p>

<p>These observations provided evidence that Aβ42 differs from other tested peptides in one or more features that are critical for γ-secretase inhibition in cells. Previous studies have shown that selective cellular uptake of human Aβ42, relative to Aβ40, leading to its concentration in the acidic endolysosomal network (ELN), promotes peptide aggregation into soluble toxic Aβ species (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></italic>). We reasoned that since this compartment is the main locus of γ-secretase activity (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></italic>), the concentration of Aβ42 in ELN may not only promote its aggregation but also facilitate its inhibitory actions on γ-secretases. To investigate whether the selective accumulation of Aβ42 in ELN, relative to other tested peptides, could explain the differential (cellular) inhibitory profiles of the tested peptides (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref></bold>), we treated PC12 cells with human Aβ40, Aβ42, Aβ43 or p3 17-42, or murine Aβ42 peptides at 1 µM final concentration for 24h, and investigated their intracellular pools by immunostaining with an anti-Aβ/p3 antibody, 4G8 (epitope: 17-23 aa). We found that, unlike other Aβ or p3 peptides, human Aβ42 accumulated in cells. The data is consistent with a model in which selective cellular uptake and/or intracellular accumulation of Aβ42 distinguishes it from the other examined peptides and explains its unique inhibitory properties in the cellular context.</p>

<p>We next investigated the effects of human Aβ42 on the γ-secretase-mediated processing of pan-cadherin in ReNcell VM cells. Cleavage of cadherins by α-secretase generates a membrane bound CTF, which is a direct substrate of γ-secretases (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></italic>). As before, we used the PanCad-CTF/FL ratio to estimate the efficiency of the γ-secretase-mediated proteolytic processing (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref></bold>). Human Aβ42 and InhX, but not p3, treatments resulted in significant increments in the PanCad-CTF/FL ratio, demonstrating that Aβ42 inhibits processing of several different γ-secretase substrates. These results suggest that this peptide may be able to generally impact proteolysis of γ-secretases substrates.</p>
<p>In demonstrating that Aβ42 inhibits γ-secretase proteolysis of substrates that are structurally distinct from APP-CTFs, these data point to Aβ42 inhibiting enzyme activity independent of substrate structure. In so doing, they render much less likely the mechanistic possibility considered above, that inhibition is due to interaction with the substrate.</p>

<title>Human Aβ42 driven accumulation of p75-CTF induces markers of neuronal death</title>
<p>The p75 neurotrophin receptor plays a prominent role in neurotrophin signaling. Under certain conditions its C-terminal fragment (p75-CTF, a γ-secretase substrate) modulates cell death (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></italic>). Previous studies have shown that accumulation of p75-CTF in basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs), due to pharmacological inhibition of γ-secretases, triggers apoptosis in a TrkA activity dependent manner (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></italic>). The proapoptotic action of p75-CTF is prevented by expression of the TrkA receptor for nerve growth factor (NGF), which serves as a co-receptor with p75 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></italic>). Similar observations were made in PC12 cells, which model sympathetic neurons. In this case, γ-secretase inhibitors increased apoptosis in TrkA-deficient (PC12nnr5) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></italic>), but not in wild type, TrkA expressing cells. These findings provided an experimental system to investigate the effects of Aβ42 mediated inhibition on γ-secretase-mediated signaling in neurons and neuron-like cells.</p>
<p>We tested the impact of Aβ on p75 signaling in wild type and PC12nnr5 cells. We exposed the cells to 1 µM human Aβ42, 1 µM p3, GSI (10 µM compound E) or vehicle (DMSO) for 3 days, and measured apoptosis via immunofluorescence staining for cleaved caspase 3 (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref></bold>). In addition, to assess γ-secretase proteolysis of p75, we measured the p75-CTF/FL ratio in the treated cultures (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref></bold>). Cleaved caspase 3 staining was increased in PC12nnr5 cells treated with GSI or human Aβ42, but not in those exposed to p3 or vehicle (DMSO). Of note, and consistent with past findings (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></italic>), none of the treatments elicited significant increases in cleaved caspase 3 in wild type PC12 cells that express physiological levels of TrkA. In addition, analysis of the p75-CTF/FL ratio demonstrated higher p75-CTF levels in GSI and Aβ42 treated cells. These results, together with our previous observations, strongly suggest that Aβ42-mediated accumulation of p75-CTFs results in cell death signaling in the absence or near absence of TrkA expression. Our similar studies using BFCNs recapitulated the reported increased cell death under conditions in which both γ-secretase and TrkA activities were inhibited (CE and K252α inhibitor) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></italic>), and showed that treatment with 1 µM human Aβ42 mimics the increase in cleaved caspase 3 driven by the GSI (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref></bold>). In conclusion, these results strongly support a novel role for human Aβ42 peptide in the global inhibition of γ-secretase activity and point to this Aβ42-induced mechanism as dysregulating cellular homeostasis.</p>

<title>Aβ42-mediated γ-secretase inhibition is the major mechanism contributing to APP-CTF accumulation in cells</title>
<p>Our data derived from well-controlled, cell-free systems and cell-based assays utilizing a concentration independent (FRET) reporter of γ-secretase activity support a direct impact of Aβ42 peptides on the activity of the enzyme. Of note, these systems are independent of α- and β-secretase cleavages as well as cellular degradation pathway, hence they allow selective and specific analysis of γ-secretase activity. Nevertheless, it is possible that in cells all or some of the aforementioned mechanisms act jointly and converge on the observed increase in APP-CTFs.</p>
<p>To investigate the impact of Aβ42 on α-secretase (ADAM10) and β-secretase (BACE1), the increased expression or activity of which could result in increased APP-CTF levels, we analyzed the levels of soluble APP (sAPP) in conditioned medium collected from SH-SY5Y cells treated with Aβ40 (1 μM), Aβ42 (1 μM), p3 17-42 (1 μM), GSI (InhX, 2 μM) or vehicle DMSO control, as well as the expression of ADAM10 and BACE1 in total cell lysates <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supplementary figure 3</xref>)</bold>. We found no evidence for either increased α-secretase and β-secretase levels or activity. Our analysis actually showed a reduction in sAPP levels in the conditioned medium collected from cells treated with Aβ42. Further studies are required to define whether the sAPP decrease in a consequent of sheddase inhibition.</p>
<p>Next, to evaluate potential γ-secretase independent changes in the degradation of APP-CTF, we assessed the impact of Aβ42 peptides on γ-secretase independent APP-CTF half-life using a well-established cycloheximide (CHX)-based assay. CHX inhibits protein synthesis through blocking translation elongation (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></italic>). In these experiments, we pre-treated SH-SY5Y cells with either GSI (DAPT, 10 μM) or GSI + Aβ42 (1 μM) for 24h to accumulate APP-CTFs. Next, we added CHX (50 μg/ml) and then collected the cells thereafter at 0h, 1h, 2.5h and 5h. Bafilomycin A1 (200 nM), which de-acidifies lysosomes and compromises degradation, was used as a positive control (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A and B</xref></bold>). Quantitative analysis of the levels of both APP-CTFs and APP-FL over the 5h time-course failed to reveal significant differences between Aβ42 treated cells and controls. As expected, Bafilomycin A1 treatment markedly prolonged the half-life of both proteins (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref></bold>). This study demonstrated the lack of a significant impact of Aβ42 on the half-life of APP-CTFs under the conditions of γ-secretase inhibition. However, we noted increased APP-CTF/FL ratio in GSI + Aβ42 treated cells vs GSI + DMSO treated cells at zero time point. The additive effect of Aβ42 in setting of full pharmacological inhibition of γ-secretase suggests that Aβ42-mediated increases in APP-CTFs are mediated by both inhibition of γ-secretase as well as one or more additional mechanisms (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref></bold>). Nevertheless, the greater relative accumulation of APP-CTFs in the absence (138%) (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold>) versus the presence of the GSI (48%) (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref></bold>) is evidence that Aβ42-mediated γ-secretase inhibition plays a more incisive role.</p>

<title>APP-CTF levels are increased in Aβ42-treated synaptosomes derived from mouse brains</title>
<p>Since both the amyloidogenic processing of APP and the accumulation of Aβ occur at the synapse (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></italic>), we reasoned that synaptosomes are potentially a cellular locus where elevated levels of Aβ could be acting on γ-secretase. Therefore, we tested γ-secretase-mediated processing of APP at the synapse and investigated whether Aβ42 inhibits γ-secretase at this particular locus (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref></bold>). To this end, we prepared synaptosomes from wild type mouse brains, treated these fractions with 2.5 µM Aβ42 or vehicle, and then measured APP-FL and APP-CTF levels by western blotting. An increased APP-CTF/FL ratio in Aβ42 treated samples, compared to vehicle control, provided evidence of γ-secretase inhibition.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Compelling evidence supports that Aβ peptides trigger molecular and cellular cascades that result in neurodegeneration (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></italic>). Here, we discovered and thoroughly characterized a previously unreported role for Aβ: inhibition of γ-secretase complexes. The recognition that Aβ peptides, despite lower affinities, can compete with APP-CTFs for binding to γ-secretase, when present at relatively high concentrations (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></italic>), led us to propose a mechanism that connects increases in the Aβ42 peptide with inhibition of γ-secretases. We note that two different mechanisms involving γ-secretases are known to cause neurodegeneration: γ-secretase dysfunction in autosomal dominant FAD (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></italic>) and γ-secretase inhibition, leading to age-dependent neurodegenerative phenotypes in mice (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></italic>). The mechanisms underlying the detrimental effects of dysfunction and inhibition are poorly understood, though it is clear that the former implicates Aβ metabolism, while the second is independent of APP (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></italic>). In addition, pharmacological inhibition of γ-secretase activity has been linked to cognitive worsening in AD affected individuals (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>To explore the possible links between γ-secretase dysfunction (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></italic>) and γ-secretase inhibition (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></italic>) we analyzed γ-secretase endopeptidase activity in well-controlled cell-free assays, using purified protease and substrate. The data demonstrated that human Aβ42 inhibited the processing of APP<sub>C99</sub> by all members of the human γ-secretase family. Notably, despite the high homology between human and murine Aβ sequences, murine Aβ1-42 peptide failed to inhibit the proteolysis of APP<sub>C99</sub>, implying that structural determinants in the N-terminal domain of Aβ are involved in the inhibitory mechanism. Consistent with this view, N-terminally truncated Aβ peptides (Aβ11-42 and p3 17-42) demonstrated reduced or no inhibitory properties, compared to human Aβ42. Of note, the p3 peptide lacks the 16 amino acid long, hydrophilic and disordered N-terminal domain present in Aβ peptides, but does contain the two aggregation prone regions (16–21 and 29-42) required for the assembly of oligomers (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></italic>) and fibrils (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></italic>). Despite p3 peptide’s aggregation prone behavior (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></italic>) and accumulation in AD brain (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></italic>), whether this peptide is responsible for toxicity is not well defined (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>Our analyses in cell-free systems revealed that the C-terminus of Aβ also modulates its intrinsic inhibitory properties, with shorter Aβ1-x species (x= 37, 38, 40) either not acting as inhibitors or inhibiting the protease to a lesser degree than human Aβ42. The reported lower affinities of shorter Aβ peptides towards γ-secretase may, at least partially, explain their decreased inhibitory potencies (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></italic>). Further investigations on cultures of neurons and neuron-like cells showed that extracellularly applied human Aβ42 resulted in the accumulation of unprocessed γ-secretase substrates. Given that the accumulation of the substrates may stem from multiple cellular pathways, such as sheddase activation or protein degradation impairments, we quantified Aβ42-driven inhibition of γ-secretase using a live cell FRET-based imaging assay that is independent of the aforementioned alternative cellular processes, and hence specifically and selectively reports on the substrate proteolysis by endogenous γ-secretases. These analyses demonstrated a significant reduction in the global γ-secretase activity in neurons treated with human Aβ42, but not with p3.</p>
<p>In contrast to findings in cell-free assays, γ-secretase inhibition in cells was only observed for human Aβ42. Other Aβ and p3 peptides did not trigger the accumulation of unprocessed APP-CTFs. Reports showing that Aβ conformation affects both cellular internalization and neurotoxicity (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></italic>) motivated us to test the possibility that Aβ42, unlike other Aβ peptides, acquires specific conformations that promote endocytosis and/or inhibit intracellular degradation. Earlier reports of the selective uptake of Aβ42, relative to Aβ40 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></italic>), facilitating concentration of Aβ42 in spatially restricted endosomal compartments, would support this postulation. Our data showing marked increases in the intracellular levels of Aβ42, but not Aβ40 or Aβ43, in cells add to the evidence for peptide-specific differences, but whether they are due to changes in cellular uptake, metabolism or both that lead to higher Aβ42 concentrations and product-feedback inhibition requires further study.</p>
<p>Evidence that Aβ42 exerts a general inhibition of γ-secretase activity is provided by data showing that this peptide also reduced processing of non-APP γ-secretase substrates, including NOTCH, neurexin, pan-cadherin and p75. The inhibitory curves revealed stronger inhibition of NOTCH than APP<sub>C99</sub> cleavage, which may arise from the lower stability of γ-secretase interactions with NOTCH, relative to APP<sub>C99</sub> (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></italic>). Considering the poor sequence homology between distinct γ-secretase substrates and the general Aβ-mediated inhibitory effect, we reason that the inhibitory action of Aβ42 likely involves its interaction with the protease, rather than with the substrate.</p>
<p>Having observed a general impact of Aβ42 on γ-secretase activity, we investigated the effects of Aβ42 on γ-secretase-mediated signaling. Specifically, our analyses demonstrated that treatment of BFCNs (or PC12 cells) with human Aβ42, but not with p3, compromised the processing of p75, increased p75-CTF levels and, in the absence of TrkA, triggered apoptotic cell death. These observations recapitulated reported findings showing that GSI treatment of BFCNs triggers p75-driven cell-death under similar conditions (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></italic>). Of note, these studies also showed that apoptosis in BFCNs subjected to GSI and TrkA signaling inhibitor treatments was rescued in p75 KO BFCNs, demonstrating that cell death is p75-dependent (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></italic>). Our findings showing that Aβ42 treatment mimics GSI-driven p75-dependent apoptosis in BFCNs support the inhibitory role of Aβ42 and links it to dysregulation of downstream signaling cascades. We note a prior study that showed that injection of Aβ42 into the hippocampus of adult mice resulted in the degeneration of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-positive forebrain neurons in wild type but not p75-NTR-deficient mice, a report that noted a correlation between Aβ42-driven neuronal death and accumulation of p75-CTFs (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></italic>). Our findings provide mechanistic bases for these observations.</p>
<p>Endocytic uptake of extracellular Aβ, the extracellular concentration of which is estimated to be at pM to low nM range in the brain, was shown to concentrate Aβ42 to μM levels in the endolysosomal compartments (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></italic>). Within these compartments, the presence of peptides at high concentration and at low pH would serve to facilitate Aβ aggregation and toxicity. We speculate that this mechanism could in addition promote the inhibition of γ-secretases. Given the reported role for APP<sub>C99</sub> in inducing dysregulation of the endolysosomal network, the potential Aβ42-mediated inhibition of γ-secretase processing of APP-CTFs could drive dysregulation of endolysosomal function leading to changes in synaptic, axonal signaling and degradative functions (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></italic>). Equally intriguing is the possibility that the inhibition of other γ-secretase substrates by Aβ42 could contribute to neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>The Aβ-mediated inhibition of γ-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></italic>). In this regard, the direct quantification of γ-secretase activity in detergent resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall γ-secretase activity levels, indicating that the normal (PSEN1 and PSEN2) γ-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></italic>). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></italic>). The inhibition of γ-secretase by Aβ42 could resolve the apparent conflict. Our data could also reconcile two at first glance exclusive hypothesis on the effects of FAD mutations in <italic>PSEN1</italic> on the development of AD (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></italic>). Specifically, the mutation-driven dysfunction on γ-secretase (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></italic>), leading to enhanced generation of Aβ42, may result in γ-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes that stem from the described here inhibitory effects.</p>
<p>Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that local elevations in Aβ42 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an Aβ-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical γ-secretase signaling functions (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref></bold>). Finally, by mechanistically connecting elevated Aβ42 levels with accumulation of multiple γ-secretase substrates, our observations integrate two pathways leading to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigations of the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.</p>

The emitted fluorescence from the donors (TurquoiseGL) and the acceptors (YPet) was detected at 470±10nm and 530±10nm, respectively, by the TruSpectral detectors on an Olympus FV3000RS confocal microscope equipped with CO<sub>2</sub>/heating units. x10/0.25 objective was used for the imaging. Average pixel fluorescence intensity for the cell body after subtraction of the background fluorescence was measured using Image J. The emission intensity of YPet over that of TurquoiseGL (Y/T) ratio was used as a readout of the FRET efficiency, which reflects the relative proximity between the donor and the acceptor. Pseudo-colored images were generated in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA).

<title>Measurement of APP-CTF levels in peptide-treated synaptosomes from mouse cortical tissue</title>
<p>The cortical tissues from two-months old wild-type mice (N=3) were collected and stored at -80°C. Synaptosomes from the cortices were isolated following published protocol using a discontinuous Percoll gradient (Sigma Aldrich, USA) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref></italic>) with some modifications. All the steps were performed on ice or at 4°C unless mentioned otherwise. Briefly, 60-70 mg of tissue was homogenized using a handhold Dounce homogenizer in 5 volumes of homogenization buffer (HB: 0.32 M sucrose, 5 mM magnesium chloride, 5 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4 and EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail). After centrifuging at 1000xg for 10 minutes, post-nuclear supernatant (PNS) was collected. The PNS was further centrifuged at 10800xg for 10 minutes to isolate the pellet fractions (P2, crude synaptosome). The P2 fraction was resuspended in HB and loaded on top of a three-step (3%, 10% and 23%) Percoll gradient, and centrifuged at 14500xg for 12 minutes at 4°C in a Fiberlite F21-8 x 50y Fixed-Angle Rotor (Thermo Fisher, USA). The synaptosome-rich interface between 10% and 23% Percoll layers was collected and resuspended in 30 volumes of HB. The diluted material was centrifuged at 18500xg for 30 minutes at 4°C, and the synaptosome-enriched pellet was resuspended in HB supplemented with 10 mM glucose. 10-15 μg of synaptosome was incubated with Aβ42 peptide at 2.5 μM final concentration at 37°C for 18h. DMSO was used as a vehicle control. One synaptosomal sample was treated with 200 nM of Compound E. Following incubation, samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE and western blotting was performed using anti-APP Y188 and anti-GAPDH antibodies. All densitometric analyses were performed using NIH ImageJ software.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Human Abeta42 inhibits gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Determination of inhibitory concentration human Abeta42 on gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Human Abeta42 may concentrate up to microM order in endosomes. If so, production of Abeta42 would be attenuated then lead to less Abeta deposition in the brain. The authors finding is interesting but does not fit the physiological condition in the brain.</p>
<p>
It is not clear whether the FRET-based assay in living cells really reflect gamma-secretase activity.</p>
<p>
Processing of APP-CTF in living cells is not only the cleavage by gamma-secretase.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In the current study, the authors tested the hypothesis that Aβ42 toxicity arises from its proven affinity for γ-secretases. Specifically, the increases in Aβ42, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on γ-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events. They showed that human Aβ42 peptides, but neither murine Aβ42 nor human Aβ17-42 (p3), inhibit γ-secretases and trigger accumulation of unprocessed substrates in neurons, including (CTFs of APP, p75 and pan-cadherin. Moreover, Aβ42 dysregulated cellular homeostasis by inducing p75-dependent neuronal death. Because γ-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2</p>
<p>
receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD) and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR), revealing a broad range of downstream signaling pathways, including those critical for neuronal structure and function. Hence, they propose to identification of a selective role for the Aβ42 peptide, and raise the intriguing possibility that compromised γ-secretase activity against the CTFs of APP and/or other neuronal substrates contributes to the pathogenesis of AD. Overall, the data are not very convincing to support the main claim.</p>
<p>Strengths.</p>
<p>Different in vitro and cellular approaches are employed to test the hypothesis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses.</p>
<p>The experimental concentrations for Aβ42 peptide in the assay are too high, which are far beyond the physiological concentrations or pathological levels. The artificial observations are not supported by any in vivo experimental evidence.</p>

<body>
<p>We are grateful to the editors and the reviewers for the thorough evaluation of our manuscript and their feedback, as it allows us to provide additional clarification of our findings and improve the manuscript.</p>
<p>In their evaluation reviewers raised a key conceptual point linked to the inhibitory mechanism that appeared to be insufficiently explained in the manuscript, leading to a misconception regarding the physiological relevance. They have also missed experimental data related to the concentrations of Aβ used and their relevance for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We believe that our studies, although performed in vitro in model systems, provide novel conceptual framework and shed light on the unexplored mechanisms underlying AD.</p>
<p>We discuss these points below in a provisional response to their comments.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>This is correct.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>If so, production of Abeta42 would be attenuated then lead to less Abeta deposition in the brain. The authors finding is interesting but does not fit the physiological condition in the brain.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this key conceptual point, as this gives us the opportunity to clarify it for the future readers.</p>
<p>The characterized inhibitory mechanism is more complex than the reviewer’s interpretation, and a number of factors must be considered. Indeed, our data show that Aβ42 upon intracellular concentration inhibits γ-secretase activity, resulting in increased γ-secretase substrate (C-terminal fragment, CTF) levels. It is important however to highlight that this inhibition is competitive in nature, implying that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the Aβ42 peptide (inhibitor) and the substrates. The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake and intracellular concentration of Aβ42 facilitates γ-secretase inhibition, which results in the accumulation of APP-CTFs (and γ-secretase substrates in general). However, as Aβ42 levels fall, the increased concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and Aβ production. As Aβ42 concentration raises again, equilibrium is shifted back towards inhibition and so on. This inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) γ-secretase inhibition, which will alter γ-secretase mediated signalling (arising from increased CTF levels or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signalling, implicated in memory formation (2), and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75 or neuregulins).</p>
<p>It is worth noting that oscillations in γ-secretase activity induced by treatment with a γ-secretase inhibitor (semagacestat) have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (2, 3); and that semagacestat, like Aβ42, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al, 2023).
We will include this clarification in the discussion of the revised manuscript and create an additional figure presenting the proposed mechanism.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It is not clear whether the FRET-based assay in living cells really reflect gamma-secretase activity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The specificity of this assay is supported by the γ-secretase inhibitor treatment included as a positive control (Figure 3). In addition, the following literature supports that this assay truthfully assesses γ-secretase activity in cellular context (4-7).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Processing of APP-CTF in living cells is not only the cleavage by gamma-secretase.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is correct, and therefore we have analysed the contribution of other APP-CTF degradation pathways by performing cycloheximide-based stability assay in the presence of γ-secretase inhibitor. Quantitative analysis of the levels of both APP-CTFs and APP-FL over the 5h time-course failed to reveal significant differences between Aβ42 treated cells and controls. As expected, Bafilomycin A1 treatment markedly prolonged the half-life of both proteins (Figure 7B &amp; C). The lack of a significant impact of Aβ42 on the half-life of APP-CTFs under the conditions of γ-secretase inhibition is consistent with the proposed inhibitory mechanism. Finally, we note that the inhibition will not only affect APP-CTF, but also the processing of γ-secretase substrates in general.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the current study, the authors tested the hypothesis that Aβ42 toxicity arises from its proven affinity for γ-secretases. Specifically, the increases in Aβ42, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on γ-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events. They showed that human Aβ42 peptides, but neither murine Aβ42 nor human Aβ17-42 (p3), inhibit γ-secretases and trigger accumulation of unprocessed substrates in neurons, including (CTFs of APP, p75 and pan-cadherin. Moreover, Aβ42 dysregulated cellular homeostasis by inducing p75-dependent neuronal death. Because γ-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2
receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD) and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR), revealing a broad range of downstream signaling pathways, including those critical for neuronal structure and function. Hence, they propose to identification of a selective role for the Aβ42 peptide, and raise the intriguing possibility that compromised γ-secretase activity against the CTFs of APP and/or other neuronal substrates contributes to the pathogenesis of AD. Overall, the data are not very convincing to support the main claim.</p>
<p>Strengths.</p>
<p>Different in vitro and cellular approaches are employed to test the hypothesis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses.</p>
<p>The experimental concentrations for Aβ42 peptide in the assay are too high, which are far beyond the physiological concentrations or pathological levels. The artificial observations are not supported by any in vivo experimental evidence.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is correct that in the majority of the experiments we used low μM concentrations of Aβ42. However, we would like to note that we also performed experiments where conditioned medium collected from human APP.Swe expressing neurons was used as a source of Aβ. In these experiments total Aβ concentration was in low nM range (0.5-1 nM) (Figure 4G). Treatment with this conditioned medium  led to the increase APP-CTF levels, supporting  that low nM concentrations of Aβ are sufficient for partial inhibition of  γ-secretase.</p>
<p>We would like to underline that Aβ is estimated to be present in the brain in concentration ranging from fM to mM, depending on the pool (soluble, aggregated, fibrillar, etc) that is considered (8, 9). However, it is rather the local than the global concentration of Aβ that is critical for the disease pathogenesis. In this regard, it is proposed that as AD progresses Aβ42 slowly accumulates in the endo-lysosomal system wherein it reaches μM concentrations that are required for aggregation and seeding (1, 10, 11).
Our findings are consistent with the analysis showing that extracellular soluble Aβ42 peptide, at low nM concentrations, is taken up by cortical neurons and neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells, and concentrated in the endo-lysosomal system wherein effective peptide concentrations reach ~2.5 μM (1).  Hence, a slow vesicular peptide accumulation and/or degradation imbalance (1, 11, 12) could lead to several order of magnitude increases in the effective concentration of Aβ42 over the span of years to decades in AD pathogenesis. We note that our experimental settings, using low μM concentrations of extracellular Aβ42 over 24h treatment, were designed to accelerate this 'peptide concentration’ process in vitro. As discussed in our report, a high μM Aβ peptide concentration in the endo-lysosomal system not only leads to aggregation but also facilitates γ-secretase inhibition. Of note, we are currently developing protocols and will undertake follow up studies to quantitatively define the Aβ concentration in synaptosomes and endosomes in AD brain, as well as in in vitro systems (i.e. cells treated with Aβ preparations obtained from AD brains).</p>
<p>Finally,  we would like to highlight that analyses of the brains of the AD affected individuals have shown that APP-CTFs accumulate in both sporadic and genetic forms of the disease (13-15); and recently, Ferrer-Raventós et al have revealed a correlation between APP-CTFs and Aβ levels at the synapse (13).</p>
<p>To conclude, we would like to highlight that as clarified above, the Aβ peptide concentrations and the conditions tested fit well within pathophysiology, and that the data presented in our report collectively provide evidence in support of an Aβ42-mediated inhibitory effect on γ-secretase.</p>
