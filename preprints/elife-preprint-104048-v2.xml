<title>Abstract</title><p>Contractility and cell motility depend on accurately controlled assembly of the actin cytoskeleton. Formins are a large group of actin assembly proteins that nucleate and elongate new actin filaments. Some formins may cap filaments while others sever or bundle filaments. The Formin HOmology Domain-containing protein (FHOD)-family of formins is critical to the formation of the fundamental contractile unit in muscle, the sarcomere. Specifically, mammalian FHOD3L plays an essential role in cardiomyocytes. Despite our knowledge of FHOD3L’s importance in cardiomyocytes, its biochemical and cellular activities remain poorly understood. It was proposed that FHOD-family formins act by capping and bundling, as opposed to assembling new filaments. Here, we demonstrate that FHOD3L nucleates actin and rapidly but briefly elongates filaments after temporarily pausing elongation. We designed function-separating mutants that enabled us to distinguish which biochemical roles are required in the cell. We found that human FHOD3L’s elongation activity, but not its nucleation, capping, or bundling activity, is necessary for proper sarcomere formation and contractile function in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. The results of this work provide new insight into the mechanisms by which formins build specific structures and will contribute to knowledge regarding how cardiomyopathies arise from defects in sarcomere formation and maintenance.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Higher order actin-based structures, such as the sarcomere, are the foundation for specific cellular functions that demand precise spatial and temporal coordination. Other examples of actin-based structures, including filopodia, stress fibers and the cytokinetic furrow, are required for a wide range of processes, such as cell migration, adhesion, and division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Blanchoin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Svitkina, 2018</xref>). Hundreds of actin-binding proteins, and specific combinations thereof, coordinate to assemble these complex structures by accelerating actin assembly, crosslinking and bundling filaments, and stabilizing and/or disassembling actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dominguez and Holmes, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lappalainen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Pollard, 2016</xref>). There are three known classes of actin nucleators that stimulate <italic>de novo</italic> filament assembly. Each class functions by a distinct mechanism, resulting in a unique starting point for the structure it initiates. One such class of actin nucleators, known as formins, mediates both nucleation and continued elongation of actin filaments. Formins are defined by their Formin Homology (FH) domains 1 and 2. The FH2 domain is highly conserved and forms a donut-shaped homodimer, which is sufficient to nucleate new filaments. After nucleation, the FH2 domain remains processively associated with the faster-growing barbed-end of actin filaments, modifying the rate of elongation. The FH1 domain is less well conserved but contains proline-rich tracts that bind profilin-actin to facilitate elongation of actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Courtemanche, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Paul and Pollard, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">2009</xref>). The regulatory domains for most formins are on either side of these FH domains and an intramolecular interaction leads to autoinhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Goode and Eck, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Li and Higgs, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Schonichen and Geyer, 2010</xref>). The timing and strength of formin activity differ between formins, allowing for distinct roles within a given cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Homa et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Multiple classes of formins have been linked to sarcomere structure, including Dishevelled Associated Activator Of Morphogenesis (Daam1, 2), Diaphanous (Diaph1-3), Formin HOmology Domain–containing proteins (FHOD1, 3), and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Deng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Iskratsch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Mi-Mi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Molnár et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Rosado et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sanger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Shwartz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Sundaramurthy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Taniguchi et al., 2009</xref>). There are two mammalian isoforms in the FHOD family of formins, FHOD1 and FHOD3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bechtold et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kanaya et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Schonichen and Geyer, 2010</xref>). FHOD1 is widely expressed and assembles stress fibers that contribute to adhesion and motility of various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gasteier et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Iskratsch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Koka et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Schulze et al., 2014</xref>). Despite its localization to intercalated discs, structures important for rapid signal transmission and synchronized contractions, FHOD1 seems to be dispensable in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Al Haj et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dwyer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sanematsu et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, FHOD3 is implicated in sarcomere assembly and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fujimoto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Iskratsch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kan-o et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Taniguchi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Ushijima et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>There are four isoforms of FHOD3 reported in Uniprot. Major differences are due to alternative splicing in the N-terminal half. An eight residue insert in the C-terminal half, an acidic sequence (T(D/E)5XE), is present only in Uniprot isoform 4, which is commonly referred to as FHOD3L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Iskratsch et al., 2010</xref>). In this paper, we adopt the commonly accepted nomenclature in which FHOD3S (short) indicates Uniprot isoform 1 and FHOD3L (long) indicates Uniprot isoform 4 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). FHOD3L is predominantly expressed in striated muscle, whereas FHOD3S is more widely expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Iskratsch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Taniguchi et al., 2009</xref>). In cardiomyocytes, FHOD3L localizes to sarcomeres in a striated pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Iskratsch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kan-o et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Taniguchi et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, FHOD3L does not localize at the barbed end of actin filaments within sarcomeres. Instead, a direct interaction between FHOD3L and cardiac myosin-binding protein C (cMyBP-C) drives localization of FHOD3L to the so-called C zone of sarcomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Matsuyama et al., 2018a</xref>). In the absence of cMyBP-C, FHOD3L is diffuse and cardiac function is compromised, suggesting that the balance between these two proteins is critical for proper heart function in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Matsuyama et al., 2018a</xref>).</p>

<p>Mutations in the <italic>FHOD3</italic> gene are deemed causative in at least 1-2% of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), in addition to cases of left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and progressive high-frequency hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arimura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Boussaty et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Myasnikov et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Ochoa et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, recent clinical studies show that HCM-linked FHOD3 mutations increase the risk of cardiovascular death and all-cause death, with the onset of the disease occurring as early as age 4 and as late as age 63 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Vodnjov et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Wu et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite its known physiological significance, we lack a mechanistic understanding of FHOD3L’s role in cardiac development and function. Early biochemical analysis suggested that FHOD family formins were an atypical class of formins. Both purified mammalian isoforms (FHOD1 and FHOD3) were found to decelerate, rather than accelerate, actin assembly <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Schonichen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Taniguchi et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, actin bundling was observed for FHOD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Schonichen et al., 2013</xref>). Consistently, FHOD1 mediates nuclear movement by bundling and anchoring actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Antoku et al., 2023</xref>). However, it fails to complete this function when a highly conserved isoleucine in the FH2 domain is mutated (hereafter, referred to as the IA mutation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kutscheidt et al., 2014</xref>). The IA mutation is known to disrupt both nucleation and elongation in most, if not all, formins, indicating that FHOD1 may enhance actin assembly <italic>in vivo</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Patel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Xu et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, FHOD proteins are required to form new sarcomeres in rat cardiomyocytes, human induced cardiomyocytes, worms and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Iskratsch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kan-O et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Mi-Mi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Taniguchi et al., 2009</xref>). FHODs with the IA mutation do not support formation of new sarcomeres, suggesting that actin assembly activity is required for this process, in conflict with the biochemical data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kan-O et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Shwartz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Taniguchi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Xu et al., 2004</xref>). Most recently, in the worm, FHOD protein was shown to cooperate with profilin to build muscle, providing strong evidence that it functions by elongating actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kimmich et al., 2024</xref>). Previously, we found that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Fhod is a potent actin nucleator that can accelerate actin elongation under certain conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bremer et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Patel et al., 2018</xref>). We also showed that human FHOD1 can nucleate actin but its activity is sensitive to the actin isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Patel et al., 2018</xref>). We confirmed that both of these Fhod-family formins lose activity when the IA mutation is introduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Patel et al., 2018</xref>). Based on these biochemical results and the data regarding Fhod-family formins in muscle of multiple species, we asked whether human FHOD3L can also nucleate.</p>
<p>Here, we show that purified FHOD3L can accelerate actin assembly by both nucleation and elongation. We also confirm that FHOD3L potently caps filaments, in the absence of profilin, and bundles. Using function-separating mutations, we correlate FHOD3L’s biochemistry to the integrity of the sarcomere within cardiomyocytes. We found that reduced nucleation, capping, and bundling by FHOD3L are well tolerated in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs), whereas elongation activity is necessary for proper sarcomere formation and function.</p>

<title>Biochemical characterization of human FHOD3</title>
<p>We purified the C-terminal half of human FHOD3L (FHOD3L-CT), encompassing the FH1 domain, FH2 domain, and C-terminal tail, which is typically sufficient for actin assembly <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, <xref rid="figs1a" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Courtemanche, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Patel et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast to an earlier report, we found that FHOD3L-CT enhances rabbit skeletal muscle actin (RSA) assembly in bulk pyrene assays (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A,B</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Taniguchi et al., 2009</xref>). (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> summarizes all biochemical measurements.) Consistent with nucleation activity, when we visualized the products of similar reactions, we observed many more filaments in the presence of FHOD3L-CT compared to actin alone (<xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We also asked if the shorter, alternatively spliced FHOD3 isoform, FHOD3S-CT, nucleates actin. FHOD3S-CT, which lacks 8 acidic residues at the end of its FH2 domain compared to FHOD3L-CT, accelerates actin assembly (∼30%) more potently than FHOD3L-CT (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref rid="figs2b" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We quantified activity of each construct by plotting the slope of the actin assembly curve shortly after the reaction is initiated (t1/8 = time until reaction has reached 1/8<sup>th</sup> completion) as a function of the FHOD3L-CT added. The slopes of these data points are then used to compare specific activity levels. In the cases of FHOD3L-CT vs. FHOD3S-CT the slopes are 0.32 ± 0.04 vs 0.42 ± 0.04, respectively. Thus, we conclude that the C-terminal half of both FHOD3 isoforms (hereafter, FHOD3S/L-CT) are able to nucleate actin filaments.</p>

<p>To further compare FHOD3L-CT to previously characterized formins, we introduced mutations at conserved residues of the FH2 domain, I1163A and K1309A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Xu et al., 2004</xref>). Like other formins, the I1163A mutant lacked nucleation activity, while the K1309A mutant reduced nucleation by ∼85% (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). We observed a reduction in the plateau of pyrene traces with wild-type FHOD3S/L-CT and the mutants. The decrease was more apparent at higher concentrations of the nucleator and seemed to be dose-dependent (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref rid="figs2b" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Control experiments demonstrated that the fluorescence change does not reflect quenching due to side binding or bundling (<xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We, therefore, measured barbed-end binding. We asked whether FHOD3L-CT inhibits filament elongation by performing bulk seeded-elongation assays. Indeed, we found that FHOD3L-CT potently slows barbed-end elongation (Kapp = 0.023 ± 0.005 nM; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C,D</xref>). (The shapes of these traces reflect the presence of activity in addition to capping (perhaps nucleation or bundling), especially at high concentrations, which could affect our estimate of the binding affinity.) Barbed-end binding by FHOD3S-CT is over 30 times weaker (Kapp = 0.750 ± 0.090 nM) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). The IA mutation is generally thought to disrupt binding to both actin monomers and filament barbed ends. However, FHOD3L-CT I1163A has an affinity of 4.9 ± 1.4 nM for barbed ends of actin filaments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref rid="figs2b" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). While the affinity is &gt;200-fold weaker than FHOD3L-CT, it still binds barbed ends tightly. Therefore, we interpret the plateau decrease observed in bulk assembly assays as evidence of barbed-end capping.</p>
<p>To directly observe the impact of FHOD3L-CT on growing actin filaments, we used Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy in the presence of profilin. Initially, we could not confirm that FHOD3L-CT was bound to these filaments. Most of the filaments elongated at rates indistinguishable from actin alone. We, therefore, repeated bulk seeded-elongation assays in the presence of profilin. Under these conditions, we observed increased rates of actin assembly at low doses of FHOD3L-CT, confirming that the formin accelerates elongation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). In contrast, at higher formin concentrations, we found that elongation was actually slower than actin alone. We attribute the complicated shapes and dose response of these data to the contributions of elongation and capping. We also note that the concentrations required for FHOD3L-CT to elicit measurable changes in actin assembly indicate a marked apparent decrease (500-1000 fold) in affinity for the barbed-end when profilin is present (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>).</p>
<p>Upon closer observation of individual filaments in the TIRF assay, we detected short dim stretches along the filaments. The dim regions reflected “bursts” of fast elongation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). During the bursts, the filaments elongated ∼3-fold faster (39 ± 13 subunits/s), consistent with formin-mediated elongation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F,H</xref>, <xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref rid="video1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Video 1</xref>). The average length of filament produced during these bursts was 1.10 ± 0.49 <italic>μ</italic>m (<xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>), which is similar to the characteristic run length of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Fhod-A (∼2 <italic>μ</italic>m), but very different from other formins, which often range from 20 – 200 <italic>μ</italic>m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bremer et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Moseley and Goode, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Patel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Vizcarra et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, a pause often preceded the burst, lasting ∼12 s on average (<xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F—figure supplement 1F</xref>). To confirm that the short dim regions were not simply fluorescence inhomogeneities, which are also observed in these assays, we analyzed filaments growing in the absence of formin. Here, the velocity of dim regions was indistinguishable from the average velocity of the filaments and no pauses were observed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G,H</xref>). In addition, the frequency of dim spots was substantially lower (<xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2— figure supplement 1G</xref>). FHOD3S-CT induced bursts similar to FHOD3L-CT but at slightly lower frequency (<xref rid="figs2b" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C-E</xref>) The bursts were slightly, albeit statistically significantly, shorter (characteristic run length of 0.90 ± 0.33 <italic>μ</italic> m), while the pauses were indistinguishable from those generated by FHOD3L-CT (<xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2F,G</xref>). We note that the resolution of our data is at the limit for describing these events. It follows that the metrics must be taken as our best estimates. Additional experiments are needed for more rigorous measurements of the elongation rate and characteristic run length. Furthermore, we cannot exclude that capping, although frequent (preceding 38 of 40 bursts for FHOD3L-CT), could reflect non-specific interaction with the slide surface. Therefore, we conservatively conclude that, for brief intervals, FHOD3S/L-CT accelerates profilin-actin elongation ∼3-fold, following what may be pauses in growth.</p>
<p>Next, we investigated bundling by FHOD3L-CT. To do so, we visually examined the organization of phalloidin-stabilized actin filaments after incubating with FHOD3L-CT. Bundles were readily apparent (<xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>). To better characterize bundling activity, we performed low-speed bundling assays with a fixed concentration of actin filaments and several concentrations of FHOD3L-CT (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H,I</xref>). We also compared this activity to bundling by FHOD3S-CT. We found that FHOD3L-CT bundles filaments somewhat more potently than FHOD3S-CT, which is most apparent at concentrations above 15 nM (<xref rid="figs2b" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2H,I</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, FHOD3S/L-CT nucleates and elongates actin filaments. FHOD3S-CT is a more potent nucleator, a weaker barbed-end capper, and a slightly weaker bundler compared to FHOD3L-CT (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These data suggest that the acidic T(D/E)5XE insertion of FHOD3L interacts with different surfaces of the actin monomer depending on the biochemical activity. Perhaps the marked increase in capping by FHOD3L-CT is mediated by binding to a basic region exposed at the barbed end of filaments. Decreased activity levels of FHOD3L-CT, such as nucleation and bundling, may be due to the fact that most of the actin surface is acidic.</p>

<title>Biochemical validation of function-separating mutants</title>
<p>We next designed FHOD3L-CT mutants to separate nucleation and elongation. We also assessed the impact of these mutations on capping and bundling. Previously, Baker et al. identified mutations in the FH2 domain of Bni1 that diminish nucleation while maintaining elongation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Baker et al., 2015</xref>). Based on sequence and structural alignments, FHOD3L K1193 approximates one of these, Bni1 K1467. FHOD3L-CT K1193L nucleated with less than 33% of the strength seen for wild-type (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The barbed-end affinity of FHOD3L-CT K1193L was 0.470 ± 0.090 nM, ∼12-fold weaker than wild-type (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Importantly, K1193L-mediated elongation of actin filaments was indistinguishable from wild-type (bursts were again evident, with no significant difference in elongation rate, run length, or capping duration) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref rid="figs3a" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Low-speed bundling assays showed that K1193L bundling is ∼2-fold weaker than wild-type (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Thus, elongation is maintained while nucleation and bundling are strongly reduced by the K1193L mutation.</p>

<p>To remove FH1-mediated acceleration of elongation, we substituted glycine-serine linkers for the polyproline tracts in FHOD3L-CT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Zweifel and Courtemanche, 2020</xref>). (The FH2 domain alone was unstable <italic>in vitro</italic>.) Pyrene-based actin assembly assays were confounded by bundling/aggregation induced by this construct. Although low-speed cosedimentation assays indicated that the bundling strength of FHOD3L-CT GS-FH1 is slightly weaker than that of wild-type, images show irregular shapes that may scatter light more, thereby disrupting the pyrene signal (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref rid="figs3b" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Therefore, to compare the nucleation strength of FHOD3L-CT GS-FH1 with wildtype, we counted filaments using TIRF microscopy. We observed similar numbers of filaments generated in the presence of low concentrations (used to minimize bundling) of FHOD3L-CT wild-type or GS-FH1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref rid="figs3b" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Barbed-end elongation assays in the absence of profilin demonstrated a weakened affinity of FHOD3L-CT GS-FH1 (Kapp = 0.218 ± 0.016 nM) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). This finding suggests that the stiffness of the FH1 domain impacts barbed end binding but we cannot say whether the effect is direct or indirect. Interestingly, profilin did not decrease barbed-end binding of FHOD3L-CT GS-FH1 (Kapp = 0.21 ± 0.13 nM; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Finally, and most importantly, only deceleration was observed in assays with profilin, confirming that elongation was not enhanced by FHOD3L-CT GS-FH1, at any concentration tested (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Thus, nucleation is maintained while acceleration of elongation is no longer detected.</p>
<p>Together, these mutations provide a range of nucleation, elongation, capping, and bundling activities (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We, therefore, used them to assess the correlation of biochemical activities with sarcomere formation and function in cardiomyocytes.</p>

Briefly, freshly isolated NRVMs were treated with small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting FHOD3 using reverse transfection (see Methods for details). Adenoviral infection, driving expression of rescue constructs, was initiated two days after siRNA treatment and cells were examined (fixed or live) two days after infection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). The rescue constructs contained human FHOD3L, which is not targeted by the siRNA used to remove endogenous rat FHOD3. In all cases, cells were treated with siRNA and adenovirus. For negative controls, AllStars Negative Control siRNA and/or empty virus were substituted for the FHOD3-specific reagents. Thus, we refer to the negative control experiment as a mock knockdown and the knockdown alone as a mock rescue. During assay development, we found that knockdown reduced FHOD3 mRNA to ∼35% of original levels after four days, with either of two commercially available oligos (<xref rid="figs4a" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). At this timepoint, we detected an ∼80% reduction in endogenous FHOD3 protein via Western blot (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B,C</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>We analyzed sarcomere structure in fixed samples. To detect sarcomeres, we stained cells with anti-α-actinin antibodies (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). To analyze on a per cell basis, we stained plasma membranes with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and segmented the NRVMs with CellPose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Stringer et al., 2021</xref>) (<xref rid="figs4a" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The DsRed reporter did not provide an accurate readout of exogenous 3xHA-FHOD3L (hereafter, FHOD3L) expression levels (<xref rid="figs4a" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Therefore, we used anti-HA antibodies to quantify the expression of exogenous FHOD3 on a per cell basis. By Western analysis, we found that average exogenous FHOD3L expression could be as high as ∼190% above endogenous levels at the end of the rescue timeline (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B,C</xref>). We, therefore, examined the impact of FHOD3L expression level on sarcomere structure. We detected essentially no correlation (R-squared ranges from 0.001 to 0.04) of sarcomere number, length, or width over a ten-fold change in FHOD3L expression levels (<xref rid="figs4a" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D-F</xref>). Despite the evidence that sarcomere structure was not a function of FHOD3 expression levels, we decided to exclude NRVMs that express very highly above endogenous FHOD3 levels. We set an upper cutoff for the normalized exogenous FHOD3L expression per cell area of 5% and applied that same intensity level as a cutoff for all other experiments (<xref rid="figs4a" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We also set a lower cutoff slightly above background HA levels to exclude NRVMs not expressing exogenous FHOD3L.</p>
<p>We confirmed that sarcomeres remained organized upon mock knockdown, counting 12 ± 13 sarcomeres per cell (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D,E</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). (Measurements from NRVMs are summarized in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>.) Sarcomeres were largely absent in the mock rescue (3 ± 7) with α-actinin puncta and aggregates visible by immunofluorescence (IF) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D,E</xref>). Expression of wild-type FHOD3L was sufficient to rescue the loss of sarcomeres and anti-HA staining demonstrated that exogenous FHOD3L localized to sarcomeres, as expected (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). In fact, FHOD3L-rescued NRVMs formed significantly more sarcomeres than the mock knockdown NRVMs (19 ± 14 vs. 12 ± 13; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). We note that the sarcomere number measurement has a high standard deviation because some cells within the expression level cutoffs, including at relatively high levels of detected FHOD3L, lacked sarcomeres (Figure 4—figure supplement 2F). Such right-tailed distributions are consistent with other reports of sarcomere numbers per cardiomyocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Neininger-Castro et al., 2023</xref>).</p>

<p>To analyze sarcomere integrity more closely, we measured sarcomere lengths (Z-line to Z-line) and widths (Z-line lengths). In the mock rescue cells, the sarcomeres that remained were both shorter and narrower than those in the mock knockdown cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>, G). When rescued with FHOD3L, sarcomere lengths (1.72 ± 0.18 µm) and sarcomere widths (1.70 ± 0.46 µm) recovered to lengths comparable to the mock knockdown control (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>, G). To measure thin filament length, we stained NRVMs with phalloidin and anti-HA. We observed shorter thin filament lengths in FHOD3L-rescued NRVMs (739 ± 81 nm) compared to mock knockdown NRVMs (925 ± 94 nm) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> H,I). The difference in thin filament length could reflect the increased number of sarcomeres in the rescued cells and/or could indicate that the sarcomeres have not reached their final steady state after two days of FHOD3L expression. Overall, FHOD3L-rescued NRVMs form sarcomeres <italic>de novo</italic> that well approximate the sarcomeres in the negative control. We compared further experimental results to FHOD3L rescue cells, due to the slight differences.</p>
<p>We next measured contractile function in FHOD3L-rescued NRVMs. To do so, we used a motionGUI MatLab program that makes use of Digital Image Correlation (DIC) to measure contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Huebsch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Nakano et al., 2017</xref>). Contraction and relaxation velocities inform us about systolic and diastolic function of the cardiomyocytes, respectively, and thus their ability to promote proper blood flow in organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Ferreira-Martins and Leite-Moreira, 2010</xref>). As expected, maximal contraction and relaxation velocities were both significantly decreased upon FHOD3 knockdown (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A,B</xref>,D, <xref rid="figs5a" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Both velocities recovered to mock knockdown levels by subsequent expression of FHOD3L (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A,C</xref>,D, <xref rid="figs5a" ref-type="fig">Figure 5— figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref rid="video2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Video 2</xref>). We also examined expression of FHOD3L in an otherwise untreated background (overexpression). Intensity of exogenous FHOD3L per NRVM was notably lower compared to the wild-type rescue despite infecting with the same titer, suggesting that NRVMs attempt to maintain FHOD3L levels below some maximum (<xref rid="figs5b" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Consistent with this idea, contraction and relaxation velocities were reduced upon overexpression of FHOD3L (<xref rid="figs5b" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>,C). These data further demonstrate that the expression levels in our rescue experiments, while higher on average than endogenous levels, are within an acceptable range.</p>

<p>To assess the impact of FHOD3L depletion on cardiac rhythm, we measured the percentage of beating area in each video that exhibited consistent, rhythmic contractions (defined as no more than 1 beat out of sync in a 10 second period). We observed rhythmic contractions for both the mock knockdown NRVMs and FHOD3L-rescued NRVMs for ∼75% of the analyzed videos (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A,C</xref>,E, <xref rid="video2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Video 2</xref>). In contrast, primarily arrhythmic contractions were detected in FHOD3-depleted NRVMs, with only ∼15% of the videos showing rhythmic beating (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B and E</xref>, <xref rid="video2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Video 2</xref>). To assess whether some NRVMs in these conditions were not contracting at all, we estimated the proportion of NRVMs that were contracting per video and found contractions throughout ∼95% of the field of view on average for both mock knockdown NRVMs and wild-type FHOD3L-rescued NRVMs (<xref rid="figs5a" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). For FHOD3-depleted NRVMs, we observed a reduction in contractile area to ∼80% (<xref rid="figs5a" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This value was higher than expected based on other metrics (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D,E</xref>). We attribute some of the movement to neighboring cells pulling each other. We also quantified contractility when we overexpressed FHOD3L. FHOD3L overexpression did not clearly impact the rhythmic contractions or the area of contraction though variance increased (<xref rid="figs5b" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D,E</xref>), consistent with the idea that, at high enough levels, FHOD3L activity can be detrimental in NRVMs.</p>

<title>Loss of nucleation but not elongation is tolerated for sarcomere formation and cardiac function</title>
<p>Once we established baseline levels of sarcomere structure and contractility in NRVMs with the wild type FHOD3L rescue, we asked which actin organizing activities of FHOD3L are important for its cellular function. To this end, we performed rescue experiments with the nucleation-hindering mutant (K1193L) and the elongation-hindering mutant (GS-FH1). Expression of the K1193L mutant resulted in expression levels similar to wild type (<xref rid="figs6a" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Little to no correlation between FHOD3 expression level and sarcomere metrics was observed (R<sup>2</sup> ranges from 0.003 to 0.2; <xref rid="figs6a" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Overall, cells expressing FHOD3L K1193L were almost indistinguishable from those expressing FHOD3L. FHOD3L K1193L localization was striated (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>) and the number of sarcomeres per NRVM was rescued to wild-type levels (15 ± 16) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Sarcomere lengths and widths were indistinguishable from wild-type (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C,D</xref>). The only statistically significant difference was thin filament length, which was ∼7% longer in the K1193L-rescued NRVMs (792 ± 79 nm) compared to those in FHOD3L-rescued NRVMs (739 ± 81) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>’,E, <xref rid="figs6b" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In agreement with the well-organized, near wild-type appearance of sarcomeres, contraction and relaxation velocities, as well as the proportion of rhythmically contracting NRVMs, were indistinguishable from the FHOD3L rescue (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F,G</xref>, <xref rid="figs6b" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>,C). Thus, ∼70% loss of nucleation, ∼20-fold weaker barbed-end capping, and loss of over 50% of bundling activity had no deleterious impact on FHOD3L’s ability to function in NRVMs.</p>

<p>In contrast, the elongation deficient mutant (GS-FH1) did not rescue FHOD3L loss in NRVMs. Based on total fluorescence per cell, we determined that GS-FH1 levels were lower than observed for wild-type or K1193L, despite infecting a similar proportion of NRVMs (<xref rid="figs6a" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In most cells, the FHOD3L GS-FH1 localization was diffuse (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref rid="figs6b" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In a few cells that probably escaped from RNAi knockdown, we observed striated doublet of FHOD3L GS-FH1 between Z-lines, demonstrating that the protein can fold and localize correctly if sarcomeres are intact (<xref rid="figs6b" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). The turnover rate of GS-FH1 may be higher than wild-type intrinsically or because there were few binding sites available, that is, fewer sarcomeres to which GS-FH1 could bind. Phalloidin staining revealed actin puncta in most cells expressing GS-FH1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>’, <xref rid="figs6b" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). The puncta were smaller than expected for mature sarcomeres but were aligned in some cases, suggesting the possible formation of premyofibrils.</p>
<p>Importantly, GS-FH1 levels detected and analyzed were within the acceptable intensity range we established for FHOD3L (<xref rid="figs6a" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>,B). As was true for the other rescues, there was no correlation between GS-FH1 expression levels and measured sarcomere metrics (R<sup>2</sup> ranges from 0.002 to 0.07; <xref rid="figs6a" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). To further test for any impact due to low protein levels, we identified two subpopulations of FHOD3L rescue cells with HA intensity distributions similar to that of the GS-FH1 cells: the first biological replicate and all cells with HA intensity levels less than 720 a.u./µm<sup>2</sup> (<xref rid="figs6c" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>). We found no significant correlations between HA intensity levels and sarcomere metrics (<xref rid="figs6c" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 3C-E</xref>). Furthermore, we found no difference in sarcomere numbers or Z-line lengths for these subgroups compared to the whole collection of FHOD3L cells (<xref rid="figs6c" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B</xref>). There was a statistically significant, albeit small (∼6%), decrease in the sarcomere lengths of cells in replicate 1 but sarcomere lengths in the HA &lt; 720 group were indistinguishable from the full FHOD3L data set. Based on these findings we conclude that the expression levels in the GS-FH1-rescued NRVMs are high enough to rescue the FHOD3 knock down, in principle, supporting our conclusion that the defect is due to loss of elongation activity.</p>
<p>The sarcomere number per GS-FH1 rescue cell was only 2 ± 4, similar to the mock rescue (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A,B</xref>). Within the sarcomeres detected, sarcomere lengths and widths were both reduced (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C,D</xref>). We were not able to measure thin filament lengths with confidence, due to the lack of sarcomere organization. Not surprisingly, contractility was nearly abolished after rescuing with GS-FH1. Contraction and relaxation velocities were decreased, and contractions were largely arrhythmic (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F,G</xref>, <xref rid="figs6b" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D</xref>,E). We note that barbed-end capping and bundling activities were weaker than wild-type in the GS-FH1 mutant but they were equivalent to or greater than the activities found for the K1193L mutant which rescued well (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B,D</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that elongation activity of FHOD3L is the primary activity required for sarcomere formation, whereas reduced nucleation, barbed-end binding, and bundling activities are well tolerated.</p>

<title>FHOD3L elongation is necessary for sarcomeres in NRVMs</title>
<p>Published rates of nucleation and elongation by formins both vary by at least an order of magnitude. It is generally thought that the specific actin assembly properties of a given formin are set for its function, i.e., the structure this formin will build. To directly test this idea, Homa et al. replaced Cdc12p, the formin critical to <italic>S. pombe</italic> cytokinesis, with several chimeras of differing nucleation strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Homa et al., 2021</xref>). Indeed, they found a strong positive correlation between formins with nucleation strength similar to Cdc12p and their ability to drive cytokinesis. In a computational model that recapitulates yeast cable structure, it was found that nucleation and/or elongation could be tuned to build the cables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">McInally et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, how formins are used is likely to differ from case to case.</p>
<p>We determined that FHOD3L can nucleate <italic>in vitro</italic>, albeit weakly compared to many formins. Unlike in cytokinesis, we found that this activity is not necessary for its function in NRVMs.</p>
<p>The necessity of actin assembly, nucleation and/or elongation, by Fhod-family formins has been questioned but supported by failure of the IA mutation to rescue in multiple species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kan-O et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kimmich et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kutscheidt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Shwartz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Taniguchi et al., 2009</xref>). However, the IA mutation is thought to diminish both nucleation and elongation. To assess the importance of nucleation more specifically, we tested a mutant variant that substantially reduces the nucleation activity without altering elongation (FHOD3L K1193L). This mutant had almost no impact on sarcomere formation or function in NRVMs. The only statistically significant difference we detected was in thin filament length (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). A host of proteins are critical to establishing and maintaining thin filaments at a precise length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Szikora et al., 2022</xref>). No other studies have implicated FHOD3L in this process to date. Thus, we believe that the length difference is more likely to reflect the state of maturity of the cells (time post infection) and/or the number of sarcomeres per cell. While we only have three data points at this time, sarcomere number and thin filament length were highly correlated (inversely) in our experiments, with an R-squared of 0.90.</p>
<p>By rescuing NRVMs with FHOD3L K1193L, we also tested a formin that caps barbed ends with a Kd that is ∼15 times higher than wild type (i.e., ∼15x weaker) and bundles filaments ∼50% less potently than wild type. The fact that the cardiomyocytes were indistinguishable from wild-type when expressing this mutant suggests that neither of these activities are required and, certainly, they are not needed at wild-type levels. Assuming that FHOD3L activities are tuned to meet its <italic>in vivo</italic> functions, these magnitudes of change in activity would be expected to result in measurable phenotypes in function and/or morphology of the cell.</p>
<p>The fact that K1193L has no impact on the elongation properties of FHOD3L <italic>in vitro</italic> and still rescues sarcomeres leads to an indirect conclusion that elongation is the actin assembly activity that is important in NRVMs. Of course, the failure to rescue by FHOD3L GS-FH1, an elongation incompetent mutant, strongly supports this conclusion (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). The elongation properties of FHOD3L are unusual. Its elongation rate is among the highest known, including mDia1 and Cappuccino (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bor et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kovar et al., 2006</xref>). However, processivity is very brief, resulting in filaments of only ∼1 μm. We previously found that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> splice variant FhodA has a similarly short characteristic run length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Patel et al., 2018</xref>). In principle, this characteristic run length is sufficient to build sarcomeric thin filaments, which are about 1 μm long in NRVMs. Notably, a splice variant of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Fhod that only differs by having a shorter tail, FhodB, typically elongates for ∼20 μm and the tails of mammalian and <italic>Drosophila</italic> formins are highly conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bremer et al., 2024</xref>). These observations lead us to question whether processivity of Fhod-family formins is somehow regulated <italic>in vivo</italic> such that it can build short filaments when needed and longer filaments in other contexts. Interestingly, a computational model describing Bni1-built actin cables demonstrates that tuning the length of individual filaments (set by elongation rate and processivity) to cell size is sufficient to account for cable differences in cells of different sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">McInally et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>The FH1 domain strongly influences the elongation rate <italic>in vitro</italic>. In NRVMs, we found that replacement of the FH1 domain with a flexible linker (FHOD3L GS-FH1) resulted in a severe phenotype. These cells had very few sarcomeres. FHOD3L GS-FH1 was indistinguishable from mock rescue in sarcomere number, structure (shorter and narrower), and function (contraction and relaxation velocities are not different). The result could be because the expression level of FHOD3L GS-FH1 was lower, on average, than those for the other constructs. We argue against this based on multiple observations: First, similar expression levels of wild type FHOD3L are sufficient to fully rescue the knock down (<xref rid="figs6c" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Second, despite similar metrics in sarcomere structure and function, the rhythmicity of contraction was markedly diminished compared to the mock rescue (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). Third, we do not believe that the low protein levels reflect protein instability. We detect FHOD3L GS-FH1 bound to residual sarcomeres, suggesting that it folds and is stable when binding sites within sarcomeres are available (<xref rid="figs6b" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). It is possible that the striated appearance of FHOD3L GS-FH1 in cells with sarcomeres is the result of protein stabilization through heterodimerization with residual endogenous FHOD3L. However, we favor a model in which low FHOD3L GS-FH1 levels reflect increased protein turnover due to the absence of sarcomeres.</p>
<p>Recent work in C. elegans is consistent with our findings. Kimmich et al. removed the endogenous coding region of the FH1 domain in worm Fhod-1 (the only worm Fhod gene) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kimmich et al., 2024</xref>). Body wall muscle is severely impacted by this deletion. In addition, they found that profilin is required for Fhod-1 function. Together, these data strongly argue that elongation activity is important. Interestingly, the muscle phenotype is more severe in a strain predicted to delete part of the FH2 domain and the downstream sequence but not the FH1 domain, <italic>fhod-1(tm2363)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kimmich et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Mi-Mi et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, nucleation activity may also be necessary in this animal. Ultimately, complete removal of any domain as we do here with the GS-FH1 mutant may be too blunt of an approach. We expect experiments with modified elongation (e.g. slower or more processive) to provide further insight.</p>

<title>Why does FHOD3L elongate in NRVMs?</title>
<p>Given these new data, what could FHOD3L be doing in the cell? In multiple species, premyofibrils are built but they fail to mature into wild-type myofibrils in the absence of FHOD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kan-O et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kimmich et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Shwartz et al., 2016</xref>). It follows that FHOD3 is not required to build the earliest thin filaments in the sarcomere. Instead, FHOD3 could contribute new thin filaments to expanding, maturing sarcomeres. If this were the case, we might expect nucleation to be more important than our data indicate. Instead, FHOD3L could be responsible for elongating filaments that are nucleated by a different protein. For example, FHOD3L and DAAM could collaborate, or they could contribute to the apparent redundancy and robustness built into sarcomerogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Szikora et al., 2022</xref>). DAAM knockout mice have overlapping cardiac phenotypes with those of the FHOD3 knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kan-O et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Li et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, a lack of sarcomere thickening and loss of sarcomere organization are common phenotypes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> knockdowns of Daam1 and Fhod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Molnár et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Shwartz et al., 2016</xref>). While FHOD3L and DAAM cannot compensate for the loss of one or the other, they might help when one is compromised.</p>
<p>Alternatively, FHOD3L could be reinforcing the Z-line structure to facilitate sarcomere thickening. This idea is consistent with the narrow myofibrils and Z-body disorder observed in worms lacking functional Fhod-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kimmich et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Mi-Mi et al., 2012</xref>). If capping and bundling were important to the Z-line integrity, one would expect to find FHOD3L localized in the Z-line. However, FHOD localization varies between species and with development, suggesting that this role is not conserved, if it exists. In mouse heart tissue, FHOD3L appears to bind directly to MyBP-C which localizes between the Z- and M-lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Matsuyama et al., 2018b</xref>), suggesting that it is not actively stabilizing the Z-line. Thus, transient actin assembly may be sufficient, consistent with our findings that capping and bundling are not essential in NRVMs.</p>

Bright and dim filaments were distinguished manually. Due to the transient nature of the dim portions of filaments generated by FHOD3L constructs, pauses for actin elongation were first visually identified as portions of roughly 0 slope deviating away from the best fit line off the subunits added vs. time plots of elongation. The corresponding times for the duration of the pauses were then more carefully examined. Events were defined as lasting at least 5 seconds, with slopes within -10 and 5. These pauses almost always preceded a burst of elongation by either FHOD3S/L-CT WT or K1193. To estimate the elongation rate, the dim region growth was fit to a line. It was confirmed that the elongation rate reduced back to that of profilin-actin alone when the filament intensity increased.

<p>NRVMs were lysed in 100 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton-X from 8-well chamber slides (Corning, Catalog No. 354118) after rescue experiments and samples were vortexed for 1 minute before centrifuging at 15,000 rpm, 4°C, for 10 minutes. The resulting supernatant was boiled in sample loading buffer at 100°C for 10 minutes and run on an SDS-PAGE gel. The gel was transferred to an Immobilon-FL polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore, IPFL00010) at 100V for 90 minutes on ice. The membrane was blocked in 4% nonfat milk in low-salt TBST (20 mM Tris pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20, 0.01% sodium azide) for 30 minutes at room temperature. It was incubated, rotating at 4°C overnight, with Fhod3 polyclonal rabbit (Abcam, ab224463) or HA monoclonal rabbit (Cell Signaling Technologies, 3724S) and GAPDH monoclonal mouse (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-365062) diluted 1:1000 in low-salt TBST. Membranes were washed 3 times for 5 minutes each the next day in high-salt TBST (20 mM Tris pH 7.6, 500 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20, 0.01% sodium azide) and then incubated for 1 hour at room temperature, shaking, with 800CW goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Li-Cor Biosciences, 926-32211) and 680RD goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Li-Cor Biosciences, 926-68070) diluted 1:10,000 in high-salt TBST. Membranes were washed 3 times for 10 minutes each in high-salt TBST and then imaged on a Li-Cor Odyssey 9120 Infrared Imager (Li-Cor Biosciences).</p>

<title>In vitro contractility assay</title>
<p>Contractility assessments were performed by utilizing a video-based technique with the UCSF Gladstone-developed MATLAB program MotionGUI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Huebsch et al., 2015</xref>). Videos for contractility analysis were acquired using MicroManager software on a Leica SD AF Spinning Disc system using a HC PL Fluotar 10x (0.3 NA) dry objective lens with an ORCA-Flash4.0 LT C11440 camera (Hamamatsu) at 30 fps with live NRVMs incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 (Tokai Hit). The videos were converted from ome.tif to a tiff stack with FIJI for analysis with MotionGUI. A pixel size of 0.538 μm was obtained from the metadata. 8 pixel macroblocks were used for all assessments. All parameters of the MotionGUI program not specified here were set to their respective default values. Motion vectors were calculated, and the data were evaluated upon completion. All videos were subjected to the same post-processing procedures to ensure consistency during comparative analysis. Each video sample was post-processed using neighbor-based cleaning with the vector-based cleaning criterion within the program. The threshold for this post-processing method was set to two for all samples and was adequate for improving the signal-to-noise ratio enough to identify peaks clearly corresponding to beating events in most samples.</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence and image analysis</title>
<p>For sarcomere integrity analysis, NRVMs were stained before fixation with Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA) TMR (Thermo Fisher, Catalog No. W849) for 10 minutes at 37°C with 5 μg/mL WGA, followed by two PBS washes. NRVMs were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Fisher Scientific, Catalog No. AC416780010) in PBS for 15 minutes at 37°C. Cells were washed 3 times in PBS for 5 minutes each at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized and blocked with PBS/0.1% Triton-X/10% Goat Serum (Triton-X: Thermo Fisher, Catalog No. A16046.AP; Goat Serum: Sigma, Catalog No. S26-100ML) for 30 minutes at 37°C. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. α-actinin (mouse) primary antibody (Sigma, Catalog No. A7811) was diluted 1:250 and HA-tag (rabbit) primary antibody (Cell Signaling, Catalog No. 3724) was diluted 1:500 in PBS/0.1% Triton-X/5% Goat Serum. Cells were washed 3 times for 5 minutes each with PBS/0.1% Triton-X/5% Goat Serum at room temperature. Incubation with secondary antibodies was for 1 hour at 37°C. Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse secondary (Thermo Fisher, Catalog No. A-11001) or Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-rabbit secondary (Thermo Fisher, Catalog No. A-21244) was diluted 1:500 in PBS/0.1% Triton-X/5% Goat Serum. Cells were then washed twice in PBS/0.1% Triton-X/5% Goat Serum for 5 minutes each followed by on PBS wash for 5 minutes before mounting in Vectashield Plus Antifade mounting media (Vector Laboratories, Catalog No. H-1900-10) with 1 μg/mL DAPI (Fisher Scientific, Catalog No. EN62248).</p>
<p>For thin filament determination, NRVM’s were incubated with sterile-filtered Ringer’s relaxation buffer (6 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 0.1% glucose, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA) for 20 min., room temperature, followed by a brief PBS wash to start the WGA staining. Fixation and blocking were performed as above. Staining with HA-tag (rabbit) primary antibody Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody were performed as above. Cells were then washed twice in PBS/0.1% Triton-X/5% Goat Serum for 5 minutes each and 200 nM Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin (Thermo Fisher, Catalog No. A12379) was added for 1 hr, room temperature in PBS/1% BSA. Cells were washed with PBS twice for 5 minutes before mounting in Prolong Glass Antifade mountant (Thermo Fisher, Catalog No. P36980) with 1 μg/mL DAPI (Fisher Scientific, Catalog No. EN62248).</p>
<p>Twelve 40X magnification images per biological replicate were acquired using a random coordinate generator (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://onlineintegertools.com/generate-integer-pairs">https://onlineintegertools.com/generate-integer-pairs</ext-link>), excluding the edges of the wells, for quantification of sarcomeres and thin filaments. Sample size with sufficient power was determined via a small-scale pilot study for sarcomere number, length, and width, as well as thin filaments between mock knockdown, mock rescue, and FHOD3L WT rescue followed by inputting averages of the treatments on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~rollin/stats/ssize/n1.html">https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~rollin/stats/ssize/n1.html</ext-link>. Each well was treated as a 16×16 grid of 40X magnification fields of view. 16-bit images were acquired on an AXIO Imager.D1 fluorescence phase contrast microscope (Zeiss) using an EC Plan-Neofluar 40x M27 (0.75 NA) objective lens with an AxioCam MRm camera (Zeiss). Images of NRVMs in figures were acquired with a Plan-Apochromat oil DIC M27 63x (1.4 NA) objective lens for visualization.</p>
<p>Images showing DsRed reporter fluorescence at the end of the rescue timeline for the NRVMs were taken on a CKX53 inverted phase contrast microscope (Olympus) using a UPLFLN 4x (0.2 NA) objective lens (Olympus) with an ORCA-spark digital CMOS camera (Hamamatsu).</p>
<p>Cells were segmented using Cellpose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Stringer et al., 2021</xref>). Two-color images of the WGA membrane stain and nuclear stain were saved as jpeg files on FIJI. These images were then input to the Cellpose environment for batch processing with a cell diameter of 210 pixels, 0.4 cell probability and flow thresholds, 0 stitch threshold, using the cyto2 model for segmentation. The text files of the outlines were saved and overlaid on the respective channels of the images individually using the provided python file from Cellpose as a macro through FIJI (imagej_roi_converter.py). Cellpose segments with no nuclei or 3 or more nuclei, as well as cell segments on the edge of the image were excluded from analysis.</p>
<p>Sarcomere analysis was performed manually in a single-blind manner (for mock knockdown, mock rescue, wild-type rescue, and the K1193L rescue) using blindrename.pl (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/davalencia0914/sarcApp_Cellpose_Merge">https://github.com/davalencia0914/sarcApp_Cellpose_Merge</ext-link>) to generate the filenames and a key filename csv file for decoding after analysis. We attempted to blind all other rescue conditions, but they were too easily identified based on expression level and localization differences. Linescans were generated along myofibrils, perpendicular to the Z-lines to make sarcomere length measurements from Z-line peak to Z-line peak. Z-line lengths were measured by visual inspection of the alpha-actinin channel and measured on FIJI with the line tool. Three or more consecutive Z-lines at least 0.70 µm long in a row were analyzed as sarcomeres.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>To compare two or more groups for the rescue experiments in NRVMs, pair-wise comparisons were performed. In order to reduce Type 1 error rate stemming from multiple comparisons, Bonferroni correction was applied to obtain a corrected alpha. Whether groups were normally distributed or not was determined by the Shapiro-Wilk test. To compare two normally distributed groups, Student’s two-sample, unpaired t-test was used. If either group was not normally distributed, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test was used. The same analysis was applied to analyze run lengths and capping duration from the TIRF seeded elongation assays.</p>
<p>For the nucleation assay, barbed-end binding assays, and TIRF elongation rate analysis, one-way ANOVA’s were performed for 3 treatment comparisons with post-hoc Tukey tests as the variances between all treatments tested were fairly equal.</p>
<p>In all cases when the sample size exceeded 20, we removed outliers from the bottom and upper 2.5% of data to perform all statistical tests, regardless of normality, to avoid introducing bias. However, all plots shown include these outliers.</p>

<p>Valencia et al. combine elegant in vitro biochemical experiments with functional assays in cardiomyocytes to determine which properties of the FHOD3 formin are essential for sarcomere assembly. Using separation-of-function mutants, they show that FHOD3's elongation activity, rather than its nucleation, capping, or bundling activities, is key to its sarcomeric function. This is an <bold>important</bold> finding and the data presented in the manuscript are <bold>convincing</bold>; however, the presence of FHOD3 at filament barbed ends in the TIRF elongation assays should probably be verified directly in a future study.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Formins are complex proteins with multiple effects on actin filament assembly, including nucleation, capping with processive elongation, and bundling. Determining which of these activities are important for a given biological process and normal cellular function is a major challenge.</p>
<p>Here, the authors study the formin FHOD3L, which is essential for normal sarcomere assembly in muscle cells. They identify point mutants of FHOD3L in which formin nucleation and elongation/bundling activities are functionally separated. Expression of these mutants in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes shows that the control of actin filament elongation by formin is the major activity required for normal assembly of functional sarcomeres.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strength of this work is to combine sensitive biochemical assays with excellent work in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. This combination of approaches is highly effective for analyzing the function of proteins with multiple activities in vitro. The authors have pushed the experiments and data analysis as far as possible with the technologies available to them.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>FHOD3L is not the easiest formin to study because of its relatively weak nucleation activity and the short duration of capping events. This difficulty imposes rigorous biochemical analysis and careful interpretation of the data. As the authors acknowledge, it will be important in future to perform complementary multi-color TIRF experiments to confirm that the brief accelerations in the elongation of actin filaments are indeed due to FHOD3 binding.</p>

<p>Valencia et al. aim to elucidate the biochemical and cellular mechanisms through which the human formin FHOD3 drives sarcomere assembly in cardiomyocytes. To do so, they combined rigorous in vitro biochemical assays with comprehensive in vivo characterizations, evaluating two wild type FHOD3 isoforms and two function-separating mutants. Surprisingly, they found that both wild type FHOD3 isoforms can nucleate new actin filaments, as well as elongate existing actin filaments in conjunction with profilin following barbed-end capping. This is in addition to FHOD3's proposed role as an actin bundler. Next, the authors focused on the longer isoform FHOD3L due to its essential role in sarcomere assembly in cardiomyocytes. They asked whether FHOD3L promote sarcomere assembly through its activity in actin nucleation or rather elongation. To do so, the authors designed two function-separating mutants: the K1193L mutation in the FH2 domain, known for its importance in actin nucleation, and the glycine-serine linker substitution in the FH1 domain (&quot;GS-FH1&quot;,) known for its requirement in actin elongation. They demonstrated that while K1193L maintains its elongation activity and greatly diminishes nucleation and bundling, in GS-FH1 keeps its nucleation activity while lose its capacity to drive elongation. Armed with these tools, the authors attempted to rescue FHOD3L siRNA-treated neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVM) with transgenes carrying wild type, K1193L, or GS-FH1 mutant forms of human FHOD3. In each condition, they evaluated the numbers and morphology of sarcomeres, as well as their ability to beat and generate cardiac rhythm. The authors found that while the wild type FHOD3L and the K1193L mutant can rescue sarcomere morphology and physiology, the GS-FH1 mutant fails to do so. Given that in GS-FH1 mainly elongation activity is compromised, the authors concluded that the elongation activity of FHOD3 is essential for its role in sarcomere assembly in cardiomyocytes, while its nucleator activity is dispensable. Overall, this important study provided a broadened view on the biochemical activities of FHOD3, and a pioneering view on a possible cellular mechanism of how FHOD3L drives sarcomere assembly. If further validated, this can lead to new mechanistic models of sarcomere assembly and potentially new therapeutic targets of cardiomyopathy.</p>
<p>The conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported by the comprehensive biochemical analyses performed by the authors. In my original assessment, I raised the point that the extreme low level of GS-FH1 signal in transfected cells in Figure 6A may reflect a failure of actin-binding by this construct in vivo, rather than its inability of driving elongation. The authors have thoroughly addressed this concern by: 1) providing new images of the GS-FH1 rescue condition with HA-FHOD3L signal intensities matching that of the K1193L rescue condition, and 2) quantitatively demonstrating that the expression levels in the GS-FH1 rescue condition are comparable with that of wild type FHOD3L rescue condition. This is nicely complemented by the new phalloidin staining of the GS-FH1 rescue condition, which showcased additional details of actin puncta reminiscent of that present in muscle stress fibers or premyofibrils. Overall, I am now convinced that the GS-FH1 cannot rescue sarcomere formation even when expressed at comparable levels. Given that GS-FH1 demonstrates actin elongation defects in vitro, it is reasonable to conclude that the actin elongation function of FHOD3L is essential for sarcomere formation in vivo.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Formins are complex proteins with multiple effects on actin filament assembly, including nucleation, capping with processive elongation, and bundling. Determining which of these activities is important for a given biological process and normal cellular function is a major challenge.</p>
<p>Here, the authors study the formin FHOD3L, which is essential for normal sarcomere assembly in muscle cells. They identify point mutants of FHOD3L in which formin nucleation and elongation/bundling activities are functionally separated. Expression of these mutants in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes shows that the control of actin filament elongation by formin is the major activity required for the normal assembly of functional sarcomeres.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strength of this work is to combine sensitive biochemical assays with excellent work in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. This combination of approaches is highly effective for analyzing the function of proteins with multiple activities in vitro.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>FHOD3L does not seem to be the easiest formin to study because of its relatively weak nucleation activity and the short duration of capping events. This difficulty imposes rigorous biochemical analysis and careful interpretation of the data, which should be improved in this work.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their praise and appreciation of our work. Indeed, FHOD3L is a challenging formin to work with.</p>
<p>Important points are raised here and below regarding the brief elongation events we reported. As suggested, we performed more rigorous analysis of the data and present it in the revised manuscript. We now report that from 45 dim regions analyzed, in three independent experiments with wild type FHOD3L, we detected 40 bursts. (The remaining five could be formin falling off too quickly to detect or the dim spots could be regions of inhomogeneity in intensity, not due to formin.) For comparison to the presented data with FHOD3L-CT, we analyzed the filaments in TIRF assays with no formin present. As the reviewers point out, inhomogeneities in filament intensity are normal. Thus, we examined any dim spots for pauses and/or bursts. As is now reported in Figure 2G,H, the velocity of growth of these dim spots is indistinguishable from the velocity of the rest of the filament. We acknowledge that our numbers may not be perfectly accurate, due to the noise in our system, we believe that the difference of 3-4 fold increase versus no change in rate is substantial and convincing.</p>
<p>We also determined the number of dim spots per length of filament. We found a higher frequency when FHOD3L-CT or FHOD3S-CT was present vs no formin, as now shown in Figure 2 – supplements 1G and 2E.</p>
<p>We were asked about the pauses we observe before bursts of elongation and how we know they are functionally relevant. The short answer is that we do not know. We reported them because they were so common: Of the 40 bursts, pauses preceded the burst in 38 cases. We cannot rule out that this pause reflects an interaction with the surface but might expect the frequency to be lower if it were. We revise the text to make our conclusions about pauses more circumspect.</p>
<p>We are convinced that the brief dim events we observed in the presence of FHOD3L-CT, in fact, reflect formin-mediated elongation and worked hard to improve their presentation, in addition to the added analysis. We include new kymographs, including examples from FHOD3L, FHOD3S, K1193L, and actin alone. We hope that the reviewers are also convinced.</p>
<p>This does not preclude our interest in the microfluidics and two-color assays, which will be pursued in the future. We have reached out to a colleague who is set up to repeat these measurements with microfluidics-assisted TIRF. The noise should be greatly reduced and the system is also optimal for directly visualizing labeled FHOD3, as suggested. We expect these experimental approaches will provide additional insights.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>This article elucidates the biochemical and cellular mechanisms by which the FHOD-family of formins, particularly FHOD3, contributes to sarcomere formation and contractility in cardiomyocytes. Formins are mainly known to nucleate and elongate actin filaments, with certain family members also exhibiting capping, severing, and bundling activities. Although FHOD3 has been well-established as essential for sarcomere assembly in cardiomyocytes, its precise biochemical functions and contributions to actin dynamics remain poorly understood.</p>
<p>In this study, the authors combine in vitro biochemical assays with cellular experiments to dissect FHOD3's roles in actin assembly and sarcomere formation. They demonstrate that FHOD3 nucleates actin filaments and acts as a transient elongator, pausing elongation after an initial burst of filament growth. Using separation-of-function mutants, they show thatFHOD3's elongation activity - rather than its nucleation, capping, or bundling capabilities - is key for its sarcomeric function.</p>
<p>The experiments have been conducted rigorously and well-analyzed, and the paper is clearly written. The data presented support the authors' conclusions. I appreciate the detailed description and rationale behind the FHOD3 constructs used in this study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are happy to hear others find paper to be clearly written and well described.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>However, I was somewhat surprised and a bit disappointed that while the authors conducted single-color TIRF experiments to observe the effects of FHOD3 on single filaments, they did not use fluorescently labeled FHOD3 to directly visualize its behavior. Incorporating such experiments would significantly strengthen their conclusions regarding FHOD3's bursts of elongation interspersed with capping activity. While I understand this might require a few additional weeks of experiments, these data would add considerable value by directly testing the proposed mechanism.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the suggestion and hope to incorporate a two-color approach soon. As noted, FHOD3L is not always easy to work with and we do not have a functional labeled copy of the protein at this time.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>There is a typo in the word &quot;required&quot; in line number 30. The authors also use fit data to extract parameters in several panels (e.g., Figures 2b, 2d, 3a, and 3b). While these fit functions may be intuitive to actin experts, explicitly describing the fit functions in the figure legends or methods would greatly benefit the broader readership.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for these comments. We updated the indicated figures and described the analysis in greater detail.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Valencia et al. aim to elucidate the biochemical and cellular mechanisms through which the human formin FHOD3 drives sarcomere assembly in cardiomyocytes. To do so, they combined rigorous in vitro biochemical assays with comprehensive in vivo characterizations, evaluating two wild-type FHOD3 isoforms and two function-separating mutants. Surprisingly, they found that both wild-type FHOD3 isoforms can nucleate new actin filaments, as well as elongate existing actin filaments in conjunction with profilin following barbed-end capping. This is in addition to FHOD3's proposed role as an actin bundler. Next, the authors asked whether FHOD3L promotes sarcomere assembly in cardiomyocytes through its activity in actin nucleation or rather elongation. With two function-separating mutants, the authors evaluated the numbers and morphology of sarcomeres, as well as their ability to beat and generate cardiac rhythm. The authors found that while the wild-type FHOD3L and the K1193L mutant can rescue sarcomere morphology and physiology, the GS-FH1 mutant fails to do so. Given that in GS-FH1 mainly elongation activity is compromised, the authors concluded that the elongation activity of FHOD3 is essential for its role in sarcomere assembly in cardiomyocytes, while its nucleator activity is dispensable. Overall, this important study provided a broadened view on the biochemical activities of FHOD3, and a pioneering view on a possible cellular mechanism of how FHOD3L drives sarcomere assembly. If further validated, this can lead to new mechanistic models of sarcomere assembly and potentially new therapeutic targets of cardiomyopathy.</p>
<p>The conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported by the comprehensive biochemical analyses performed by the authors. However, the sarcomere assembly defect phenotype in the GS-FH1 rescue condition requires further investigation, as the extremely low level of GS-FH1 signal in transfected cells in Figure 6A may reflect a failure of actin-binding by this construct in vivo, rather than its inability to drive elongation. Though the authors do show in Figure 6 that GS-FH1 can bind to normal-looking sarcomeres when they are present, this may be due to a lack of siRNA activity in these cells, such that endogenous FHOD3L is still present. In this possible scenario, GS-FH1 may dimerize with endogenous FHOD3L. The authors should demonstrate that GS-FH1 alone can indeed interact with existing actin filaments in vivo. While this has been clearly demonstrated in vitro, given the more complex biochemical environment in vivo where additional unknown binding partners may present, cautions should be made when extrapolating findings from the former to the latter.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is concerned about the low protein levels in the GS-FH1 rescue experiments as reflected in the HA fluorescence intensity distributions shown in Fig. 5 Supplement 2A. While the scenario proposed could explain our observations with the GSFH1 rescues it is quite complex. Nor does the scenario preclude the conclusion that the FH1 domain is critical. We agree that the observed sarcomeres are likely to be residual in cells with incomplete RNAi. We now include the image of a cell that is still full of sarcomeres and note that the GH-FH1 is expressed at a relatively high level and striated throughout the cell. We interpret this as evidence that GS-FH1 is stable when suitable binding sites are available. We cannot exclude that there is more GS-FH1 because there was more endogenous FHOD3L with which to heterodimerize. If the GS-FH1 heterodimer were simply poisoning the wild type protein, we do not expect that it would be bound correctly to sarcomeres. If, instead, heterodimers have some activity, it seems far from sufficient to rescue sarcomere formation, suggesting that two functional FH1 domains are critical.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we do not see evidence of correlation between protein levels and rescue at the level present in these cells (addressed below). Unfortunately, the proposed IP to test whether FHOD3L binds actin in vivo would only potentially report on filament side binding (both direct and indirect). It would not address whether the GS-FH1 mutant functions as a nucleator, elongator, bundler and/or capping protein in vivo.</p>
<p>The critical question that we can address is whether the phenotype is due to low protein levels, assuming the protein present is functional, or due to loss of elongation activity by FHOD3L. To address this question, we returned to our data.</p>
<p>First, we plotted the distributions of the intensities of the cells we analyzed further, in addition to the automated readout of all of the cells in the dish (Fig. 4 supplement 1). These cells were selected randomly and, as should be the case, the distributions of their intensities agree well with the original distributions for the three different rescue constructs: FHOD3L, K1193L, and GS-FH1 (Fig. 6 supplement 1). We then asked whether there was any correlation in HA intensities with the sarcomere metrics. As seen in our pilot data, no correlation is evident in any of the three cases across the range of intensities we collected (400 – 2700 a.u.) (old Fig. 6 supplement C,D,E). We now replace the data from pilot experiments with analysis of HA intensities and sarcomere metrics from the data sets included in the paper (new Fig 6. Supplement 1). Again, little to no correlation was observed (the single highest r-squared value is 0.2 and the remaining eight values are less than or equal to 0.08).</p>
<p>To more specifically address the question of whether low HA fluorescence intensity is likely to reflect sufficient protein levels to build sarcomeres we re-examined two data sets from the FHOD3L WT rescue data. We found that, by chance, the first replicate of data from the wild type rescue has a comparable intensity distribution to that of the GSFH1 rescues (580 +/- 261 / cell vs. 548 +/- 105 / cell). In addition, we collected all of the data from cells with intensity levels &lt;720, designed to mimic the distribution of the GS-FH1 cells (Fig. 6 supplement 3). We then compared the sarcomere metrics (sarcomere number, sarcomere length, sarcomere width) between the full data set and the two low intensity subsets:</p>
<p>•   Sarcomere number is the only non-normal metric. We therefore used the Mann Whitney U test, which shows no difference between all 3 WT distributions.</p>
<p>•   We compared Z-line lengths by one-way ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc tests, again finding no significant difference for all distributions.</p>
<p>•   Sarcomere length shows a weakly significant difference (p=0.038) between the whole WT data set and bio rep 1, but no difference between the whole WT data set and the HA&lt;720 group.</p>
<p>Thus, cells expressing wild type FHOD3L at levels comparable to levels detected in GS-FH1 mutant rescues, are fully rescued. Based on these findings we conclude that the expression levels in the GS-FH1 are high enough to rescue the FHOD3 knock down, supporting our conclusion that the defect is due to loss of elongation activity. We have added this analysis and discussion to the revised manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewing Editor Comments:</bold></p>
<p>You will see that the 3 reviewers are very positive about your work and appreciate the elegant combination of biochemical assays and functional tests in cardiomyocytes. We've had a long discussion with them and we all agree that two experiments deserve further effort to make the conclusions of your paper more convincing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The first experiment is the TIRF elongation assay, where the two biochemist Reviewers remain doubtful that these short events are really due to the presence of a formin at the end of the filament. One of them suggests that two-color imaging with a labeled formin should clearly prove this point.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the elongation assays can be improved. Given the similarity of processivity of Fhod3L, Fhod3S and Drosophila FhodA (measured by a distinct method), we are inclined to believe them. However, the reviewer raises an excellent point about the accuracy of the measurements given the resolution (and noise) of the data. We are interested in the two-color imaging assay but do not believe it will necessarily simplify the analysis. We suspect that Fhod spends more time at/near the barbed end than is apparent based on elongation rates. The fact that we see repeated events on individual filaments at such low concentrations of FHOD3L (0.1 nM) supports this idea. Otherwise, the likelihood of FHOD3L finding barbed ends so often is really quite low.</p>
<p>We will return to these experiments, using alternate methods, curious to see what else we learn. In the meantime, we conducted more thorough analysis, including controls, and improved visualization of example traces. Data for elongation analysis and kymographs were acquired with Jfilament. We stretched the x-axis (time) in kymographs for FHOD3L-CT (Fig. 2F), FHOD3S-CT (Fig. 2, supplement 2C), FHOD3L-CT K1193L (Fig. 3, supplement 1A), and actin alone (Fig 2G), and highlighted regions of analysis. The slopes for these regions, separated based on intensity, were fit to the data in KaleidaGraph. The fits are offset from the data such that they do not obscure the filaments and corresponding rates are given. The fact that we never see fast dim regions when FHOD3 is not present, as shown in Fig. 2H and that the frequency of dim events is markedly increased (Fig. 2-supplements 1G and 2E) give us confidence that the events are real. We acknowledge in the text that the precise values of the short events may be inaccurate due to the resolution of our experiments. We hope the reviewers are convinced by the improved analysis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The second experiment is the sarcomere assembly defect phenotype in the GS-FH1 rescue condition. This requires further investigation, as the extremely low level of GS-FH1 signal in transfected cells in Figure 6A may reflect a failure of actin-binding/nucleation in vivo, rather than its inability to elongate F-actin. Although you show that GS-FH1 can bind to sarcomeres when they are present, this may be due to a lack of siRNA activity in these cells, such that endogenous FHOD3L is still present. In this possible scenario, GS-FH1 could dimerize with endogenous FHOD3L.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the sarcomeres we see are likely to be residual and could reflect some remaining endogenous FHOD3. The reviewers are concerned about the low protein levels in the GSFH1 rescues. First, we do not agree that the levels are “extremely” low. Through careful analysis, we established that 3xHA-FHOD3L intensities between 300 and 3000 a.u./um<sup>2</sup> were sufficient for full rescue. The mean for the GSFH1 experiments is 533 +/- 93, which is well within this range. Furthermore, we did not observe correlation between sarcomere number, length, or width and HA intensity over the full range collected for wild type FHOD3L or within the GS-FH1 data. We previously showed pilot data but now show correlation analysis for every analyzed cell (Fig. 4 – figure supplement 1 D-F). We conducted this analysis on all of the mutant rescue experiments (Fig. 6-supplement 1). Finally, we identified two subpopulations of the wildtype rescue data. One is all of the cells with HA intensity &lt; 720, which gives a distribution of mean 545 +/- 85. The second set is the first biological replicate of wild type rescue, which has a distribution of mean 560 +/- 160. Again correlation shows little relationship between HA levels and sarcomere metrics. Nevertheless, we show intensity level matched images in Fig 6, as opposed to images reflecting average intensities.</p>
<p>The critical question remains whether the phenotype is due to low protein levels or due to loss of elongation by FHOD3L. Notably, we now show a cell that is full of sarcomeres and has relatively high FHOD3L levels as well, consistent with available binding sites stabilizing mutant protein but not ruling out heterodimerization (Fig. 6 – figure supplement 2C). Others have expressed mutant FHOD3L in a wild type background in mice. They observed poisoning, consistent with heterodimerization. Thus, it is possible that, as suggested, the FHOD3L-GSFH1 detected in sarcomeres is in fact heterodimerized with residual endogenous FHOD3L. In this case, we would still conclude that the protein is not functional enough to rescue, supporting a role for the FH1 domain.</p>
<p>In the future, we plan to perform experiments with compromised, but not inactive, FH1 domains, as we discuss in the paper.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>We hope that you will find these comments useful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, the comments were thoughtful and helped us write a better paper. Thank you.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Some experiments should be described and analyzed more carefully. This lack of clarity calls into question the interpretation of some experiments. Overall, this study is not yet as convincing as it should be.</p>
<p>Main recommendations:</p>
<p>(1) Formin elongation phases in the TIRF experiment are not convincing. They are rare and it is difficult to see any significant difference between the control movie without FHOD3L-CT and the movie with FHOD3L-CT. Filaments assembled in the absence of FHOD3L-CT also show some fluorescence inhomogeneity (which is normal), and measurements of formin elongation rates and capping times are not convincing (for example, the kymograph of the control profilin-actin situation in Figure 2F also shows a fast elongation phase on the right).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please see response above. We conducted more thorough analysis and created improved visualizations. We hope the data are more convincing now.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It is also difficult to understand how an accurate measurement can be made from these noisy kymographs, and the method section should explain that precisely.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a valid point. We added details of analysis to the methods section and we discuss the fact that the measurements are at the limit of our resolution in the paper. We rely on the large (~3-fold) difference in elongation, more than specific elongation rates for our interpretation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>One of the problems is that these events are too transient to quantify well with noisy data. I noticed that the formin concentration used in these movies is quite low (0.1 nM FHOD3L-CT). Is there a reason for this? Is it possible to increase the formin concentration to increase the number of formin capping/elongation events and provide more convincing movies?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge that the data are noisy. We felt that it was necessary to perform experiments with filaments only tethered at one end, leaving the growing end free. We did so, in part, because when we did experiments with biotinylated actin to anchor the filaments down, we observed pauses in the absence of formin. Ultimately, we compromised, using anchored seeds and a relatively low concentration of NEM-myosin to decrease motion of the actin filaments.</p>
<p>The experiments were performed with such low FHOD3L-CT because it was a potent nucleator in TIRF assays, making data analysis nearly impossible with more formin present. FHOD3S-CT and FHOD3L-CT K1193L behaved somewhat differently between these experiments and we were able to perform them with 1 nM formin.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Not seeing formin at the tip of the filaments is an additional difficulty because we do not know if these pauses occur because formin is stuck to the coverslips (which could very well happen with these sticky proteins) or freely bound at the end of a filament as the text suggests. Is there any argument in favor of one scenario over the other?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This will be an important experiment. As described above, we suspect that Fhod spends more time at/near the barbed end than is apparent based on elongation data. The fact that we see repeated events on individual filaments at such low concentrations of FHOD3L (0.1 nM) supports this idea. Otherwise, the likelihood of FHOD3L finding barbed ends so often is really quite low. In order to address the question about the cause of pauses, we reviewed our data, finding that 38 of 40 bursts were preceded by pauses. We do, however, discuss that we cannot rule out non-specific interactions with the surface.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Pyrene elongation assays in the presence of profilin are actually more convincing to test the elongation ability of formins. However, such an assay is not presented for all mutants. It should be.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While we agree to some extent with this comment, we did not include the pyrene data for all of the mutants because the shapes of the curves were even more complicated than those seen with wild type FHOD3L-CT rendering them uninterpretable.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Some experiments (e.g. in Figure 2E) are performed with yeast profilin, while others (e.g. in Figure 2F) are performed with human profilin. Obviously, both profilins could modulate formin activity differently and the side-by-side interpretation of both experiments is difficult. Could the authors stick to human profilin for all experiments?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We used to always perform pyrene assays with yeast profilin because it was known to be insensitive to pyrene. These data were collected before we realized that the affinity of human profilin for actin is so high that we could probably do everything with this profilin. We have compared the two profilins for other formins, e.g. Delphilin, Capu, and did not observe detectable differences.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor recommendations:</p>
<p>(1) The pyrene assays with the light blue colored curve choice are not ideal. I have difficulties seeing some of the curves.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you. We added symbols to a subset of the traces to make them more visible.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In the same curves, I can't understand what the +3.75 and 0.078 numbers mean. Could these results be plotted in a clearer way?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>These values are the lowest concentrations in the range tests. They were matching light blue with black outline for visibility. We added symbols and changed the color of the numbering for improved visibility/understanding.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In Figure 2D, is the Kd of I1163A really determined only from 2 experimental data points?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Of course not. We now show the figure with extended axes in Fig. 2 - figure supplement 1C.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In Figure 2C, the shape of the curves suggests that this is not a pure capping assay, but a mix of capping and nucleation. It's not dramatic but could lead to an under-estimation of the capping efficiency.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that the complicated shapes confound interpretation. Our analysis is based on the earliest slopes, in part, for this reason. We added discussion of this complication to the text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Suggestions for additional experiments:</p>
<p>(1) To evaluate whether GS-FH1 alone can indeed interact with existing actin filaments in vivo, the authors may consider performing immunoprecipitation assays with GS-FH1 extracted from rescued NRVMs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>An IP of GS-FH1 from cells could show actin filament side binding but, unfortunately, will not provide any information about filament end binding, which is of much greater interest.</p>

<p>It will be helpful to show phalloidin staining in GS-FH1 rescues in a similar manner as in Figure 6-supplement 1, panel B, and compare that with mock rescue in Figure 4 panel D. It will be essential to prove this prior to concluding that actin elongation activity is essential for sarcomere assembly.</p>

<p>This is an excellent suggestion. We now include images of phalloidin stained cells from both K1193L and GS-FH1 rescues (Fig. 6A’ – supplement 2A,B). We were intrigued to see small actin punctae that were sometimes aligned. We speculate that these could be pre-premyofibrils and suggest that this is further evidence that the GS-FH1 protein is not completely unstable.</p>

<p>(2) Prior to sarcomere assembly, a-actinin is known to form short bundles with actin filaments (I-Z-I complex) without clearly defined periodicity. This semi-ordered state then transforms into the more ordered sarcomeres with periodic spacing. It will be valuable to show the phalloidin staining in addition to the a-actinin IF consistently across all conditions. This may lead to further insights into the defects of sarcomere assembly. Along the same vein, higher magnification images showcasing several sarcomeres will help the readers evaluate these defects.</p>

<p>We agree that there are additional valuable measurements to be made. In order to favor synchronized contraction, we plated the cells at too high a density to reliably identify IZI complexes. We have included some zoomed in images of the phalloidin staining.</p>

<p>Recommendations for improving the writing:</p>
<p>The authors mentioned the interaction between cardiac MyBP-C and FHOD3L as essential for the localization of FHOD3L to the C-line of the sarcomere. Can they discuss whether this interaction is important for the role of FHOD3L in sarcomere assembly? If so, how?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a very interesting question that we cannot answer at this time.</p>
