<title>Summary</title><p>A dramatic shift from aggressive infanticidal to paternal behaviors is an essential event for male mice after mating. While the central part of the medial preoptic area (cMPOA) has been shown to critically mediate the paternal behaviors in mice, how this brain region becomes activated by mating and subsequent interaction with pups has not been investigated. Here, we demonstrate that the reduction in inhibitory synaptic strength towards the cMPOA provided by posterior-dorsal medial amygdala (MePD) neurons is a key event for the post-mating behavioral shift in males. Consistent with this, we found optogenetic disinhibition of Me<sup>Cartpt</sup> to the cMPOA synapses reduces male aggression towards pups. The cMPOA of paternal mice mediated pup-induced neural plastic changes in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. These findings provide possible functions of cMPOA neural circuits required for the reception to young in male mice.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Reproductive behavior in male includes courting, mating and parental behavior. Polygynous male mammals, which form reproductive groups with one male and multiple females, often show aggressive behavior toward un-familiar infant conspecifics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Infanticide of non-offspring young is commonly believed to improve reproductive success by achieving a shorter inter-birth interval for females, a situation more favorable to breeding lower competition for resources, and the avoidance of misdirected paternal investment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. After mating, however, the same male gradually stops committing infanticide and becomes paternal, even toward non-biological offspring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. This behavioral transition from infanticide to paternal care in C57BL/6 male mice is shown to require not only the experience of ejaculation but also cohabitation with the pregnant female<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. The exact neural mechanisms governing this behavioral transition through social experiences with female and infant remained unknown.</p>
<p>The medial preoptic area (MPOA) has been identified as one of the most important brain regions regulating parental behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Within the MPOA, the central part (cMPOA), located ventral to the cluster of magnocellular oxytocin neurons (the anterior commissural nucleus), appears to play a pivotal role in parental behavior because bilateral cMPOA lesions abolished this behavior and promoted infanticide in both maternal and paternal mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Likewise, optogenetic activation of the MPOA in virgin male mice delayed infanticidal behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. However, the neural circuit mechanisms controlling the MPOA neuronal activities were unclear. Previously, we reported that behavioral mode transition from infanticide to parental was initiated by lesions of vomeronasal organ (VNO), which transmits olfactory information to the accessory olfactory bulb<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Similar results were obtained in the experiment using genetically mutated mice with impaired vomeronasal signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Tracing studies using classical retrograde tracer or rabies virus indicate that sensory information from accessary olfactory system is mediated by the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) and the medial amygdala (Me) and is transmitted to the MPOA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. It is reported that aggressive behavior toward pup is elicited by activation of GABAergic Me<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The present study evaluates the efficacy of synaptic transmission from the Me to putative cMPOA neurons from three groups: (i) virgin males, (ii) males that experienced mating and pup exposure, and (iii) an intermediate stage, males that experienced mating but had not pup exposure, referred to as âfather in gestation experiences (FGE)â <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). We observed that inhibitory inputs from the Me to cMPOA were suppressed before pup delivery, leading to cMPOA disinhibition. Optogenetic inhibition of MeâcMPOA synapses significantly reduced the proportion of mice showing aggressive behavior toward pups. Furthermore, we found paternal experiences increased synaptic inhibition in the rhomboid nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTrh), one of a downstream structure of the MPOA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Together, findings indicate that alterations in plasticity at MeâcMPOA synapses occur as a result of social experience with a female partner, which may function to prime a shift in behavioral response toward pups. This is followed by paternal experience with pups inducing changes in BSTrh.</p>

<title>Cart positive Me neurons project to the cMPOA and respond to pup exposure</title>
<p>To map the projections from the Me to cMPOA, we took advantage of the high expression of the peptide, cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (Cart), in the subpopulation of posterior-dorsal Me (MePD) neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Within the Me, clusters of Cart-positive neurons were visualized in the MePD by immunostaining with an anti-Cart antibody (Fig. S1A). We infused biotin dextran amine (BDA), an anterograde neuron tracer, into the Cart-positive area of the Me (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) and observed neural projections descending between fornix and anterior commissure (AC) and entering the cMPOA were observed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C, D</xref>). The cMPOA is located ventral to the anterior commissural nucleus, which contains magnocellular oxytocin neurons and thus could be visualized using an antibody for the oxytocin-associated protein neurophysin I (NPI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. In contrast to the Cart-positive area of the Me, the Cart-negative area did not send a dense projection to the cMPOA regardless of tiny BDA leak in the Cart-positive area of the Me (Fig. S1B-E). We observed neural activity marker, cFos expression in MPOA regions receiving projection from Me in Cart-positive regions, with different trends between the paternal and virgin groups, with cFos expression tending to be higher in the paternal group in cMPOA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E, F</xref>). Next, we infused an AAV vector encoding Cre-dependent eYFP into the Me of Cartpt (which encodes Cart)-Cre mice for pathway identification, and we observed a clear Cre-dependent eYFP expression in Me<sup>Cartpt</sup> neurons and eYFP-labeled projections into the cMPOA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>), consistent with the tracer study (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, we investigated the neural activity of Me<sup>Cartpt</sup> neurons after exposure to pups. Cartpt-Cre: Ai9 reporter mice showed that 21.2% of NeuN-positive neurons in MePD were Cartpt (tdTomato) positive (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). We exposed three pups to Cartpt-Cre: Ai9 -FGE mice for four days, and as the days passed, the proportion of mice showing aggressive behavior decreased, while the number of parental individuals increased (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>); mice showing aggressive and parental respectively on day four were perfused with PFA 90 min after the end of the behavioral test. The results of the immunohistochemical analysis showed a significant increase of c-Fos positive Cartpt-neurons in the aggressive and parental groups compared to the control group but no difference between the aggressive and parental groups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J, K</xref>).</p>

<title>Sensitivity to GABAergic synaptic inputs from the Me to the cMPOA are suppressed by mating experience and cohabitation with a late gestational female</title>
<p>We infused an AAV vector to express blue light-sensitive channelrhodopsin, ChR2(H134R) in Me<sup>Cartpt</sup> neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). After incubation periods, we performed whole-cell patch clamp recordings from cMPOA neurons in slices prepared from these mice. Application of blue light to brain slices, including the cMPOA, depolarized the synaptic terminals derived from Me<sup>Cartpt</sup> neurons and induced both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents in cMPOA neurons; as expected, control group mice expressing only eYFP did not show light-evoked synaptic responses (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-D</xref>). We evaluated social experience-dependent synaptic changes at both excitatory and inhibitory pathways. At the recording potential (â60 mV), glutamatergic and GABAergic ionotropic receptor currents should flow in the opposite direction. Thus, glutamatergic and GABAergic predominance can be distinguished by the net change in membrane current. Because of the abundance of GABAergic neurons in the MePD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, including retrogradely labeled cMPOA projecting MePD neurons (Fig. S2), we chose an experimental protocol that emphasized the EPSC amplitude. The driving force for EPSC and IPSC, calculated by subtraction of the recording potential (â60 mV) and reversal potential (â1 mV for EPSC, â87 mV for IPSC calculated by Nernst equation), was about 59 mV and 27 mV, respectively. Under this experimental protocol, we counted cMPOA neurons expressing predominantly blue light-induced EPSCs or IPSCs by the net membrane current change. Whereas 83.3% of cMPOA neurons were IPSC-dominant in virgin male mice, only 21.4% were IPSC-dominant in FGE males (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). In addition, we observed that intracellular perfusion of a membrane-impermeable G-protein signaling blocker GDPÎ²S into the cMPOA neurons reversed the ratio of IPSC-dominant neurons in FGE males to the level of virgin males. The data presented suggest that experiencing mating and cohousing with a pregnant female changes the excitatory/inhibitory (E-I) balance at synaptic transmission from Me<sup>Cartpt</sup> into the cMPOA. Whereas application of tetrodotoxin (TTX) blocked light-induced synaptic current, an additional application of 4-aminopyridine rescued, suggesting the monosynaptic projection at the Me<sup>Cartpt</sup>-cMPOA pathway (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>).</p>

<p>Such changes in E-I balance could be caused by an increased excitatory or a decreased inhibitory synaptic function. We analyzed spontaneous postsynaptic currents in the cMPOA and found changes in the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) but no differences in amplitude. A comparison of relative frequencies showed a trend towards less frequent intervals of sIPSC in the paternal and FGE groups than in virgin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H-K</xref>). No differences were found in spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs, Fig. S3A-E).</p>
<p>Next, we applied electrical stimulation on the fiber inputs including those from Cart-positive Me to the cMPOA. Similar to FGE mice, paternal mice showed a significant level of decreased eIPSP amplitude in the cMPOA compared with the virgin mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2L</xref>). In addition, intracellular infusion of GDPÎ²S reversed eIPSP amplitude in the paternal group. Average evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (eEPSPs) amplitudes did not differ between the groups (Fig. S3F). We also addressed the effects of pregnant female exposure alone (i.e., without the experience of copulation and delivery) on virgin males (virgin male with late gestation; VMLG group, Fig. S4A) or sexual experience without staying until late gestation of female partner (male with mating experience; MME, Fig. S4D). As a result, eIPSP amplitude in the cMPOA in VMLG and MME mice was not changed (Fig. S4B and S4E), suggesting that either mating experience or cohabitation with a late gestational female was not enough to reduce eIPSP amplitude in the cMPOA. There were no significant differences in the passive membrane properties of cMPOA neurons among the groups (Table S1). In behavioral test, most mice showed aggression on the first day in both groups; in the VMLG group, this did not change throughout the four days, whereas in the MME group, some mice showed parental behavior as the experimental days passed (Fig. S4C, F).</p>
<p>To address the recorded cell type in the cMPOA, we prepared cell samples using the same experimental methods as patch clamp recordings were manually collected using a glass pipette. RNA-seq analysis was performed to evaluate mRNA expression levels. Six samples were combined and represented as data for one mouse. Table S2 lists the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in cMPOA neurons among virgin, FGE, and paternal mice. Further, we evaluated the expression levels of 21 representative genes previously reported in activated MPOA neurons during social behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> to explore the recorded neuronâs cell type in this study and found no difference in their expression levels among the groups. Among all samples, the expression level of <italic>Galanin</italic> (<italic>Gal</italic>) was the highest (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2M</xref>). We visualized <italic>Galanin</italic> mRNA-positive neurons with Alexa Fluor 647 using <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization chain reaction (HCR). We observed a banded <italic>Galanin</italic>-expressing region extending ventrally from the posterior part of the anterior commissure (AC) and covering the cMPOA region (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2N</xref>). Also, the cell types of the recorded neurons in our experimental protocol were addressed by co-staining of post hoc <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization and visualization of biocytin by reacting it with streptavidin conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). We observed that 85.0% (34 in 40 cells) of the recorded neurons were positive for <italic>Galanin</italic> mRNA co-staining (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2O, P</xref>). When the average evoked inhibitory postsynaptic potential amplitude was compared in the neuron confirmed as <italic>Galanin</italic>-positive, the FGE group showed significantly smaller than the virgin group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2Q</xref>), as seen in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2L</xref>. These meticulous findings suggest that mating and cohabitation with a female before pup delivery induces synapse plastic changes in the cMPOA of male mice, which densely includes <italic>Galanin</italic>-positive neurons.</p>

<p>Next, we infused an AAV vector encoding ChR2 and vLWO into the Me of virgin Cartpt-Cre mice to confirm the inhibitory effects of vLWO at the synaptic terminal (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3G</xref>). After more than four weeks, brain slices were prepared and recorded from cMPOA neurons. A green light could affect ChR2, and therefore, instead of using green light as above, the red light was used to stimulate the vLWO. The amplitude of blue light-induced IPSC was significantly reduced by vLWO activation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3I</xref>). Furthermore, the suppressed synaptic inputs from the Me<sup>Cartpt</sup> to the MPOA could result in reduced direct synaptic transmission and in more frequent inhibitory synaptic currents by disinhibition of surrounding interneurons. To address this hypothesis, we observed spontaneous IPSCs (sIPSC) in each cMPOA neuron before and after inhibiting inputs from the Me<sup>Cartpt</sup> via vLWO activation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3J-L</xref>). Within 25 recorded neurons, sIPSC frequency was increased by more than 10% in 13 neurons and reduced by more than 10% in 1 neuron. The average frequency of the sIPSC in cMPOA was significantly increased (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3L</xref>). The application of TTX blocked the effects of vLWO activation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3M</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3N</xref>). These data suggest that inhibition of the Me<sup>Cartpt</sup> inputs to the cMPOA could modify the activity of each neuron in the cMPOA by acting on an inter-neuronal network.</p>

<title>In vivo optogenetic inhibition of Me-cMPOA inputs suppresses infanticidal behavior</title>
<p>Next, we aimed to address the causal relationship between synapse plastic changes in the cMPOA and behavioral changes. To address the behavioral causality of the impaired Me-cMPOA inputs, we infused an AAV vector encoding vLWO into the Me of virgin Cartpt-Cre mice, and two optic fibers were bilaterally implanted above the cMPOA for optogenetic stimulation. While the green light was delivered to the cMPOA, three pups were exposed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). The proportion of vLWO-expressing mice that did not show infanticidal behavior was more significant than in the control group. About this relative frequency of behavioral patterns, we found statistically significant differences between the vLWO and the control group (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). After a four-day test with a green light application, subject mice were exposed to pups again without the green light application. As a result, a similar proportion of subject mice as day four did not infanticide again. The latency to first sniffing did not differ significantly between the vLWO group and control group (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Latency and probability of each mouse committing infanticide throughout test days were shown in the survival curve (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Because we detected altered GABAergic neurotransmission in the cMPOA of FGE and paternal mice, we tested the effects of inhibition of the Me input to cMPOA in vGAT-IRES-Cre mice. As a result, similar trends to the case of Carpt-Cre mice were observed in vGAT-IRES-Cre mice with statistically significant differences (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E-I</xref>). These data suggest that inhibition of the Me inputs, mainly GABAergic, to the cMPOA disrupts aggression of virgin male mice toward pup without minimal effect on investigation motivation.</p>

<title>Paternal experience enhances inhibitory transmission in the BSTrh through a postsynaptic mechanism</title>

<p>We hypothesized that the cMPOA plays a critical role in increasing inhibition in the BSTrh. To evaluate this hypothesis, we specifically lesioned the MPOA. To this end, we bilaterally injected NMDA into the cMPOA in virgin and paternal mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref> and S5) and, 3 to 9 days later, performed whole-cell recordings from BSTrh. In the BSTrh of ipsilaterally lesioned paternal mice, the average eIPSP amplitude was significantly smaller than in unlesioned paternal mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). These data strongly suggest that the increased inhibitory input to the BSTrh is mediated by the cMPOA in mice showing paternal behavior. It should be noted that cMPOA fiber inputs into BSTrh were not likely stimulated to evoke synaptic responses in the current protocol because cMPOA lesion unchanged eIPSP amplitude in virgin mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>).</p>
<p>We next addressed whether this increased inhibition onto the BSTrh occurs through a pre-or post-synaptic mechanism. There were no significant differences in passive membrane properties among the three groups (Table S3). We carried out a patch-clamp analysis on BSTrh of paternal group mice. We found out that while inclusion of the GDPÎ²S in the pipette does reduce the amplitude of eIPSPs to the level of the virgin group (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>), eEPSP did not show apparent changes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>). These data suggest that the increased eIPSP amplitude in the BSTrh occurs mainly by the postsynaptic mechanisms. We also analyzed the paired-pulse ratios to compare the release probability from presynaptic terminal and found out that the ratio of eEPSCs and eIPSCs did not differ between paternal and virgin groups (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>). Altogether, we conclude that the cMPOA in the paternal mice mediates plastic changes at GABA synapses in the BSTrh mainly by the postsynaptic mechanisms, and these sequential events are centrally involved in the fundamental switch in the paternal behaviors of the father animals.</p>

Here, virgin male mice at postnatal day 28 experienced pup exposure four times per week and repeated three, six, and eight weeks. No attacks on pups were observed during this period. At 12 weeks old, we tested the behavioral pattern in response to pup exposure (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). As a result, consecutive pup exposures did not result in infanticide on pups beyond sexual maturity; instead, each mouse exhibited pup retrieval to the nest. The proportion of pup-sensitized mice showing infanticide increased in proportion to the length of the gap between the end of pup exposure and the behavioral test (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we examined the inhibitory synaptic change in pup-sensitized mice upon experience with the pup for eight weeks. The amplitude of eIPSPs in the cMPOA in pup-sensitized males was similar to that of control males without experience of sensation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). On the other hand, the amplitude of eIPSPs in the BSTrh in pup ed male were potentiated compared with control males (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>) as seen in paternal mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). These data suggest that the experiences with pup sensitization encode inhibitory synapse in the BSTrh.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results showed that multi-step plastic synapse changes correlate with the transition from infanticidal to parental behavior in male mice (Fig. S6). The synapses from Me<sup>Cartpt</sup> neurons in the cMPOA were altered by interactions with females (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Optogenetic inhibition of the Me<sup>Cartpt</sup> - cMPOA pathway resulted in impaired aggression of virgin male mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), suggesting plastic change in Me<sup>Cartpt</sup> -cMPOA synapses is the potential trigger for the behavioral transition from virgin to FGE. In addition, the shift from FGE to paternal was accompanied by an increased BSTrh inhibition (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). These plastic changes caused the change of E/I balance, which correlated positively with the neuronal activity of the cMPOA and BSTrh when virgin or paternal males were contacted with pups.</p>
<p>The Me has been implicated in various social behaviors, including social investigation, mating, and aggression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. In males, the functional association between the Me and the MPOA is critical for mating behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. The Me comprises several subdivisions with neural activity patterns, distinct projections and cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, including the MePD, a sexually dimorphic nucleus crucial for aggressive behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. In the present study, we focused on Cartpt, which has been reported to be enriched in two of the 16 clusters of the Me<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Cartpt-positive neurons were more responsive to pups than to neutral objects (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J, K</xref>). These data support the importance of investigating the contribution of the Me<sup>Cartpt</sup>-MPOA pathway in the neural mechanisms of social behavior.</p>
<p>Each subpopulation of Me neurons might specifically control some cMPOA neurons and the associated behavioral pattern. Our targeted cMPOA area are mainly composed by <italic>Galanin</italic>-positive neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2M-O</xref>), consistent with the previous reports that the activation of <italic>Galanin</italic>-positive MPOA neuron cause inhibition of aggressive behavior toward pup<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. The MPOA contributes to several types of intrinsic behaviors, activating the MPOA neurons according to different patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. However, the mechanisms underlying the expression of one appropriate behavior remain unknown. Suppressing the accessory olfactory signals mediating the Me, presumably changes neural activity patterns in the cMPOA. This hypothesis is supported by the results that temporal disinhibition of the MeâcMPOA pathway modifies behavioral patterns and increases cMPOA inter-neuronal network activity, as reflected by the increased frequency of sIPSCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). In addition to the Me, other inputs into the cMPOA would drive several inter-neuronal network activity patterns to achieve the multi-functional MPOA and behavioral choices.</p>
<p>In the present study, we show for the first time that social experience with females, including mating, alters the E-I balance in synaptic transmission in the cMPOA in male mice. Changes in GABAergic neurotransmission were observed in sIPSCs and electrical stimulation-induced postsynaptic potentials of FGE and paternal group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2L</xref>), but not in glutamatergic neurotransmission (Fig. S3). These results were different from the case observed in pregnant female mediating estradiol and progesterone to induce parental behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Me<sup>Cartpt</sup> neurons contain more GABAergic neurons, supporting the possibility of altered GABAergic synaptic function in the cMPOA, the projection site from Me<sup>Cartpt</sup>. In addition, changes in the probability of neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic side and receptor sensitivity and expression levels are known to cause changes in the E-I balance. Me<sup>Cartpt</sup>: Ai9 neurons showed more cFos positive neurons against pups than in neutral objects, but no significant differences between the infanticide and parental groups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1K</xref>). In the electrophysiological analysis, GDPÎ²S infusion into the recording cMPOA neurons reversed the E-I balance in FGE mice to the level of virgin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Thus, it is suggested that changes in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor in the cMPOA neurons cause the E-I balance changes in the Me<sup>Cartpt</sup>-cMPOA pathway. However, these hypotheses do not match the reduced sIPSC frequency in FGE mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G-K</xref>); the hypothesis that only some GABA synapses within a single cMPOA neuron are drastically altered may explain the results. It is also necessary to take into account complex mechanisms, such as changes in activity occurring in neurons throughout the MPOA associated with synaptic changes that alter the pattern of intercellular communication, rather than merely input from the Me<sup>Cartpt</sup>. The details require further investigation. How does the experience with female mice bring about these changes? As neither behavior nor synaptic function was altered in the VMLG model (Fig S4), we consider it unlikely that the experience with a pregnant female could direct the brain function and behavior of virgin male mice towards the parental side. Similarly, no inhibitory synaptic changes in the cMPOA were observed in male mice that did not experience mating but came to express parental behavior through pup sensitization (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). These data suggest that the synaptic changes in the cMPOA that we detected encode the experience of mating and cohabitation with females but not pup. On the other hand, it was previously reported that the number of males showing infanticide decreased about two weeks after ejaculation without cohabitation with the female partner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. The behavior of males toward pups appears to be controlled by factors triggered by ejaculation, which remain effective for several subsequent weeks, thus preventing infanticide of the maleâs own offspring. Several groups have reported that prolactin has the effect of promoting paternal behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. However, the possibility that mating-induced prolactin concentration increases may influence subsequent paternal expression has been negatively described in studies using the D<sub>2</sub> receptor agonist bromocriptine. Post-mating neurotransmission in the brain area related to paternal expression may be altered over time by multiple hormones/neurotransmitters and changes in receptor sensitivity, as has been discussed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Synaptic functional changes that occur on the way to express fatherhood, such as those found in the present study, may provide clues to elicit new developments in clarifying paternal expression. In this study, the MME model, which experienced mating but separated from female mice, showed parental behavior after several days of pup exposure, although most of them showed infanticide on the first experimental day. Also, the MME model differed from the FGE and paternal groups in the amplitude of eIPSP (Fig S4). The experiences of mating and the social isolation period of 2 weeks after mating might affect synaptic function in the cMPOA and behavioral patterns related to aggression and pup sensitization.</p>
<p>Interestingly, unlike the synaptic changes in the Me<sup>Cartpt</sup> - cMPOA pathways of FGE mice, an inhibitory shift was observed in the BSTrh E/I balance induced by the caring experience (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, 6). What is the biological significance of the increased BSTrh inhibition? Like the previous report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, we observed that BSTrh inactivation by hM4Di significantly delayed infanticidal behavior in virgin male mice without parental behavior initiation (Fig. S7). This suggests that BSTrh does not block parental behavior directly. On the other hand, considering the reduced latency for the pup retrieval as the experimental days progressed in FGE and paternal mice (Fig. S8), BSTrh plastic changes could contribute to pup sensitization, which underlies the onset of pup caring. The cMPOA lesions reversed the increased BSTrh inhibition in paternal mice to the level of virgin mice, suggesting that the inhibitory transmission of BSTrh was controlled by cMPOA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref> and 55E). The following facts support this: (1) cMPOA neurons project into the BSTrh, and (2) unilateral lesion of the cMPOA increases the number of c-Fos positive neurons in the ipsilateral BSTrh of mice exposed to pups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Because increased BSTrh inhibition in paternal mice is sensitive to intracellular GDPÎ²S infusion (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>), as seen in the cMPOA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2L</xref>), some neurotransmitter or peptide metabotropic receptors may influence BSTrh during and/or after pup sensitization. The cMPOA neurons activated during parental behavior contain many neurotransmitters, including galanin, neurotensin, and tachykinin2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Moreover, the anterior commissural nucleus, adjacent to the cMPOA, contains the third largest population of magnocellular oxytocin neurons. Therefore, cMPOA neurons or adjacent neurons may directly and persistently control GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor activity in the BSTrh of paternal mice via metabotropic receptors.</p>
<p>The results of this study show that mating and cohabitation with females and pup sensitization are processed in various parts of the brain, resulting in aggressive male mice going into parenting. Converging data suggest that the cMPOA neurons contribute to infanticide inhibition and parental behavior by modifying the inter-neuronal network and projecting it downstream, including BSTrh. Uncovering the relevant MPOA subgroup for each function requires the analysis of neural circuits. Understanding the modulatory mechanism of synaptic plasticity in the cMPOA and BSTrh may provide evidence for possible interventions in parental stress and subsequent child maltreatment.</p>

<p>Animal maintenance and male exposure to different levels of mating and paternal experience Most C57BL/6J male mice were bred at the RIKEN Brain Science Institute and Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University unless specially described. For the BDA (Thermo Fisher Scientific) tracer injection into Me (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-C</xref> and S1), we utilized C57BL/6J male mice from Japan SLC. Cartpt-Cre mice (Jackson Laboratory, stock number 009615), vGAT-IRES-Cre mice (Jackson Laboratory, stock number 016962) and Ai9 (Jackson Laboratory, stock number 007909) were bred at the Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University. We backcrossed vGAT-IRES-Cre mice with C57BL/6J mice at least five generations after arrival from Jackson Laboratory. Mice were housed in individually ventilated cages and provided ad libitum access to water and food and maintained under a 12-h light/dark cycle in cages lined with TEK Fresh Standard bedding (Envigo). Mice were weaned at postnatal day 28 (P28). All mutant heterogenic mice were co-housed with wild-type mice until the experiments. To produce paternal group mice, a virgin male mouse was housed with a female for mating. After delivery, the male stayed with pups for 3 days. All paternal group males experienced one delivery and were used for experiments within 20 days after the birth of pups. If pups did not survive for more than 3 days, the male was not included in the paternal group for experiments. Other virgin male mice were mated and co-housed with a female only until late gestation but not delivery, termed âfathers in gestation experienceâ (FGE) mice.</p>

<p>Mice were anesthetized by sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, i.p.) and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4). Brains were removed from the skull and post-fixed overnight in PFA at 4 Â°C, followed by incubation in PBS/20% sucrose for 1 day and PBS/30% sucrose for 1â2 days. Brains were then embedded in O.C.T. Compound (Sakura Finetek) at â80 Â°C and sectioned at 40 Âµm using a Cryostat (Leica Biosystems) unless otherwise indicated. Some brains were used to prepare sections for electrophysiological analysis. In the case of BSTrh recording after MPOA lesion, serial slices including MPOA were sectioned at 80 Âµm in cutting solution (see below) using a Leica VT1200 Semiautomatic Vibrating Blade Microtome (Leica). These slices and the slices including BSTrh used for electrophysiological analysis were fixed in 4% PFA and immunostained.</p>

<title>Electrophysiology</title>
<p>Electrophysiological recordings were performed as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>.

For a cutting solution, NaCl in ACSF was replaced with the same concentration of choline chloride. Mice were injected with pentobarbital (30 mg/kg, i.p.) followed by transcardiac perfusion of ice-cold cutting solution. The brains were removed, and 230-Âµm brain slices including the target area prepared in ice-cold choline chloride-based cutting solution using a Leica VT1200 Semiautomatic Vibrating Blade Microtome. Brain slices were stored in warmed ACSF at 32 Â°C for 20â30 min and then kept at room temperature until recording.</p>
<p>For electrophysiological recordings, slices were superfused with 32 Â°Câ34 Â°C ACSF at 2â4 mL/min in a chamber mounted on a microscope. Neurons were identified using a 40Ã or 60Ã lens and an infrared camera (IR-1000, DEGE-MTI). Glass electrodes (World Precision Instruments) of 4â9 MÎ© resistance were used for whole-cell patch clamp recordings in response to electrical stimulation using â¼0.5 MÎ© glass electrodes containing ACSF. Recording electrodes were filled with a potassium-based internal solution (132 mM K-gluconate, 3 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 0.5 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 12 mM Na-phosphocreatine, 4 mM Mg-ATP, 0.5 mM Na-GTP, 0.2-0.3 % biocytin, pH 7.25) and signals were recorded using an Axopatch 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices). Only cells with access resistance &lt;30 MÎ© and exhibiting action potentials with &gt;60 mV amplitude evoked by positive current injection were included in the analysis. Whole-cell currents were filtered at 3 kHz. The liquid junction potential (11 mV) was compensated. Stimulating electrodes were placed at the dorsal BSTrh or cMPOA to stimulate stria terminalis. To activate the ChR2-expressing axon terminals, we utilized a LED (465 nm, LEX2-LZ4-B, Brainvision Inc.). To activate the vLWO-expressing neurons, green light generated by a 100 W mercury lamp (U-RFL-T) was applied through a fluorescence band pass filter (520-550 nm) (Olympus). Red light was provided by Fiber-Coupled LED (625 nm, Thorlabs). Evoked synaptic currents and potentials were measured at least three times at the same stimulus intensity and averaged. Responses with action potentials were omitted from the analysis. We recorded evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (eEPSPs) and eEPSCs at a holding potential of â85 mV in the presence of 100 ÂµM picrotoxin. eIPSPs were recorded at â65 mV and eIPSCs at â60 mV in the presence of 20 ÂµM CNQX and 20 ÂµM MK-801. In experiments using optogenetic suppression using vLWO, slices were also perfused with 25 ÂµM 9-cis-retinal, 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide, 0.025% (Â±) - Î±-tocopherol and 0.2% bovine serum albumin.</p>

These constructs were bilaterally implanted into the mouse brain area 1-mm above the target area and fixed with dental cement. After the mouse had recovered from the surgery (one week later), the optic fibers were connected via Ceramic Split Mating with 1Ã2 Branching Fiber-optic Patch Cords-Glass (0.37 NA, Doric Lenses) to a diode laser (450 nm or 532 nm, Changchun New Industries Optoelectronics Tec.) through a FC/PC connector. Averaged light power at the tips between the bilateral fiber tips was set to 30â40 mW (450 nm) or 10â12 mW (532 nm). Light pulses were controlled by TTL Pulse Generators (Doric Lenses). After connecting the fibers, experimental mice were allowed free actiTon for 15 min. During the last minute of the behavioral test, mice received constant light on for 20 s without light pulses followed by a 10-s off period. This photostimulation protocol was continued throughout the 30-min behavioral experiment. After the behavioral experiments, animals were perfused with 4% PFA to prepare the brain slices. Only animals with bilateral expression of fluorescence labeled fiber and the bilateral optic fibers above targeted area between 0.3-1.0 mm from the targeted area were included for the data analysis. For the chemogentic silencing, we infused CNO (2.0 mg / kg, i.p.) and observed the behavioral pattern 30-35 min later. After the behavioral experiments, we immunostained the brain slices with anti-GFP. Only animals with bilateral expression of fluorescent signal in the targeted area were included for the data analysis.</p>

<title>RNA-seq analysis</title>
<p>Mouse brain slices were prepared using essentially the same procedures for electrophysiological experiments. Six cMPOA neurons were manually collected by using 1 â¼ 2 MÎ© glass electrodes containing ACSF and suspended in cell lysis buffer (0.5% Triton-X100, 0.5 U/ÂµL RNase inhibitor, 5 ng/ÂµL yeast rRNA). The cell samples were immediately frozen and stored at â80Â°C until starting reverse transcription. Reverse transcription and cDNA library preparation were performed using the Smart-seq2 method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> with some modifications. Briefly, 12 ÂµM dT<sub>30</sub>VN primer (5â-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTACT<sub>30</sub>VN-3) were added into microtubes containing cell lysates (final concentration, 1 ÂµM); then, samples were heat-denatured at 70 Â°C for 3 min, followed by immediate incubation on ice. Next, samples were mixed with a reverse transcription reaction solution containing locked nucleic acid (LNA)-template switching oligo primer (5â-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTACrGrG+G-3â, rG; riboguanosines, +G; LNA-modified guanosine, final concentration of 0.6 ÂµM) and reverse transcriptase (SMARTscribe, Clontech, final concentration of 5 U/ÂµL), and incubated at 42Â°C for 120 min followed by at 70Â°C for 10 min to terminate the reaction. The resultant cDNA samples were purified using solid phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) beads (AMPure XP, Beckman Coulter). The purified cDNA samples were amplified by PCR using the IS primer (5â-NH<sub>2</sub>-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGT-3â, final concentration of 0.24 ÂµM) and Tks Gflex DNA polymerase (Takara Bio, final concentration of 0.025 U/ÂµL). The amplified cDNA samples were purified by SPRI beads. The quality and quantity of cDNA sample was confirmed by an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using the High sensitivity DNA kit (Agilent Technology, CA, USA).</p>
<p>The cDNA samples were then processed to generate indexed libraries for sequencing using a NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (#E7645, New England Biolabs Inc., Ipswich, MA, USA), according to manufacturerâs instructions. Then, libraries were sequenced for 50-bp single-end reads using HiSeq 3000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Output fastq files were aligned to the mouse genome (GRCm38/mm10) using STAR aligner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Library size normalization was performed using R (v.4.1.0) by calculating transcripts per million (TPM). Genes with &lt;5 TPM in all samples were excluded from the analysis. We selected 22 genes for neuronal cluster-mediated social behavior in the MPOA based on previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. However, <italic>Oprd1</italic> was excluded because of its low expression. Heatmaps were drawn using gplots (v.3.1.1). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between virgin, FGE, and paternal mice were analyzed using DESeq2 (v.1.32.0). Genes with a false discovery rate-adjusted p â¤ 0.05 and a log2 fold change â¥2 in either direction were considered DEGs.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Group means were compared by Fisherâs exact test, the two-tailed t-test, one-way or two-way repeated measures ANOVA followed by a post hoc test as indicated. All statistical tests were two-tailed and conducted with GraphPad Prism software 6 and 9 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) or R (v.4.4.0) and ARTool (v.2.2.2). To compare the distribution of behavioral pattern of each mouse during optogenetic manipulation, we performed Aligned Rank Transformation (ART) to handle nonparametric factorial data transformations, and two-way ANOVA analysis. A P-value &lt; 0.05 was deemed statistically significant. Statical data was written in the Fig. legends and Table S6.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>After mating, male mice undergo a behavioral switch from infanticide to parental behavior (postmating switch). The neural mechanisms underlying this switch are still largely unknown. Studies performed in different mouse strains have also resulted in mixed evidence for whether mating (specifically: ejaculation) itself is sufficient for this switch, or whether subsequent cohabitation with the pregnant female, and parental experience with pups is required. Recent work found that while lesions to the central part of the medial preoptic area (cMPOA) promote infanticidal behavior, lesions to the rhomboid nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTrh) inhibit infanticide. The current work convincingly adds to this evidence by showing that mating and cohabitation lead to reduced inhibition from Cart-positive medial amygdala neurons onto cMPOA neurons, and that this synaptic change is in fact critical for the postmating switch. Further, the authors demonstrate that parental experience increases inhibitory synaptic transmission onto BSTrh neurons. The male postmating switch thus appears to rely on two sequential stages of synaptic plasticity.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The behavioral characterization is thorough and the authors nicely manage to disentangle the relative contributions of mating, cohabitation, and parental experience to the postmating switch. Their finding of dissociable plasticity mechanisms underlying mating/cohabitation vs pup experience is intriguing.</p>
<p>(2) Most conclusions are based on complementary evidence from different experimental approaches and are compelling.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors do not provide an explicit synthesis/model of the circuit-level changes underlying this switch. For instance, how does cMPOA-to-BSTrh connectivity change in fathers, and how does the necessity of the cMPOA for the exposure/sensitisation effect square with the effect being postsynaptic in the BSTrh?</p>
<p>(2) The presentation of the manuscript (clarity of language, grammar, reporting of stats in figures etc.) needs to be improved.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The present study identifies how mating and pup experience are correlated with differences in inhibitory neurotransmission underlying the promotion of paternal behavior toward pups. The study builds on existing knowledge about the circuit between the medial amygdala, medial preoptic area, and the bed nucleus of stria terminalis to uncover synaptic changes correlated with behavior. The authors find that inhibition from the medial amygdala is decreased in the medial preoptic area and increased in the bed nucleus of stria terminalis to promote paternal behavior in mated males.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors use a combination of in vivo activity manipulation and slice electrophysiology to study the role of inhibition in this circuit in dynamic infant-directed behavior induced by mating.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Some technical and methodological details are incomplete or missing for interpretation of the significance of the findings. Statistical details are also left out.</p>
<p>(2) The rationale for using Cartpt as a marker is not fully explained. This marker has activity-dependent expression and this possibility is not explored experimentally--for example, could exposure to objects or pups change expression (or the number of cells expressing) cartpt alone?</p>
<p>(3) The cfos experiment is quantified by exposing a male to a pup inside a tea ball. Therefore, it is unclear how the male was classified as infanticidal or parental based on the available criteria provided in the methods section.</p>
<p>(4) There is no information about inclusion/exclusion criteria for chemical and viral experiments. Specifically, there is no information provided about the validation of the lesion experiment--how large were the lesions? Is there concern about leakage of the chemical into the recorded region (MPOA and BNST are adjacent).</p>
<p>(5) The authors do not provide information about how long rAAV is allowed to express before quantifying retrograde transport.</p>
<p>(6) For statistics, the authors do not provide information distinguishing the main effects from multiple comparisons post hoc testing for the ANOVA analyses.</p>

<p>Ito et al. investigate the role of synaptic plasticity in the medial preoptic area (MPOA) pathway of male mice and its involvement in transitions from infanticidal aggression to parental behavior. Using optogenetics, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, and behavioral assays, they demonstrate that inhibitory synaptic transmission from the posterior-dorsal medial amygdala (MePD) to the central MPOA (cMPOA) decreases following mating and cohabitation with pregnant females. This synaptic disinhibition is correlated with a reduction in aggressive behavior toward pups. They further show that paternal experience induces enhanced inhibitory transmission in the rhomboid nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTrh), downstream of the MPOA, through postsynaptic mechanisms. These findings suggest a circuit-based model where social experiences and mating induce synaptic changes in the Me-cMPOA-BSTrh pathway, mediating the transition to parental behavior.</p>
<p>The conclusions of this paper are largely supported by the data, but several methodological and conceptual aspects require clarification or additional experiments.</p>
<p>(1) When evaluating the Me Cartpt-expressing neuron projection to the cMPOA, the authors compared excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). However, the standard procedure for isolating these currents is to hold the membrane potential at the reversal potential for inhibitory or excitatory currents, respectively. The authors appear not to have followed this procedure, making it unclear how EPSCs and IPSCs were calculated. This requires clarification to ensure the validity of their reported E/I balance changes.</p>
<p>(2) The authors chose to assess parental behavior over four consecutive days. It is unclear why this specific timeframe was selected. A justification for this choice would strengthen the interpretation of the behavioral data.</p>
<p>(3) The experimental design in Figure 5, where the authors lesioned the entire cMPOA to assess its role in BSTrh inhibition, presents several limitations: First, the effects on BSTrh activity could result from indirect circuit alterations rather than direct cMPOA projections. The current lesion approach cannot disentangle these possibilities. Second, the cMPOA is a heterogeneous region containing diverse neuronal subtypes. Full lesions prevent the differentiation of the roles played by distinct populations within this region. Third, lesion specificity is questionable, as some lesions extended beyond the cMPOA boundaries (Figure S5). This overextension complicates the interpretation of the results and requires tighter control.</p>
<p>(4) In Figure 3, the authors show that optogenetic inhibition of Me projections to the cMPOA modifies the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs). However, the proposed mechanism that this modulation reflects inter-neuronal network activity within the cMPOA lacks sufficient experimental validation. Additional experiments assessing circuit-level interactions could substantiate these claims.</p>
<p>(5) While the paper highlights synaptic changes in the cMPOA, it does not establish a direct relationship between these changes and the social experience. How do mating and cohabitation with females impact this pathway and modulate synaptic strength? The discussion could benefit from integrating these factors into their proposed model.</p>
<p>Overall, the paper offers valuable insights into the neural circuitry underlying male parental behavior, particularly the synaptic dynamics of the Me-cMPOA-BSTrh pathway. However, addressing these methodological and conceptual limitations would significantly enhance the clarity and impact of the work.</p>
