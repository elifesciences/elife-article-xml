<title>Abstract</title><p>Membrane contact sites (MCSs) are junctures that perform important roles including coordinating lipid metabolism. Previous studies have indicated that vacuolar fission/fusion processes are coupled with modifications in the membrane lipid composition. However, it has been still unclear whether MCS-mediated lipid metabolism controls the vacuolar morphology. Here we report that deletion of tricalbins (Tcb1, Tcb2, Tcb3), tethering proteins at endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-plasma membrane (PM) and ER-Golgi contact sites, alters fusion/fission dynamics and causes vacuolar fragmentation in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. In addition, we show that the sphingolipid precursor phytosphingosine accumulates in tricalbin-deleted cells, triggering the vacuolar division. Detachment of the nucleus vacuole junction (NVJ), an important contact site between the vacuole and the perinuclear ER, restored vacuolar morphology in both cells subjected to high exogenous phytosphingosine and Tcb3-deleted cells, supporting that phytosphingosine transport across the NVJ induces vacuole division. Thus, our results suggest that vacuolar morphology is maintained by MCSs through the metabolism of sphingolipids.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cellular organelles are formed by membranes with unique lipid compositions, morphology, and functions. The vacuole of budding yeast is an organelle that shares many similarities with mammalian lysosomes and plant vacuoles. Vacuoles possess degradative and storage capacities, and are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis, including maintaining pH or ion homeostasis, cellular detoxification, and responses to osmotic shock and nutrient environments. Vacuoles are liable to change their morphology (size, volume, and number) through cycles of fusion and fission, to adapt to the intracellular and extracellular environments or upon vacuole inheritance to daughter cells. The steady-state morphology of the vacuole is maintained by a balance of constitutive vacuolar fusion and fission processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>].</p>
<p>The homotypic vacuolar membrane fusion process occurs in four stages: priming, tethering, docking and fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Each stage is defined as follows. “Priming” In the priming reaction, inactive fusion factors that are still assembled from previous fusion events are recycled. The yeast N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF), Sec18p, is activated by ATP and releases the NSF attachment protein (SNAP), Sec17p, from the SNAP receptor (SNARE) complex, thereby activating the SNARE molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. “Tethering” The HOPS/Class C Vps complex and the Rab-GTPase Ypt7p mediate the reversible contact of opposing vacuoles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. “Docking” The coupling of three Q-SNAREs (Vam3p, Vam7p, and Vti1p) with an opposing R-SNARE (Nyv1p) to form a trans-SNARE complex between the two corresponding vacuoles. “Fusion” The final stage in which the lipid bilayer fuses and the contents of the lumen are mixed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. For stable vacuolar fusion, several factors are required such as vacuolar acidification by V-ATPase proton pump activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], ions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>] and ion transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Furthermore, vacuolar fission is required for proper vacuolar inheritance during mitosis and acute response to osmotic shock in yeast, however the molecular mechanism of fission is not fully understood, and limited knowledge is available. Vacuolar fission is performed in two steps that require proteins and lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. The first step is the contraction and invagination of the vacuolar membrane through the involvement of Vps1p, a dynamin-like GTPase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] and V-ATPase, which drives the proton gradient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Next, vacuolar fission is promoted by Vac14p, Vac7p, and Fab1p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], which are required for the generation of PtdIns[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]P2, and Atg18p, an effector of Fab1p and a sensor of PtdIns[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]P2 levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Recently, it has also been shown that vacuolar fission is associated with nutrient status and responds to ER stress via TORC1 targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Moreover, it has been proposed that vacuolar fusion and fission dynamics are regulated by the Yck3p-Env7p kinase cascade, which maintains an equilibrium between fusion and fission activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>].</p>

<title>Deletion of tricalbins causes vacuole fragmentation</title>
<p>Tricalbins (Tcb1p, Tcb2p, and Tcb3p) are ER membrane tethering proteins that connect the cortical ER (cER) with the PM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>], and contribute to PI4P turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>], sterol flux and transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>] and maintain other lipid homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. It is also suggested that tricalbins create ER membrane curvature to maintain PM integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. Tricalbins also localize to the ER-Golgi contacts and are responsible for the non-vesicular transport of ceramide from ER to Golgi apparatus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. However, their role in other organelle morphology and function remains unknown. Interestingly, the <italic>NVJ1</italic> gene, which encodes a major component of the NVJ, showed a negative synthetic interaction with the absence of all three tricalbins (<italic>tcb1</italic>Δ<italic>2</italic>Δ<italic>3</italic>Δ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. Moreover, HOPS subunit Vam6p and Rab-GTPase Ypt7p, which are both involved in vacuolar fusion, also showed negative synthetic interaction with <italic>tcb1</italic>Δ<italic>2</italic>Δ<italic>3</italic>Δ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. Based on the findings, we assumed that tricalbins may be involved in the regulation of vacuolar morphology or function linked with the NVJ. To investigate the role of tricalbins in vacuole morphology, we analyzed the number of vacuoles per cell by a fluorescent probe FM4-64 that selectively stains yeast vacuolar membranes. We observed that compared to wild type cells, the <italic>tcb1</italic>Δ<italic>2</italic>Δ<italic>3</italic>Δ strain showed a phenotype characterized by a decreased percentage of cells with one vacuole and an increased percentage of cells with two or more vacuoles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). We refer to this phenotype as vacuolar fragmentation. In addition, analysis with single- and double deletion strains revealed that single deletion of <italic>TCB1</italic> or <italic>TCB3</italic> already exhibited strong vacuole fragmentation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). These results indicate that tricalbins are important to maintain vacuole morphology.</p>

</fig>
<p>We next examined whether deletion of tricalbins affects vacuolar acidification. As homotypic vacuole-vacuole membrane fusion requires the vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (V-ATPase) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>], tricalbins could be indirectly involved in maintaining vacuole morphology through V-ATPase. Therefore, we addressed whether tricalbin mutant strains could grow in alkaline media, because V-ATPase–deficient mutants can grow in acidic media but fail to grow in alkaline media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. As a negative control, we used <italic>vma3</italic>Δ mutant cells in which one of the V<sub>O</sub> subunits of V-ATPase had been deleted. The <italic>vma3</italic>Δ mutant cells grew in acidic medium (pH 5.0), but failed to grow in alkaline medium (pH 7.5) (Fig S1A). In contrast, all tricalbin mutant strains grew like wild type in both conditions, suggesting that the V-ATPase in these mutants remains functionally normal. Thus, these results suggest that vacuole fragmentation caused by tricalbin deletion is not due to a loss of function of V-ATPase.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we investigated the effects of tricalbin deletion on delivery of a vacuolar protease, carboxypeptidase S (Cps1p) that is sorted into the vacuole lumen upon endosome– vacuole fusion. Deletion of HOPS complex components that mediate endosome–vacuole fusion results in vacuole fragmentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. To test the possibility that vacuole fragmentation in tricalbin mutant cells is caused by a defect of endosome–vacuole fusion, we analyzed the localization of GFP-Cps1p in tricalbin mutant cells. Cps1p, a vacuole-localized hydrolytic enzyme, is transported to the vacuole after sorting into multivesicular bodies by ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. In strains with loss of ESCRT function, such as disruption of <italic>VPS4</italic>, one of the class E <italic>VPS</italic> (vacuolar protein sorting) genes, GFP-Cps1p is known to localize to the limiting membrane rather than the lumen of the vacuole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. In both WT and <italic>tcb3</italic>Δ cells, GFP-Cps1p was observed in the vacuole lumen in contrast to <italic>vps4</italic>Δ cells (Fig S1B), suggesting that the tricalbin mutant exhibits a normal delivery of vacuolar proteins via endosomes to the vacuole. In addition, the fact that tricalbin deletion does not affect the maturation of CPY, a vacuolar hydrolase carboxypeptidase Y [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>], indicates that the vacuolar degradation ability as well as protein delivery to the vacuole is normal. Taken together, tricalbins are required for maintaining vacuole morphology, but not due to an indirect action through vacuolar acidification or endosome-vacuole fusion.</p>

<title>Tricalbins negatively regulate vacuole fission in a parallel pathway with TORC1</title>
<p>The number and size of vacuoles within a cell are regulated by coordinated cycles of vacuolar fission and fusion. To address whether vacuole fragmentation in the tricalbin mutant is caused by facilitation of vacuole fission or an impaired homotypic vacuole fusion, we examined the effect of hypotonic stress on vacuole fragmentation in <italic>tcb1</italic>Δ<italic>2</italic>Δ<italic>3</italic>Δ mutant cells, because low-osmotic stimuli such as water promote homotypic vacuole fusion to maintain cytoplasmic osmolarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. We observed that addition of water to <italic>tcb1</italic>Δ<italic>2</italic>Δ<italic>3</italic>Δ cells partially restored vacuole fragmentation, suggesting that vacuolar fusion machinery is functional in <italic>tcb1</italic>Δ<italic>2</italic>Δ<italic>3</italic>Δ cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). This result suggests that loss of tricalbins alters fusion-fission dynamics by primarily affecting the fission machinery rather than fusion.</p>
<p>As the target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) is a positive regulator of vacuole fission in response to hyperosmotic shock and ER stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], we next examined if rapamycin, which is an inhibitor of TORC1, affects the vacuole fragmentation in <italic>tcb1</italic>Δ<italic>2</italic>Δ<italic>3</italic>Δ cells. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, we observed that the vacuole fragmentation in <italic>tcb1</italic>Δ<italic>2</italic>Δ<italic>3</italic>Δ cells was suppressed by rapamycin, suggesting that TORC1 may be required for tricalbin deletion-induced vacuolar fragmentation. We attempted to characterize further the relationship between tricalbin and TORC1, and showed that <italic>tcb1</italic>Δ<italic>2</italic>Δ<italic>3</italic>Δ cells had no significant effect on phosphorylation levels of Sch9p, a major downstream effector of TORC1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). These results suggest that deletion of tricalbins does not activate TORC1. Therefore, we conclude that tricalbins and TORC1 act in parallel and opposite ways to regulate vacuole fission (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>).</p>

<title>The transmembrane domain of Tcb3 contributes to mediating protein interactions between the tricalbin family to maintain vacuolar morphology</title>
<p>Tcb3p possesses an N-terminal transmembrane (TM) domain, a central synaptotagmin-like mitochondrial lipid-binding protein (SMP) domain, and multiple C-terminal Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent lipid binding (C2) domains (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). To identify which domain of Tcb3p is essential for regulating vacuole fission, we replaced the C-terminal sequence of the endogenous <italic>TCB3</italic> gene with a GFP binding protein (GBP). This way, we created three strains expressing either full-length Tcb3-GBP; Tcb3(Full)-GBP, Tcb3-GBP lacking C2 domains; Tcb3(TM-SMP)-GBP or Tcb3-GBP lacking both SMP and C2 domains; Tcb3(TM)-GBP. Vacuole morphology in cells expressing Tcb3(Full)-GBP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref> (iii)) was almost similar to that in WT cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref> (i)), indicating that the addition of GBP has no effect on vacuole morphology. Remarkably, vacuoles remained non-fragmented even in cells expressing Tcb3(TM)-GBP, which lacked most of the C-terminal region (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref> (v)), as well as Tcb3(TM-SMP)-GBP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref> (iv)). In an attempt to address the question of why the TM domain of Tcb3p is sufficient to suppress vacuolar division, we found that cells expressing Tcb3(TM)-GBP and lacking Tcb1p and Tcb2p (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref> (vi)) are even more fragmented than <italic>tcb1</italic>Δ<italic>2</italic>Δ in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>, and similar to <italic>tcb3</italic>Δ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref> (ii)). These results suggest that the TM domain of Tcb3p requires Tcb1p and Tcb2p to suppress vacuole fission. Tcb2p has been reported to interact with either Tcb1p or Tcb3p through their C-terminal domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>], and some of the protein interactome analyses have reported that Tcb1p, Tcb2p and Tcb3p interact with each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. In this study, we have also confirmed that Tcb3 shows physical interaction with both Tcb1 and Tcb2 by the coimmunoprecipitation assay (Fig S2). In addition, according to the structural simulation by AlphaFold2, each TM domain of Tcb1p, Tcb2p, and Tcb3p formed alpha-helical structure, which is known to be typical for membrane proteins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). It is likely that Tcb1p and Tcb2p directly interact with Tcb3p by their TM domains. Interestingly, the complex of these three TM domains was constructed with Tcb3p between Tcb1p and Tcb2p in most cases (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). Together these data suggest that the TM domain of Tcb3p contributes sufficiently to the maintenance of vacuolar morphology by mediating the tricalbin complex formation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>).</p>

<p>We first evaluated whether the increases in certain lipids are the cause of vacuolar fragmentation in <italic>tcb1</italic>Δ<italic>2</italic>Δ<italic>3</italic>Δ. Our analysis showed that vacuoles are fragmented in <italic>lag1</italic>Δ<italic>lac1</italic>Δ cells, which lack both enzymes for LCBs (DHS and PHS) conversion into ceramides (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). Loss of ceramide synthases could cause an increase in PHS levels. Therefore, we tested if exogenously added PHS induces vacuolar fragmentation in WT cells. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>, exogenous addition of PHS induced vacuolar fragmentation. PHS are converted into ceramide by the ceramide synthase Lag1p, which is the main enzyme synthesizing phytoceramide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. Thus, we next examined whether PHS-induced vacuolar fragmentation occurs in <italic>lag1</italic>Δ cells. Our analysis showed that vacuolar fragmentation in <italic>lag1</italic>Δ cells treated with PHS was comparable to that for WT cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). These results suggest that the increases in ceramide and subsequent product IPC/MIPC are not the cause of vacuolar fragmentation, but rather its precursors induce vacuolar fragmentation.</p>
<p>Because our lipid analysis showed a strong increase in LCB-1P in <italic>tcb1</italic>Δ<italic>2</italic>Δ<italic>3</italic>Δ cells, phosphorylation of PHS may be involved in PHS-induced vacuolar fragmentation. Although exogenously added LCBs move slowly from the PM to the ER if they are not phosphorylated, efficient utilization of exogenously added LCBs in sphingolipid synthesis requires a series of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation steps for LCBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. The major yeast LCB phosphate phosphatase Lcb3p dephosphorylates LCB-1P (DHS-1P/PHS-1P) to yield DHS/PHS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>], while Lcb4p and Lcb5p catalyze the reverse reaction producing DHS-1P/PHS-1P [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]. Lcb3p, Lcb4p, and Lcb5p are localized to the ER, PM or Golgi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]. We examined the ability of exogenous PHS to fragment vacuoles in cells lacking these processing factors. Our results showed that PHS-induced vacuolar fragmentation was completely blocked in the <italic>lcb3</italic>Δ cells in which PHS-1P is not dephosphorylated (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>), suggesting that PHS-induced vacuolar fragmentation requires the reaction of dephosphorylation of PHS-1P by Lcb3p. On the other hand, we observed that vacuoles were still fragmented in <italic>lcb4</italic>Δ <italic>lcb5</italic>Δ and <italic>lcb3</italic>Δ <italic>lcb4</italic>Δ <italic>lcb5</italic>Δ cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). These results suggest that elevated levels of non-phosphorylated PHS induces vacuolar fragmentation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>). Additionally, we tested whether overexpression of Rsb1p, which has been reported as a translocase that exports LCBs from the inner to the outer leaflet of the PM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>], rescues vacuole fragmentation in <italic>tcb1</italic>Δ<italic>2</italic>Δ<italic>3</italic>Δ cells. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F</xref>, we observed that Rsb1p overexpression results in decreased vacuole fragmentation. Collectively, these results support the model in which vacuole fragmentation in tricalbin-deleted cells is caused by increased levels of PHS.</p>

<title>The nucleus-vacuole junction (NVJ) is required for PHS- or <italic>tcb3</italic><bold>Δ</bold>-induced vacuole fragmentation</title>
<p>To characterize further the relationship between PHS and vacuole morphology, we asked whether PHS delivered from the ER to the vacuole induces vacuole fragmentation. We hypothesized that if PHS are transported to the vacuole by either the vesicular transport pathway through the Golgi apparatus or the non-vesicular transport pathway via inter-organellar MCS triggers vacuole fission, then blockage of the transport could rescue the PHS-induced vacuole fragmentation. Accordingly, we used two types of mutant strains, one blocking vesicular transport and the other blocking the NVJ. In a temperature sensitive <italic>sec18-20</italic> mutant, vesicular transport is abolished at the restrictive temperature of 30 °C or higher, but even at the permissive temperature of 25 °C, vesicular transport is partially impaired [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>]. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref> (left), under the condition without exogenous PHS, some vacuoles in <italic>sec18-20</italic> mutant cells became fragmented when shifted to the non-permissive temperature of 30 °C. We also observed that vacuoles in <italic>sec18-20</italic> mutant at 30 °C underwent fragmentation after addition of PHS to the same extent as at the permissive temperature of 25 °C (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>, right), suggesting that vesicle-mediated transport is not required for PHS-induced vacuolar fragmentation. To test the role of NVJ-mediated membrane contact for PHS-induced vacuolar fragmentation we employed a quadruple Δ<italic>NVJ</italic> mutant (<italic>nvj1</italic>Δ <italic>nvj2</italic>Δ <italic>nvj3</italic>Δ <italic>mdm1</italic>Δ) that was used in a previous study in which complete loss of the NVJ was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>], but thus has a different background to other strains of this study. When PHS was added to the Δ<italic>NVJ</italic> mutant, we observed a significant suppression of vacuole fragmentation compared to WT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). Finally, to investigate the requirement for NVJ in tricalbin deletion-induced vacuolar fragmentation, we constructed the <italic>tcb3</italic>Δ <italic>nvj1</italic>Δ and <italic>tcb</italic>3Δ <italic>nvj1</italic>Δ <italic>nvj2</italic>Δ <italic>nvj3</italic>Δ <italic>mdm1</italic>Δ mutants. <italic>TCB3</italic> single disruption sufficiently induced vacuolar fragmentation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>), whereas as expected, the fragmentation was partially suppressed by loss of only <italic>NVJ1</italic> and completely suppressed by loss of all NVJ factors (<italic>NVJ1</italic>, <italic>NVJ2</italic>, <italic>NVJ3</italic>, and <italic>MDM1</italic>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). Taken together, we conclude from these findings that vacuole fission caused by accumulated PHS in tricalbin deleted cells requires contact between ER and vacuole at the NVJ, possibly as a way to transport PHS to the vacuole.</p>

<title>NVJ and PHS accumulation mediate hyperosmotic shock-induced vacuole fission</title>
<p>Besides PHS-induced vacuolar fission, it is generally well-known that vacuolar division can be triggered as an acute response to osmotic shock. We made an interesting observation under hyperosmotic conditions (0.2 M NaCl), wherein the loss of NVJ led to complete suppression of vacuolar division (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). This finding suggests a significant role for NVJ in vacuolar fission as a hyperosmotic response. To test the involvement of PHS accumulation in this process, we analyzed the effect of hyperosmolarity on PHS levels. Analysis of PHS under hyperosmotic shock conditions (0.2 M NaCl), in which vacuolar fragments were observed, showed an increase in PHS of about 10% (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). Furthermore, when the NaCl concentration was increased to 0.8 M, PHS levels increased up to 30%. While NaCl treatment increased PHS, both ceramide and IPC decreased. There are at least two possible reasons why NaCl increases PHS and decreases ceramide and IPC. The first is the possibility that NaCl dissociates subunits of ceramide synthase (Lag1p, Lac1p, and Lip1p) or IPC synthase (Aur1p and Kei1p). The second possibility is that NaCl suppresses the expression of ceramide synthase or IPC synthase, as can be inferred from the previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>]. Alternatively, we cannot exclude the possibility that the difference in PHS levels detected with [<sup>3</sup>H]DHS in this study is due to differences in the activity of Sur2p hydroxylase that catalysis the conversion of DHS to PHS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]. Finally, NaCl-induced vacuolar fragmentation, like that caused by PHS treatment, was also suppressed by PHS export from the cell by Rsb1p overexpression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). These results suggest that hyperosmotic shock-induced vacuole fission is also mediated by PHS accumulation and NVJ.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we found that the accumulation of PHS triggers the fission of vacuoles. Our results suggest that MCSs are involved in this process in two steps. First, the intracellular amount of PHS is modulated by tricalbin-tethered MCSs between the ER and PM or Golgi (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref> left). Second, the accumulated PHS in the tricalbin-deleted cells induces vacuole fission via most likely the NVJ (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref> right). Thus, we propose that MCSs regulate vacuole morphology via sphingolipid metabolism. Fundamental questions that arise from our data concern the accumulation of PHS in the tricalbin deletion strain and the mechanism of PHS-induced vacuole fission. Possible mechanisms for elevated PHS levels in tricalbin-deleted cells are the following. MCS deficiency between ER and PM has been shown to reduce the activity of Sac1p, a PtdIns4P phosphatase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. Sac1p disruption strain decreases the levels of complex sphingolipids such as IPC and MIPC, while it increases the levels of their precursors, ceramide, LCB, and LCB-1P [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>]. This is probably due to the loss of function of Sac1p, which reduces the level of PtdIns used for IPC synthesis, thereby impairing IPC synthesis, and resulting in the accumulation of precursors such as the substrate ceramide. This model is also consistent with the results of accumulated PtdIns4P and reduced IPC synthesis in Δtether cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. As tricalbins are required for ceramide nonvesicular transport from the ER to the Golgi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>], it is also possible that impaired ceramide nonvesicular transport due to tricalbin deficiency causes ceramide and its precursor, LCB, to accumulate in the ER. Another possibility is that MCS facilitate PHS diffusion between the ER and the PM, which might be coordinated with the LCB export from the PM by Rsb1p. The loss of tricalbins partially disrupts the ER-PM tether, possibly resulting in low efficiency of PHS ejection by Rsb1p. This is supported by the result that overexpression of Rsb1p suppressed vacuolar fragmentation in tricalbin-deleted cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies have observed that myriocin treatment results in vacuolar fragmentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>]. Myriocin treatment itself causes not only the depletion of PHS but of complex sphingolipids such as IPC. This suggests that normal sphingolipid metabolism is important for vacuolar morphology. The reason for this is unclear, but perhaps there is some mechanism by which sphingolipid depletion affects, for example, the recruitment of proteins required for vacuolar membrane fusion. In contrast, our new findings show that PHS increase causes vacuole fragmentation. Taken together, there may be multiple mechanisms controlling vacuole morphology by both increasing and decreasing PHS.</p>
<p>Based on the fact that both PHS- and tricalbin deletion-induced vacuolar fragmentations were partially suppressed by the lack of NVJ (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>, 4C), it is possible that the trigger for vacuolar fragmentation is NVJ-mediated transport of PHS into the vacuole. Recently, it has been reported that sphingoid bases are transferred between ER and vacuole via the NVJ, and that Mdm1p, a key tethering protein for the formation of the NVJ, may play an additional role in LCB transfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. The study applied an experimental method that tracks LCBs released in the vacuole and showed that Mdm1p is necessary for LCBs leakage into the ER. However, assuming that Mdm1p transports LCBs along its concentration gradient we consider that under normal conditions, LCBs is transported from the ER (as the organelle of PHS synthesis) to the vacuole. Perhaps, Mdm1p may be responsible for pulling out and passing LCBs. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the repression of vacuolar fragmentation in the absence of NVJ is not due to inhibition of PHS transfer, but rather to changes in the lipid composition of the vacuolar membrane caused by the lack of supply of other substances capable of triggering vacuolar fragmentation other than PHS, like sterols and lipids such as PtdIns[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]P2 and its precursors. Further analysis in this regard is warranted.</p>
<p>How accumulated PHS triggers vacuolar fragmentation remains undetermined. Fab1p, a target of TORC1, is responsible for the production of PtdIns[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]P2, which is a well-established inducer of vacuolar fragmentation. Fab1p exhibits co-localization with the TORC1-activating EGO complex, and its activity is controlled by Ivy1p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>] and TORC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>]. PtdIns[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]P2 was shown to regulate vacuole fission employing Vps1p and Atg18p as executioners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>] while also promoting TORC1 activity in a positive feedback loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>]. In this context, we found that PHS-induced vacuolar fragmentation can be suppressed by the loss of Fab1p and its regulatory binding partner Vac14p (Fig S3). This observation suggests that PHS-induced vacuolar fragmentation would employ known factors such as Fab1p or Vac14p as the executioners.</p>
<p>The following possibilities still remain, although less likely than the above. Sphingosine, as a bioactive lipid, has been reported to exert effects on enzyme activity in humans and yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>], and it is possible that PHS may induce vacuolar fragmentation through established signaling pathways. Yabuki et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>] reported that LCB accumulation activates a signaling pathway that includes major yeast regulatory kinases such as Pkh1/2p, Pkc1p and TORC1, which may be a candidate to promote vacuolar fragmentation. On the other hand, it was shown that membrane division is mediated by certain proteins that contain amphipathic helices (AHs) and interact with lipid cofactors such as PtdIns[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]P2, PA, and cardiolipin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>]. Thus, PHS may possess a similar regulatory function as a lipid cofactor for the activity of fission-inducing proteins. If PHS-induced vacuole fragmentation is not due to signaling, another possible model is that PHS accumulation in the vacuolar membrane causes physical changes in the membrane structure that result in membrane fragmentation. The accumulation of sphingosine in the GARP mutant <italic>vps53</italic>Δ, in which retrograde transport from the endosome to the Golgi is blocked, caused vacuolar fragmentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>], and thus also supports this model. Sphingosine stabilizes (rigidifies) the gel domains in the membrane, leading to a structural defect between the phase separation of &quot;more rigid&quot; and &quot;less rigid&quot; domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>]. This structural defect may result in high membrane permeability. Sphingosine also forms small and unstable channels (compared to the channels formed by ceramide) in the membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>]. Sphingosine channels are not large enough to release proteins but are believed to induce a permeability transition. Other studies have suggested that sphingosine induces non-lamellar structures by interacting with negatively charged lipids such as PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>]. PHS alone or in concert with negatively charged lipids such as PtdIns[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]P2 may be actively involved in the fission process by inducing structural changes in the vacuolar membrane.</p>
<p>Finally, additional results provided further insight into the more general aspects of PHS involvement in the vacuole fission process. Lipid analysis under hyperosmotic shock condition (0.2 M of 0.8 M of NaCl) showed an increase in PHS level (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). NaCl-induced vacuolar fragmentation was also suppressed by Rsb1p-mediated PHS export (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>), as was NVJ loss (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). In addition to the hyperosmotic shock-induced PHS accumulation, we have previously shown that treatment with tunicamycin, which is ER stress inducer, increased the PHS level by about 20% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>]. Tunicamycin treatment has been shown to induce vacuole fission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Collectively, we propose that the NVJ and PHS play a general regulatory role in vacuolar morphology.</p>

<title>FM4-64 stain and Fluorescence Microscopy</title>
<p>Yeast cells were cultured in YPD medium at 25°C for 15 hours to achieve OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.5. The cells were collected and suspended in the same medium to achieve OD<sub>600</sub>=20. 20 mM FM4-64 (N-(3-Triethylammoniumpropyl)-4-(6-(4-(diethylamino) phenyl) hexatrienyl) pyridinium) dissolved in DMSO was added (a final concentration of 20 μM) while shielded from light. The cells were incubated with FM4-64 for 15 minutes at 25°C and then the cells were washed twice with YPD medium. Cells were suspended to achieve OD<sub>600</sub>=10 in the same YPD medium or YPD containing reagents (such as rapamycin or PHS), and incubated at 25°C for 2 hours under light shielding to label the vacuoles. After incubation, cells were collected and observed with a fluorescence microscope.</p>

<p>This manuscript presents <bold>valuable</bold> findings that contribute to our understanding of how sphingolipids and membrane contact sites, formed by the tethering protein family tricalbins, are involved in regulating vacuolar morphology in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. The evidence supporting the authors' claims is largely <bold>solid</bold>. While the reported correlation between sphingolipid levels and vacuole homeostasis is interesting and intriguing, more work is needed to thoroughly substantiate the proposed mechanism. This study will be of interest to cell biologists focusing on intracellular organization and lipid metabolism.</p>

<p>The manuscript investigates the role of membrane contact sites (MCSs) and sphingolipid metabolism in regulating vacuolar morphology in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The authors show that tricalbin (1-3) deletion leads to vacuolar fragmentation and the accumulation of the sphingolipid phytosphingosine (PHS). They propose that PHS triggers vacuole division through MCSs and the nuclear-vacuolar junction (NVJ). The study presents some solid data and proposes potential mechanisms underlying vacuolar fragmentation driven by this pathway. Although the manuscript is clear in what the data indicates and what is more hypothetical, the story would benefit from providing more conclusive evidence to support these hypothesis. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the connection between MCSs, lipid metabolism, and vacuole dynamics.</p>

<p>This manuscript explores the mechanism underlying the accumulation of phytosphingosine (PHS) and its role in initiating vacuole fission. The study posits the involvement of membrane contact sites (MCSs) in two key stages of this process. Firstly, MCSs tethered by tricalbin between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the plasma membrane (PM) or Golgi regulate the intracellular levels of PHS. Secondly, the amassed PHS triggers vacuole fission, most likely through the nuclear-vacuolar junction (NVJ). The authors propose that MCSs play a regulatory role in vacuole morphology via sphingolipid metabolism.</p>
<p>While some results in the manuscript are intriguing, certain broad conclusions occasionally surpass the available data. Despite the authors' efforts to enhance the manuscript, certain aspects remain unclear. It is still uncertain whether subtle changes in PHS levels could induce such effects on vacuolar fission. Additionally, it is regrettable that the lipid measurements are not comparable with previous studies by the authors. Future advancements in methods for determining intracellular lipid transport and levels are anticipated to shed light on the remaining uncertainties in this study.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, the authors investigated the effects of deletion of the ER-plasma membrane/Golgi tethering proteins tricalbins (Tcb1-3) on vacuolar morphology to demonstrate the role of membrane contact sites (MCSs) in regulating vacuolar morphology in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Their data show that tricalbin deletion causes vacuolar fragmentation possibly in parallel with TORC1 pathway. In addition, their data reveal that levels of various lipids including ceramides, long-chain base (LCB)-1P, and phytosphingosine (PHS) are increased in tricalbin-deleted cells. The authors find that exogenously added PHS can induce vacuole fragmentation and by performing analyses of genes involved in sphingolipid metabolism, they conclude that vacuolar fragmentation in tricalbin-deleted cells is due to the accumulated PHS in these cells. Importantly, exogenous PHS- or tricalbin deletion-induced vacuole fragmentation was suppressed by loss of the nucleus vacuole junction (NVJ), suggesting the possibility that PHS transported from the ER to vacuoles via the NVJ triggers vacuole fission. Of note, the authors find that hyperosmotic shock increases intracellular PHS levels, suggesting a general role of PHS in vacuole fission in response to physiological vacuolar division-inducing stimuli.</p>
<p>This work provides valuable insights into the relationship between MCS-mediated sphingolipid metabolism and vacuole morphology. The conclusions of this paper are mostly supported by their results, but inclusion of direct evidence indicating increased transport of PHS from the ER to vacuoles via NVJ in response to vacuolar division-inducing stimuli would have strengthened this study.</p>
<p>There is another weakness in their claim that the transmembrane domain of Tcb3 contributes to the formation of the tricalbin complex which is sufficient for tethering ER to the plasma membrane and the Golgi complex. Their claim is based only on the structural simulation, but not on by biochemical experiments such as co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down.</p>

<p>We thank the positive review from the Reviewer #1. We hope that our hypotheses are supported by the &quot;Author Response to Recommendations&quot; and by further research in the future.</p>

<p>We thank the careful comment from Reviewer #2. As Reviewer #2 pointed out, the mechanism of how slight changes in PHS levels can induce the vacuolar fission event is still uncovered in this manuscript. We sincerely consider that this issue has to be resolved in further study.</p>

<p>We appreciate the careful feedback from Reviewer #3. We have responded in the &quot;Recommendations to Authors&quot; section and hope it can partially support the weakness in our claim regarding the physical interaction between Tcb1, 2, and 3.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>I would suggest that the authors include some of the data (e.g., Tcb interactions) that they refer to in the response to the reviewers. I think that this could enhance the message in this manuscript. Also, maybe it's a typo and you were referring to some other image panel, but in the rebuttal letter a &quot;Fig. S3B&quot; is mentioned, but I could not find it.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Following the suggestions of reviewers #1 and #3, we have added the data of co-immunoprecipitation which confirmed that Tcb3 binds to both Tcb1 and Tcb2 as Supplemental Figure 2. With this change, the person (Ms. Saku Sasaki) who performed this analysis was also added as a co-author.</p>
<p>Also, we appreciate the careful remark and apologize for the mistake. In the previous Author's response, we mentioned the vacuole observation using SD medium, but this data was Fig 5C, not Fig S3B.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>I would recommend that the authors include the IP data mentioned in their rebuttal letter to show the interactions among Tcb1-3. Also, the authors should quantify all lipid species in Fig 5B, as shown in Fig 3A.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Following the suggestions of reviewers #1 and #3, we have added the co-immunoprecipitation data (Fig S2). In a further study, we would like to test if the transmembrane domain of Tcb3 is sufficient for the interaction among Tcb1-3. Also, we quantified all lipid species and replaced the data in Fig 5B.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor points:</p>
<p>(1) The function of vps4 is not mentioned in the manuscript.</p>
<p>(2) The function of Sur2p is not mentioned in the manuscript. It should be clearly mentioned that DHS is converted to PHS by Sur2p.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>(1) We have added text sections which mention that VPS4 is needed for normal ESCRT function, and its deletion is an example for inhibition of GFP-Cps1p transport into the vacuole.</p>
<p>(2) We have added the text in the manuscript that states Sur2p is the hydroxylase that catalysis the conversion of DHS to PHS.</p>
