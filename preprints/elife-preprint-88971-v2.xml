<title>Abstract</title>
<p><italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> is a global public health concern due to the rising myriad of hypervirulent and multi-drug resistant clones both alarmingly associated with high mortality. The molecular microbial genetics underpinning these recalcitrant <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> infections is unclear, coupled with the emergence of lineages resistant to nearly all present day clinically important antimicrobials. In this study, we performed a genome-wide screen in <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> ECL8, a member of the endemic K2-ST375 pathotype most often reported in Asia, to define genes essential for growth in a nutrient-rich laboratory medium (Luria-Bertani medium), human urine and serum. Through transposon directed insertion-site sequencing (TraDIS), a total of 427 genes were identified as essential for growth on LB agar, whereas transposon insertions in 11 and 144 genes decreased fitness for growth in either urine or serum, respectively. These studies provide further knowledge on the genetics of this pathogen but also provide a strong impetus for discovering new antimicrobial targets to improve current therapeutic options for <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> infections.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> are Gram-negative bacteria found ubiquitously in natural and man-made environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>)1} (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). In immunocompromised patients, and those with co-morbidities such as diabetes or alcoholism, <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> can colonize multiple body sites causing a diverse array of infections ranging from life-threatening pneumonia, urinary tract infections (UTIs), and bacteremia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> is a frequently reported multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogen isolated from nosocomial settings. Such infections have generally higher mortality rates and require longer treatment regimens and hospital stays, placing a significant burden on healthcare providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Of most concern is resistance to β-lactam antibiotics such as penicillin, aztreonam, and extended-spectrum cephalosporins, by horizontally acquired plasmid-mediated β-lactamases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). While combined antibiotic therapies have been deployed in the clinic, the emergence of pandrug-resistant strains has created an urgency to develop new and efficient approaches to treat <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). The identification of genetic determinants essential for growth and those required for survival of <italic>K. pneumoniae in vivo</italic> may help elucidate novel therapeutic targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent large scale phylogenetic investigations have suggested that distinct lineages of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> exist in clinical and environmental settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Furthermore, two clinical pathotypes of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> have emerged: classical and hypervirulent. While the full repertoire of genetic factors required for <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> virulence remains unclear, various studies have highlighted the importance of genes involved in adhesion, iron acquisition, capsulation and cell envelope biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Nevertheless, for both classical and hypervirulent <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> strains, the ability to colonize the urinary tract and survive in the bloodstream are essential pathogenic traits and are dependent on a large and diverse range of virulence factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Indeed, previous studies demonstrated that lipopolysaccharide (O-) (9 serotypes) and capsular polysaccharide (K-) antigens (79 serotypes) contribute to the resistance of serum-mediated killing and antiphagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). However, prior genetic screens have revealed that serum-resistance in Gram-negative bacteria is an intricate phenotype defined by a multitude of factors (the serum resistome) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). A recent study of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> identified 93 different genes associated with serum resistance across four distinct strains but found that only three genes (<italic>lpp</italic>, <italic>arnD</italic>, and <italic>rfaH</italic>) played a role in all strains. These data hint that multiple mechanisms of serum resistance may exist in <italic>Klebsiella</italic> lineages. In contrast, the full repertoire of genes required for growth of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> in the urinary tract (the urinome) has not been defined.</p>
<p>To define the genetic basis of the <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> urinome and serum resistome, we used Transposon Insertion Sequencing (TIS), also referred to as Transposon Directed Insertion-site Sequencing (TraDIS). TraDIS is a genome-wide screening technique that has been widely used to identify genes essential for bacterial growth and to discover conditionally essential genes under physiologically relevant conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). In this study, we generated a highly saturated transposon library within <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> ECL8, a member of the K2-ST375 phylogenetic lineage that includes hypervirulent clones of epidemiological significance known to cause infections in relatively healthy subjects predominantly in Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). We identified the repertoire of genes essential for growth in laboratory conditions, in pooled human urine, and in human serum. Selected fitness-genes were validated for growth in pooled urine or serum by generating single-gene deletion mutants. Our study provides insight into the molecular mechanisms that enable <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> to survive <italic>in vivo</italic> and cause disease.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Bacterial strains, plasmids, and culturing conditions</title>
<p>A complete list of bacterial strains, plasmids, and primers utilized in this study are listed in Table S1 and Table S2. To culture strains, scrapings from a frozen glycerol stock strain were plated onto solid Luria-Bertani (LB) (10 g tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, 10 g NaCl) supplemented with agar 1.5% (w/v) and were incubated overnight at 37°C. A single colony was isolated and used to inoculate 5 mL of liquid LB medium incubated overnight at 37°C with 180 RPM shaking. To prepare stocks, bacteria were grown to mid-exponential phase in LB medium and stored at -80°C with 25% (v/v) glycerol. When required, solid or liquid media were supplemented with appropriate antibiotics at the following concentrations: ampicillin (35 μg/mL); chloramphenicol (100 μg/mL); and kanamycin (100 μg/mL).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Generation of the <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> ECL8 transposon mutant library</title>
<p>An overnight culture of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> ECL8 was inoculated into 2× YT broth at OD<sub>600</sub> 0.05 supplemented with a final concentration of 0.7 mM EDTA and incubated at 37°C with 180 RPM shaking. Cells were harvested at 0.4 OD<sub>600</sub> by centrifugation (4,000 <italic>g</italic>) at 4°C for 20 min. Cell pellets were washed 4 times with ice-cold 10% (v/v) glycerol. <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> ECL8 electrocompetent cells were transformed with 0.2 µL of EZ-Tn<italic>5</italic>™ transposon (Epicentre) at 1.4 kV and recovered in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth for 2 h at 37°C with 180 RPM shaking. Cells were plated onto LB agar supplemented with 50 µg/mL kanamycin and incubated overnight at 37°C. More than 1 million transformants were pooled in 15% (v/v) LB-glycerol for storage at -80°C until required.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Transposon library screening in human urine</title>
<p>Human urine from 7 healthy male volunteers was sterilized using a vacuum filter (0.2 μM). Urine was pooled and stored at -80<italic>°</italic>C until required. Approximately 2 × 10<sup>8</sup> <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> ECL8 TraDIS mutants were inoculated into 50 mL of urine and grown for 12 h at 37<italic>°</italic>C with shaking (P1) in biological duplicates in parallel with control samples that were instead inoculated into 50 mL of LB medium. A sample of P1 was inoculated into 50 mL of urine or LB medium, respectively, at an initial OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.05 and grown for a subsequent 12 h (P2). Both control and test experiments were passaged and grown for a further 12 h (P3). A sample of culture from P3 was removed and normalized to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 1 for subsequent genomic DNA extraction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Transposon library screening in human serum</title>
<p>A 10 mL sample of human blood was collected from 8 healthy volunteers (male and female). Blood was pooled and centrifuged at 6,000 <italic>g</italic> for 20 min to separate sera from blood components. The pooled serum was sterilized, aliquoted and stored at -80<italic>°</italic>C until required. Approximately 2 x 10<sup>8</sup> <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> ECL8 mutants were inoculated into 1 mL of pre-warmed sera, heat-inactivated sera (60<italic>°</italic>C for 1 h) in biological duplicates. Samples were incubated at 37°C for 90 min with 180 RPM shaking. Following this, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min and washed twice with PBS. Cells were then inoculated into 50 mL of LB for outgrowth at 37<italic>°</italic>C with 180 RPM shaking and harvested at an OD<sub>600</sub> of 1 by centrifugation at 6,000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. A 1 mL sample of each culture was used for genomic DNA extraction.</p>

<sec id="s2e">
<title>Transposon library sequencing and data analysis</title>
<p>Pooled kanamycin resistant <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> ECL8 cells were prepared for sequencing following an amended TraDIS protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Briefly, genomic DNA from the <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> ECL8 library of pooled mutants was extracted from ∼1×10<sup>9</sup> cells in biological duplicate, as per manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen QIAamp DNA blood minikit). The DNA concentration of replicates was determined using the Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The DNA was sheared into ∼200 bp fragments by ultra-sonication (Bioruptor Plus Diagenode). Fragmented DNA samples were prepared for Illumina sequencing using the NEBNext Ultra I DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina according to manufacturer’s instructions with the following modifications: ends of fragmented DNA were repaired using the End Prep Enzyme Mix (NEB) and an NEBNext adaptor for Illumina sequencing was ligated to the newly repaired ends. During protocol optimization, samples were analyzed using a Tapestation 2200 (High Sensitivity D5000) to determine DNA fragment sizes following adapter ligation. The uracil within the adaptor hairpin loop was enzymically excised using the USER enzyme (NEB). AMPure XP SPRI beads (Beckman Coulter) or custom-made SPRI beads were used to select for DNA fragments ∼250 bp in size.</p>
<p>To enrich for fragments containing the transposon a custom PCR step was introduced using a forward primer annealing to the 3’ end of the antibiotic marker of the transposon and a reverse primer that annealed to the ligated adaptor. The PCR product was purified using SPRI beads at a ratio of 0.9:1 (beads:sample). A further custom PCR step introduced sequencing flow-cell adaptors (Illumina barcodes) and inline barcodes to allow for sample multiplexing (Table S3). Samples were then stored at -20°C until sequencing. After qRT-PCR (KAPA Library Quantification Kit Illumina® Platforms) to determine TraDIS library concentration, a 1.5 μL sample of each library sample diluted to 8 nM was combined and mixed by pipetting to generate a pooled amplified library (PAL) of samples for multiplexed sequencing. The PAL was prepared for Illumina MiSeq sequencing according to manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
<p>Bioinformatic analysis of sequencing reads was completed on the Cloud Infrastructure for Microbial Bioinformatics (CLIMB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). Raw fastQ files were first demultiplexed according to Illumina barcodes automatically using the Illumina MiSeq software. Experimental replicates were separated by custom inline barcodes using the FastX barcode splitter and the barcodes were subsequently removed using the FastX trimmer (v0.0.13). Each read was checked for the presence of the transposon sequence in two steps; first, reads that contained the first 25 bp of the transposon sequence (AGCTTCAGGGTTGAGATGTGTA), introduced by the TKK_F primer, allowing for 3 mismatches were filtered and parsed. Parsed reads were subsequently checked for the presence of the final 10 bp of the transposon sequence (TAAGAGACAG), allowing for 1 mismatch. The transposon sequence and reads &lt;20 bp were trimmed using Trimmomatic (v0.39). Resulting reads were mapped to the <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> ECL8 [HF536482.1 and HF536483] genome and plasmid using the Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA-MEM) using default parameters (i.e. -k=20bp exact match). Mapped reads were indexed using samtools (v1.8) and converted into bed format using the Bam2bed tool (Bedtools suite v2.27.1). The resulting bed file was intersected against the annotated CDS in the <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> ECL8 gff file, which was generated using PROKKA (v1.14.0). Transposon insertion sites and their corresponding location were quantified using custom python scripts. Mapped transposon insertion sites were visualized using the Artemis genome browser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Statistical analysis of transposon insertion density</title>

<p>In-house scripts kindly provided by Langridge and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>) were amended and used for the prediction of essential genes. Briefly, the number of unique transposon insertion sites for each gene was normalized for CDS length (number of UIPs/CDS length in bp), which was denoted the insertion index score.

<p>An exponential distribution was applied to the ‘essential’ mode, situated on the left of the histogram.

<title>Generation and sequencing of a <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> strain ECL8 transposon input library</title>
<p>A <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> ECL8 mini-Tn5 mutant library composed of &gt;1 million mutants was constructed and subsequently subjected to TraDIS. The resulting reads were mapped to the reference genome that consists of a ∼5.3 Mb chromosome and a single 205-kb plasmid (EMBL Accessions: HF536482.1 and HF536483) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-B</xref>). The gene insertion index scores of the two technical replicates of the <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> ECL8 TraDIS library (KTL1 and KTL2) were highly correlated with each other (R<sup>2</sup>=0.955) demonstrating a high level of reproducibility (Figure S1A). Therefore, sequence reads for both replicates were combined for downstream analysis and essential gene prediction. Through iterative rounds of sequencing, we determined that the library was sequenced to near saturation as the discovery of unique reads plateaued at ∼2 million reads (Figure S1B). This library contained 554,834 unique genome-wide transposon insertion sites and 499,919 of these insertions map within annotated coding sequence (CDS) boundaries. This high level of transposon coverage equates to an average transposon insertion every 9.93 bp throughout the genome, equivalent to an insertion approximately every four codons. A de Brujin graph visualized in the genome assembly package Bandage revealed that the sequencing coverage of the plasmid was only 1.33 fold higher than that of the chromosome indicating that the plasmid is likely present as a single copy (Figure S2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> summarizes the data relating to the ECL8 libraries.</p>

<title>Essential chromosomal genes in <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> ECL8</title>
<p>To classify a gene as essential or non-essential, the number of transposon insertions within each gene on the chromosome and plasmid was normalized for gene length and this value was denoted the gene insertion-index score (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Insertion index scores (IIS) for the <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> genome followed a bimodal distribution, as has been previously described (Figure S3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). The probability of a gene being essential was calculated by determining the likelihood of each given insertion-index score as belonging to the essential or non-essential mode. The ratio of the IIS values was denoted the log-likelihood ratio (Log<sub>2</sub>-LR), a metric previously used to categorize genes into essential or non-essential groupings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). To limit the number of false-positive hits identified, genes were classified as essential only if they were 12-times more likely to be within the essential, rather than the non-essential mode. Based on the above criteria, 373 chromosomal genes were assigned a log2-LR of less than -3.6 and were therefore classified as essential for growth on solid LB medium supplemented with kanamycin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). It should be noted that non-coding sequences such as tRNA and rRNA were excluded from this analysis. Most genes (4551) were classified as non-essential (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). A subset of 241 genes were located between these two modes with their essentiality mode was deemed ‘unclear’ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). A complete list for all <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> ECL8 bimodal essentiality categorization and their associated statistical significance metrics are listed in Dataset S1.</p>
<p>To understand the essential gene functions, we evaluated their COG (cluster of orthologous) categories; a metric that predicts functional classification against a database of known proteins. We applied a log<sub>2</sub> COG enrichment index to identify COG categories that were enriched among the essential genes in contrast to the wider genome eggNOG (v5.0) orthology data (Figure S4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). We identified no essential genes within the COG categories for chromatin structure and dynamics (B), cell motility (N) and secondary structure (Q) suggesting genes within these categories are not required or redundant for <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> growth in the utilized nutrient-rich liquid medium. However, genes involved in signal transduction (T) and inorganic ion transport/metabolism (P) were depleted, while genes involved in translation (J), cell cycle control (D) and co-enzyme metabolism (H) were the most highly enriched. This correlates with enriched COG categories shared among essential genes in other members of the Proteobacteria such as <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> Typhimurium, <italic>S. enterica</italic> Typhi and <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> and serves as an internal control for the validity of the library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>).</p>

<title>“Essential” plasmid genes</title>
<p>The identification of eleven genes on the <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> ECL8 plasmid that met the criteria to be defined as essential was an unexpected observation (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). As previously noted, the bacterial copy number of the plasmid was approximated to be one. The average IIS of a gene located on the plasmid and the chromosome was comparable, 0.16 and 0.11, respectively. Due to the presence of a single plasmid per bacterial cell, and an observed even distribution of IISs for genes located on the plasmid, the lack of insertions in the 11 genes is unlikely to be due to gene dosage effects arising from the presence of multiple copies of the plasmid. Notably, the 11 plasmid-borne “essential” genes included <italic>repB,</italic> which is required for plasmid replication. Therefore, these genes are likely to be required for plasmid replication and stability and are unlikely to be essential for growth.

<title>Insertion free regions</title>
<p>Using a highly saturated transposon library it is possible to not only define essential genes, but also define chromosomal regions lacking transposons that are large enough not to have occurred by chance. Previously, we described a geometric model to predict statistically significant regions of the genome that were free from transposon insertions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). This model indicated that with the insertion frequency calculated for this library, for a genome of 5.3 Mb, an insertion-free region (IFR) of 145 bp or greater was statistically significant (Figure S5). The size of insertion-free regions that are statistically significant for two previously published TraDIS libraries are plotted for comparison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). A total of 667 genomic regions with insertion-free regions ≥145 bp were identified, many which correspond to the 380 essential genes identified through the bimodal analysis described earlier.</p>
<p>The remaining insertion free regions can be explained in several ways. First, as noted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), genes that encode proteins with essential domains are often excluded from the bimodal analysis described above as much of the gene contains transposon insertions. For example, the <italic>polA</italic> gene was classified as “unclear” but contained, barring a single transposon insertion event, an 826-bp insertion-free region. This IFR corresponds to 275 amino acids that are predicted to encode the 5’-3’ exonuclease function of the protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). This region has also been shown to be required for the growth of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> in laboratory conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). In contrast, but as noted for <italic>E. coli polA</italic>, multiple transposon insertions are present in the remaining portion of the gene, which confers the 3’-5’ proofreading and polymerase activity. Aside from those genes already identified by the bimodal analyses described above, our analyses revealed 54 additional genes with statistically significant IFRs, which indicates that they are likely essential for growth under the conditions tested here. Thus, our data suggest <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> contains at least 427 essential genes, which we define as the ECL8 curated essential gene list.</p>
<p>An explanation for the remaining IFRs can be derived from traditional bioinformatic approaches to genome annotation. Originally, genome annotation protocols overlooked small ORFs because (i) they only consider genes that code for proteins &gt;100 amino acids, and (ii) define genes based on sequence homology to those that have been previously annotated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). Interestingly, the methodology used here revealed 59 regions ≥145 bp that lacked transposon insertion sites and did not map to within annotated CDS boundaries (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). The applied approach is conservative and does not include insertion free regions that overlap with the 5’ or 3’ region of any annotated CDS. Forty-six of these regions contain potential open reading frames that could encode proteins through blastX identification. These putative unannotated ORFs were not characterized further within this study but might represent essential genes. This study emphasizes the untapped potential of TraDIS datasets to identify previously uncharacterized, essential, small coding sequences and promoter elements that are not immediately obvious by traditional and computational genomic annotation methods. A complete list of IFRs, within annotated ORFs or in intergenic regions, and an ECL8 curated essential gene list is found in Dataset S2.</p>

<p>As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>), due to the design of the transposon used in this study, transcription of polycistronic operons can be affected by the insertion orientation of the transposon (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>).

</fig>
<p>Notably, transposon insertions were poorly tolerated in the forward Tn orientation of the DNA strand. While bias for Tn insertions has previously been described in individual genes (e.g. ribosomal RNA genes), this study is the first to describe such a large bias across an operon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). However, the basis for this bias is not fully understood. One potential explanation for such bias might be the presence of a gene encoding a toxic small RNA (tsRNA). Typically, tsRNAs are usually present in the 5’ or 3’ untranslated regions of genes and act as regulators of gene expression at a post-transcriptional level, but due to their small size, typically &lt;500 nucleotides, they are very difficult to predict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>). However, this hypothesis does not explain why transposon insertions are uniformly absent for the opposite orientation of the transposon and not isolated to ‘hotspots’ in the 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions. An alternative hypothesis is that the reverse orientation expression of the capsular operon might result in the accumulation of intracellular capsular intermediates that may be toxic if left to accumulate in the periplasm. This finding may hint to a more cryptic regulation mechanism of the <italic>cps</italic> operon with implications for other similar <italic>Klebsiella</italic> capsular serotypes and species.</p>

<title>Comparison of essential genes to other <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> transposon libraries</title>
<p>Transposon libraries have previously been generated in other <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> strains, however these studies primarily focused on identifying genes that are required for a specific phenotype i.e antibiotic stress or capsular mutants, and therefore they lack a definitive list of essential genes for <italic>in vitro</italic> growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>).

As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, the ECL8 strain is an acceptable representative for the <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> KpI phylogroup as demonstrated by the phylogenetic and ANI (average nucleotide identity) analyses in the context of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> strains previously used or ‘common’ nosocomial lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>). Furthermore, our transposon mutant library is amongst the most saturated <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> libraries reported to date, permitting accurate determination of gene essentiality and delineating between real and stochastic effects. The number of essential genes among the four strains ranged from 434 to 642; a complete list and comparison of our curated gene list against the reported gene lists of KPNIH1, RH201207 and ATCC 43816 is found in Dataset S3. We speculate that the higher number of essential genes predicted in the KPNIH1 gene list is due to a lower transposon density, as this is associated with an increased likelihood of false-positive results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>). This might be due in part to differences in the techniques used to construct the libraries; here we used a mini-Tn5 transposon which showed no bias in insertion whereas others have used the TnSeq method relying on the Himar I Mariner transposon, which has a requirement for a TA dinucleotide motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>). Differences in gene essentiality might also be due to inherent genomic differences or due to differences in experimental methodology, computational approaches, or the stringency of analysis used to categorize these genes. While further validation experiments will be required to determine whether specific genes are essential, 57% of the essential genes identified in <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> ECL8 were essential in the other three strains.

Cultures were grown until late stationary phase (12 h) followed by two subsequent 12 h passages before sequencing (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). This approach eliminated mutants that were unable to grow in urine while allowing those capable of growth to flourish. DNA from test and control samples was harvested, sequenced, and analyzed as before (Figure S6). As the gene IISs for the library passaged in both LB and urine were highly correlated with respective biological replicates of 0.8483 and 0.9078 R<sup>2</sup>, replicates were combined for downstream analyses (Figure S7). The data for all <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> genes and their associated statistical significance metrics are listed in Dataset S4.</p>

<p>(A) Schematic of the experimental design used to identify genes that provide a fitness advantage for <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> ECL8 growth in pooled human urine. The <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> ECL8 library was inoculated into either 50 mL of LB or 50 mL of urine and incubated at 37°C with 180 RPM shaking for 12 h. The library was passaged into 50 mL of fresh LB or pooled human urine at an initial OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.05 two subsequent times.

<p>Ten genes that satisfied a stringent threshold of a log<sub>2</sub> fold change (log<sub>2</sub>FC) &gt;-2 and a Q-value ≤0.05, relative to the LB control, were considered as advantageous for <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> ECL8 growth in urine (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). The transposon insertion profiles of these genes showed a marked decrease in overall insertions following passaging in urine when compared to the LB control (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C-F</xref>), suggesting loss of these genes confers a fitness defect. These included genes encoding the superoxide dismutase SodA, the structural outer membrane protein OmpA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>), the periplasmic chaperone Skp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>), and five proteins (<italic>fepB</italic>, <italic>fepD</italic>, <italic>fepG</italic>, <italic>exbB</italic> and <italic>exbD</italic>) associated with iron acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>). The remaining two genes (<italic>ytfL</italic> and <italic>argH</italic>) play key roles in controlling cytoplasmic cadaverine and putrescine concentrations and amino acid biosynthesis, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>). The proper regulation of cadaverine and putrescine maintains intracellular pH concentrations and reduce oxidative damage to proteins and DNA and may be in response to acidic conditions in urine known to be unconducive for colonization of uropathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>).</p>
<p>To experimentally validate our observations, seven independent mutants were constructed by allelic replacement of the chromosomal gene with a kanamycin (<italic>aph</italic>) cassette. To determine whether <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> strains lacking the genes identified in this screen were truly less fit in urine compared to the parent strain, the WT ECL8 and individual isogenic mutant strains were inoculated into urine or LB medium at a 1:1 ratio. These cultures were sequentially passaged, and the CFU/mL of both the WT and mutant strain were determined over a time-course of three 12 h passages (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). When compared to the wild-type, a Δ<italic>sodA</italic>::<italic>aph</italic> mutant was less fit in both urine and LB, but the phenotype was exacerbated in urine. In contrast, the fitness of the remaining mutants was comparable to the parent strain when grown in LB medium and only less fit when grown in urine. While the relative competitive index of the Δ<italic>ytfL</italic>::<italic>aph</italic> strain was 0.8 in urine, the <italic>ompA</italic>, <italic>fepB</italic>, <italic>fepD</italic>, <italic>exbB</italic> and <italic>exbD</italic> mutants were dramatically less fit than the parent strain in urine (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on these observations, we hypothesized that iron-levels were limiting growth in human urine and that the ability to acquire iron was crucial for <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> to survive and grow <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>). To test this hypothesis, urine was supplemented with exogenous ferrous iron (100 μM FeSO<sub>4</sub>) or an iron chelator (100 μM bipyridine/2,2-dipyridyl). No variance in optical density was observed after passaging in LB medium (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). However, the optical density of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> cultures decreased after passage in urine (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>), and the restricted growth was further exacerbated by the addition of the iron chelator 2,2-dipyridyl (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). In contrast, supplementation of urine with exogenous iron increased growth relative to non-supplemented cultures with no difference in growth upon passage (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). To further interrogate the role of iron limitation, the growth kinetics of the constructed mutants were grown in urine with and without exogenous ferrous iron for 16 h in a microtiter plate assay. Not unexpectedly, area under the curve (AUC) analysis revealed that mutants lacking genes involved in iron uptake (<italic>fepB</italic>, <italic>fepD</italic>, <italic>exbB</italic>, <italic>exbD</italic>) were drastically less fit than the wildtype (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). Surprisingly, our screen showed several siderophore synthesis genes did not confer a statistically significant fitness advantage for growth in urine (i.e. <italic>entACDF</italic>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). In contrast, the highest Log<sub>2</sub>FC increase (∼7-fold) in read counts mapped to the <underline>F</underline>erric <underline>U</underline>ptake <underline>R</underline>egulator (<italic>fur</italic>) gene indicating its loss is beneficial for growth in urine. In Gram-negative bacteria, Fur is a key regulator for iron homeostasis functioning as a transcriptional repressor for siderophore synthesis genes in an iron concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>). Furthermore, the Fur regulon includes the cognate ferric enterobactin uptake (Fep) genes, for which decreased Log<sub>2</sub>FC read counts were also noted (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). Altogether, this suggests that the Fur regulon plays a pivotal role for <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> growth in urine by tightly regulating enterobactin synthesis and enterobactin-mediated iron uptake.</p>

<title>Identification of genes required for resistance to complement-mediated killing</title>
<p>To identify genes that protect against complement-mediated killing,previously defined as the serum resistome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>), we first established the serum killing kinetics of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> ECL8. Approximately, 2 x 10<sup>8</sup> cells were incubated with 100 μL of human serum for 180 min. At specified time points, aliquots were plated to determine the number of viable bacteria. As expected, no viable bacteria were recovered from the <italic>E. coli</italic> BW25113 control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>). In contrast, a 2 log<sub>10</sub> decrease in the number of viable <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> cells was observed after 90 min exposure to normal human serum, and a &gt;4 log<sub>10</sub> decrease after 180 min exposure. To determine whether the observed reduction in viable cells was due to the presence of active complement proteins, <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> was incubated inheat-inactivated serum control where no reduction in viable was noted (Figure S8).</p>
<p>Subsequently, 2 x 10<sup>8</sup> cells from the ECL8 TraDIS library were inoculated into 1 mL of human serum or 1 mL of heat-inactivated human serum and incubated for 90 min. Following exposure to serum, cells were grown in duplicate to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 1 in LB medium to enrich for viable mutants. DNA was harvested from each sample, and subsequently sequenced as described previously (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). The Pearson correlation coefficient (R<sup>2</sup>) of gene insertion index scores (IIS) for two sequenced biological replicates were calculated as 0.91 (normal human serum) and 0.76 (heat inactivated serum) (Figure S9). To ensure robust data analysis, thresholds were applied to the data where genes with less than 50 mapped reads in the input library were removed from downstream analysis to exclude confounding essential genes and minimize the effect of stochastic mutant loss. A total of 356 genes with a log<sub>2</sub>FC ≤-2, P&lt;0.05, and Q-value of ≤0.05 between the serum and heat-inactivated control were classified as genes that are advantageous for growth under complement-mediated killing conditions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). The complete list of all genes analyzed for growth in human serum and their associated statistical significance metrics are listed in Dataset S5. The operons encoding lipopolysaccharide (LPS) core antigen, O-antigen, and enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) biosynthesis were noted as containing several conditionally essential genes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Mutants defective in these cell envelope structures have previously been reported to play a role in membrane integrity and resistance to serum-killing for a variety of Gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref>). Genes implicated as important for serum resistance encode proteins with an important role in membrane stability. They include GalE involved in LPS sugar sub-unit biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>), outer membrane protein MlaA involved in phospholipid retrograde transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref>), cardiolipin synthase ClsA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref>), Bam complex component BamE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref>), and proteins involved in LPS biosynthesis (LpxC) and its regulator (YejM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref>).</p>
<p>To validate our observations, we selected the gene with the greatest Log<sub>2</sub>FC decrease between serum and a heat-inactivated control; a putative glycosyltransferase <italic>espE</italic>_3/<italic>wbbY</italic> (inset, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Analyses using the ‘Kaptive’ webtool suggested that ECL8 encodes the O-antigen serotype O1v2 with the operon having 98.98% nucleotide identity to the reference genome (Dataset S6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>). The O-antigen of the O1v2 serotype features distal repeating D-galactan I and D-galactan II sugar sub-units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref>). Despite its role in O-antigen biosynthesis, <italic>wbbY</italic> is not located within the <italic>rfb</italic> LPS operon. To determine the role of <italic>wbbY</italic> in serum sensitivity, the gene was replaced with an <italic>aph</italic> cassette and the resulting mutant was compared to its parent strain using a serum bactericidal assay. A comparable growth profile was observed for <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> ECL8 and the Δ<italic>wbbY</italic>::<italic>aph</italic> mutant in LB medium (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). However, the Δ<italic>wbbY</italic>::<italic>aph</italic> mutant was more sensitive to human serum than the parent with no viable mutants surviving after 30 min (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). To investigate whether the <italic>wbbY</italic> deletion affected LPS production, crude LPS extracts were visualized using silver staining (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). The Δ<italic>wbbY</italic>::<italic>aph</italic> strain produced LPS with a lower molecular-weight compared to the parent strain, suggesting that a truncated O-antigen was expressed Alterations in the amount or length of LPS produced are known to influence susceptibility to serum mediated killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>). Importantly, Hsieh <italic>et al</italic> have previously reported that deletion by <italic>wbbY</italic> in <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> NTUH-K2044 (ST23) resulted in LPS profile defects due to abrogated D-galactan II production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref>). The authors also demonstrate that gene complementation restores LPS profiles and serum-resistance, thus demonstrating that this screen was robust in identifying a key <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> gene involved in complemented-mediated killing.</p>

<title>Identification of genes required for serum-resistance</title>
<p>Following the identification of genes that when mutated confer increased sensitivity to complement-mediated killing (i.e. the serum resistome), the <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> ECL8 TraDIS library was screened for mutants that confer increased resistance to serum-killing. Approximately 2 x 10<sup>8</sup> TraDIS mutants were incubated in 1 mL of human serum for 180 min. The output pool was washed with PBS and plated onto LB agar supplemented with kanamycin (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Following overnight growth, ∼150,000 colonies were recovered and pooled for sequencing confirming good correlation of replicates (Figure S10). We then used AlbaTraDIS to identify mutations that conferred a fitness advantage or disadvantage for survival in serum. In addition to identifying genes with an increase or decrease in reads between the condition and control samples, AlbaTraDIS will also analyze changes in sequencing read depth of insertions immediately upstream and downstream of a gene, as well as within-gene transposon orientation biases. Such differences can be strong indicators of mutations that result in gene expression or regulatory effects (For a detailed explanation please see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>)). The data for insertions with a significant (&gt;2-fold) change in read-depth following serum exposure for 180 min are listed in Dataset S7. As expected, similar to our previous experiment genes with the greatest significance in decreased insertions, suggesting decreased fitness, were O-antigen outer-core biosynthesis gene espJ_2/<italic>wabI</italic> and O-antigen ligase rfaL/<italic>waaL</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). Genes with significantly increased insertions, suggesting increased fitness, included <italic>hns</italic>, <italic>gnd</italic> and <italic>igaA</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). Closer inspection of the transposon insertion profiles further confirmed the enrichment of <italic>hns</italic> mutants when comparing the serum exposed test to the input control (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). To validate our observations, a defined <italic>hns</italic> mutant was constructed by allelic replacement with an <italic>aph</italic> cassette in the same orientation as native gene transcription. A comparable growth profile in LB was observed for the <italic>hns</italic> mutant relative to the parent (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). To determine whether the <italic>hns</italic> mutant was indeed more resistant to serum a sample of 1 x 10<sup>8</sup> cells was incubated in serum for 360 min. At 30 min post-incubation the number of viable <italic>hns</italic>::aph cells was decreased by ∼2 log. However, no additional decrease in viable cell numbers was observed at later time points and these strains proliferated in serum (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>). Ares and colleagues demonstrated that <italic>rcsA; galF; wzi;</italic> and <italic>manC</italic> were derepressed in a Δ<italic>hns K. pneumoniae</italic> mutant resulting in increased capsule production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref>). Similarly, up-regulation of <italic>rcsA</italic> was noted in an <italic>E. coli</italic> Δ<italic>hns</italic> mutant. RcsA is known to positively regulate the capsular locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref>). Notably, IgaA represses the Rcs regulon, preventing activation of RcsA. Mutants in <italic>igaA</italic> are enriched in our experiments (Figure S11A). These data suggest that activation of the Rcs regulon confers resistance to serum killing in <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, as noted for other members of the <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, by increasing capsule production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>For a variety of reasons, the determination of gene essentiality from TraDIS data is challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Here, we used two different computational approaches to identify essential genes ensuring that our essential gene dataset includes those genes that can tolerate insertions in regions of the gene but where specific domains are essential for growth. Coupled with the presented phylogenetic and genomic analyses, the observation that 57% of the essential genes identified in this study were found to be essential in three of the four <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> TraDIS libraries described to date provides reassurance that this library would provide meaningful data for subsequent studies. A minor caveat that is worthwhile mentioning is the potential for false-positive gene essentiality calls due to nucleoid-assocaited proteins (NAPs) hinders traposon insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">104</xref>). Nevertheless, the high density of insertion sites achieved in our study ensured reliable identification of essential and conditionally-essential genes and a low probability of false positive identification, which had previously been noted for low complexity libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>).</p>
<p>The search for genetic determinants of bacterial survival and growth <italic>in vivo</italic> has been augmented by whole genome approaches to infection, including transposon insertion site sequencing techniques such as TraDIS and TnSeq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). These data have potential implications for the design and development of novel drugs, vaccines and antivirulence strategies. In this study, we employed TraDIS to identify genes which, when mutated, confer decreased or increased fitness for growth in human urine and serum, two <italic>in vivo</italic> niches relevant to <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> infection. Unexpectedly, our study revealed only 11 genes significantly required for growth in urine. These included genes encoding the outer membrane protein OmpA, its chaperone Skp, the superoxide dismutase SodA, and genes required for iron acquisition by the enterobactin uptake system. Notably, not all the genes for enterobactin synthesis, export and uptake were essential (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). The gene encoding FepB, the periplasmic chaperone for the iron laden siderophore, was essential, as were <italic>fepD</italic> and <italic>fepG</italic>, which encode the inner membrane uptake system. The TonB complex (TonB-ExbB-ExbD), which energizes the translocation of iron laden enterobactin through the FepA outer membrane pore, was also essential for growth in urine. In contrast, the genes encoding FepA, the inner membrane ATPase FepC, and the enterobactin synthesis (Ent) and export (TolC) components were not essential. These observations can be explained in two ways. First, as <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> ECL8 contains paralogous copies of <italic>fepA</italic> (<italic>fepA</italic>_1 and <italic>fepA</italic>_2) and <italic>fepC</italic> (<italic>fepC</italic>_1 and <italic>fepC</italic>_2), the non-essential nature of <italic>fepA</italic> and <italic>fepC</italic> might be the result of functional redundancy. Second, as TraDIS is in principle a large-scale competition experiment between thousands of mutants, mutants lacking enterobactin (or aerobactin) synthesis and export genes can “cheat” by acquiring the siderophore released from siderophore-producing strains within the population, a phenomenon described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">105</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">106</xref>). It should be mentioned, our study utilized filter sterilized urine which may preclude identification of genes that are required for interspecies predation, cross-protection and cross-feeding in the context of a urinary microbiome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">107</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">108</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to the limited number of genes in the urinome, the serum resistome consisted of more than 144 genes. This number is significantly greater than reports of a recent study that defined the serum resistome of four independent <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). While that study found 93 genes that were required for survival in one or more strains, remarkably only three genes were common to all four strains: <italic>rfaH</italic>, <italic>lpp</italic> and <italic>arnD</italic>. Comparison with our dataset revealed that in contrast to <italic>rfaH, arnD</italic> was not required for serum resistance in <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> ECL8. Surprisingly, comparison of our data with the 56 genes comprising the serum resistome of the more distantly related multidrug resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> strain EC958 revealed 14 genes in common. The variation in the outcome of these experiments can be accounted for in different ways. First, in all cases the genes encoding O-antigen and/or capsule synthesis were required for growth in normal human serum; As the genes encoding these surface structures vary with serotype, they are not identified as common genes, though ostensibly they have the same function Second, the methodology appears at first glance to be identical in each study (growth in the presence of serum for 90 min). However, not all strains exhibit the same killing kinetics in normal human serum. Using fixed timepoints, strains with longer killing kinetics are likely to have fewer genes identified in TraDIS experiments, whereas strains with short killing windows will have more. Third, several of the genes identified in the serum resistome of other strains were excluded from our downstream analysis as there were fewer than 50 transposon insertions in the gene following exposure to heat-inactivated serum. A case in point is the <italic>lpp</italic> gene. This observation indicates that <italic>lpp</italic> is required for <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> ECL8 growth in human serum but not resistance to complement dependent killing <italic>per se</italic>. Fourth, the density of the library used, the level of comparative annotation, and the thresholds to define significance, all have the potential to influence the final outcome of such experiments. Finally, strain-specific features such as gene duplication events, functional redundancy in biosynthetic pathways, and the variation in the genetic complement of each strain, are likely to influence the contribution each gene makes to serum resistance.</p>
<p>Despite the intra and interspecies variation in the serum resistome noted above, comparison of the urinome and serum resistome of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> ECL8 revealed that mutation of five genes (<italic>ompA</italic>, <italic>galE</italic>, <italic>exbB</italic>, <italic>exbD</italic> and <italic>sodA</italic>) conferred reduced fitness for both growth in urine and survival in serum. The role of <italic>exbB</italic> and <italic>exbD</italic> are described above but their detection in both experimental conditions reinforces the importance of iron acquisition for infection. The major outer membrane protein OmpA identified in this study encodes a functionally pleiotropic outer membrane protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>). Notably, a role for OmpA in serum resistance has previously been described for <italic>E. coli</italic>, however it was not identified by TraDIS experiments investigating the serum resistome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). The molecular basis for this discrepancy remains unresolved. GalE is known to play a key role in serum resistance for <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp.. The gene <italic>galE</italic> encodes a UDP-glucose 4-epimerase catalyzing the interconversion of UDP-D-galactose/UDP-D-glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref>). It has been previously reported that GalE plays a role in D-galactan II synthesis, an O1 LPS component in <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">109</xref>). These data suggest that loss of <italic>galE</italic> results in a modified LPS in <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> resulting in increased serum susceptibility. Additionally, the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase SodA converts superoxide to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen to prevent DNA and other cellular damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">110</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">111</xref>). A previous study in <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> has reported the inducible expression of <italic>sodA</italic> in a triumvirate system with <italic>sodB</italic> and <italic>sodC</italic>, expressed in response to anaerobic challenge and high-oxygen concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">112</xref>). These transcriptional responses might very well be present in both the microenvironments of blood vessels and the bladder, in the form of nutrient limitation and oxygen exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">113</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">115</xref>). Hence, the observed importance of <italic>sodA</italic> might be a consequence of elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to iron-acquisition and could represent a specialized metabolic adaptation for growth in these environments. Ultimately, these findings underline the interplay between bacterial iron homeostasis and oxidative stress previously reported in Gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">116</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">120</xref>). However, these data shine a light on cross-niche (i.e. urine and serum) genes and associated pathways as suitable drug development targets to treat <italic>Klebsiella</italic> infections. Finally, this library was then used to identify genes conferring serum resistance. An interesting finding was the observed transposon insertion orientation bias into <italic>gnd.</italic> As the downstream transcriptional unit of <italic>gnd</italic> are O-antigen related genes (i.e. biosynthesis and export), this in turn lends further credence to a transcriptional regulatory model where biosynthesis of O-antigen and capsule is coupled for biophysical reasons as has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">120</xref>). Collectively, these data show that O-antigen biosynthesis genes (i.e <italic>wabI</italic> and <italic>waaL</italic>) play a contributing role in serum resistance whilst <italic>hns</italic> mutants were shown to be more resistant to serum killing than WT <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> ECL8. However, the mechanism that underpins this resistance is still largely unknown and requires further characterization. Despite the previously described links between <italic>hns</italic> and the regulation of a selection of capsular genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref>), this is the first report of a role for <italic>hns</italic> in resisting complement-mediated killing in human serum.</p>
<p>This genome-wide screen has identified a suite of genetic fitness-factors required for growth of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> ECL8 in human urine and serum. The defined ECL8 urinome and serum resistome gene sets from this study gene differ from other TraDIS studies, hinting that the genotype of different pathogenic lineages might only be a piece in understanding the underlying infection biology. Future studies like these but expanding to other isolates, and the lesser studied clinically relevant <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> species complex (KpSc), will be imperative for the effective future development of targeted therapeutics towards this problematic pathogen.</p>

<p><bold>Figure S3</bold> The frequency distribution of insertion index scores. The insertion index score for each coding sequence was calculated as the number of insertions per CDS divided by the CDS length in base pairs to normalize for gene length. An exponential distribution model was fitted to the left mode that includes essential genes, and a gamma distribution model was fitted to the right, nonessential mode (blue). For a given insertion index score, the probability of belonging to each mode was calculated, and the ratio of these values was the log likelihood score. A gene was classified as essential if its log likelihood score was less than log2 12 and was therefore 12 times more likely to belong to the red mode than the blue mode.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study is of relevance for those interested in the mechanism required for infections of humans by <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>. The authors apply TraDIS (high-density TnSeq) to <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> with the goal of identifying genes required for survival under various infection-relevant conditions and the gene sets identified, together with the raw sequence data, will be resources for the Klebsiella research community. The evidence to support the lists of essential and conditionally-essential genes is <bold>convincing</bold>. The study provides strong evidence that some genes are conditionally essential in urine because of iron limitation, but there is less mechanistic insight for genes that are conditionally essential in serum.</p>

<p>The study provides strong evidence that some genes are conditionally essential in urine because of iron limitation.</p>
<p>The authors raise the intriguing possibility that some mutants can &quot;cheat&quot; by benefitting from the surrounding cells that are phenotypically wild-type. The authors make it clear that the proposed cheating mechanism is speculation, but there is a missed opportunity to test this hypothesis. I did not understand the authors' rationale for not doing this experiment.</p>
<p>In cases where there are disparities between studies, e.g., for genes inferred to be essential for serum resistance, it would be informative to test individual deletions for genes described as essential in only one study. The authors argue this is beyond the scope of the study. Their conclusions of the study are not impacted by the absence of these experiments, but readers will be left wondering which lists of conditionally essential genes are correct, or whether there are strain-dependent or condition-dependent contexts that influence conditional essentiality.</p>

<p>In this study Gray and coworkers use a transposon mutant library in order to define: (i) essential genes for K. pneumoniae growth in LB medium, (ii) genes required for growth in urine, (iii) genes required for resistance to serum and complement mediated killing. Although there are previous studies, using a similar strategy, to describe essential genes for K. pneumoniae growth and genes required for serum resistance, this is the first work to perform such a study in urine. This is important because these types of pathogens can cause urinary tract infections. Moreover, the authors performed the work using a highly saturated library of mutants, which makes the results more robust, and used a clinically relevant strain from a pathotype for which similar studies have not been performed yet. Besides applying the transposon mutant library coupled with high-throughput sequencing, the authors validate some of the most relevant genes required for each condition using targeted mutagenesis. This is an important step to confirm that the results obtained from the library are reliable. Although this was done for only a small subset of the most significant genes. In addition, in vitro experiments involving complementation of urine with iron provide additional support to the results obtained with the mutants suggesting the importance of genes required for iron acquisition in a limiting-iron environment such as urine. Overall, the study is well-designed and written, and the methodology and analysis performed are adequate. The study would have benefited from in vivo experiments, including a mouse model of bacterial sepsis or urinary tract infections which could have demonstrated the role of some of the identified genes in the infection process. Nevertheless, the results obtained are informative for the scientific community since they pinpoint genes potentially more relevant in infections caused by K. pneumoniae. The identified genes could represent future targets for developing new therapies against a type of pathogen that is acquiring resistance to all available antibiotics. Although, as mentioned above, these potential targets should be confirmed using in vivo models.</p>
<p>One potential weakness of the work is that the TnSeq analysis only included two replicates per condition, thus it is possible that some of the differences detected may not be reproducible in future studies, first of all those that are less significant. In this sense, hundreds of genes were detected to be theoretically relevant for bacterial resistance to complement in serum. It is possible that some of these genes represent false positives. Thus, confirmation of the relevance of these genes in resistance to complement should be performed in future studies.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The data strongly suggest that iron depletion in urine leads to conditional essentiality of some genes. It would be informative to test the single gene deletions (Figure 3G) for growth in urine supplemented with iron, to determine how many of those genes support growth in urine due to iron limitation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this suggestion. We have now included this suggested experiment as a new panel (Figure 5G).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Line 641. The authors raise the intriguing possibility that some mutants can &quot;cheat&quot; by benefitting from the surrounding cells that are phenotypically wild-type. Growing a fepA deletion strain in urine, either alone or mixed with wild-type cells, would address this question. Given that other mutants may be similarly &quot;masked&quot;, it is important to know whether this phenomenon occurs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion but believe that this would be very difficult to ascertain in K. pneumoniae as several redundant iron uptake systems exist. This would require significantly more time to construct sequential/combinatorial iron-uptake mutants to exactly determine this “cheating” and “masking” phenomenon and such work is beyond the scope of the current study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In cases where there are disparities between studies, e.g., for genes inferred to be essential for serum resistance, it would be informative to test individual deletions for genes described as essential in only one study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, and we agree that deleting conditionally essential genes (i.e. serum resistance) could help identify discrepancies in methodology with other studies but this is beyond the scope of this study. Furthermore, we do not have these other strains readily available to us and importing these strains into Australia is challenging due to the strict import/quarantine laws.</p>

<p>(4) Line 529. Why was 50 chosen as the read count threshold?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This was chosen as the minimum threshold needed to exclude essential genes from the comparative analysis, as these can contribute false positive results where a change from, for example, 2 to 5 reads between conditions is considered a &gt;2-fold change. We have updated the manuscript text to highlight this: “were removed from downstream analysis to exclude confounding essential genes and minimize the effect of stochastic mutant loss” (line 539</p>

<p>(7) Two previous TnSeq studies looking at Escherichia coli and Vibrio cholerae suggest that H-NS can prevent transposon insertion, leading to false positive essentiality calls. Is there any evidence of this phenomenon here? A/T content could be used as a proxy for H-NS occupancy.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this point and also agree that H-NS or other DNA-binding proteins could indeed lead to false-positive essentiality calls using TraDIS. Based on this, we have now included a sentence in the conclusion section mentioning this methodological caveat (Line 631). We believe that A/T content could potentially be used as a proxy for H-NS occupancy,</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The authors may wish to reformat the manuscript by decanting a number of panels and figures as supplementary material. These include the panels related to the description of TraDIS (for example Fig 1D, 1E, 1F. 1G, Fig 2A, Fig 3C, 3D, 3E, 3F, Fig 5C, Fig 6D). This is a well-established method.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion but believe that these panels allow the  methodology and resulting insertion plots to be more followable and allow other researchers, of varying expertise, to better understand this functional genetic screen technique.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors need to indicate how relevant the strain they have probed is. Is it a good reference strain of the KpI group?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a great suggestion and we have now included a new figure illustrating the genetic context and relatedness of K. pneumoniae ECL8 within the KpI phylogroup (New Figure 3).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors need to provide an extensive comparison between the data obtained and those reported testing other Klebsiella strains. A Table identifying the common and different genes, as well as a figure, may suffice. I would encourage authors to compare also their data against E. coli and Salmonella. For example, igaA seems to be not essential in Kebsiella although data indicates it is in Salmonella.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their comment and appreciate that our data could be extended and compared to other relevant Enterobacteriaceae members. However, we believe this is beyond the scope of this study as the focus is more on K. pneumoniae.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) None of the mutants tested further are complemented. Without these experiments, it cannot be rigorously claimed that these loci play any role in the phenotypes investigated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that complementation is an important tenet for validation of mutant gene phenotypes to specific gene loci, in this case wbbY has already been complemented and believe complementation for an already known molecular mechanism would be redundant. Please refer to our response in point 6.</p>
<p>We complemented isolated transposon mutants hns7::Tn5 and hns18::Tn5 with a mid-copy IPTG inducible . We observed a slight increase in serum susceptibility but not full rescue of the WT phenotype (i.e. serum susceptibility). We suspect that the imperfect rescue of the serum-resistance phenotype observed could be due to the expression levels and copy number of the complement hns plasmid used. As hns is a known global regulator its possible pleiotropic role is complex as many aspects of stress response, metabolism or capsule could be affected in Klebsiella (doi.org/10.1186/1471-2180-6-72, doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2016.00013). We have now included in the text our efforts in complementation and have included a new supplementary figure (Figure S11).</p>

<p>(5) The contribution of siderophores to survival in urine is not conclusively established. Authors may wish to test the transcription of relevant genes, and to assess whether the expression is fur dependent in urine. Also, authors may wish to identify the main siderophore needed for survival in urine by probing a number of mutants; this will allow us to assess whether there is a degree of selection and redundancy.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their comment and agree siderophore uptake is important. We have now included an additional panel (Figure 5G) interrogating the importance of iron-uptake genes grown in urine which is iron limited. We do appreciate that further experiments looking into the Fur regulon and siderophore biosynthesis would be interesting but believe this is outside the scope of this study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The role of wbbY is intriguing, pointing towards the importance of high molecular weight O-polysaccharide. In this mutant background, the authors need to assess whether the expression of the capsule, and ECA is affected. Authors need also to complement the mutant. Which is the mechanism conferring resistance?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their comment and would like to mention that wbbY has already been shown to play a role in LPS profile/biosynthesis and  serum-resistance (10.3389/fmicb.2014.00608 ). Furthermore, blast analysis shows that the wbbY gene between the NTUH-K2044 (strain used in aforementioned study) and ECL8 shares 100% sequence identity and also shares lps operon structure. Hence, we do not find it pertinent to complement this mutant as we believe its molecular mechanism has already been established. We have now in the text more prominently highlighted the results of this study and how our screen was robust enough to also identify this gene for serum resistance.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) hns and gnd mutants most likely will have their capsule affected. The authors need to assess whether this is the case. Which is the mechanism conferring resistance?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As mentioned in point 6, we believe that the serum resistance phenotype is attributable to the LPS phenotype. Previous studies have listed  hns and gnd mutants would likely have differences in capsule but due to hns being pleiotropic and gnd being intercalated/adjacent to the LPS/O-antigen biosynthesis it would be difficult to exactly delineate which cellular surface structure is involved.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Below I include several comments regarding potential weaknesses in the methodology used:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The study was done with biological duplicates. In vitro studies usually require 3 samples for performing statistical robust analysis. Thus, are two duplicates enough to reach reproducible results? This is important because many genes are analyzed which could lead to false positives. That said, I acknowledge that genes that were confirmed through targeted mutagenesis led to similar phenotypic results. However, what about all those genes with higher p and q values that were not confirmed? Will those differences be real or represent false positives? Could this explain the differences obtained between this and other studies?</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their comment and apologize for the confusion, data were only pooled for the statistical analysis of gene essentiality. Here, two technical replicates of the input library were sequenced and the number of insertions per gene quantified (insertion index scores). These replicates had a correlation coefficient of r2 = 0.955, and the insertions per gene data were pooled to give total insertions index scores to predict gene essentiality. For conditional analyses (growth in urine or serum), replicate data were not combined. As mentioned previously, differences between this and other studies could also be attributed to inherent genomic differences or due to differences in experimental methodology, computational approaches, or the stringency of analysis used to categorize these genes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Two approaches are performed to investigate genes required for K. pneumoniae resistance to serum. In the first approach, the resistance to complement in serum is investigated. And here a total of 356 genes were identified to be relevant. In contrast, when genes required for overall resistance to serum are studied, only 52 genes seem to be involved. In principle, one would expect to see more genes required for overall resistance to serum and within them identify the genes required for resistance to complement. So this result is unexpected. In addition, it seems unlikely that 356 genes are involved in resistance to complement. Thus, is it possible false positives account for some of the results obtained?</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their comment and do believe false positives may account for some of the identified genes. Specifically, to the large contrast in genes, we believe this is due to the methodology as alluded to in our conclusion section. For overall resistance to serum, we used a longer time point (180 min exposure) where fewer surviving mutants are recovered hence fewer overall genes will be identified, whereas strains with short killing windows will have more (i.e. complement-mediated killing, 90 minute exposure).</p>

<list-item><p>In Figure 4 it is shown that genes important for growth in urine include several that are required for enterobactin uptake. Moreover, an in vitro experiment shows that the complementation of urine with iron increases K. pneumoniae growth. It would have been informative to do a competition experiment between the WT and Fep mutants in urine supplemented with iron. This could demonstrate that the genes identified are only necessary for conditions in which iron is in limiting concentrations and confirm that the defect of the mutants is not due to other characteristics of urine.</p>
