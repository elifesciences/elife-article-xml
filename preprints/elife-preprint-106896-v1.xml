<abstract>
<p>Several human pathogens exploit the kinetic forces generated by polymerizing actin to power their intracellular motility. Human cell-autonomous immune responses activated by the cytokine interferon-gamma (IFNγ) interfere with such microbial actin-based motility, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly defined. Here, we identify the IFNγ-inducible human giant GTPases GVIN1 as a novel host defense protein that blocks the bacterial pathogen <italic>Burkholderia thailandensis</italic> from high-jacking the host’s actin polymerization machinery. We found that GVIN1 proteins form a coatomer around cytosolic bacteria and prevent <italic>Burkholderia</italic> from establishing force-generating actin comet tails. Coatomers formed by a second IFNγ-inducible GTPase, human guanylate binding protein 1 (GBP1), constitute a GVIN1-independent but mechanistically related anti-motility pathway. We show that coating with either GVIN1 or GBP1 displaces the <italic>Burkholderia</italic> outer membrane protein BimA, an actin nucleator that is essential for actin tail formation. Both GVIN1 and GBP1 coatomers require additional IFNγ-inducible co-factors to disrupt the membrane localization of BimA, demonstrating the existence of two parallel-acting IFNγ-inducible defense modules that evolved to target a virulence trait critical for the pathogenesis of numerous bacterial infectious agents.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Actin-based bacterial motility is a key mechanism by which host cytosol-invading bacterial pathogens like <italic>Listeria, Shigella,</italic> and <italic>Burkholderia</italic> move within and between infected cells. By recruiting and polymerizing host actin filaments at the surface of one bacterial pole, these bacteria form actin “comet tails” that propel the bacteria forward, enabling them to move rapidly through the infected cell and directly into neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). This dissemination mechanism enables pathogens to spread within cell layers while avoiding extracellular immunity. Intracellular cell-autonomous host defenses that target actin motility are thus critical for immune protection, yet our understanding of these defenses is limited.</p>
<p>The general mechanisms by which intra-cytosolic bacterial pathogens hijack the host cell’s actin polymerization machinery are well characterized. For example, in <italic>Shigella</italic> the outer membrane autotransporter IcsA is localized to one bacterial pole and recruits the host protein N-WASP, an actin nucleation promotion factor. N-WASP in turn recruits the actin polymerization initiation Arp2/3 complex to launch actin filament formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Like IcsA in <italic>Shigella,</italic> the <italic>Burkholderia</italic> outer membrane protein BimA is localized to one bacterial pole and is essential for actin-based motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). BimA of <italic>Burkholderia thailandensis</italic> is an N-WASP mimic that directly recruits Arp2/3 to the bacterial pole to initiate actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>).</p>
<p>The polar localization of bacterial proteins like IcsA and BimA is essential for their function and tightly regulated through multiple mechanisms. Specifically, the function of IcsA is dependent on lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the main building block of the outer leaflet of Gram-negative bacterial outer membranes. LPS consists of its membrane anchor lipid A, an inner core oligosaccharide, and the outer core polysaccharide O-antigen. The outwards-facing thick O-antigen layer provides a chemo-physical barrier that protects bacteria against antimicrobial molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Additionally, O-antigen enhances bacterial outer membrane stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Accordingly, loss of O-antigen in ‘rough mutant’ bacteria results in increased outer membrane fluidity and enhanced diffusion of outer membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). The functional importance of this O-antigen-mediated membrane stiffness is illustrated by the enhanced diffusion of IcsA proteins away from the bacterial pole and the consequential loss of actin-based motility in <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> rough mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Whether O-antigen is also required for the function of the actin nucleator BimA of <italic>Burkholderia</italic> has not been previously reported.</p>
<p>Actin-based cell-to-cell movement not only facilitates bacterial spread within tissues, but also helps pathogens avoid extracellular immunity. To control infections with pathogens that largely remain hidden intracellularly, host cells are equipped with cell-autonomous immune responses. These cell-autonomous defense programs are executed by a range of immune effector proteins, many of which are expressed in response to proinflammatory cytokine signaling. Arguably, the most potent inducer of antibacterial cell-autonomous immunity is the lymphocyte-derived cytokine IFNγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Among the hundreds of IFNγ-inducible genes are those encoding members of GTPase families that include ‘Immunity-Related GTPases’ (IRGs), giant GTPases annotated as ‘GTPases, Very large Interferon-inducible’ (GVINs), and ‘Guanylate Binding Proteins’ (GBPs). Whereas GBPs and other interferon-inducible GTPases families have proven antimicrobial activities, no biological function has previously been reported for GVIN proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>).</p>
<p>The most highly expressed human GBP family member is GBP1, an LPS-binding protein that can form coatomers on the surface of Gram-negative bacteria including <italic>Shigella</italic> and <italic>Burkholderia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Once embedded onto the bacterial outer membrane, the GBP1 coatomer operates akin to a surfactant that disrupts the function of O-antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). As a result, IcsA is displaced from the bacterial pole of GBP1-coated bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>), which consequently lose their ability to form actin tails and to disseminate within epithelial monolayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Human GBP1 coatomers also assemble on the surface of <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). However, studies conducted in human HeLa epithelial cells indicated that these GBP1 coatomers formed on the surface of <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> fail to disrupt the formation of actin tails. Instead, it was suggested that GBP1-mediated host cell death may inhibit the intercellular spread of <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). In contrast to these findings in human HeLa cells, a separate study demonstrated that the mouse ortholog of human GBP1, mouse Gbp2, was capable of directly interfering with <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> actin tail formation in murine primary macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). However, the underlying mechanism by which mouse Gbp2 modulates <italic>Burkholderia</italic>’s actin-based motility was not further explored.</p>
<p>In the current work we demonstrate that some human cell lines block <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> actin tail formation when primed with IFNγ, whereas other human cell lines including commonly used HeLa cervical epithelial cells lack the ability to interfere with <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> actin tail formation. We find that IFNγ priming can activate two independent but functionally related anti-motility pathways that are dysfunctional in HeLa cells but functional in T24 bladder epithelial cells. The first pathway requires the formation of GBP1 coatomers and the expression of additional IFNγ-inducible factors that are ostensibly non-functional or not expressed in HeLa cells. A second anti-motility pathway is dependent on the expression of GVIN1, the single human member of the GVIN family of IFN-inducible giant GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). We show that GVIN1, annotated as the pseudogene GVINP1 (GTPase, Very large IFN-Inducible Pseudogene-1) in the NCBI database, is a functional protein that forms a coatomer surrounding cytosolic <italic>B. thailandensis</italic>. Like GBP1 coatomers, GVIN1 coatomers require additional IFNγ-inducible factors to disrupt the localization of BimA and to interfere with actin tail formation. Our study thus identifies GVIN proteins as a novel class of antimicrobial coatomer-forming proteins.</p>

<title>IFNγ priming restricts <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> actin tail formation in a subset of human cell lines</title>

<p>To more broadly test whether any human cell lines exist that could block actin tail formation by <italic>B. thailandensis</italic>, we monitored the effect of IFNγ priming on actin tail formation in a small collection of commonly used human cell lines that included A549 lung epithelial cells, T24 bladder epithelial cells, and differentiated monocytic U937 and THP1 cells. In the case of THP1 monocytes we used CASP4-deficient (CASP4<sup>KO</sup>) cells to avoid the confounding effects of <italic>B. thailandensis</italic>-triggered CASP4-driven pyroptotic cell death. We observed that IFNγ priming significantly diminished actin tail formation by <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> in T24, U937, and THP1-CASP4<sup>KO</sup> but not in A549 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D-F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">S2A-C</xref>). Deletion of GBP1 in IFNγ-primed epithelial T24 cells partially restored actin tail formation by <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>), indicating that both GBP1-dependent and GBP1-independent pathways impede <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> actin tail formation in human T24 cells. The GBP1-independent pathway is ostensibly inactive against <italic>S. flexneri</italic> based on the observation that the reduction in actin tail formation by <italic>S. flexneri</italic> in IFNγ-primed T24 cells is completely reversed by the deletion of GBP1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S1F-G</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous work suggested that GBP1 may limit cell-to-cell spread by <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> through the induction of pyroptotic cell death in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). However, such a mechanism is unlikely to be active in T24 cells, because we found that naïve and IFNγ-primed WT and GBP1<sup>KO</sup> T24 cells displayed comparable levels of cell death as assessed by LDH release assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S2D</xref>).</p>

<title>GBP1-mediated inhibition of <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> actin tail formation requires a co-factor that is missing from HeLa cells</title>
<p>Hela cells lack not only the GBP1-independent but also the GBP1-dependent pathway to restrict <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> actin tail formation, despite having GBP1 protein expression levels that are comparable to T24 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). We therefore considered that the loss of the GBP1-dependent pathway in HeLa cells was either due to i) differences in the GBP1 protein sequence between the two cell lines or ii) the absence of an essential co-factor from HeLa cells. To test both hypotheses in one experiment, we engineered GBP1<sup>KO</sup> T24 and GBP1<sup>KO</sup> HeLa cells that inducibly expressed the same N-terminally mCherry-tagged GBP1 (mCh-GBP1) fusion protein upon treatment of cells with anhydrotetracycline (aTc) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Targeting of mCh-GBP1 to <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> occurred at comparable frequency in GBP1<sup>KO</sup> T24 and GBP1<sup>KO</sup> HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S2E-F</xref>). We found that mCh-GBP1 overexpression was sufficient to reduce the percentage of actin tail-positive <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> by 2-fold in in unprimed GBP1<sup>KO</sup> T24 but not in unprimed GBP1<sup>KO</sup> HeLa cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C-D</xref>). These data suggest that T24 but not HeLa cells express an essential GBP1 co-factor, even in the absence of IFNγ priming. Combining ectopic mCh-GBP1 expression with IFNγ priming led to a near complete elimination of actin tail formation in T24 GBP1<sup>KO</sup> but had no discernable effect on bacterial actin tail formation in HeLa GBP1<sup>KO</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C-D</xref>). The additive effect of ectopic GBP1 expression and IFNγ priming in T24 GBP1<sup>KO</sup> cells can be largely explained by the induction of a GBP1-independent host defense pathway in IFNγ-primed T24 cells. However, IFNγ stimulation may additionally enhance GBP1-dependent host defense against <italic>B. thailandensis</italic>, if the putative GBP1 co-factor is itself an IFNγ-inducible gene (ISG).</p>

<title>Loss of O-antigen renders <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> resistant to GBP1-independent inhibition of actin tail formation</title>
<p>GBP1 coatomer formation is sufficient to block actin formation by <italic>S. flexneri</italic> but not by <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S1 and 2</xref> and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>)). The mechanism by which GBP1 coatomers block actin tail formation was previously elucidated for <italic>S. flexneri</italic>: GBP1 coatomers on the surface of <italic>S. flexneri</italic> emulsify the O-antigen layer and thereby turn bacteria into quasi-O-antigen deficient strains. Because O-antigen is essential for the polar localization and function of IcsA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), formation of GBP1 coatomers on <italic>S. flexneri</italic> is sufficient to block IcsA-dependent actin tail formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). To explain why GBP1 coatomer formation on the other hand is insufficient to block actin formation by <italic>B. thailandensis</italic>, we considered two hypotheses: i) the O-antigen layer of <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> is impervious to disruption by GBP1 coating or ii) O-antigen is dispensable for <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> BimA function. To test the latter hypothesis, we generated loss-of-function mutants in the gene BTH_I1483, which encodes the predicted polysaccharide biosynthetic enzyme WbpM (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining with <italic>B. thailandensis</italic>-specific anti-LPS antibody and ProQ Emerald 300 LPS gel staining characterized the <italic>wbpM</italic> CmR insertion mutant (henceforth simplified as Δ<italic>wbpM</italic>) as O-antigen-deficient (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-C</xref>). We found that the O-antigen-deficient w<italic>bpM</italic> mutant formed actin tails at frequencies comparable to wildtype (WT) bacteria in naïve T24 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D-E</xref>), thus demonstrating that O-antigen is dispensable for <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> actin-based motility. These findings suggest that BimA remains functional even when the membrane stiffening property of O-antigen is disrupted by GBP1 coatomers. Unexpectedly, we also observed that the O-antigen deficient <italic>B. thailandensis wbpM</italic> mutant became resistant to IFNγ-mediated inhibition of bacterial actin tail formation in T24 GBP1<sup>KO</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). The latter finding suggested that the GBP1-independet host defense pathway specifically recognizes the O-antigen polysaccharide layer of the bacterial outer membrane.</p>

<title>A genetic screen identifies GVIN1 as an inhibitor of <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> actin tail formation</title>
<p>We found that IFNγ-inducible pathways interfering with <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> actin tail formation are present in some (T24, U937, THP1) but absent from other (A549 and HeLa) human cell lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">S2</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that A549 and HeLa cells lack robust expression of specific ISGs that are required for the inhibition of actin tail formation. To identify candidate ISGs, we profiled gene expression in all five cell lines (T24, U937, THP1, A549, and HeLa) under naïve and IFNγ-primed conditions using bulk RNAseq and then used these data to curate a list of candidate genes that we could test for function (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Based on our RNAseq data we identified 28 protein-coding ISGs that were induced at least 2 log-fold upon IFNγ priming in T24 cells and were expressed at least 2-fold higher in IFNγ-primed T24, U937, and THP1 cells relative to IFNγ-primed A549 or IFNγ-primed HeLa cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">S3A-B</xref>). To determine whether any of these candidate ISGs were involved in the GBP1-independent pathway, we conducted an arrayed functional genomics ‘mini screen’ in T24 GBP1<sup>KO</sup> cells. For each candidate gene, individual wells seeded with T24 GBP1<sup>KO</sup> cells were transfected with four independent siRNA oligonucleotides. We then primed the transfected cells with IFNγ overnight, infected the cells with <italic>B. thailandensis</italic>, and quantified the percentage of bacteria forming actin tails at 8 hours post infection (hpi). The number of cytosolic <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> forming actin tails inside IFNγ-primed T24 GBP1<sup>KO</sup> cells significantly increased by approximately 2-fold relative to cells treated with siRNA control oligonucleotides for two targeted ISGs, namely <italic>GBP6</italic> (Gene ID: 163351) and <italic>GVINP1</italic> (GTPase, Very large interferon inducible pseudogene 1; Gene ID: 387751) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">S3C</xref>).

<p>To independently validate whether GBP6 and GVIN1 play any role in limiting actin tail formation by <italic>B. thailandensis</italic>, we generated <italic>GBP6</italic> and <italic>GVIN1</italic> deletions in T24 cells using CRISPR technology (Fig. S4A-B).

Furthermore, GBP6 protein expression in naïve or IFNγ-primed T24 cells was below the level of detection by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S4D</xref>). Collectively, these data suggested that GBP6 was a false-positive hit from our screen.</p>
<p>In contrast to GBP6<sup>KO</sup> cells, GVIN1<sup>KO</sup> cells allowed for increased rates of actin tail formation by <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> and showed incomplete restriction of actin tail formation upon IFNγ priming, thus mimicking the phenotype of GBP1<sup>KO</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>).

<title>GVIN1 coatomers require IFNγ-inducible co-factors to block actin tail formation</title>
<p>The <italic>GVIN1</italic> gene is intronless and expresses a transcript that is approximately 8,700 nucleotides in length. The GVIN1 mRNA contains three potential open reading frames (ORFs). The longest uninterrupted ORF is 5,424 nucleotides in length and predicted to encode a protein of 1,808 amino acids with an expected molecular weight of 209 kDa (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>), hereinafter simply referred to as GVIN1 protein.

To assess whether GVIN1 could operate in a similar fashion, we expressed a C-terminally HA-tagged GVIN1 protein under control of an aTc-inducible promoter in cell culture. Importantly, we found that expression of GVIN1-HA in T24 GVIN1<sup>KO</sup> restored IFNγ-dependent restriction of <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> actin tail formation to levels comparable to WT cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Ectopic expression of GVIN1-HA in T24 GVIN1/GBP1<sup>DKO</sup> partially restored IFNγ-dependent restriction of actin tail formation comparable to the phenotype of GBP1<sup>KO</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). These complementation experiments confirmed that loss of functional GVIN1 is responsible for elevated levels of <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> actin tail formation in GVIN1<sup>KO</sup> cells. Next, we monitored the subcellular localization of ectopically expressed GVIN1-HA in <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> infected HeLa cells and observed that at 8 hpi approximately 50% of intracellular bacteria were encased by GVIN1-HA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E-F</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>IFN-inducible GTPases are potent executioners of cell-autonomous immune programs targeting viral, bacterial, fungal, and protozoan intracellular pathogens. Previous work focused on the function of three of these GTPases families, the Mx proteins, the IRGs, and the GBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). While <italic>GVIN</italic> genes encoding members of the fourth family of IFN-inducible GTPases are present in most vertebrate genomes and have previously been shown to be expressed in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>), their biological function has remained enigmatic. Our current work demonstrates that human GVIN1, the sole human member of the GVIN family, forms a coatomer around <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> and interferes with bacterial actin tail formation. Our observations thus establish GVIN GTPases as a new class of host defense proteins.</p>
<p>Previous work demonstrated that human GBP1 can form coatomers on the surface of numerous Gram-negative bacteria to combat intracellular infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). The GBP1 coatomer acts like an emulsifier and disrupts the chemo-mechanical barrier established by the polysaccharide O-antigen portion of bacterial LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). In concert with additional antimicrobial molecules the emulsification of the LPS barrier by GBP1 can promote the killing of encased bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). On its own the GBP1 coatomer appears to be neither bacteriostatic nor bactericidal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>), yet its detergent-like activity is sufficient to increase the diffusion rate of the <italic>Shigella</italic> outer membrane protein IcsA, thereby interfering with IcsA’s critical role in nucleating actin at one bacterial pole and establishing actin-based motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). In contrast to the <italic>Shigella</italic> IcsA protein, we show here that the functionally related BimA protein of <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> is impervious to the disruption of the O-antigen layer. Instead, one or more unidentified GBP1 co-factors are required for GBP1 coatomers to block actin tail formation by <italic>B. thailandensis</italic>.</p>
<p>Like GBP1 coatomers, GVIN1 coatomers require additional co-factors to effectively block <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> actin formation. The nature of these co-factors will need to be determined in future studies. However, because ectopic expression of GVIN1 but not GBP1 in HeLa cells reduces <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> actin tail formation, we can already conclude that HeLa cells express essential GVIN1 but not GBP1 co-factors. Accordingly, we can infer that GBP1 and GVIN1 use distinct sets of co-factors. Despite these clear differences, both GBP1 and GVIN1 coatomers, in cooperation with their respective co-factors, function similarly by removing BimA from the bacterial outer membrane to disrupt actin tail formation by <italic>B. thailandensis.</italic> The polar localization of the inner membrane protein BimC on the other hand is undisturbed, suggesting that both GBP1 and GVIN1 coatomers specifically disrupt modalities of the outer bacterial membrane.</p>
<p>The basic principles underlying the assembly of GBP1 coatomers have been established. Upon GTP binding and hydrolysis GBP1 monomers undergo conformational changes and form dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). These dimers can polymerize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>), a process that is aided by the presence of bacterial LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). The polymers dock to the surface of Gram-negative bacteria, penetrate the bacterial polysaccharide barrier, and release thousands of GBP1 dimers into the bacterial outer membrane to form a GBP1 coat on the bacterial surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Although our structural modelling suggests that GVIN1 GTPases may also form dimers, whether GVIN1 coatomers assemble through a multi-step process that is analogous to GBP1 coatomer formation will require future investigations.</p>
<p>Our studies did not systematically explore whether GVIN1 targets intracellular pathogens other than <italic>B. thailandensis,</italic> although this seems likely. Remarkably, we found that O-antigen deficient <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> rough mutants had become resistant to GVIN1-mediated host defense, which suggests that GVIN1 either detects moieties present in <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> O-antigen or that O-antigen helps to stabilize the GVIN1 coat. This observation is also noteworthy in the context of reports showing that clinically important <italic>Burkholderia</italic> species such as <italic>Burkholderia cenocepacia</italic> and <italic>Burkholderia multivorans</italic> isolated from chronically infected cystic fibrosis patients tended to acquire mutations that alter or remove O-antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). While speculative, changes in O-antigen composition and expression may provide these clinical <italic>Burkholderia</italic> isolates with a formidable fitness advantage by obtaining resistance to GVIN1.</p>
<p>ISGs play crucial roles in executing cell-autonomous immune responses. However, only a limited number of these ISGs have been thoroughly characterized, and there is little understanding of how they functionally interact with one another. Here, we characterize GVIN proteins as novel executioners of cell-autonomous immunity. Like related GBP1 proteins, human GVIN1 proteins encase their bacterial target, spotlighting coatomer formation as a fundamental mechanism of antibacterial cell-autonomous defense. Furthermore, we show that both GBP1 and GVIN1 coatomers collaborate with other ISGs, highlighting ISG synergy as a principal operating mechanism of antimicrobial coatomer activity. Elucidating the formation and defensive role of GVIN1 coatomers, along with potential microbial evasion strategies, could offer valuable insights into host-pathogen interactions and aid in developing novel therapies for infectious diseases.</p>

<p>Cell lines (T24, HeLa, A549, THP-1, and U-937) were seeded in 24-well plate (immunofluorescence and CFU assays) or 96-well plates (LDH assay) and treated with 200 U/ml IFNγ (Sigma-Aldrich) overnight before infection. For <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> infections, all <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> strains were grown at 37°C on lysogeny broth (LB) agar plates. 5 mL of LB supplemented with appropriate antibiotics was inoculated with one <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> colony and incubated overnight at 37°C with shaking. On the day of infection, the overnight culture was diluted 1:50 in 5 mL of fresh LB with antibiotics and grown at 37°C with shaking for 3–4 hours until the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) reached 0.6–0.8. The bacterial cultures were pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 3 minutes at room temperature (RT), resuspended in 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Gibco), and centrifuged again under the same conditions. The washed bacteria were then resuspended in cell culture media containing antibiotics and further diluted in cell culture media to the desired concentration. T24, HeLa and A549 cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100, THP-1 and U-937 cells were infected at a MOI of 20. Following centrifugation at 700 × g for 10 minutes at RT, infected cells were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2.</sub> At 4 hpi, cells were washed twice with Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, Gibco) to remove extracellular bacteria. Cells were then incubated in media containing chloramphenicol for 2 hours to eliminate remaining extracellular bacteria. Afterwards, the culture media was replaced with antibiotic-free media. The infection was terminated at 8 hpi for T24, HeLa, and A549 cells, and at 6 hpi for THP-1 and U-937 cells. For <italic>S. flexneri</italic> infections, bacteria were grown at 37°C on tryptic soy broth (TSB) agar plates containing 0.01% Congo red. 5 mL of TSB supplemented with appropriate antibiotics was inoculated with one <italic>S. flexneri</italic> colony and incubated overnight at 37°C with shaking. On the day of infection, the overnight culture was diluted 1:50 in 5 mL of fresh TSB with antibiotics and grown at 37°C with shaking for about 2 hours until the OD600 reached 0.5-0.7. The bacterial cultures were pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 3 minutes RT, resuspended in the 990 µL PBS supplement with 10 µL of 0.1 mg/mL polyD-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich) solution, and then incubated at 37°C with shaking for 15 minutes. The <italic>S. flexneri</italic> were pelleted again by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 3 minutes RT. The washed bacteria were then resuspended in cell culture media containing antibiotics and further diluted in cell culture media to the desired concentration. T24, HeLa cells were infected at an MOI of 10, followed by centrifugation at 700 × g for 10 minutes at RT. Infected cells were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2.</sub> 30 minutes post-infection, cells were washed twice with HBSS to remove extracellular bacteria.

<title>Expression constructs and lentivirus production</title>
<p>An anhydrotetracycline-inducible GVIN1 plasmid was constructed using Gateway assembly (Thermo Fisher) into the pMVP cloning system. The pMVP Cloning System was a gift from Christopher Newgard (Addgene kit #1000000155) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). The third ORF of GVIN1 sequence without stop codon flanked by attB4 and attB3r recombination sites was amplified via PCR using primers, CloneGVINP1F3 (5’-GGGGACAACTTTTCTATACAAAGTTGCCACCATGCAGTGGATCTTCCAGTC-3’), and CloneGVINP1nostopR1 (5’-GGGGACAACTTTATTATACAAAGTTGTCTGTTTTTTCAAGTCTTCAAGCAC-3’) with genomic DNA from T24 cells as the template. The PCR product was cloned into the pDONR221-P4r-P3r vector (NovoPro) using BP Clonase™ II (Thermo Fisher), generating a GVIN1 entry clone. Subsequently, the following entry clones were assembled in an LR recombination reaction: pDONR221-R4-R3-GVIN1, Tre promoter entry clone (Addgene Plasmid #121691), HA tag-polyA + CMV-TETa-polyA entry clone (Addgene Plasmid #121802).Entry clone plasmids were added with the pMVP/Lenti/Neo-DEST vector (Addgene Plasmid #121850), and LR Clonase™ II Plus enzyme mix (Thermo Fisher) together to generate the final tetracycline-inducible HA-tagged GVIN1 expression lentiviral construct (pMVP-lenti-neo-largeORFGVIN1-HA). Lentiviral particles were produced by transfecting lentivirus plasmids with packaging vectors into HEK293T cells using the TransIT™ 293 transfection reagent (Mirus Bio) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Each well of a 6-well plate containing 293T cells was transfected with 1 µg of plasmid, 750 ng of pSPAX2, and 250 ng of VSVG. At 24 hours post-transfection, the media were replaced with DMEM. The supernatants containing lentiviral particles were collected at 48- and 72-hours post-transfection. Supernatants were pooled and filtered through 0.45-µm nylon filters (Corning). For lentiviral transduction, 293T cells were diluted to a concentration of 3.33 × 10⁴ cells/mL in media containing 10 µg/mL polybrene. A total of 500 µL of lentivirus was added to each well of a 6-well plate containing recipient cells, followed by the addition of 1.5 mL of diluted cells. The plates were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 48 hours. Post transduction, cells were selected in media containing geneticin (Gibco, 500 μg /mL for HeLa, 1000 μg /mL for T24). An anhydrotetracycline-inducible GBP1 plasmid was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>).

<p>Post-infection, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at RT for 20 minutes. Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 minutes at RT. Permeabilized cells were then blocked with blocking buffer (5% bovine serum albumin and 0.3 M glycine in PBS) at RT for 45 minutes. Samples were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer at RT for 1 hour. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer as follows: rabbit recombinant monoclonal anti-GBP1 (1:150; Abcam, ab131255); mouse monoclonal ANTI-FLAG® M2 (1:1000; Sigma-Aldrich, F1804); mouse monoclonal anti-HA tag [HA.C5] (1:500; Abcam, ab18181); recombinant rabbit monoclonal Anti-LPS [CK3 (BP1 7F7)] (absolute antibody, Ab03071-23.0). Following primary antibody incubation, samples were washed three times in 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 minutes at RT. Subsequently, samples were incubated with secondary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer at RT for 1 hour. Secondary antibodies and phalloidin were prepared in blocking buffer as follows: Alexa Fluor™ 568-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H+L; 1:1000; Thermo Fisher, A10042), Alexa Fluor™ 405-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L; 1:1000; Thermo Fisher, A31553), Alexa Fluor™ 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L; 1:1000; Thermo Fisher, A-11004), Alexa Fluor™ 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L; 1:1000; Thermo Fisher, A-11008), Alexa Fluor™ 660 phalloidin (1:400; Thermo Fisher, A22285) for F-actin visualization. Cells were washed four times in 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 minutes at RT. Coverslips with cells were mounted on glass slides using a mixture of Mowiol 4-88 and para-phenylenediamine antifading agent (9:1 ratio) to preserve fluorescence. Images were acquired using a Zeiss Axio Imager microscope equipped with a 63×/1.4 NA oil immersion lens. For each condition, at least six fields of view were captured to analyze at least 100 bacteria. Z-stack images were taken at 1 µm intervals. Bacteria with protein signals surrounding at least 50% of its visible surface were counted as targeted.</p>

<p>For cell lysis and protein extraction, cells were washed twice with Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) and lysed in RIPA buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 4 U/ml DNase I (New England Biolabs) and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich). Lysates were incubated at 4°C for 30 minutes, followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Protein concentrations were quantified using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and normalized prior to analysis. Normalized samples were mixed with Laemmli buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol and denatured by heating at 95°C for 10 min. Protein samples were resolved on 4–20% Mini-PROTEAN TGX Stain-Free precast gels (Bio-Rad) using Tris-glycine running buffer. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes using the Tank Transfer System or Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (both Bio-Rad). Primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution (5% non-fat dry milk in 0.1% TBS-T) were incubated with membranes overnight at 4°C. After three washes with TBS-T (0.1% Tween-20 detergent in tris-buffered saline), membranes were incubated with species-matched horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature. After four washes with TBS-T, protein bands were visualized using Amersham ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (Cytiva) and imaged on an Azure 500 imaging system (Azure Biosystems).</p>

<title>siRNA knockdown</title>
<p>Gene knockdown in T24 cell lines was achieved by transfecting cells with siGENOME siRNA Reagents (Horizon) using Lipofectamine® RNAiMAX Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, T24 cells were seeded in 24-well plates to achieve 60–80% confluency at the time of transfection. siRNA-lipid complexes were prepared in Opti-MEM® Reduced Serum Medium (Gibco). The siRNA and lipofectamine reagents were diluted separately in Opti-MEM® medium before mixing the dilutions in a 1:1 volume ratio. Following incubation at room temperature for 5 minutes to allow formation of the siRNA-lipid complexes, the reaction mix was added to the T24 cells. The final transfection mixture for each well contained 5 pmol siRNA and 1.5 µL Lipofectamine in 50 µL siRNA-lipid Opti-MEM® complex. After 48 h, transfected cells were used for the infection screening.

<p>This is a <bold>fundamental</bold> discovery revealing two independent IFNγ-induced pathways that restrict bacterial motility: one GBP1-dependent and the other GVIN1-dependent. The findings are supported by <bold>compelling</bold> evidence. While the paper is already very strong, there are a few points that could be addressed editorially or through the addition of a few key experiments.</p>

<p>This is a very elegant and convincing study. Using systematic screening of actin tail formation in two bacterial strains and employing a panel of CRISPR-CAS ko cell lines, the authors identify a novel dynamin-related GTPase GVIN, which forms an oligomeric coat around an intracellular Burkholderia strain. The bacterial O-antigen LPS layer is required for the formation of the GVIN coat, which disturbs the polar localization of the bacterial actin-polymerizing BimA protein.</p>
<p>I am not an expert in infection studies, but the experiments appear to be of high quality, the figures are well prepared, and clean and statistically significant results are provided. I have no criticism of the presented approaches.</p>
<p>The identification of a novel GBP1-independent pathway targeting intracellular bacteria is not only of fundamental importance for the immunity field but also of high interest to researchers in other areas, for example, evolutionary or structural biologists.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors wanted to investigate how cells defend against intracellular pathogens, such as Shigella and Burkholderia species, that co-opt the host actin machinery to spread from cell-to-cell. Previous work has identified IFNg-inducible GTPase of the Guanylate Binding Protein (GBP) family in cytosolic defence against Gram-negative bacteria. By forming a coat around Shigella, human GBP1 suppresses actin-based motility by displacing IcsA, which is the actin-polymerising virulence factor present at bacterial poles. In addition, GBP1 recruits the cytosolic LPS-sensor, caspase-4, to the bacterial surface, which results in the removal of bacterial replicative niches via pyroptotic cell death. Here, they followed up their finding that GBP1 can reduce actin-based motility of Shigella in HeLa cells and, surprisingly, fails to do so during Burkholderia infection. In contrast, in T24 bladder epithelial cells, GBP1 is competent in blocking Burkholderia actin-tails. They therefore wanted to identify the GBP1-independent factor that blocks actin-based motility in IFNg-treated cells that is absent in HeLa cells.</p>
<p>Major strengths and weaknesses of the methods and results:</p>
<p>The authors report a second IFNg-dependent pathway involving the protein product of the gene GVIN1, which was previously thought to be a pseudogene. GVIN1 (GTPase, very large interferon inducible 1) is thus the first human member of this family of ~250 kDa putative GTPases to be demonstrated to be functional and have potential antimicrobial roles. The discovery that GVIN1 is indeed functional, forms coats on Burkholderia in an LPS O-antigen-dependent manner, and limits actin-dependent motility are the main strengths of this paper. The authors use CRISPR/Cas9-based knockouts in HeLa and T24 cells, and complement them to demonstrate that GBP1 and GVIN1 are both required to inhibit actin-based motility.</p>
<p>An appraisal of whether the authors achieved their aims and whether the results support their conclusions:</p>
<p>The authors achieved their main goals through well-planned experiments and unbiased screens. They succeeded in finding the factor that blocks actin-based motility independently of GBP1. This is driven by GVIN1, which coats bacteria and limits actin-tail formation by reducing the expression of BimA through currently unknown mechanisms. Further, they found that an O-antigen mutant can escape coating by GVIN1, indicating the requirement for these polysaccharides in GVIN1-dependent bacterial sensing. However, the authors have not investigated whether GVIN1, which has two GTPase-domains, does indeed have GTPase activity and whether GVIN1 and GBP1 together completely block cell-to-cell spread by Burkholderia and thereby restrict bacterial numbers over the infection time course. They also do not show whether GBP1 and GVIN1 target the same bacterial cell or different populations of bacteria.</p>
<p>A discussion of the likely impact of the work on the field, and the utility of the methods and data to the community:</p>
<p>This work uncovers the antimicrobial actions of a member of yet another family of IFNg-induced GTPases, which potentially acts against other intracellular pathogens. GVIN1 appears to operate independently and in parallel to GBP1, pointing to the breadth and complexity of the IFNg-inducible GTPase families.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Here, Guo et al. (2025) propose that the IFN-induced GTPase GVIN1 forms a coat on cytosolic Burkholderia thailandensis, blocking actin tail formation through a mechanism analogous to GBP1-mediated restriction of Shigella motility.</p>
<p>Their study was prompted by the intriguing observation that IFNγ priming and GBP1 coat formation fail to inhibit B. thailandensis actin-based motility in HeLa cells, yet IFNγ restricts the motility of Burkholderia in T24 cells. Further investigation revealed that IFNγ restricts B. thailandensis motility in T24 cells via both GBP1-dependent and -independent mechanisms, suggesting that HeLa cells lack a critical GBP1 co-factor required to inhibit actin tail formation.</p>
<p>To identify the GBP1-independent mechanism, the authors performed an siRNA screen of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and identified GVIN1, a large IFN-induced GTPase, as essential for restricting B. thailandensis motility. To identify the GBP1-independent mechanism, perform a knock-down screen for ISGs and find that the loss of GVIN, a very large IFN-induced GTPase, results in higher actin tail-positive B. thailandensis in T24 cells. They further demonstrate that GVIN forms coats on the surface of B. thailandensis, which prevent the polar localization of BimA and thus actin tail formation. In summary, the data reveal two independent IFNγ-induced pathways that restrict bacterial motility: one GBP1-dependent and the other GVIN1-dependent, each relying on distinct host co-factors.</p>
<p>Global assessment:</p>
<p>This is a well-executed study that convincingly demonstrates how GVIN1 restricts the actin-based motility of B. thailandensis through the assembly of coatomers. The results are clearly described, the manuscript is easy to follow, and the data are overall compelling and well presented. I have only a few suggestions on how the manuscript could be further improved.</p>
