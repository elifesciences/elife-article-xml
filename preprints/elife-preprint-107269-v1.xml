<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Affective states are dynamic, fluctuating in response to recent events: an unexpected pleasure, a disappointing loss. Affective biases, which cause disruptions in these dynamics, are core components of mental ill-health, but the specific effects of treatments on these biases are poorly understood. Here, we investigate the impact of common psychiatric treatments on subjective assessments of happiness, confidence, and engagement during a reinforcement learning task (<italic>N</italic> =935; 130 taking antidepressant medications). Half (<italic>N</italic> =459) of the participants were randomised to practice a common psychotherapeutic technique—cognitive distancing—throughout the task. From a joint computational model of learning and affect, we find evidence for distinct and overlapping impacts of psychiatric treatments on affective dynamics. Cognitive distancing attenuates downward drift in happiness and engagement and increases recency bias in the affective impact of recent choices. Conversely, antidepressant use increases baseline happiness and confidence in individuals with similar levels of current symptoms, and decreases recency bias such that more past events influence affective states. Crucially, both cognitive distancing and antidepressant use converge to dampen negative biases in happiness and confidence specifically in participants experiencing higher levels of anxiety and depression symptoms. Together, our results indicate that common treatments for mental ill-health may alter symptoms through their impact on affective dynamics, but via distinct mechanisms.</p>

<title>1 Background</title>
<p>How are you feeling right now? Research across economics, psychology, and health sciences suggests the answer to this question—your subjective well-being—is closely tied to objective quality of life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> and health across the lifespan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. But feelings are far from static, momentarily fluctuating in response to recent events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, and even individual choices. Frequently asking participants to rate their feelings enables a read-out of moment-to-moment changes in subjective well-being, or their <italic>affective dynamics</italic>.</p>
<p>In influential work, Rutledge <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> demonstrated momentary happiness ratings during a gambling task could be accurately predicted by a computational model incorporating the average reward for a gamble (<italic>expected value</italic>) and the outcome of the gamble minus this average (<italic>prediction error</italic>). Using a task where reward magnitude and probability were uncorrelated, Blain &amp; Rutledge (2020)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> subsequently showed that momentary happiness is particularly sensitive to changes in learning-related variables—specifically, prediction errors for reward probability—as compared to as compared to reward information that was relevant to behaviour but not learning. Links between happiness ratings and learning-related quantities may extend to subjective assessments of other affective states. Theoretical accounts posit that momentary confidence is the approximate probability a choice is correct<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> (though see<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>), while effort costs decrease the value of choices independently of reward probability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, in turn influencing momentary engagement. Together, these results suggest that affective dynamics are closely coupled with objective quantities that drive choices during learning.</p>
<p>Biases in subjective affect are a core feature of mental ill-health. Symptoms of depression have been consistently linked to lower<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> and less stable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> momentary happiness, while transdiagnostic features of mental ill-health have been linked to biased confidence judgements at different timescales<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> and impairments in motivation and engagement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Affective biases maintain symptoms of mental ill-health by inducing changes in emotion processing and perception<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. For example, negatively biased perception—a common feature of depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>—may cause low mood by making outcomes appear less rewarding; low mood in turn further negatively biases perception, causing a positive feedback loop which spirals toward a depressive episode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Successful psychiatric treatment may act to perturb these maladaptive cycles. Short-term selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) administration induces positive perceptual biases in healthy participants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, suggesting that affective biases may be an early target of antidepressant drugs, acting to shift choices away from those that maintain low mood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Crucially, given that affective biases are precipitated and maintained by negative thinking patterns—a core target of cognitive psychotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>— they may represent a transdiagnostic treatment target of psychological and pharmacological interventions for symptoms of mental ill-health.</p>
<p>Here, we aimed to link choice behaviour to affective dynamics throughout a reinforcement learning (RL) task<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and to relate this to mental ill-health symptoms and treatments. We asked online participants (<italic>N</italic> =935) to rate their feelings (from 0–100) on one of three different affect scales—happiness, confidence, and engagement—after receiving feedback on each choice they made. Half (49.1%) of the participants were randomised to an acute psychological intervention known as “cognitive distancing”, a common<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> and effective<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> component of psychological therapy which alters learning in this task<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. We also collected information on current antidepressant medication use in a demographic questionnaire (reported by 13.9% of participants), and derived transdiagnostic mental health symptom factor scores from a psychiatric questionnaire battery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. We then assessed how participants’ affect ratings across each of the three scales covaried with learning-related outcomes throughout the task, accounting for underlying affective biases, using computational modelling. By quantifying the associations between model-derived measures of affective dynamics and transdiagnostic features of mental ill-health, the cognitive distancing intervention, and self-reported antidepressant medication use, we asked whether affective dynamics may be a common target of treatments for symptoms of mental ill-health.</p>

<title>2.1 Online experiment and sample</title>
<p>A total of 995 participants were recruited via Prolific<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> over three weeks in April–May 2021. Participants were recruited in batches with fixed pre-screeners for age range, gender, and history of any mental health diagnosis, which resulted in a sample broadly representative of the UK population in terms of these characteristics (see<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> for details). After completing a demographic questionnaire, which included questions on current medication usage and mental health diagnoses, participants completed the RL task described below. They then took a short test of working memory (visual digit span), and answered questions from several psychiatric questionnaires, answers from which were used to derive three validated transdiagnostic features of mental health (anxiety/depression, compulsive behaviour, and social withdrawal)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, using methods for computational factor modelling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> described in detail elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Sixty participants were excluded for meeting pre-registered criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. The study was approved by the University of Cambridge Human Biology Research Ethics Committee (HBREC) (HBREC.2020.40) and jointly sponsored by the University of Cambridge and Cambridge University Hospitals National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust (IRAS ID 289980). All participants provided written informed consent through an online form, in line with University of Cambridge HBREC procedures for online studies.</p>

<sec id="s2-2">
<title>2.2 Reinforcement learning task</title>
<p>The reinforcement learning task in the present study—the probabilistic selection task<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>— involved learning which symbol in each of three pairs was more likely correct. Consistent choice of the “better” symbol in each pair enabled a participant to accumulate more points (and maximise their chances of winning a monetary bonus). One symbol in each pair was always more likely correct, but the contingencies varied across the pairs, from 0.8/0.2 (‘AB’) to 0.7/0.3 (‘CD’), to 0.6/0.4 (‘EF’). All participants saw the same six symbols, but the pairs were randomised across individuals and counterbalanced across trials. After making a choice, participants received feedback (“Correct!” or “Incorrect.”), and then rated their subjective happiness, confidence, or engagement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the three questions was asked after each trial outcome, with each question asked twenty times per block of sixty trials, and never more than twice in a row. Participants were also asked to rate (again from 0–100) how fatigued they felt compared to the beginning of the block after the end of each of the sixty-trial training blocks. After six training blocks, participants were tested on all fifteen unique pairs without feedback. We previously reported the effects of cognitive distancing on task performance and learning, including results of the test phase, in the same sample<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>.</p>

<sec id="s2-3">
<title>2.3 Acute psychological intervention and antidepressant use</title>
<p>Half of the participants (<italic>n</italic>=459; 49.1%) were randomised to be taught, and then practice throughout the task, a psychotherapeutic technique termed “cognitive distancing”, which encouraged them to “take a step back” from their emotional reactions to feedback throughout the task (see here<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> for further details). Apart from an additional instructional video before the task started and a small prompt to <italic>“Distance yourself...”</italic> which appeared with each fixation cross (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), the task was identical for distanced and non-distanced participants. To explore similarities between the effects of this psychological intervention, and a pharmacological treatment for mental ill-health, antidepressant medication, we also asked participants to report their current medication use: 130 participants (13.9%) reported current antidepressant use, with the majority (<italic>n</italic>=94; 72.3%) taking an SSRI.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2-4">
<title>2.4 Computational modelling: joint RL-affect models</title>
<p>For consistency with previous literature, we used the well-characterised model of momentary happiness first described by Rutledge <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> as a baseline model. This model assumes fluctuations around a baseline (i.e., longer-term mean) can be captured by a weighted sum of recent expected values and prediction error and, importantly, does not condition on previous ratings.</p>
<p>The Rutledge <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> model has been primarily validated in (e.g., gambling) tasks where expected values and prediction errors are explicitly available to participants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. As such, we extended it to account for learning in this task. Specifically, our model—which we term a joint RL-affect model—comprised two components: (1) a <italic>Q</italic>-learning model to infer expected values and prediction errors from participants’ choices (which has been shown to accurately capture choice behaviour in this task<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>); and (2) a model for momentary affect which assumes fluctuations around a baseline can be captured by a recency-weighted sum of <italic>Q</italic>-learning model-derived expected values and prediction errors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Hierarchical models were simultaneously fitted to task choices plus happiness, confidence, and engagement selfreports, assuming different parameter weights across all scales and participants.</p>

We also tested a final model with two extra parameters: weights on both total time elapsed and time elapsed since the beginning of that block.

GLMs relating model parameters to antidepressant use were run with and without adjustment for concurrent anxiety/depression symptoms (i.e., factor score), as medication use was not randomised. We also considered whether the effect of cognitive distancing and current antidepressant use on affect model parameters may differ in relation to their association with transdiagnostic mental health, by including factor score as an interaction term in GLMs.</p>
<p>Posterior samples for GLM coefficients were obtained via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) implemented in CmdStan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>, with 2,000 warm-up and 10,000 sampling iterations for each of four chains, using models and priors from the rstanarm R package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>.

We then validated the predictive accuracy of this number of components in held-out test data (20% of participants), and formally tested this using a permutation test, where the PLS regression model was re-trained on 10,000 training datasets with shuffled outcome labels (providing a null distribution), and the fraction of these datasets where the MSE between the test data and the predictions from the permuted datasets was lower than the true train-test MSE taken as the <italic>p</italic>-value. The PLS regression with the chosen number of components was then refitted in the whole dataset, to obtain component loadings on each of the responses and predictors.

<title>3.3 Baseline affect is most strongly associated with anxiety/depression symptoms</title>

<title>4 Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we applied a computational model of momentary happiness which assumes fluctuations in affect ratings depend simply on baseline affect, its drift over time, and recency-decayed expected and received outcomes. By extending this model to also capture learning, we were able to link objective behaviour to subjective feelings across distinct affective states—happiness, confidence, and engagement ratings—and show that a a core component of psychological therapy, cognitive distancing, and antidepressant medication use have different effects on affective dynamics, but converge to alter affective biases associated with symptoms of mental ill-health.</p>
<p>There were distinct effects of both treatments on affective dynamics. Randomisation to a psychotherapeutic intervention, cognitive distancing, attenuated declines in happiness and engagement over time, adding to our previously reported findings that this psychotherapeutic technique alters aspects of reward learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Self-reported antidepressant use, meanwhile, was associated with higher baseline happiness and confidence after adjustment for current anxiety/depression symptoms (as antidepressant use was not randomised), which is consistent with evidence that antidepressants exert positive affective biases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Subsequent exploration of changes in affect revealed further mechanistic divergence: current antidepressant use was associated with lower recency biases across all scales (i.e., forgetting factors closer to one), and cognitive distancing reduced the weighting of expectations and higher recency bias in happiness ratings. Together, these results suggest that psychiatric treatments act to alter the contribution of objective learning-related quantities to subjective value judgements.</p>
<p>Consistent with extensive evidence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, we found negative associations between model-derived baseline affect (across all scales) and transdiagnostic psychiatric symptom measures derived from computational factor modelling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. This effect, which was strongest for anxiety/depression symptom scores, indicates a consistent, time-invariant negative affective bias which scales with mental ill-health symptom load. Critically, we found evidence for a convergent treatment by symptom interaction with baseline affect across both cognitive distancing and antidepressant use: negative associations between anxiety/depression symptoms and baseline happiness and confidence were attenuated in participants with higher anxiety/depression symptom scores. These results support the cognitive neuropsychological model of antidepressant action, whereby antidepressants are proposed to act acutely to revert negative or maladaptive affective biases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, and suggest that cognitive distancing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> and other components of psychotherapy may also act clinically to alter affective biases contributing to symptoms of mental ill-health. We propose that changes in affective dynamics should be investigated further in longitudinal studies as a computational predictor of subsequent symptom change.</p>
<p>Our methodological approach also extends previous work in two ways. First, we applied a theory-driven computational model which allows for fluctuations in momentary happiness as a function of the history of expected values and prediction errors resulting from those expectations, which has been primarily validated in tasks where learning is not required<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. We not only show that this model can capture happiness ratings in a task where expected values are never explicitly available and have to be learned from experience, but can also accurately capture variation in subjective ratings of confidence and engagement. Second, we found evidence for drift in happiness over time, replicating recent work which characterised ‘mood drift over time‘<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, and extended this to both confidence and engagement. We also found that this drift was strongly associated with self-reported fatigue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure S5</xref>; see Supplementary Results for more details). We note that we did not find evidence of a previously reported effect—reduced mood drift over time with increased depressive symptoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>—instead finding evidence to the contrary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref><italic>ii</italic>). However, this work primarily reported evidence from short gambling tasks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>; our results indicate that associations between affective drift and mental ill-health symptoms are not task-invariant.</p>
<p>We note several limitations. Firstly, there were limitations in our outcome measures. Transdiagnostic measures of mental health psychopathology were estimated using questionnaire subsets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, precluding investigation of associations between parameters and individual diagnostic scales. Antidepressant use, meanwhile, was self-reported, non-randomised, and we did not collect information concerning length of treatment. Secondly, our use of a single computational model for all three affect scales is a powerful approach, but limited in its ability to truly contrast trial-to-trial fluctuations in each individual rating scale, as we are only comparing the contribution of a small number of computational components (i.e., affective weights) to a fraction of their variation; the residual (scale-specific) variation is likely also important in explaining how these ratings overlap and differ. Third, as model complexity meant only approximate (mean-field variational, rather than samplingbased) inference was viable, we were unable to account for uncertainty in estimates of individual-level posterior mean parameters in associations with quantities of interest (e.g., by using precision-weighted GLMs), as the posterior covariance matrix cannot accurately capture local interdependencies, meaning that parameter precisions are not reliable enough for uncertainty-weighted outcome models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To conclude, we integrated objective choice behaviour in a learning task with trial-to-trial affect ratings across three distinct states—happiness, confidence, and engagement— within a unified computational model. This enabled us to uncover associations between model parameters and treatments for mental health conditions, offering new insights into their underlying mechanisms-of-action. Our results demonstrate the critical importance of affective biases in the maintenance and updating of affective states in mental ill-health, and indicate that existing, effective treatments can be understood at least in part as acting to shift these biases towards the healthy range.</p>

Furthermore, there was limited evidence of an accompanying interaction effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure S4B</xref><italic>ii</italic>), suggesting the contribution of less recent expected values to engagement ratings was also marginally higher in participants taking antidepressants, which may in turn explain the higher forgetting factor <italic>γ</italic><sub>engaged</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref><italic>v</italic>).</p>

<title>Affective drift over time is associated with self-reported fatigue</title>
<p>Previous work on ‘mood drift over time’ has suggested it is mostly distinct from boredom and mind wandering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Here, were able to test an additional aspect of this phenomenon, namely its relation to fatigue, as we asked participants the following question after the end of each of the six blocks: “How fatigued do you feel compared to the beginning of the block?”.

<p>Decron and colleagues combine common psychiatric treatments with a probabilistic reward learning task and trial-by-trial ratings of affect, confidence, and engagement. Using computational cognitive modeling, they show that, while both treatments serve to counter negative biases in affect and confidence, cognitive distancing and antidepressant medication have dissociable effects on subjective evaluations and reward-based choice behavior. This work provides <bold>convincing</bold> evidence regarding an <bold>important</bold> line of investigation into the dynamic integration of affect, cognition, and learning.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study examines how two common psychiatric treatments, antidepressant medication and cognitive distancing, influence baseline levels and moment-to-moment changes in happiness, confidence, and engagement during a reinforcement learning task. Combining a probabilistic selection task, trial-by-trial affect ratings, psychiatric questionnaires, and computational modeling, the authors demonstrate that each treatment has distinct effects on affective dynamics. Notably, the results highlight the key role of affective biases in how people with mental health conditions experience and update their feelings over time, and suggest that interventions like cognitive distancing and antidepressant medication may work, at least in part, by shifting these biases.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Addresses an important question: how common psychiatric treatments impact affective biases, with potential translational relevance for understanding and improving mental health interventions.</p>
<p>(2) The introduction is strong, clear, and accessible, making the study approachable for readers less familiar with the underlying literature.</p>
<p>(3) Utilizes a large sample that is broadly representative of the UK population in terms of age and psychiatric symptom history, enhancing generalizability.</p>
<p>(4) Employs a theory-driven computational modeling framework that links learning processes with subjective emotional experiences.</p>
<p>(5) Uses cross-validation to support the robustness and generalizability of model comparisons and findings.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors acknowledge the limitations in the discussion section.</p>
<p>Additional questions:</p>
<p>(1) Group Balance &amp; Screening for Medication Use: How many participants in the cognitive distancing and control groups were taking antidepressant medication? Why wasn't medication use included as part of the screening to ensure both groups had a similar number of participants taking medication?</p>
<p>(2) Assessment of the Practice of Cognitive Distancing: Is there a direct or more objective method to evaluate whether participants actively engaged in cognitive distancing during the task, and to what extent? Currently, the study infers engagement indirectly through the outcomes, but does not include explicit measures of participants' use of the technique. Would including self-report check-ins throughout the task, asking participants whether they were actively engaging in cognitive distancing, have been useful? However, including frequent self-report check-ins would increase procedural differences between groups, making perhaps the tasks less comparable beyond the intended treatment manipulation. Maybe incorporating a question at the end of the task, asking how much they engaged in cognitive distancing, could offer a useful measure of subjective engagement without overly disrupting the task flow.</p>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>This study advances our understanding of the mechanisms underlying mental health interventions. The combination of computational modeling with behavioral and affective data offers a powerful framework for understanding how treatments influence affective biases and dynamics. These findings are of broad interest across clinical and mental health sciences, cognitive and affective research, and applied translational fields focused on improving psychological well-being.</p>

<p>In this paper, Dercon and colleagues report on affective changes related to components of reinforcement learning and on the effects of brief training in psychological distancing and participants' self-reported antidepressant use. About 1,000 participants were assessed online, with half randomized to a brief training in psychological distancing with reminders to distance during the subsequent reinforcement learning (RL) task. Participants completed a battery of psychiatric questionnaires and answered questions about medication use, with about 14% of participants reporting current antidepressant use. All participants completed the RL task and rated their happiness, confidence, engagement, and (at the end of each block of trials) fatigue throughout the task. Computational models were used to estimate trial-by-trial values of expected value and prediction error and to assess the effects of these values on self-reported affect. Participants' affect ratings decreased over time, and participants with higher psychiatric symptoms (particularly anxiety/depressive symptoms) showed lower baseline affect and greater decreases in affect. Participants randomized to the distancing intervention and who reported antidepressant use differed in their affective ratings: distancing reduced the reductions in happiness over time, while antidepressant use was related to higher baseline happiness. Distancing also reduced the effects of trial-level expected value on happiness, while antidepressant use was related to a more enduring effect of trial-level values on happiness.</p>
<p>Overall, this is an interesting paper with strong methods and an interesting approach. That psychiatric symptoms and cognitive distancing are related to affective ratings is not terribly novel; the relationship with antidepressant use is a bit more novel. The extension of the mood model to an RL task is a new contribution, as is the relationship of these effects with psychologically related manipulations.</p>
<p>One major concern is the inference that can be drawn from the two &quot;treatments&quot;: one is a brief instruction in a component of psychotherapy, and one is ongoing use of medication. The former is not a treatment in and of itself, but a (presumably) active ingredient of one. How to interpret antidepressant use as measured is unclear, e.g., are the residual symptoms in these participants an early indicator of treatment resistance? Are these participants with better access to health care? Are they receiving antidepressants for a mental health issue?</p>
<p>There are some clarifications needed in the affect model as well.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The present manuscript investigates and proposes different mechanisms for the effects of two therapeutic approaches - cognitive distancing technique and use of antidepressants - on subjective ratings of happiness, confidence, and task engagement, and on the influence of such subjective experiences on choice behavior. Both approaches were found to link to changes in affective state dynamics in a choice task, specifically reduced drift (cognitive distancing) and increased baseline (antidepressant use). Results also suggest that cognitive distancing may reduce the weighing of recent expected values in the happiness model, while antidepressant use may reduce forgetting of choices and outcomes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a timely topic and a significant contribution to ongoing efforts to improve our mechanistic understanding of psychopathology and devise effective novel interventions. The relevance of the manuscript's central question is clear, and the links to previous literature and the broader field of computational psychiatry are well established. The modelling approaches are thoughtful and rigorously tested, with appropriate model checks and persuasive evidence that modelling complements the theoretical argument and empirical findings.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Some vagueness and lack of clarity in theoretical mechanisms and interpretation of results leave outstanding questions regarding (a) the specific links drawn between affective biases, therapies aimed at mitigating them, and mental health function, and (b) the structure and assumptions of the modelling, and how they support the manuscript's central claims. Broadly, I do not fully understand the distinction between how choice behavior vs. affect are impacted separately or together by cognitive distancing. Clarification on this point is needed, possibly through a more explicit proposal of a mechanism (or several alternative mechanisms?) in the introduction and more explicit interpretation of the modelling results in the context of the cyclical choice-affect mechanism.</p>
<p>(1) Theoretical framework and proposed mechanisms</p>
<p>The link between affective biases and negative thinking patterns is a bit unclear. The authors seem to make a causal claim that &quot;affective biases are precipitated and maintained by negative thinking patterns&quot;, but it is unclear what precisely these negative patterns are; earlier in the same paragraph, they state that affective biases &quot;cause low mood&quot; and possibly shift choices toward those that maintain low mood. So the directionality of the mechanism here is unclear - possibly explaining a bit more of the cyclic nature of this mechanism, and maybe clarifying what &quot;negative thinking patterns&quot; refer to will be helpful.</p>
<p>More generally, this link between affect and choices, especially given the modelling results later on, should be clarified further. What is the mechanism by which these two impact each other? How do the models of choice and affect ratings in the RL task test this mechanism? I'm not quite sure the paper answers these questions clearly right now.</p>
<p>The authors also seem to implicitly make the claim that symptoms of mental ill-health are at least in part related to choice behavior. I find this a persuasive claim generally; however, it is understated and undersupported in the introduction, to the point where a reader may need to rely on significant prior knowledge to understand why mitigating the impact of affective biases on choice behavior would make sense as the target of therapeutic interventions. This is a core tenet of the paper, and it would be beneficial to clarify this earlier on.</p>
<p>It would be helpful to interpret a bit more clearly the findings from 3.4. on decreased drift in all three subjective assessments in the cognitive distancing group. What is the proposed mechanism for this? The discussion mentions that &quot;attenuated declines [...] over time, [add] to our previously reported findings that this psychotherapeutic technique alters aspects of reward learning&quot; - but this is vague and I do not understand, if an explanation for how this happens is offered, what that explanation is. Given the strong correlation of the drift with fatigue, is the explanation that cognitive distancing mitigates affect drift under fatigue? Or is this merely reporting the result without an interpretation around potential mechanisms?</p>
<p>(Relatedly, aside from possibly explaining the drift parameter, do the fatigue ratings link with choice behavior in any way? Is it possible that the cognitive distancing was helping participants improve choices under fatigue?)</p>
<p>(2) Task Structure and Modelling</p>
<p>It is unclear what counted as a &quot;rewarding&quot; vs. &quot;unrewarding&quot; trial in the model. From my understanding of the task description, participants obtained positive or no reward (no losses), and verbal feedback, Correct/Incorrect. But given the probabilistic nature of the task, it follows that even some correct choices likely had unrewarding results. Was the verbal feedback still &quot;Correct&quot; in those cases, but with no points shown? I did not see any discussion on whether it is the #points earned or the verbal feedback that is considered a reward in the model. I am assuming the former, but based on previous literature, likely both play a role; so it would be interesting - and possibly necessary to strengthen the paper's argument - to see a model that assigns value to positive/negative feedback and earned points separately.</p>
<p>From a theory perspective, it's interesting that the authors chose to assume separate learning rates for rewarding and non-rewarding trials. Why not, for example, separate reward sensitivity parameters? E.g., rather than a scaling parameter on the PE, a parameter modifying the r term inside the PE equation to, perhaps, assign different values to positive and zero points? (While I think overall the math works out similarly at the fitting time, this type of model should be less flexible on scaling the expected value and more flexible on scaling the actual #points / the subjective experience of the obtained verbal feedback, which seems more in line with the theoretical argument made in the introduction). The introduction explicitly states that negative biases &quot;may cause low mood by making outcomes appear less rewarding&quot; - which in modelling equations seems more likely to translate to different reward-perception biases, and not different learning rates. Alternatively, one might incorporate a perseveration parameter (e.g., similar to Collins et al. 2014) that would also accomplish a negative bias. Either of these two mechanisms seems perhaps worth testing out in a model - especially in a model that defines more clearly what rewarding vs. unrewarding may mean to the participant.</p>
<p>If I understand correctly, the affect ratings models assume that the Q-value and the PE independently impact rating (so they have different weights, w2 and w3), but there is no parameter allowing for different impact for perceived rewarding and unrewarding outcomes? (I may be misreading equations 4-5, but if not, Q-value and PE impact the model via static rather than dynamic parameters.) Given the joint RL-affect fit, this seems to carry the assumption that any perceptual processing differences leading to different subjective perceptions of reward associated with each outcome only impact choice behavior, but not affect? (whereas affect is more broadly impacted, if I'm understanding this correctly, just by the magnitude of the values and PEs?) This is an interesting assumption, and the authors seem to have tested it a bit more in the Supplementary material, as shown in Figure S4. I'm wondering why this was excluded from the main text - it seems like the more flexible model found some potentially interesting differences which may be worth including, especially as they might shed additional insight into the influence of cognitive distancing on the cyclical choice-affect mechanisms proposed.</p>
<p>Minor comments:</p>
<p>If fatigue ratings were strongly associated with drift in the best-fitting model (as per page 13), I wonder if it would make sense to use those fatigue ratings as a proxy rather than allow the parameter to vary freely? (This does not in any way detract from the winning model's explanatory power, but if a parameter seems to be strongly explained by a variable we have empirical data for, it's not clear what extra benefit is earned by having that parameter in the model).</p>
