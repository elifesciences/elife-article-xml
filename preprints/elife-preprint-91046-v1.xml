<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Ethylamine (EA), the precursor of theanine biosynthesis, is synthesized from alanine decarboxylation by Alanine Decarboxylase (AlaDC) in tea plants. AlaDC evolves from Serine Decarboxylase (SerDC) through neofunctionalization and has lower catalytic activity. However, lacking structure information hinders the understanding of the evolution of substrate specificity and catalytic activity. In this study, we solved the X-ray crystal structures of AlaDC from <italic>Camellia sinensis</italic> (CsAlaDC) and SerDC from <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (AtSerDC). Tyr<sup>341</sup> of AtSerDC or the corresponding Tyr<sup>336</sup> of CsAlaDC is essential for their enzymatic activity. Tyr<sup>111</sup> of AtSerDC and the corresponding Phe<sup>106</sup> of CsAlaDC determine their substrate specificity. Both CsAlaDC and AtSerDC have a distinctive zinc finger that contributes to the activity and has not been identified in any other Group II PLP-dependent amino acid decarboxylases. Based on the structure comparison and evolution analysis AlaDC or SerDC led us to perform mutation screen of CsAlaDC. The results indicated that the mutation of L110F or P114A in the CsAlaDC dimerization interface significantly improved the catalytic activity by 110% and 59%, respectively. Combining double mutant CsAlaDC<sup>L110F/P114A</sup> with theanine synthetase increased 672% of theanine production in an <italic>in vitro</italic> system. This study provides the structural basis for the substrate selectivity and catalytic activity of CsAlaDC and AtSerDC and sheds light on a new direction for the efficient industrial synthesis of theanine.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tea is one of the most popular natural non-alcoholic beverages consumed worldwide. About 2 billion cups of tea are consumed worldwide daily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). The popularity of tea is determined by its favorable flavor and numerous health benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). The flavor and health-beneficial effects of tea are conferred by the abundant secondary metabolites, including catechins, caffeine, theanine, volatiles, etc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Theanine (γ-glutamylethylamide) is a unique non-protein amino acid and the most abundant free amino acid in tea plants (<italic>Camellia sinensis</italic>). It accounts for more than 50% of the total free amino acids and approximately 1-2% of the dry weight of the new shoots of tea plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Theanine is the secondary metabolite conferring the umami taste of tea infusion and also balances the astringency and bitterness of tea infusion caused by catechins and caffeine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). It has also many health-promoting functions, such as reducing stress and anxiety, improving mood and cognition, protecting the nervous system, etc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Therefore, theanine content is highly correlated with green tea quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>).</p>
<p>Theanine is synthesized from EA and glutamate (Glu) by theanine synthetase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Importantly, the large amount of theanine biosynthesis is determined by the high availability of EA in tea plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Therefore, the evolution of EA biosynthesis in tea plants largely determined the quality formation of tea. EA is synthesized from alanine decarboxylation by alanine decarboxylase (CsAlaDC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Indeed, CsAlaDC expression level and catalytic activity largely determine the theanine accumulation level in tea plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). As a novel gene, <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> had not been reported in other plant species before it was identified in tea plants. Previous studies indicated that <italic>AlaDC</italic> originated from the serine decarboxylase gene (<italic>SerDC</italic>) by gene duplication in tea plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). However, CsAlaDC and CsSerDC specifically catalyze alanine and serine decarboxylation, respectively, despite they share highly conserved amino acid sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, 1C). In addition, CsAlaDC exhibited a much lower enzymatic activity compared with CsSerDC. However, the structural basis and key amino acids underlying the evolution of the substrate specificity and enzymatic activity of CsAlaDC are unknown.</p>

<p>SerDC belongs to the Group II pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP)-dependent decarboxylase superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). These Group II amino acid decarboxylases produce many bioactive secondary metabolites and signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). In plants, SerDC catalyzes the biosynthesis of ethanolamine from serine, which was first functionally characterized in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Ethanolamine is an important metabolite in the synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine, two main phospholipids involved in maintaining eukaryotic membrane structures in eukaryotic cell membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Furthermore, the study has shown that SerDC is essential in the embryogenesis of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). SerDC is of vital importance for plant growth and development, but the mechanism of substrate recognition and catalytic activity of SerDC also remains unclear.</p>
<p>In this work, we attempt to understand the mechanism of functional divergence of plant AlaDC and SerDC by analyzing their structural characteristics. Here, we obtained the X-ray crystal structure of CsAlaDC and AtSerDC. According to the crystal structure, we found a distinctive zinc finger structure located at both CsAlaDC and AtSerDC, which has not been identified in any other Group II PLP-dependent amino acid decarboxylases that have been previously characterized. By comparing the substrate binding pockets, we identified Phe<sup>106</sup> of CsAlaDC and Tyr<sup>111</sup> of AtSerDC as the crucial sites for substrate specificity. By conducting mutation screening based on the protein structures, we identified the amino acids repressing the catalytic activity and discovered that CsAlaDC<sup>L110F/P114A</sup> exhibited a 2.3-fold increase in catalytic activity compared to that of CsAlaDC and enhanced the engineering of theanine production <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

<title>Enzymatic properties of CsAlaDC, AtSerDC, and CsSerDC</title>
<p>CsAlaDC originates from CsSerDC by gene duplication and neofunctionalization in tea plants, but they catalyze different metabolic processes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). A phylogenetic tree was constructed to further reveal the evolutionary relationship between CsAlaDC and its homologs in <italic>Algal</italic>, <italic>Pteridohyta</italic>, <italic>Bryophyta</italic>, <italic>Monocots</italic> and <italic>Dicots</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that CsAlaDC is homologous with SerDCs, and its closer relationship was Dicots plants. As expected, CsSerDC was most closed to AtSerDC, which implies that they shared similar functions. However, CsAlaDC is relatively distant from CsSerDC. Next, we performed a multiple sequence alignment of the amino acid sequences of the 6 SerDCs and CsAlaDC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). The results showed that the amino acid sequences of CsAlaDC and SerDCs were highly conserved, but CsAlaDC has amino acid mutations in conserved motifs compared with other SerDCs.</p>
<p>Next, to verify the substrate specificity and enzyme activity, we conducted enzyme activity detection and enzyme kinetics analysis for CsAlaDC, CsSerDC and AtSerDC. The 5′ truncated <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> and <italic>AtSerDC</italic> were constructed into the pET22b and pET28a expression vectors to generate recombinant plasmids pET22b-<italic>CsAlaDC</italic> and pET28a-<italic>AtSerDC</italic>, correspondingly. Additionally, the full-length protein of CsSerDC was inserted into the pET28a expression vector to generate recombinant plasmid pET28a-<italic>CsSerDC</italic>. Subsequently, the recombinant proteins were expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and purified via nickel affinity chromatography. The purified proteins were examined through SDS-PAGE analysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). To investigate the substrate specificity of CsAlaDC, AtSerDC, and CsSerDC, enzyme activity assays were conducted using Ala and Ser as substrates, followed by product identification via UPLC analysis. The results showed that CsAlaDC can effectively participate in the decarboxylation of alanine to generate EA, whereas its catalytic efficacy towards serine is relatively inferior. Conversely, AtSerDC and CsSerDC selectively catalyzed serine decarboxylation to yield ethanolamine but did not exhibit activity towards alanine (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). These findings confirmed that CsAlaDC and SerDCs do not have promiscuous decarboxylase activity on Ala and Ser.</p>

<p>The kinetic properties of CsAlaDC, AtSerDC, and CsSerDC were determined through the use of corresponding substrates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), and the results are presented in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The kinetic parameter Km of CsAlaDC was determined to be 1.215 mmol/L, which is similar to that of AtSerDC and CsSerDC at 1.522 mmol/L and 2.364 mmol/L, respectively. However, AtSerDC has a Vmax of 7.053 μmol/L/s, which is 4-fold that of CsAlaDC’s Vmax of 1.709 μmol/L/s; while CsSerDC has a Vmax of 9.031 μmol/L/s, which is 5.3-fold that of CsAlaDC. These findings indicated that the catalytic efficiency of CsAlaDC is considerably lower than that of both CsSerDC and AtSerDC. Due to the similarity in catalytic activity between CsSerDC and AtSerDC, we chose the more representative AtSerDC for further analysis.</p>

<title>The overall structures of CsAlaDC and AtSerDC</title>
<p>To enhance our comprehension of CsAlaDC and AtSerDC, we conducted structural analyses of these two proteins. Through optimization of crystallization conditions, we successfully determined the crystal structures of CsAlaDC, as well as the CsAlaDC-EA, and AtSerDC at resolutions of 2.50 Å, 2.60 Å and 2.85 Å, respectively (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The overall architecture of CsAlaDC and AtSerDC comprises homodimeric structures with two subunits exhibiting an asymmetrical arrangement (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). The monomer of CsAlaDC and AtSerDC is divided into three distinct structural domains: an N-terminal domain (N-terminal −104 aa in CsAlaDC, N-terminal −109 aa in AtSerDC), a large domain (105-364 aa in CsAlaDC, 110-369 aa in AtSerDC), and a small C-terminal domain (365 aa-C-terminus in CsAlaDC, 370-C-terminus as in AtSerDC), colored light pink, khaki, and sky blue, respectively. Compared to the full-length protein, the N-terminal structures of CsAlaDC and AtSerDC are truncated by 60 and 65 amino acid residues, respectively. The truncated protein N-terminus contains a long α-helix, which is connected to the large domain through a long loop. The large domain contains a seven-stranded mixed β-sheet surrounded by eight α-helices, while the C-terminal domain composes of a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and three α-helices. The catalytic site of the enzyme is positioned within a superficial crevice at the junction of two subunits forming a dimeric arrangement. The cofactor-binding process involves amino acid residues derived from both subunits. One monomer accommodates both PLP and substrate, while the other monomer also contributes to cofactor binding and enzymatic function (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>).</p>

<p>Notably, our investigation has revealed the presence of a distinctive zinc finger structure (as depicted in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>) located at the C-terminus of CsAlaDC and AtSerDC. This structure is composed of a ring structure spanning 17 amino acid residues, wherein coordination of Zn<sup>2+</sup> is facilitated by three Cys residues and one His residue. Importantly, this particular configuration is exclusive to the two proteins under examination and has not been identified in any other Group II PLP-dependent amino acid decarboxylases that have been previously characterized.</p>
<p>The crystal structures of CsAlaDC-EA complex and AtSerDC were obtained and further analyzed. In the former complex, PLP bound to Lys<sup>309</sup> via a Schiff base linkage (internal aldimine form), and the pyridine moiety of PLP is positioned between the imidazole ring of His<sup>196</sup> and the methyl group of Ala<sup>279</sup> in a parallel orientation to the imidazole ring. The N1 of PLP establishes a salt bridge interaction with Asp<sup>277</sup>, while the O3 forms hydrogen bonds with Thr<sup>247</sup> and Lys<sup>309</sup>. Additionally, the phosphate group of PLP participates in hydrogen bonding interactions with His<sup>308</sup>, Gly<sup>169</sup>, Thr<sup>170</sup>, Lys<sup>309</sup>, and Ser<sup>347</sup>*(“*” denotes the amino acids on adjacent subunits.) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Similarly, in the latter structure, the pyridine ring of PLP was sandwiched between the imidazole ring of His<sup>201</sup> and the methyl group of Ala<sup>284</sup>. The N1 of PLP formed a salt bridge with Asp<sup>282</sup>, while the O3 formed hydrogen bonds with Thr<sup>252</sup>. The phosphate group of PLP established hydrogen bonding interactions with Lys<sup>314</sup>, His<sup>313</sup>, Gly<sup>174</sup>, Thr<sup>175</sup>, and Ser<sup>352</sup>* (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>).</p>

A flexible loop of amino acids originating from one monomer extends into the active site of the other monomer and plays a crucial role in catalysis. The catalytic loop in CsAlaDC, consisting of amino acid residues 328-341, is well-structured and exhibits clear electron density. However, the corresponding loop in AtSerDC is disordered (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). The aforementioned loop harbors a conserved Tyr residue that is believed to function as a proton donor of the carbanion in the catalytic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). In particular, CsAlaDC Tyr<sup>336</sup> and AtSerDC Tyr<sup>341</sup> correspond to that Tyr residue. Upon superimposing the active site residues of CsAlaDC apo and CsAlaDC-EA complex, it was observed that the hydroxyl group of Tyr<sup>336</sup>* in the CsAlaDC-EA complex exhibits a substantial 60-degree deviation along the Cα-Cβ bound (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). To assess the function of the Tyr, we substituted the corresponding Tyr residues in CsAlaDC and AtSerDC with Phe. The resulting CsAlaDC<sup>Y336F</sup> and AtSerDC<sup>Y341F</sup> mutants were then exposed to L-alanine and L-serine, respectively. We measured the production of EA or ethanolamine in the reaction mixtures. Our findings indicate that these mutants catalyze abortive decarboxylation, as opposed to wild-type CsAlaDC and AtSerDC, as evidenced by the absence of detectable EA and only a small amount of ethanolamine observed in the reaction mixture (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). This result suggested this Tyr is required for the catalytic activity of CsAlaDC and AtSerDC.</p>
<p>CsAlaDC and AtSerDC both possess a C-terminal zinc finger motif whose removal led to protein insoluble when expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Therefore we used dithiothreitol (DTT) to block the zinc finger structure to evaluate the role of this zinc finger structure in the catalytic activity. The results showed that 5 mM L-DTT reduced the relative activity of CsAlaDC and AtSerDC to 22.0% and 35.2%, respectively, compared to the control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>). These results suggested that this characteristic zinc finger motif is probably critical for the protein folding of CsAlaDC and AtSerDC.</p>

<title>Identification of key amino acids for the substrate specificity</title>
<p>Through the superposition of the amino acid residues present in the substrate binding pocket of CsAlaDC and AtSerDC, it was observed that except for Phe at position 106 in CsAlaDC (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), the residues were identical. In AtSerDC, this position is occupied by Tyr at 111, suggesting that this specific amino acid residue is related to substrate specificity.</p>

<p>To obtain more insights into the role of specific amino acid residue in substrate specificity, we utilized amino acid sequences of AtSerDC to identify all potential serine decarboxylases in <italic>Embryophyta</italic> and constructed phylogenetic trees (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary figure 1</xref>). We further identified conserved motifs in these SerDC homologs in <italic>Embryophyta</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Importantly, the Phe<sup>106</sup> of CsAlaDC or Tyr<sup>111</sup> of AtSerDC locates in a conserved motif (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). In this conserved motif, the first two amino acids Y and P are 100% conserved, but the third amino acid is variable and can be Y, T, F, V, A, I, or other amino acids (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B and C</xref>); interestingly, the Phe<sup>106</sup> of CsAlaDC and Tyr<sup>111</sup> of AtSerDC locates at this variable amino acid position. For these first three amino acids, the YPY was identified in 83.7% of the SerDC homologs, while the YPF motif was found in 2.3% of these SerDC homologs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). These analyses provided more insights into the role of Phe<sup>106</sup> of CsAlaDC and Tyr<sup>111</sup> of AtSerDC in the substrate specificity.</p>
<p>To verify the role of Phe<sup>106</sup> of CsAlaDC or Tyr<sup>111</sup> of AtSerDC in substrate specificity, we mutated Phe<sup>106</sup> of CsAlaDC into Tyr (CsAlaDC<sup>F106Y</sup>) and Tyr<sup>111</sup> of AtSerDC into Phe (AtSerDC<sup>Y111F</sup>) and tested enzymatic activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. The results showed that CsAlaDC<sup>F106Y</sup> totally lost the alanine decarboxylase activity, and AtSerDC<sup>Y111F</sup> gained alanine decarboxylase activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). We also performed other mutations of Tyr<sup>111</sup> of AtSerDC, including AtSerDC<sup>Y111A</sup>, AtSerDC<sup>Y111I</sup>, AtSerDC<sup>Y111L</sup>, AtSerDC<sup>Y111V</sup> and AtSerDC<sup>Y111W</sup>. Within these mutations, only AtSerDC<sup>Y111I</sup> exhibited a low level of alanine decarboxylase activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). These results verified that the Phe<sup>106</sup> of CsAlaDC is required for the alanine decarboxylase activity from serine decarboxylase activity.</p>
<p>On the other side, both CsAlaDC and CsAlaDC<sup>F106Y</sup> exhibit a very low level of serine decarboxylase activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Moreover, compared with AtSerDC, the serine decarboxylase activity of AtSerDC<sup>Y111F</sup> was about 30% of AtSerDC; AtSerDC<sup>Y111I</sup> retained lower than 5% of serine decarboxylase activity of AtSerDC; while other mutations, including AtSerDC<sup>Y111A</sup>, AtSerDC<sup>Y111L</sup>, AtSerDC<sup>Y111V</sup> and AtSerDC<sup>Y111W</sup> abolished the serine decarboxylase activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). These results suggested the Tyr<sup>111</sup> of AtSerDC is also important for the substrate specificity of AtSerDC.</p>
<p>To further verify that Phe<sup>106</sup> of CsAlaDC and Tyr111 of AtSerDC were key amino acid residues determining its substrate recognition <italic>in planta</italic>, <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> transient expression system was carried out. To this end, <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> strain GV3101 (pSoup-p19), carrying recombinant plasmid, was infiltrated into leaves of 5-week-old <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> plants, and the pCAMBIA1305 empty vector was used as the control (EV). Relative mRNA levels were detected (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary figure 2</xref>), indicating that they had been successfully overexpressed in tobacco. Here, we found that a high level of EA was produced in the CsAlaDC-expressing tobacco leaves; while no EA product was detected in tobacco leaves infiltrated with the mutant CsAlaDC<sup>F106Y</sup>. In addition, we did not detect EA products in the AtSerDC-expressing tobacco leaves, while a high level of EA was detected in tobacco leaves infiltrated with mutant AtSerDC<sup>Y111F</sup>. As anticipated, EA was not detected in tobacco leaves infiltrated with EV (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G and H</xref>). These results further verified the critical role of Phe<sup>106</sup> in the substrate specificity of CsAlaDC.</p>

<title>Key amino acids for the evolution of CsAlaDC enzymatic activity</title>
<p>CsAlaDC and AtSerDC have a high sequence similarity of 74.5% and a nearly identical structure with an RMSD (root mean square deviation) of only 0.77Å for monomer structures. However, the two enzymes catalyze different amino acid decarboxylation reactions, and AtSerDC exhibits significantly higher activity than CsAlaDC (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B and C</xref>). To elucidate this observation, we proposed a prediction test: EA, generated via Ala decarboxylation by CsAlaDC, can be toxic and harmful to plants if accumulated excessively. Thus, during the evolution of plant serine decarboxylase into alanine decarboxylase, the enzyme has evolved not just to alter the substrate preference but also to reduce catalytic activity to control EA production within a suitable range. Based on this hypothesis, we suggest that mutating specific amino acids in CsAlaDC to those corresponding amino acids in SerDCs could enhance its activity, and the results could provide insights into the evolution of CsAlaDC enzymatic activity.</p>
<p>Dimerization is essential to AlaDC/SerDC activities because the active site is composed of residues from two monomers. To identify the amino acids repressing the enzymatic activity of CsAlaDC during evolution from SerDC, we analyzed the crystal structures and the amino acids at the dimer interface between CsAlaDC and AtSerDC. This analysis revealed that the amino acid residues at positions 66, 97, 110, 114, 116, 117, 122, 315 and 345 are different in CsAlaDC and SerDCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Therefore, we mutated these amino acids of CsAlaDC into those in the corresponding positions of AtSerDC and CsSerDC, and performed enzyme activity assays (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). The results demonstrated that CsAlaDC<sup>L110F</sup> and CsAlaDC<sup>P114A</sup> exhibited significantly enhanced enzyme activity compared to the wild-type CsAlaDC, with a 2.1-fold and 1.59-fold increase, respectively. Furthermore, the catalytic activity of the CsAlaDC<sup>L110F/P114A</sup> double mutant exhibits a remarkable 2.3-fold enhancement compared to that of the wild-type protein (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). These findings suggested a critical role of Leu<sup>110</sup> and Pro<sup>114</sup> of CsAlaDC in the evolution of enzymatic activity and provided a basis to improve CsAlaDC activity. It is possible that these amino acid residues could potentially augment the hydrophobic nature of the protein dimer interface.</p>

<title><italic>In Vitro</italic> synthesis of theanine</title>
<p>The biosynthetic pathway of theanine in tea plants comprises two sequential enzymatic steps: alanine decarboxylase mediates alanine decarboxylation to yield EA, which is subsequently utilized by theanine synthetase to effectuate the condensation reaction with glutamate to synthesize theanine. By conducting mutation screening, we discovered a CsAlaDC mutant protein (L110F/P114A) that exhibited a 2.3-fold increase in catalytic activity compared to the wild-type protein. Subsequently, we employed an <italic>in vitro</italic> theanine synthesis system utilizing CsAlaDC and either glutamate synthetase (PtGS [P<italic>seudomonas syringae</italic> pv. syringae]) or gamma-glutamate methylamine ligase (GMAS [<italic>Methylovorus mays</italic>]) which have the activity to synthesize theanine from EA and Glu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>).</p>
<p>The results illustrated the successful synthesis of theanine using CsAlaDC in conjunction with two theanine synthetases, employing Ala and glutamate as substrates (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). The theanine content generated by the combination of CsAlaDC<sup>L110F</sup> and GMAS, as well as CsAlaDC<sup>L110F/P114A</sup> and GMAS, are 4.57-fold and 6.72-fold higher than the content produced in the combination of wild-type CsAlaDC and GMAS, respectively. Similarly, when combined with the PsGS, comparable outcomes are observed as well. The theanine content resulting from the combination of CsAlaDC<sup>L110F</sup> and PsGS, as well as CsAlaDC<sup>L110F/P114A</sup> and PsGS, exhibit enhancements of 1.62-fold and 4.33-fold compared to the wild-type protein combination, respectively. (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Hence, the utilization of CsAlaDC<sup>L110F/P114A</sup> could effectively enhance the theanine production yield and thus, holds potential for large-scale engineering production of theanine.</p>

<title>Comparison of CsAlaDC and AtSerDC with other decarboxylases</title>
<p>The Dali search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>) revealed that AtSerDC and CsAlaDC exhibit structural similarity to several other decarboxylases, including 7CIG (MetDC [<italic>Streptomyces sp</italic>. 590]), 7ERV (HisDC1 [<italic>Photobacterium phosphoreum</italic>]), 6KHO (TrpDC [<italic>Oryza sativa Japonica</italic> Group]), 4E1O (HisDC2 [<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>]), 6JY1 (AspDC [<italic>Methanocaldococcus jannaschii</italic>]), and 5GP4 (GluDC [<italic>Levilactobacillus brevis</italic>]). The monomers of these amino acid decarboxylases all consist of three characteristic domains (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary figure 4</xref>). The C-terminal domain, also known as the small domain, is composed of three antiparallel β-sheets and three α-helices, facing toward the opposite monomers. The large domain contains seven stranded β-sheets surrounded by eight α-helices, exhibiting characteristics typical of Type I enzymes. This domain includes a conserved PLP-binding active center and amino acid residues that are conserved across species. The N-terminal domain consists of elongated α-helices and is connected to the large domain via a loop. The helix of one subunit is antiparallel to the corresponding helix in the neighboring subunit, forming a clamp. Therefore, the N-terminal domain may not be an independent folding unit and is likely only stable in dimers.</p>
<p>The monomeric structure of CsAlaDC and AtSerDC exhibits numerous structural features common to other Group II PLP-dependent amino acid decarboxylases, and the amino acid residues that bind to PLP cofactors are conserved across multiple enzymes (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary figure 3</xref> and 4). Out of the eight proteins analyzed, a total of thirteen amino acid residues were found to be conserved across all sequences (Glu<sup>143</sup>, Glu<sup>171</sup>, Lys<sup>201</sup>, Gly<sup>245</sup>, Thr<sup>247</sup>, Asp<sup>253</sup>, His<sup>275</sup>, Asp<sup>277</sup>, Ala<sup>279</sup>, Pro<sup>286</sup>, Ser<sup>302</sup>, Lys<sup>309</sup>, and Tyr<sup>336</sup> in CsAlaDC). Some of them are situated within the active center and play a role in stabilizing PLP or facilitating catalytic reactions. Conversely, other residues reside outside the active center and their function remains unclear. (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary figure 3</xref>). PLP is bound to conserved lysine residues in the active center through the Schiff base. The carboxylic group of conserved Asp residues stabilizes protonated pyridine nitrogen of PLP by electrostatic action, providing the latter with strong electrophilicity to stabilize carbanion intermediates during enzymatic catalysis. Another conserved His residue is situated laterally to the PLP, while on the opposite side, there is a conserved Ala residue. The oxygen atom at position 3 of PLP is stabilized by hydrogen bonding with the Thr residue. The phosphate moiety of PLP is additionally secured to the protein through an elongated system of hydrogen bonding. The α5 helix located within the large domain exhibits evolutionary conservation in Group II enzymes, facilitating interaction with the PLP phosphate moiety and conferring appropriate stabilization thereof.</p>
<p>The superimposition of the crystal structures of CsAlaDC and AtSerDC with those of related enzymes suggests that residue Phe106 in CsAlaDC (corresponding to Tyr in AtSerDC and Glu in MetDC) may play a role in determining substrate specificity. This hypothesis was tested via mutagenesis experiments, which revealed that substitution of Phe<sup>106</sup> for Tyr rendered CsAlaDC inactive, while substitution of Tyr<sup>111</sup> for Phe in AtSerDC enabled alanine decarboxylase activity. Likewise, the substitution of Glu<sup>64</sup> for Ala in MetDC reduced enzyme activity by approximately 50-fold compared to the wild-type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>), supporting this conclusion.</p>
<p>Group II amino acid decarboxylase is characterized by the existence of highly flexible catalytic rings, which are of great significance for the catalytic mechanism of decarboxylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). The catalytic rings are located at the dimer interface and extend to the active sites of other monomers in a closed conformation. In the structure of CsAlaDC, the catalytic ring is orderly and allocated, while in the structure of AtSerDC, it is disordered and lacks electron density (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Prior research has established that the conserved amino acid residue Tyr within the ring plays a crucial role in catalysis by donating protons to carbanions of quinone intermediates that arise following decarboxylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Our experiments demonstrate that the substitution of the corresponding Tyr with Phe in the loop renders the protein inactive. Furthermore, alterations in the structure of CsAlaDC when combined with EA provide further evidence supporting this conclusion. Specifically, the structure of CsAlaDC-EA complex displayed a significant conformational change in Tyr<sup>336</sup>* located in the catalytic site (as depicted in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). Comparing the structure of CsAlaDC apo, the CsAlaDC-EA complex exhibited a notable 60-degree shift in the p-hydroxyl group of Tyr<sup>336</sup>* along the Cα-Cβ bond.</p>
<p>The monomeric configuration of CsAlaDC and AtSerDC is akin to that of other Group II amino acid decarboxylases, except for a conspicuous dissimilarity. Unlike other Group II amino acid decarboxylases, the C-terminal of CsAlaDC and AtSerDC harbors an evident zinc finger structure. We propose that this structure could potentially influence enzyme stability. To test this hypothesis, we truncated the zinc finger structure from both proteins and expressed them. Our findings indicate that, following the excision of the zinc finger structure, CsAlaDC became insoluble, while AtSerDC displayed a similar trait to a certain extent.</p>

<title>Evolution of AlaDC and SerDC</title>
<p>The sequence identity between CsAlaDC and AtSerDC is 74.5%, indicating a significant degree of homology. Moreover, the two proteins exhibit a high level of monomer structural similarity. Notably, they differ in substrate specificity. Using the crystal structure of CsAlaDC and AtSerDC as a basis, we identified pivotal amino acid residues that govern the substrate specificity of serine or alanine decarboxylase. We observed that sequences proximal to these sites exhibit a high degree of conservation in both proteins and possess characteristic motifs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Moreover, we analyzed serine decarboxylase-like proteins in <italic>Embryophyta</italic> that are highly homologous to CsAlaDC and constructed phylogenetic trees to gain insight into their evolutionary relationships. Based on our experimental findings and evolutionary evidence, we have identified a conserved YPX motif at the substrate binding pocket. For most plants, the residue X in this motif is predominantly Tyr, which corresponds to the serine decarboxylase protein. However, other residues such as Thr, Phe, Val, Ala, and Ile can also occupy this position (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B and C</xref>). Interestingly, serine decarboxylase-like proteins containing YPF motifs, which have the potential to function as alanine decarboxylases, were found to be distributed throughout the phylogenetic tree, including <italic>Asteroideae</italic>, <italic>Ericales</italic>, <italic>Chenopodiaceae</italic>, <italic>Poaceae</italic>, and <italic>Ranunculales</italic> (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary figure 1B</xref>). However, these proteins were absent in some more recent species. This observation implies that the emergence of alanine decarboxylase in these particular species could be attributed to convergent evolution.</p>
<p>Moreover, we have observed the enrichment of serine decarboxylase-like proteins that possess a YPT motif within the <italic>Fabales</italic>. Prior research has demonstrated that XP_004496485-1, which possesses a YPT motif, displays catalytic efficacy toward the processes of decarboxylation and oxidative deamination of Phe, Met, Leu, and Trp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). Given that the YPT motif is highly conserved and widely distributed in <italic>Fabales</italic>, serine decarboxylase-like proteins bearing the YPT motif may have developed a unique substrate specificity in <italic>Fabales</italic>, beyond their conventional decarboxylation functions, as exemplified by XP_004496485-1 protein mentioned above. We speculate that these proteins may be capable of catalyzing other reactions, potentially involving non-protein amino acids or other substances as substrates.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In summary, we determined the crystal structures of the CsAlaDC-EA complex and AtSerDC. We employed structural biology to reveal the substrate selection mechanism of these two decarboxylases. By structural analysis and enzyme activity experiments, we found that Tyr<sup>111</sup> of AtSerDC and Phe<sup>106</sup> of CsAlaDC as crucial sites for substrate specificity. Next, through mutation screening, we identified a CsAlaDC mutant protein (L110F/P114A) with catalytic activity 2.3 times higher than that of the wild-type protein. In an <italic>in vitro</italic> L-theanine biosynthesis system with added PsGS or GMAS, we demonstrated that the L-theanine yield of the CsAlaDC<sup>L110F/P114A</sup> group was 4.3 and 6.7 times higher than that of the wild-type control group, respectively. In addition, by utilizing the substrate recognition key motif of CsAlaDC and AtSerDC, evolutionary analysis was conducted on protein sequences exhibiting high homologous to CsAlaDC in <italic>Embryophyta</italic>, which resulted in the discovery of 13 potential alanine decarboxylases. Furthermore, we discovered serine protease-like proteins containing special motifs that have evolved in <italic>Fabale</italic>, which may possess unique substrate specificity and catalytic functions.

The reservoir solution of CsAlaDC contained 0.1 M HEPES (pH 7.5), 2.6 M sodium acetate or 0.1 M Bis-Tris (pH 6.0), and 3.5 M sodium formate. Crystals grew in 3-5 days using a protein concentration of 10 mg/mL. Diffraction data were collected at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (China). The collected data sets were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the HKL3000 software package. The structure of AtSerDC was solved by molecular replacement using the structure of HisDC (PDB code: 7ERV [<italic>Photobacterium phosphoreum</italic>]) as the model, and utilizing AtSerDC as a molecular displacement model for both CsAlaDC and the CsAlaDC-EA complex. The AtSerDC, CsAlaDC, and CsAlaDC-EA complex exhibit resolutions of 2.85 Å, 2.50 Å, and 2.60 Å, respectively.

<p>Decarboxylase activity was measured by detecting products (EA or ethanolamine) in Waters Acquit ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). The 100 μL reaction mixture, containing 20 mM substrate (Ala or Ser), 100 mM potassium phosphate, 0.1 mM PLP, and 0.025 mM purified enzyme, was prepared and incubated at standard conditions (45 °C and pH 8.0 for CsAlaDC, 40 °C and pH 8.0 for AtSerDC for 30 min). Then, the reaction was stopped with 20 μL of 10% trichloroacetic acid.</p>
<p>The detection methodology for theanine production remains consistent with the aforementioned approach. The 100 μL reaction mixture, containing 20 mM Ala, 45 mM Glu, 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.1 mM PLP, 30 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM ATP, 0.03 mM PsGS/GMAS, and 0.025 mM CsAlaDC/CsAlaDC <sup>L110F</sup>/CsAlaDC <sup>L110F/P114A</sup>, was prepared and incubated at standard conditions for 1 h. Subsequently, the reaction was terminated via immersion of the reaction vessel in a metal bath at 96 °C for 3 min.</p>
<p>The product was derivatized with 6-aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxy-succinimidyl carbamate (AQC) and subjected to analysis by UPLC. All enzymatic assays were performed in triplicate.</p>

<p><italic>Agrobacterium</italic> transient expression assays were performed on 5-week-old <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> plants. <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> strain GV3101 (pSoup-p19), carrying the above-described vectors, were cultured in Luria Bertani (LB) medium, containing appropriate antibiotics, at 28 °C. When the absorbance of bacteria colonies reached OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.6-0.8, bacterial cells were collected and resuspended in MMA solution (10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM 2-(N-morpholino) ethane sulfonic acid (MES), pH 5.6). After the OD<sub>600</sub> of the resuspended bacterial solution was adjusted to approx. 1.0, acetosyringone (AS) was added with a final concentration of 200 µM, and this solution was then incubated, at room temperature, for at least 3 h in darkness. Next, cell suspensions were infiltrated into <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves with a needle-free syringe. These <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves were then collected 3 days post infiltration, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Internal EA in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves was extracted as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>), and then the solvent was subjected to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry GS-MS system.</p>

<p>The CsAlaDC was used as a query for searching its homologs in <italic>Embryophyta</italic> using BLASTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>) (version 2.13.0). To fetch homologs of CsAlaDC in distant species, we performed a two-round blast. We first search for the best hit in the given order under <italic>Embryophyta</italic>. Then we blast each species under a provided order using the order best hit as a query and as many as 10 hits were kept. The sequences with e values &lt;= 0.001 were removed. We further dropped sequences with lengths less than 200 or larger than 800 amino acids. Then multiple sequence alignment was performed via clustalo (version 1.2.4) with default settings on these filtered sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). The NJ algorithm implemented in clustalw (version 2.1) was adopted to build the phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>).

<p>In this study, the structural characteristics of plant AlaDC and SerDC were analyzed to understand the mechanism of functional differentiation, deepen the understanding of substrate specificity and catalytic activity evolution, and explore effective ways to improve the initial efficiency of theanine synthesis.</p>
<p>On the basis of previous solid work, the authors successfully obtained the X-ray crystal structures of the precursors of theanine synthesis-CsAlaDC and AtSerDC, which are key proteins related to ethylamine synthesis, and found a unique zinc finger structure on these two crystal structures that are not found in other Group II PLP- dependent amino acid decarboxylases. Through a series of experiments, it is pointed out that this characteristic zinc finger motif may be the key to the folding of CsAlaDC and AtSerDC proteins, and this discovery is novel and prospective in the study of theine synthesis.</p>
<p>In addition, the authors identified Phe106 of CsAlaDC and Tyr111 of AtSerDC as key sites of substrate specificity by comparing substrate binding regions and identified amino acids that inhibit catalytic activity through mutation screening based on protein structure. It was found that the catalytic activity of CsAlaDCL110F/P114A was 2.3 times higher than that of CsAlaDC. At the same time, CsAlaDC and AtSerDC substrate recognition key motifs were used to carry out evolutionary analysis of the protein sequences that are highly homologous to CsAlaDC in embryos, and 13 potential alanine decarboxylases were found, which laid a solid foundation for subsequent studies related to theanine synthesis.</p>
<p>In general, this study has a solid foundation, the whole research idea is clear, the experimental design is reasonable, and the experimental results provide strong evidence for the author's point of view. Through a large number of experiments, the key links in the theanine synthesis pathway are deeply studied, and an effective way to improve the initial efficiency of theanine synthesis is found, and the molecular mechanism of this way is expounded. The whole study has good novelty and prospectivity, and sheds light on a new direction for the efficient industrial synthesis of theanine.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The manuscript focuses on the comparison of two PLP-dependent enzyme classes that perform amino acyl decarboxylations. The goal of the work is to understand the substrate specificity and factors that influence the catalytic rate in an enzyme linked to theanine production in tea plants.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The work includes x-ray crystal structures of modest resolution of the enzymes of interest. These structures provide the basis for the design of mutagenesis experiments to test hypotheses about substrate specificity and the factors that control catalytic rate. These ideas are tested via mutagenesis and activity assays, in some cases both in vitro and in plants.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The manuscript could be more clear in explaining the contents of the x-ray structures and how the complexes studied relate to the reactant and product complexes. The structure and mechanism section would also be strengthened by including a diagram of the reaction mechanism and including context about reactivity. As it stands, much of the structural results section consists of lists of amino acids interacting with certain ligands without any explanation of why these interactions are important or the role they play in catalysis. The experiments testing the function of a novel Zn(II)-binding domain also have serious flaws. I don't think anything can be said at this point about the function of the Zn(II) due to a lack of key controls and problems with experimental design.</p>

<p>In the manuscript titled &quot;Structure and Evolution of Alanine/Serine Decarboxylases and the Engineering of Theanine Production,&quot; Wang et al. solved and compared the crystal structures of Alanine Decarboxylase (AlaDC) from Camellia sinensis and Serine Decarboxylase (SerDC) from Arabidopsis thaliana. Based on this structural information, the authors conducted both in vitro and in vivo functional studies to compare enzyme activities using site-directed mutagenesis and subsequent evolutionary analyses. This research has the potential to enhance our understanding of amino acid decarboxylase evolution and the biosynthetic pathway of the plant-specialized metabolite theanine, as well as to further its potential applications in the tea industry.</p>
