<title>Abstract</title><p>Spermiogenesis is a critical, post-meiotic phase of male gametogenesis, in which the proper gene expression is essential for sperm maturation. However, the underlying molecular mechanism that controls mRNA expression in the round spermatids remains elusive. Here, we identify that FBXO24, an orphan F-box protein, is highly expressed in the testis of humans and mice and interacts with the splicing factors (SRSF2, SRSF3, and SRSF9) to modulate the gene alternative splicing in the round spermatids. Genetic mutation of FBXO24 in mice causes many abnormal splicing events in round spermatids, thus affecting a large number of critical genes related to sperm formation that were dysregulated. Further molecular and phenotypical analyses revealed that FBXO24 deficiency results in aberrant histone retention, incomplete axonemes, oversized chromatoid body (CB), and abnormal mitochondrial coiling along sperm flagella, ultimately leading to male sterility. In addition, we discovered that FBXO24 interacts with MIWI and SCF subunits and mediates the degradation of MIWI via K48-linked polyubiquitination. Furthermore, we show that FBXO24 depletion could lead to aberrant piRNA production in testes, which suggests FBXO24 is required for normal piRNA biogenesis. Collectively, these data demonstrate that FBXO24 is essential for sperm formation and piRNA production by regulating mRNA alternative splicing and MIWI degradation during spermiogenesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Spermatogenesis is a dynamic but well-organized process in which germ cells develop in the seminiferous tubules of the testis. Spermatogenesis comprises three phases: mitosis of the spermatogonia, meiosis of spermatocytes, and differentiation of round spermatids into mature sperm. The third phase is also known as spermiogenesis. During spermiogenesis, round spermatids undergo many significant changes, including the loss of cytoplasm, migration of cytoplasmic organelles, formation of the acrosome and flagellum, condensation of nuclei, and reorganization of mitochondria around the sperm midpiece (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). In mice, spermiogenesis is subdivided into 16 steps based on changes in acrosome structure and nuclear compaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Coordinated regulation of gene expressions in the round spermatids is essential for sperm formation. However, the underlying molecular mechanism that controls mRNA expression during spermiogenesis remains elusive.</p>
<p>FBXO24 (F-Box Protein 24) is a member of the F-box protein family characterized by an F-box domain. The F-box proteins constitute one of the subunits of the ubiquitin protein ligase complex called SCF (SKP1-cullin-F-box). The interaction between FBXO24 and the SCF subunits is unknown. The F-box domain recruits the F-box protein to the SCF complex, and the carboxy-terminal domain functions as protein-protein interaction. According to the different substrate recognition domains, F-box protein was generally divided into three subclasses: F-box/WD repeat-containing protein (FBXW), leucine-rich repeat protein (FBXL), and F-box only protein (FBXO) with/without other unknown domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Compared with the studies of FBXW and FBXL, the roles of most members of the FBXO subfamily have yet to be defined. FBXO24 belongs to the FBXO class. Previous studies demonstrated some FBXO proteins could regulate spermatogenesis. For example, FBXO47 has been reported to be essential for meiosis I progression in the spermatocytes of mouse testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>), and FBXO43 was associated with male infertility and teratozoospermia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). In addition, FBXO24 has been reported to recognize deacetylated nucleoside diphosphate kinase A (NDPK-A) to enhance its degradation in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). In H1299 cells, FBXO24 could promote cell proliferation by mediating ubiquitination and degradation of protein arginine methyltransferase 6 (PRMT6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). However, the molecular and biological functions of FBXO24 in mammals remain unclear, especially its role in male fertility and spermatogenesis.</p>
<p>In this study, we find that FBXO24 transcript is abundantly expressed in the testis of humans and mice. The loss function of FBXO24 in mice resulted in male sterility, with sperm possessing a collapsed mitochondrial sheath and uncompacted chromatin. We revealed that FBXO24 interacts with splicing factors (e.g., SRSF2, SRSF3, and SRSF9) to mediate gene expressions during spermiogenesis. Unexpectedly, we discovered that FBXO24 mediates MIWI ubiquitination and regulates the chromatoid body (CB) architecture and piRNA production. Together, our study demonstrated that FBXO24 plays a critical role in controlling gene expression in haploid spermatids and sperm formation during spermiogenesis.</p>

<title>FBXO24 expressed in haploid spermatids during spermiogenesis</title>
<p>Multi-alignment and phylogenetic analysis revealed that <italic>Fbxo24</italic> encodes a highly conserved protein expressed in mammals, including humans and mice (<bold>Figure S1A</bold>). FBXO24 has two domains, F-box and regulator of chromatin condensation 1 (RCC1), which were also highly conserved in humans and mice <bold>(Figure S1B)</bold>. Interestingly, qPCR analysis of multiple mouse organs showed that the mRNA of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> was predominantly expressed in mouse testes <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>)</bold>. Consistent with this result, transcription expression of analysis of FBXO24 in various human organs from the GE-mini database revealed FBXO24 also a testis-enriched expression in human testes <bold>(Figure S1C)</bold>. Further qPCR analysis of developmental testes and purified testicular cells showed that FBXO24 mRNA was highly expressed in the round spermatids and elongating spermatids <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-C</xref>)</bold>. To examine the protein level of FBXO24 in testes, we then characterized the tissue expression pattern of FBXO24 in various organs from adult <italic>Fbxo24</italic>-HA-tagged transgenic mice. Consistent with the mRNA expression showing a testis-enriched expression of FBXO24, FBXO24<sup>HA-Tag</sup> protein was exclusively expressed in the testes <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>)</bold>, suggesting FBXO24 plays a role during spermatogenesis. To explore the subcellular localization of FBXO24 in male germ cells, we performed immunofluorescence analysis by co-staining of FBXO24<sup>HA-Tag</sup> with γ-H2AX (a marker of meiotic DNA damage response) or PNA (an acrosome marker) in adult <italic>Fbxo24</italic>-HA-Tagged transgenic mouse testes. The results showed that FBXO24 <sup>HA-Tag</sup> protein was exclusively localized in the nuclei and cytoplasm of spermatids at stages VI-IX <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E-F</xref>)</bold>, demonstrating FBXO24 expressed in the round and elongating spermatids at steps 6-9. These results indicate that FBXO24 is an evolutionarily conserved testis-enriched protein expressed in haploid spermatids specifically during spermiogenesis.</p>

<title>FBXO24 deficiency results in detective spermiogenesis and male infertility in mice</title>
<p>To reveal the role of FBXO24 in male germ cell development and spermatogenesis, we generated <italic>Fbxo24</italic> knockout (KO) mice using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology. Two small guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were designed to target exon 3, which encodes the conserved F-box domain <bold>(Figure S2A)</bold>. To validate nucleotide deletion at the targeted loci, the corresponding genomic regions of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> were evaluated by PCR <bold>(Figure S2B)</bold>. qPCR analysis verified the mRNA expression of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> was almost undetectable in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mouse testes <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>)</bold>. To test the fecundity of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice, we crossed <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice with fertility-proved WT mice for at least 6 months. The fertility test results showed that <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO males were completely infertile, but the <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO females were fertile <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>)</bold>. Interestingly, we observed the testis size and the ratio of testis weight to body weight were comparable between <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO males and controls <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold> and <bold>Figure S2C)</bold>. Consistent with these observations, histological analysis of adult testes and epididymides showed no obvious abnormalities in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice compared with WT <bold>(Figure S2D)</bold>. However, in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice, we found fewer elongating spermatids (at stages IX-X) and condensing spermatids (at stages XII) and a reduced number of condensed spermatids (at stages II-VIII) <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D-E</xref>)</bold>, concomitant with increased apoptotic signals detected in late spermatids <bold>(Figure S2E-F)</bold>, which suggesting FBXO24 deficiency could affect spermatid development during spermiogenesis. To further demonstrate the critical function of FBXO24 during spermiogenesis, we attempted to use the <italic>Fbxo24</italic>-HA-tagged transgenic mice to rescue spermatogenesis and fertility in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO males. As expected, we found that expression of the transgenic FBXO24 could rescue the defects in spermiogenesis and infertility observed in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO male mice <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref> and Figure S2G)</bold>, which confirmed the specific targeting of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> in the mutants and the true role of FBXO24 in spermiogenesis. Together, these data indicate that depletion of FBXO24 causes defective spermiogenesis, leading to male infertility.</p>

<title>Ablation of FBXO24 in mice causes disorganized mitochondrial sheath of spermatozoa</title>
<p>To elucidate the causes of sterility in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO males, we examined sperm count, sperm motility, and sperm morphology in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice. The results showed that the sperm count and motility were significantly reduced in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice compared with WT <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-B</xref>)</bold>. Inspiringly, we found that most of the spermatozoa in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice displayed a disorganized mitochondrial sheath and had abnormal bending of the flagella <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>). In WT spermatozoa, the midpiece connected smoothly to the principal piece; however, in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa, a gap in the midpiece can be observed <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C-D</xref>)</bold>, which may lead to an abrupt bending of the tail. In addition, we observed the midpiece length was significantly shorter in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mouse spermatozoa compared with WT (21.67 ± 1.524 μm in WT <italic>vs.</italic> 14.80 ± 3.430 μm in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO) <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>)</bold>. To better reveal spermatozoon abnormalities in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice, we decided to examine the ultrastructure of the spermatozoa using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). In WT spermatozoa, the midpiece was normally populated with many mitochondria in a spiraling fashion. However, in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa, mitochondria near the annulus were absent, resulting in a shorter mitochondrial sheath <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>)</bold>. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) further confirmed that mitochondria were not present near the annulus or neck and left apparent gaps along the mitochondrial sheath in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>)</bold>, indicating mitochondrial sheath formation was disrupted. In addition, some mitochondria in the midpiece of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa appeared large and swollen. To determine whether the failure in the assembly of the mitochondrial sheath could cause disrupted flagellar development, we examined cross-sections of the <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO sperm flagellum. In the midpiece, well-defined outer dense fibers (ODFs) and the axoneme consisting of the typical “9 + 2” microtubules were observed in WT spermatozoa, whereas the <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa displayed incomplete axonemes with missing axonemal microtubules <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>)</bold>. In the principal piece, the <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa also showed completely or partially lacking ODFs and a typical “9 + 2” microtubular structure <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>)</bold>. These severe flagellar defects may explain why <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa displayed decreased motility <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>)</bold>.</p>

<p>We next asked whether FBXO24 deletion influences the protein levels of mitochondrial and flagellum components in spermatozoa using Western blot analysis of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa. We found that the levels of MFN2 (a marker of mitochondrial fusion) and DRP1 (a marker of mitochondrial fission) were decreased in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>)</bold>. Moreover, the protein expression of ODF2, AKAP3, and TSSK4, which were directly related to the formation of the sperm tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>), were all decreased in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>).</bold> This was supported by the fact that immunofluorescence analysis of ODF2 and AKAP3 on <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO flagella showed a reduction in their fluorescent signals <bold>(Figure S3A-B)</bold>. Interestingly, we found that the level of the CUL1, a scaffold for E3 ubiquitin ligase, was also significantly reduced in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>)</bold>. Together, these results indicate that FBXO24 is critical for mitochondrial sheath formation and could modulate the protein expression levels of mitochondrial and flagellar components to maintain sperm motility.</p>

<title>The mitochondrial and chromatoid body architecture were affected in FBXO24-deficient round spermatids</title>
<p>To further explored whether the mitochondrial organelle morphology in round spermatids was affected upon FBXO24 depletion, we examined the ultrastructure of round spermatids from control and <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO testes by TEM. Notably, we found that the mitochondria displayed swollen and had abnormal central cristae in the round spermatids of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO testis <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-B</xref>)</bold>. Interestingly, we identified that the chromatoid body (CB) was structurally maintained in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO round spermatids, whereas the size was often larger than WT <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C-D</xref>)</bold>. CB was considered to have the functions in the assembly of the mitochondria during the spermiogenesis, and dysfunctional transformation of the CB in mouse spermatids could cause spermatozoa to possess a collapsed mitochondrial sheath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>), which resembled the phenotype observed in our <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice. To explore the molecular reason for the abnormal CB formation, we examined the protein expression levels of CB components in WT and <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO testes. Western blot analyses revealed that the protein level of MIWI was remarkably increased in the <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO testes compared with WT <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>)</bold>.

<title>FBXO24 depletion leads to altered gene expressions in the round spermatids</title>
<p>To further investigate the underlying molecular changes during spermatogenesis upon FBXO24 depletion in mice, we performed RNA-seq using purified round spermatids (RS) from adult <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO and WT males <bold>(Figure S4A)</bold>. A large number of genes significantly differentiated expressed in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO round spermatids, including 5368 upregulated and 4097 downregulated genes <bold>(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref></bold> and <bold>Table S1)</bold>.

<title>Loss of FBXO24 results in aberrant mRNA alternative splicing in the round spermatids</title>
<p>Since FBXO24 is mainly continued to the nucleus of the round spermatids, we speculated that FBXO24 might interact with the key splicing factors. To test this hypothesis, we performed immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) using the HA antibody to unbiasedly identify the interactome of FBXO24 in testes. The IP-MS results showed many splicing factors, such as SRSF2, SRSF3, and SRSF9, highly enriched in HA-immunoprecipitates (<bold>Table S3</bold>). Through co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays, we confirmed FBXO24 has indeed interacted with splicing factors SRSF2, SRSF3, and SRSF9 in the testes <bold>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>)</bold>. Interestingly, we found a significant decrease in SRSF2, SRSF3, and SRSF9 protein expression levels in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO testes compared to controls <bold>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B-C</xref>)</bold>. Because many alternative splicing genes related to sperm formation were affected in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO round spermatids by RNA-seq analysis <bold>(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>)</bold>, we asked if the splicing levels of corresponding exons of those genes were altered. To this end, we performed RT-PCR on purified round spermatids to verify the alternative splicing alteration. The RT-PCR results showed that many genes related to sperm formation, including mitochondria (<italic>Mfn1</italic>), flagellum (<italic>Zmynd12</italic>, <italic>Map7d1</italic>, and <italic>Bbs7</italic>), chromatin (<italic>Phf7</italic> and <italic>Kat5</italic>), acrosome (<italic>Nucb2</italic>), appeared to be significantly alternative splicing changes in their corresponding exons (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D-G</xref></bold>).

<title>FBXO24 mediates K48-linked polyubiquitination of MIWI</title>
<p>Since the ectopic expression of MIWI was found in the testes of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice, we sought to determine whether FBXO24 interacts with MIWI and affects its degradation via ubiquitination. We ectopically expressed FBXO24-mCherry in HEK293T cells, in which MIWI and CUL1 were detected in FBXO24 immunoprecipitates <bold>(<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>)</bold>, suggesting that FBXO24 could bind MIWI and CUL1 <italic>in vivo</italic>. To confirm that FBXO24 endogenously interacted with its candidates in the testes, we performed immunoprecipitation in the testis of <italic>Fbxo24</italic>-HA-tagged transgenic mice. Through co-immunoprecipitation assays, we identified that FBXO24 indeed interacts with MIWI and SCF subunits, CUL1, SKP1and RBX1. <bold>(<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>)</bold>. To further dissect the binding abilities between FBXO24 and MIWI, we examined which domain was responsible for the interaction through the truncated proteins of FBXO24, which only contain the F-box or RCC1 domain <bold>(<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>)</bold>. The immunoprecipitation results showed that both the F-box and RCC1 domains of FBXO24 could bind with MIWI <bold>(<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>)</bold>. Furthermore, we found that FBXO24 leads to a decreased level of MIWI in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting FBXO24 modulates the degradation of MIWI <bold>(<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E</xref>)</bold>. Because K48- and /or K63-linked polyubiquitination was reported to be responsible for degradation, trafficking, and phosphatase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>), we then asked which kind of modification participates in MIWI ubiquitination. The immunoblotting results showed that FBXO24 leads to the polyubiquitination of MIWI in the presence of Ub (K48) but not Ub (K63) <bold>(<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8F</xref>)</bold>. Consistently, FBXO24 contributes to the decreased expression of MIWI in a ubiquitin-dependent manner <bold>(<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8G</xref>)</bold>.

<title>FBXO24 is required for normal piRNA production in the testes</title>
<p>Because piRNAs could be loaded onto MIWI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), we next examined whether the population of piRNAs was affected in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO testes.

However, a large number of piRNAs were identified to be differentially expressed in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO testes, 463 up- and 128 down-regulated piRNAs <bold>(Figure S5B and Table S5)</bold>. After normalized with miRNA counts, the relative amount of total piRNAs was also increased in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO testes <bold>(Figure S5C)</bold>.

To assess the potential functions of the association of piRNAs to different functional gene regions, we analyzed the piRNAs mapping density of varying gene regions, including coding region (CDS), 5′ and 3′ untranslated region (UTR), and intron, as well as transposable element (TE), including retrotransposon (LTR, LINE, and SINE) and DNA transposon.

Furthermore, we analyzed the abundance and size of piRNA populations in adult <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO and WT testes. The results showed that the number of 29–31nt piRNAs were remarkably increased in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO testes compared with WT <bold>(<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9D</xref>)</bold>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we identified FBXO24 as a testis-enriched F-box protein conserved in mammals and highly expressed in the round spermatids and elongating spermatids. To define its biological roles <italic>in vivo</italic>, we generated genetically engineered <italic>Fbxo24</italic> knockout and <italic>Fbxo24</italic> HA-tagged knock-in mouse models. Our functional study demonstrated that FBXO24 is essential for spermiogenesis and piRNA production. FBXO24 deficiency leads to remarkable histone retention and the disruption of histone-to-protamine transition in the mature sperm. A growing number of studies have demonstrated impaired chromatin condensation can cause nuclear damages as DNA denaturation or fragmentation often associated with male infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). The molecular basis of nuclear condensation is related to key events such as the expression of testis-specific histone variants, post-translational modifications of histones, and transient DNA strand breaks. Indeed, we found that, in the current study, FBXO24 could modulate the homeostasis of PHF7, TSSK6, and RNF8, which are related to the histone-to-protamine transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the abnormalities of mitochondrial sheaths are observed in infertile men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>), the key proteins implicated in sperm mitochondrial sheath formation largely remain unclear due to a lack of good animal models with the typical phenotype. Notably, we found that the round spermatids and spermatozoon of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice have impaired mitochondrial architecture, with mitochondrial size heterogeneity and a more open structure of the mitochondria with less crista. Using MitoTracker staining and an electron microscope, we demonstrated the mitochondrial structure is severely disrupted in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa. Previous studies showed abnormalities of the annulus (<italic>Sept4</italic> and <italic>Sept12</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>), and chromatid bodies (<italic>Tssk1</italic> and <italic>Tssk2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>) can disrupt abnormal mitochondrial coiling. Similarly, the current study revealed that <italic>Fbxo24</italic> regulates spatiotemporal mitochondrial dynamics during spermiogenesis. Our study identified FBXO24 might serve as a critical protein in regulating sperm mitochondrial sheath formation, which expands the knowledge of sperm mitochondria formation. In addition, we found that FBXO24 is indispensable for proper flagellum formation, such as axoneme and ODFs. Therefore, the reduction of sperm motility of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO male mice observed in this study might attribute to the uncompleted mitochondrial formation of the middle piece and defective flagellum assembling.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that the RNA-seq data of the round spermatids showed that FBXO24 ablation leads to dysregulation in the mRNA expression of many genes related to chromatin, mitochondria, and flagellum, indicating the comprehensive mRNA alternative splicing programs in round spermatids were susceptible to ablation of FBXO24. Combined with our immunoprecipitation assays provided evidence of molecular interactions between FBXO24 and the key splice factors (SRSF2, SRSF3, and SRSF9), it is reasonable to infer that dysregulation of these splicing factors inevitably would lead to more splicing errors in their target genes, thus amplifying the initial adverse effects and generating a vicious circle of aberrant splicing. Of note, many genetic changes identified in this study have been closely associated with spermatogenesis. For example, <italic>Zmynd12</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), <italic>Bbs7</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), and <italic>Ube2j2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>) were required for flagellum function and male fertility. <italic>Map7d1</italic> facilitates microtubule stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>) and <italic>Mfn1</italic> deficiency leads to defects in mitochondrial activity and male infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). <italic>Phf7</italic> modulates BRDT stability and histone-to-protamine exchange during spermiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). <italic>Kat5</italic> encodes an essential lysine acetyltransferase, which is involved in regulating gene expression and chromatin remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). <italic>Nucb2</italic> suppresses the acrosome reaction in sperm within the mouse epididymis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Therefore, our study, for the first time, provides evidence that FBXO24 interacts with the splicing factors in round spermatids to regulate the alternative splicing of mRNA involved in round spermatid development during spermiogenesis. However, the exact regulatory mechanism of how FBXO24 facilitates the mRNA alternative splicing needs further study.</p>
<p>In addition to modulating alternative splicing, we demonstrated that FBXO24 is a novel E3 ligase that can mediate the K48-linked ubiquitination of MIWI. FBXO24 deletion results in the increase of MIWI and piRNA production in the testes. A previous study showed the ubiquitination of MIWI through the APC/C-26S proteasome pathway <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). In the current study, we identified that testis-enriched FBXO24 could interact with MIWI and mediate MIWI degradation, which provides new insight into MIWI degradation during spermiogenesis. MIWI and piRNAs are highly abundant in round spermatids, but their levels start to decline normally in elongating spermatids and are completely eliminated in matured sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Overexpression of a piRNA cluster in the mouse genome can reduce the expression of mRNA required for spermatogenesis, leading to male infertility. Interestingly, our small RNA-seq results showed FBXO24 deficiency does not have a significant impact on piRNA mapping. However, the level of 29–31nt piRNA was remarkably increased in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO testes. Previous studies revealed that MIWI-bound piRNA could cause mRNA decay in the testes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>), which raises a possibility that piRNA-related transcriptional repression in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO testes might contribute to the reduction of mature sperm in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice.</p>
<p>In summary, we discovered that FBXO24 is essential for mitochondrial organization and chromatin condensation in the spermatozoa. Our results disclose FBXO24 interacts with splicing factors to regulate the mRNA splicing of some essential genes required to spermiogenesis (<bold><xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref></bold>).

<p>In summary, our study revealed a novel role for FBXO24 in controlling mRNA alternative splicing of round spermatids and MIWI/piRNA pathway and demonstrated that FBXO24 is required for mitochondrial organization and chromatin condensation in mouse spermatozoa. Importantly, our results disclosed FBXO24 interacts with splicing factors to regulate the mRNA splicing of some essential genes required for spermiogenesis, which probably functionally connects the dysregulation of genes involved in mitochondria migration and histone removal during spermiogenesis (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>). We further demonstrated FBXO24 interplays with the subunits of the SCF complex and mediated MIWI degradation via K48-linked polyubiquitination. This study extensively expands our understanding of the mechanistic explanation of FBXO24 for the regulation of spermiogenesis.</p>

<title>Generation of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> mutant mice</title>
<p><italic>Fbxo24</italic> knockout (KO) mice were generated by CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Briefly, the two pairs of single-guided RNAs (sgRNAs) with the sequence sgRNA-1: 5’-TGTGGAGGCGCATCTGTCGAAGG-3’ and sgRNA-2 5’-GTCAAAGACTTGGTCGCCCTAGG-3’ were designed for targeting for the third exon of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> gene. The sgRNAs were injected into the pronuclei of fertilized eggs, and the 2-cell stage embryos were transferred into the oviducts of pseudopregnant C57BL/6J females in the next day to generate <italic>Fbxo24</italic> mutant founder mice (F0). The F1 <italic>Fbxo24</italic> heterozygous mice were produced by crossing the F0 founder mice with WT mice and further intercrossed F1 to obtain <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice carrying an 82-bp deletion in exon 3 of the <italic>Fbxo24</italic> gene. A 197-bp band as the wild-type (WT) allele and a 115-bp band as the deleted allele were designed for genotyping by PCR amplification. The primers used are listed in <bold>Table S7</bold>.</p>

<title>Generation of <italic>Fbxo24</italic>-HA Tagged knock-in (KI) mice</title>
<p><italic>Fbxo24</italic>-HA-tagged KI mice were also generated by CRISPR/Cas9 technology and haploid embryonic stem cell microinjection. The sgRNAs of the C-terminus of the target gene <italic>Fbxo24</italic> (AAGAAGAGGGGTTCAGCTCT) were synthesized, annealed, and ligated to the pX330-mCherry plasmid. For the construction of the HA-tag KI DNA donor, the sequences encoding the left homologous arm, the HA tag, and the right homologous arm were amplified and ligated to the linear pMD19T. DKO-AG-haESCs were transfected with CRISPR-Cas9 plasmid and HA tag KI DNA donor. At 24 h after transfection, the mCherry-positive haploid cells were enriched. In 7–8 days after plating, single colonies were picked up, and positive colonies for the HA tag were selected by genomic DNA PCR amplification for Sanger sequencing. DKO-AG-haESCs with <italic>Fbxo24</italic>-C-HA were arrested in M-phase by culturing in a medium containing 0.05 μg/ml demecolcine for 10 h and then used for intracytoplasmic injection as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Intracytoplasmic AG-haESC injection (ICAHCI) embryos were cultured in KSOM medium for 24 h to reach the two-cell stage. 15–20 two-cell embryos were transferred into each oviduct of pseudo-pregnant females to produce <italic>Fbxo24</italic>-C-HA semi-cloned mice (F0). Then, the F0 female mice were crossed with WT male mice to generate heterozygous <italic>Fbxo24</italic>-C-HA F1 male mice for the experiments.</p>

<title>Western blot</title>
<p>Fresh mouse adult testes or HEK293T cells were collected, and proteins were extracted by using RIPA buffer (Beyotime, P0013J). In total, 40 μg of protein lysates were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad) and the membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat milk (blocking solution) for 1 h. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C after blocking. The membranes were washed with TBST three times and then incubated with a secondary antibody for 1 h before using Luminol/enhancer solution and Peroxide solution (ClarityTM Western ECL Substrate, Bio-Rad).</p>

<title>Immunoprecipitation (IP) assays</title>
<p>For testis tissue IP experiments, the testes were dissected and lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (Beyotime, P0013J), clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g, and then pre-cleared with anti-HA nanobody agarose beads (AlpaLife, ktsm1305). The lysate was incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C on a rotator and conjugated with anti-HA beads. The beads were washed with IP buffer and then boiled in 2× SDS loading buffer for western blotting analysis.</p>
<p>For cell line IP experiments, the HEK293T cells were transfected with indicated plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies). After 48 h, immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). 25 μl mCherry-Trap bead 50% slurry (AlpaLife, ktsm1331) was used and all wash steps were performed with washing buffer (10mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, 150mM NaCl, 0.5mM EDTA). mCherry-Trap beads were washed with dilution buffer prior to addition to the cell lysate. Beads were incubated with cell lysate at 4°C for 2 h following another wash step. To elute the proteins from the beads, 40 μl sample buffer (120 mM Tris-HCl pH=6.8, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 0.04% Bromophenol blue, 10% β-mercaptoehanol) was added and boiled at 95°C for 5 min. mCherry-tagged proteins were detected by western blotting using an anti-mCherry antibody.</p>

<title>Spermatogenic cell isolation</title>
<p>Spermatogenic cells were isolated from the whole mouse testis using the STA-PUT method described previously with slight modifications(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). In brief, testes were collected from 8-week-old mice WT and <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice and decapsulated with collagenase treatment to remove Leydig cells. The dispersed seminiferous tubules were then digested with trypsin and DNase I to single-cell suspensions. Next, Sertoli cells were separated from germ cells by filtration through a 40 mm cell strainer and by adhesion to lectin-coated culture plates. Different germ cell populations were separated using a manually prepared 0.5–5% discontinuous BSA density gradient for velocity sedimentation sediment.

<title>RNA isolation and quantitative qPCR</title>
<p>Total RNAs were extracted from purified germ cell fractions using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s procedure. The purity and concentration of RNA samples were determined using a Nanodrop ND-2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). Reverse transcriptional reactions contained 500 ng of purified total RNA using a PrimeScript RT reagent kit with gDNA Eraser (Takara) to remove the DNA contamination. RT-qPCR was performed with SYBR green master mix (Takara) on the ABI Step One System (Applied Biosystems) according to manufactures’ instructions.

<p>This study provides <bold>valuable</bold> insight into the role of FBXO24, a member of the less characterized F-Box protein subfamily (F-box only protein) in controlling mRNA expression during spermiogenesis using loss-of-function and HA-tagged knock-in mouse models. The major strengths of the study are the rigorous phenotypic and molecular analysis by using two complementary animal models (knock-out mouse model but also HA-tagged transgenic mouse model) to determine protein levels and localization in time and space during normal spermatogenesis and in the absence of the protein.

<p>In this study, Li et al., report that FBXO24 contributes to sperm development by modulating alternative mRNA splicing and MIWI degradation during spermiogenesis. The authors demonstrated that FBXO24 deficiency impairs sperm head formation, midpiece compartmentalization, and axonemal/peri-axonemal organization in mature sperm, which causes sperm motility defects and male infertility. In addition, FBXO24 interacts with various mRNA splicing factors, which causes altered splicing events in Fbxo24-null round spermatids. Interestingly, FBXO24 also modulates MIWI levels via its polyubiquitination in round spermatids. Thus, the authors address that FBXO24 modulates global mRNA levels by regulating piRNA-mediated MIWI function and splicing events in testicular haploid germ cells.</p>
<p>This study is performed with various experimental approaches to explore and elucidate underlying molecular mechanisms for the FBXO24-mediated sperm defects during germ cell development. Overall, the experiments were designed properly and performed well to support the authors' observation in each part. In addition, the finding in this study is useful for understanding the physiological and developmental significance of the FBXO24 in the male germ line, which can provide insight into impaired sperm development and male infertility. However, there are several concerns to be explained more in this study. In addition, some results should be revised and updated.</p>

<p>Spermatogenesis is a process of cell differentiation necessary to produce fertile spermatozoa. It consists of three parts, the last of which is called spermiogenesis, in which the size, shape, and organelle composition of the spermatids undergo significant changes that result in the formation of fully elongated spermatozoa. Defects in spermatogenesis or spermiogenesis can lead to male infertility. In this study, Li et al. identified FBXO24 as a highly expressed protein in human and mouse testis that is required for modulating alternative gene splicing in round spermatids through interaction with various splicing factors. They also found that deletion of FBXO24 in mice results in disorganized mitochondrial packing along the midpiece of the tail and chromatoid body architecture, which may account for the observed male sterility. The authors discovered that FBXO24 interacts with the subunits of MIWI and SCF and is required for normal piRNA biogenesis.</p>
<p>The major strengths of the study are the rigorous phenotypic and molecular analysis by using two complementary animal models (knock-out mouse model but also HA-tagged transgenic mouse model) to pinpoint the protein levels and localization in time and space during normal spermatogenesis and when the protein is absent.</p>
<p>The minor weakness of the study is inconsistent use of terminology throughout the manuscript, occasional logic-jump in their flow, and missing detailed description in methodologies used either in the text or Materials and Methods section, which can be easily rectified.</p>
<p>Overall, this study highlights the relevance and importance of FBXO24 in male fertility and provides a better understanding of the MIWI/piRNA pathway, mitochondrial organization, and chromatin condensation in mouse spermatozoa during spermiogenesis.</p>

<p>This work is carried out by the research group led by Shuiqiao Yuan, who has a long interest in and significant contribution to the field of male germ cell development. The authors study a protein for which limited information existed prior to this work, a component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, FBXO24. The authors generated the first FBXO24 KO mouse model reported in the literature using CRISPR, which they complement with HA-tagged FBXO24 transgenic model in the KO background. The authors begin their study with a very careful examination of the expression pattern of the FBXO24 gene at the level of mRNA and the HA-tagged transgene, and they provide conclusive evidence that the protein is expressed exclusively in the mouse testis and specifically in post-meiotic spermatids of stages VI to IX, which include early stages of spermatid elongation and nuclear condensation. The authors report a fully sterile phenotype for male mice, while female mice are normal. Interestingly, the testis size and the populations of spermatogenic cells in the KO mutant mice show a small (but significant) reduction compared to the WT testis. Importantly, the mature sperm from KO animals show a series of defects that were very thoroughly documented in this work by scanning and transmission electron microscopy; this data constitutes a very strong point in this paper. FBXO24 KO sperm have severe defects in the mitochondrial sheath with missing mitochondria near the annulus, and missing outer dense fibers. Collectively these defects cause abnormal bending of the flagellum and severely reduced sperm motility. Moreover, defects in nuclear condensation are observed with faint nuclear staining of elongating and elongated spermatids, and reduction of protein levels of protamine 2 combined with increased levels of histones and transition protein 1. All of the above are in line with the observed male sterility phenotype.</p>
<p>The authors also performed RNAseq in the KO animal, and found profound changes in the abundance of thousands of mRNAs; and changes in mRNA splicing patterns as well. The data reveal deeply affected gene expression patterns in the FBXO24 KO testis, which further supports the essential role that this factor serves in spermiogenesis. Unfortunately, a molecular explanation of what causes these changes is missing; it is still possible that they are an indirect consequence of the KO and not directly caused by the KO.</p>
<p>A well-reasoned narrative on if and how the absence of FBXO24 as an E3 ubiquitin ligase is responsible for the observed mRNA and protein differential expression is missing. If FBXO24-mediated ubiquitination is required for normal protein degradation during spermiogenesis, protein level increase should be the direct consequence of genuine FBXO24 targets in the KO testis. Importantly, besides the Miwi ubiquitination experiment which is performed in a heterologous and therefore may not be ideal for extracting conclusions, the possible involvement of ubiquitination was not shown for any other proteins that the authors found that interact with FBXO24. For example splicing factors SRSF2, SRSF3, SRSF9, or any of the other proteins whose levels were found to be changed (reduced, thus the change in the KO is less likely due to the absence of ubiquitination) such as ODF2, AKAP3, TSSK4, PHF7, TSSK6, and RNF8. Interestingly, the authors do observe increased amounts of histones and transition proteins, but reduced amounts of protamines, which directly shows that histone to protamine transition is indeed affected in the FBXO24 KO testis, and is in agreement with the observed less condensed nuclei of spermatozoa. Could histones and transition proteins be targets of the proposed ubiquitin ligase activity of FBXO24, and in its absence, histone replacement is abrogated? Providing experimental evidence to address this possibility would greatly expand our understanding of why FBXO24 is essential during spermiogenesis.</p>
<p>Regarding the results on Miwi protein and piRNAs, the following remarks can be made:</p>
<p>The finding that the Miwi protein is upregulated is an important point in this work, and it is in agreement with the observed increased size of the chromatoid body, where most of the Miwi protein is accumulated in round spermatids. This finding needs to be further supported and verified with experiments done in WT and KO mice. Miwi should be immunoprecipitated and Miwi ubiquitination should be detected (with WB or mass spec) in WT testis. It should be expected that Miwi ubiquitination is reduced in KO testis. The experiments that the authors performed in HEK293T cells are informative but experiments with tissue/cells normally expressing Miwi and FBXO24 are missing. With regard to piRNA expression, it is an exaggeration to call the observed increase in piRNA expression remarkable, especially since one replicate small RNA library per condition was sequenced. Although the library is constructed from total small RNA (which includes Mili-bound piRNAs as well), it does seem that the upregulated piRNAs are Miwi-bound piRNAs because the size of the upregulated piRNAs is mostly 29-32 bases. However, the direct comparison of the number of upregulated piRNAs with upregulated miRNAs is not in support of the claim that the increase in piRNA expression is higher compared to miRNAs: there are approximately a few hundred miRNAs expressed in mice, but hundreds of thousands of different piRNA sequences, so upregulation of ~10 times more piRNA species than miRNAs is a smaller proportional increase. Moreover, the observed increase in the overall piRNA levels could be just an epiphenomenon of the increased abundance of the Miwi protein; it has been documented that Piwi proteins stabilize their piRNA cargo, so most likely the increase in iRNA levels in 29-32 nt sizes is probably not a result of altered biogenesis, but increased half-life of the piRNAs as a result of Miwi upregulation. Therefore, the claim that FBXO24 is essential for piRNA biogenesis/production (lines 308, 314) is not appropriately supported.</p>
