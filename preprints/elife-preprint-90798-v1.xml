<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Certain bacteria demonstrate the ability to target and colonize the tumor microenvironment, a characteristic that positions them as innovative carriers for delivering various therapeutic agents in cancer therapy. Nevertheless, our understanding of how bacteria adapt their physiological condition to the tumor microenvironment remains elusive. In this work, we employed liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to examine the proteome of <italic>E. coli</italic> colonized in murine tumors. Comparing to <italic>E. coli</italic> cultivated in the rich medium, we found that <italic>E. coli</italic> colonized in tumors notably upregulated the processes related to ferric ions, including the enterobactin biosynthesis and iron homeostasis. This finding indicated that the tumor is an iron-deficient environment to <italic>E. coli</italic>. We also found that the colonization of <italic>E. coli</italic> in the tumor led to an increased expression of lipocalin 2 (LCN2), a host’s protein that can sequester the enterobactin. We therefore engineered <italic>E. coli</italic> in order to evade the nutritional immunity provided by LCN2. By introducing the IroA cluster, the <italic>E. coli</italic> synthesizes the glycosylated enterobactin, which creates steric hindrance to avoid the LCN2 sequestration. The IroA-<italic>E. coli</italic> showed enhanced resistance to LCN2 and significantly improved the anti-tumor activity in mice. Moreover, the mice cured by the IroA-<italic>E. coli</italic> treatment became resistant to the tumor re-challenge, indicating the establishment of immunological memory. Overall, our study underscores the crucial role of bacteria’s ability to acquire ferric ions within the tumor microenvironment for effective cancer therapy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Bacterial therapy has re-emerged as a promising modality for cancer treatment, building on the pioneering works of William Coley in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Carlson et al. 2020</xref>). As a living therapeutic agent, bacteria offer several advantages over traditional cancer treatments, including (1) active tumor targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Yamamoto et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kim et al. 2023</xref>), (2) tumor colonization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Westphal et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Weibel et al. 2008</xref>), (3) immune system stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Qiu et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Yang et al. 2023</xref>), and (4) great engineerability for customized functionalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Gurbatri et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hu et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Canale et al. 2021</xref>). The tumor microenvironment (TME) provides unique cues, such as hypoxia, low pH values, and immune suppressors, which facilitate the selective targeting and colonization of certain bacteria, including <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ryan et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Flentie et al. 2012</xref>). However, the restricted resource in the TME may also pose challenges for bacterial survival and growth, potentially limiting their anti-tumor efficacy. While the molecular physiology of <italic>E. coli</italic> has been extensively studied under well-controlled laboratory conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Han and Lee 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Mateus et al. 2020</xref>), such as rich medium or minimal medium, it is still unclear how <italic>E. coli</italic> adapts to the nutrition-limited and immune-responsive environment in tumors. An in-depth understanding of the intricate relationship between the TME and the adaptation of colonized bacteria may provide hints to unlock the full potential of bacterial therapy against cancers.</p>
<p>It is well-established that the innate and adaptive immunity are sequentially activated upon bacterial infection in humans. However, even before the innate immune response commences, a critical defense mechanism known as “nutritional immunity” serves as the first line of protection to hinder the bacterial infection. Nutritional immunity is employed by the host organism through restricting the availability of essential nutrients to the invading pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Weinberg 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Murdoch and Skaar 2022</xref>). For examples, humans have evolved specialized proteins to chelate several trace minerals, such as iron, zinc, and manganese, keeping their free-form concentrations at very low level within the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Andrews and Schmidt 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Kambe et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Roth et al. 2013</xref>). In response, pathogens have counter-evolved mechanisms to evade the nutritional immunity. For instance, a variety of siderophores are developed by bacteria in order to acquire the ferric ions from the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kramer et al. 2020</xref>). Intriguingly, humans have further retaliated by evolving the antimicrobial proteins, such as lipocalin 2 (LCN2), that sequester the siderophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Singh et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bachman et al. 2009</xref>). These co-evolutionary events highlight the importance of nutritional immunity in combating bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Golonka et al. 2019</xref>). Previous studies on bacterial cancer therapy have often overlooked the role of nutritional immunity, potentially resulting in suboptimal therapeutic efficacy.</p>
<p>In this work, we aimed to understand how bacteria modulate their physiological states at the molecular level in response to the tumor microenvironment. We employed liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for a quantitative comparison of the proteome between <italic>E. coli</italic> cultured in nutrient-rich medium and <italic>E. coli</italic> colonized in tumors. We found that <italic>E. coli</italic> colonized in tumors dramatically increases the protein expressions involving in the enterobactin biosynthesis and the iron ion homeostasis. This finding suggested that <italic>E. coli</italic> was stressed in an iron-deficient environment. Driven by this discovery, we hypothesized that enhancing the iron acquisition ability of <italic>E. coli</italic> might potentially improve its anti-tumor activity. We engineered <italic>E. coli</italic> as a potent iron scavenger by introducing LCN2 blockades, such as cyclic-di-GMP or glycosylated enterobactin. The engineered bacteria successfully evaded the nutritional immunity and achieved superior anti-tumor activity with frequent complete remission in mouse models.</p>

<title>Tumor is an iron-deficient microenvironment for bacterial colonization</title>
<p>While many bacteria are known to colonize and proliferate in the TME, it remains elusive how bacteria adapt to such a nutrition-limited environment as compared to a nutrition-rich one. To this end, we performed quantitative LC-MS/MS experiments to compare the proteome of <italic>E. coli</italic> colonized in the murine tumors or cultured in the rich medium (LB broth) (Fig. S1). Not surprisingly, there are many more proteins enriched in the rich medium than in the tumor condition. The Venn diagram and the volcano blot revealed hundreds of protein IDs enriched in the rich medium condition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a, 1b</xref>, Table S1). The Gene Ontology(GO)-term analysis revealed that many of these proteins are associated with the machineries of biosynthetic processes, cell division, and energy production (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>), reflecting that the <italic>E. coli</italic> was under a highly proliferative state in the rich medium. Interestingly, there were also 71 proteins that were preferentially expressed in the tumor condition over the rich medium condition. The GO-term analysis and the hierarchical clustering revealed that many of these proteins are involved in the processes of enterobactin synthesis and iron ion homeostasis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d, 1e</xref>, and Fig. S2). <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref> showed that the individual proteins in these two processes were markedly up-regulated in the tumor condition. These proteins are known to be tightly controlled by the iron sensing system in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and only become up-regulated under the stress of iron deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Seo et al. 2014</xref>). It is worth mentioning that while enterobactin facilitates the uptake of ferric ions into bacteria, the host immune cells can counteract by secreting a protein called LCN2, which possesses a specialized pocket to bind and sequester enterobactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Fischbach et al. 2006</xref>). To investigate this possibility, we employed LC-MS/MS and analyzed the LCN2 expression in the tumors with or without <italic>E. coli</italic> colonization. Indeed, we observed a significant up-regulation of LCN2 expression in the tumors with <italic>E. coli</italic> inoculation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref>). Collectively, our data suggest that tumor is an iron-deficient environment for <italic>E. coli</italic> colonization.</p>

<title>Cyclic-di-GMP-producing <italic>E. coli</italic> synergizes with iron chelators for cancer therapy</title>
<p>Based on the proteomic findings, we aimed to focus our therapeutic strategies on modulating the iron competition between bacteria and cancer cells in the tumor. First, we hypothesize that an iron chelator that lowers the effective pool concentration of iron may provide a selection pressure, which disfavors the growth of cancer cells over bacteria. We tested three iron chelators, deferoxamine, ciclopirox, and VLX600, which have been approved for clinical trials or medical applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Lang et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Qi et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Fryknas et al. 2016</xref>). All three chelators showed high cytotoxicity toward the cancer cells, suggesting the essential role of irons for the survival of mammalian cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2a</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>E. coli</italic> can better tolerate these iron chelators at relatively high concentrations. Among them, VLX600 was the most potent drug against the cancer cells (IC50 = 0.33 μM) and provided the largest therapeutic window (280-fold difference) between the cancer cells and <italic>E. coli</italic>. In addition to the iron chelator, we also attempted to find approaches for counteracting the enterobactin sequestering function of LCN2. It has been reported that cyclic di-GMP (CDG) can block the binding between LCN2 and enterobactin, therefore restoring the functionality of enterobactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Li et al. 2015</xref>). We engineered the <italic>E. coli</italic> by introducing a plasmid that carries the gene of diguanylate cyclase (DGC), an enzyme responsible for catalyzing the biosynthesis of cyclic di-GMP (CDG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Lv et al. 2019</xref>). We showed that the <italic>E. coli</italic> transformed with the DGC plasmid (hereafter referred to DGC-<italic>E. coli</italic>) actively synthesized CDG and secreted it into the supernatant as detected by the LC/MS-MS mass spectrometry (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). It is worth noting that CDG is also a potent ligand for the STING pathway, which may stimulate the anti-tumor immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Diner et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Krasteva and Sondermann 2017</xref>). When applying the DGC-<italic>E. coli</italic> supernatant to the macrophages, the macrophages enhanced the IFN-β secretion, suggesting the activation of the STING pathway by CDG (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p>

<p>We evaluated the anti-tumor activity of VLX600 and DGC-<italic>E. coli</italic> in a syngeneic mouse model. The MC38 tumor-bearing mice received VLX600 and/or DGC-<italic>E. coli</italic> as depicted in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>. The VLX600 monotherapy only marginally suppressed the tumor growth as compared to the PBS control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). The DGC-<italic>E. coli</italic> monotherapy, although inhibited the tumor progression to a certain degree, did not show superior efficacy than the wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> without the DGC plasmid transformation. Strikingly, the combination of DGC-<italic>E. coli</italic> and VLX600 showed significantly improved efficacy as compared to the individual mono-therapies. The tumor sizes were greatly suppressed, and two out of the four mice achieved complete remission (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2f</xref>). Of note, the combination of the wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> and VLX600 did not result in such an improved activity, suggesting the syngeneic interaction of CDG and VLX600. Finally, when the mice cured by the combinatorial therapy were rechallenged by the same cancer cell line, no tumor developments were observed (Fig. S3), suggesting the establishment of a durable anti-cancer immunological memory in these mice.</p>

<title>Salmochelin-secreting <italic>E. coli</italic> significantly impeded tumor growth</title>
<p>Encouraged by the results shown above, we sought to engineer <italic>E. coli</italic> into a more potent iron scavenger and avoid the usage of iron chelators due to the potential systemic toxicity. Because CDG binds LCN2 with a relatively weak affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 1.6 μM), it can only partially sequester LCN2 even using a very high concentration (Fig. S4). Alternatively, bacteria have evolved another strategy, known as glycosylated enterobactin or salmochelin, to escape from the LCN2 blockade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Fischbach et al. 2006</xref>). Some pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> strains carry a gene cluster called IroA, which consists 5 genes to perform enterobactin glycosylation and its downstream uptake and processing. The sugars on the enterobactin create steric hindrance to the LCN2 pocket, therefore completely abolishing the LCN2 binding. To investigate this effect, we cloned the IroA cluster into a plasmid and transformed it into a non-IroA-carrying <italic>E. coli</italic> strain BL21(DE3). We incubated the <italic>E. coli</italic> with varying concentrations of LCN2 and measured their viability by colony formation assay. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref> showed that the <italic>E. coli</italic> without the IroA plasmid transformation (referred as WT-<italic>E. coli</italic>) was sensitive to LCN2, whereas the <italic>E. coli</italic> transformed with the IroA plasmid (referred as IroA-<italic>E. coli</italic>) was significantly more resistant to LCN2. The IroA-<italic>E. coli</italic> also showed stronger potency in acquisition of the ferric ions than the WT-<italic>E</italic>. coli, presumably due to the expression IroN, a member of the IroA cluster in charge of transporting both non-glycosylated and glycosylated enterobactin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). In line with this observation, we found that the enterobactin (including the glycosylated form) extracted from the IroA-<italic>E. coli</italic> was more cytotoxic to the cancer cells than that extracted from the WT <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). In the mouse tumor experiments, the IroA-<italic>E. coli</italic> was significantly more efficacious than the WT-<italic>E. coli</italic>. Six out of ten mice treated by IroA-<italic>E. coli</italic> achieved complete remission, while none of the mice treated by the WT-<italic>E. coli</italic> experienced a cure (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d-3f</xref>). Overall, we showed that the IroA cluster equips <italic>E. coli</italic> with an effective iron-scavenging capability, exerting a potent anti-tumor effect in the LCN2-rich tumor microenvironment.</p>

<title>IroA<italic>-E. coli</italic> is less iron-deficient than WT-<italic>E</italic>. coli in the tumor microenvironment</title>
<p>Because the salmochelin secreted by IroA-<italic>E. coli</italic> is resistant to the sequestration of LCN2, we speculated that IroA-<italic>E. coli</italic> could have ameliorated the iron deficiency problem in the TME. To verify this speculation, we quantitatively compared the proteome of WT-<italic>E. coli</italic> and IroA-<italic>E. coli</italic> colonized in the tumors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). The GO-term analysis revealed that the many proteins enriched in WT-<italic>E. coli</italic> belong to the enterobactin biosynthesis process and the iron homeostasis. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref> showed the fold changes of the individual proteins in these two terms. Strikingly, all of these proteins were expressed much higher in WT-<italic>E. coli</italic> than in IroA-<italic>E. coli</italic>. These results suggested that IroA-<italic>E. coli</italic> was less stressed by the iron deficient environment in the TME, presumably due to its superior iron scavenging ability from the glycosylated enterobactin. Besides the proteome of <italic>E. coli</italic>, we also examined the proteome changes in the host cells. We found that two iron-related proteins in mice, transferrin and transferring receptor, were elevated in the IroA-<italic>E. coli</italic> treatment as compared to the WT-<italic>E. coli</italic> treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). These two proteins are known to up-regulate when the cells sense a lack of iron in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ponka and Lok 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Theil 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ponka et al. 2015</xref>). Our finding suggests a competitive scenario between the host cells and <italic>E. coli</italic> where the potent acquisition of ferric ion by IroA-<italic>E. coli</italic> posed an iron-deficient stress to the host cells.</p>

<title>Iron-scavenging IroA<italic>-E. coli</italic> significantly enhanced CD8+ T cell-mediated antitumor activity</title>
<p>Given that the IroA-<italic>E. coli</italic> treatment achieved long-term remission, we sought to investigate whether it also triggered the immunological memory against cancers. We re-challenged the mice cured by IroA-<italic>E. coli</italic> with the same cancer cell line (MC38) and found no tumors were able to develop (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>), indicating a long-term anti-cancer memory has been established in these mice. Furthermore, we analyzed the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the mice treated by PBS, WT-<italic>E. coli</italic>, IroA-<italic>E. coli</italic>, respectively. We found that the TILs, especially the CD8+ T cells, were significantly elevated in the IroA-<italic>E. coli</italic> group (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). Given these observations, we speculated that the adaptive immune system might have contributed to the anti-tumor activity of the IroA-<italic>E. coli</italic> treatment to certain degrees. To verify this speculation, we performed the CD8+ T-cell depletion experiments in mice. We found that, indeed, the anti-tumor activity of IroA-<italic>E. coli</italic> was partially weakened in the mice treated with the anti-CD8 depletion antibody, and no long-term remission was achieved in these mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). Of note, the tumor progression was still significantly impeded under the CD8 depletion condition, indicating the inherent anti-tumor activity of IroA-<italic>E. coli</italic> still existed. Our findings suggest that the iron scavenging from IroA-<italic>E. coli</italic> may result in cancer cell deaths and tumor antigen releases, which in turn activate the adaptive immune cells for further cancer cell eradication.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>There are accumulating studies that apply bacteria as drug delivery vehicles for cancer therapy with various payloads, including toxins, cytokines, immune checkpoint inhibitors, etc. However, in order to optimize the therapeutic outcomes of these engineering endeavors, it is also very important to understand the bacterial adaptation in the TME. The growth conditions differ vastly between the <italic>in vitro</italic> cultivation and the intratumoral environments. The rich medium provides ample nutrients for the optimal bacterial growth and payload production, whereas tumor is a nutrient-deprived, acidic, and hypoxic environment, which may stress the bacteria and restraint the engineered functionality. Also, unlike the <italic>in vitro</italic> cultivation, bacteria face the competition from the cancer cells as well as the surveillance from the host’s immune system. This work provides the first proteomic data comparing <italic>E. coli</italic> cultured in the rich medium and colonized in the mouse tumor. The results clearly show that the TME is an iron-deficient environment for <italic>E. coli</italic>. Moreover, upon the bacterial inoculation, the host cells up-regulate LCN2 to further block the iron uptake of <italic>E. coli</italic> by enterobactin. This observation inspired us to develop <italic>E. coli</italic> that overcame the nutritional immunity from the host. This discovery-driven design, especially the IroA implementation, proves to be highly effective in enhancing the anti-tumor activity of <italic>E. coli</italic>. It is of interest to investigate that if the iron uptake ability is also critical for other types of bacteria when applied in cancer therapy.</p>
<p>In addition to the enterobactin biosynthetic process and the iron ion homeostasis, our proteomic data also revealed other insights into the key nutrients whose scarcity within the TME may impede the bacterial growth. For examples, the proteins involving “the <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of IMP” are highly enriched in the <italic>E. coli</italic> grown in tumors compared to the rich medium condition. Inosine phosphate (IMP) is the precursor of purine. When the environment is deficient of purine, the bacteria need to synthesize them using <italic>de novo</italic> pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Rolfes and Zalkin 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cho et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Meng et al. 1990</xref>). A previous report by Samant et al. has shown that the genes associated with the <italic>de novo</italic> purine synthesis are the most critical factors for the growth of <italic>E. coli</italic> or other gram-negative bacteria in human serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Samant et al. 2008</xref>). Their data indicate that, similar to iron, humans also control the purine at a very low level in blood as a strategy of nutritional immunity in order to restraint the proliferation of bacteria. In light of these findings, one potential avenue could involve engineering <italic>E. coli</italic> to bolster its ability for <italic>de novo</italic> nucleotide biosynthesis, therefore facilitating better adaptation to the TME. Given that bacteria and cancer cells vie for growths within the TME, an enhanced bacterial adaptation to the TME may potentially improve the anti-tumor activity.</p>
<p>Overall, our research revealed that the tug of war for iron plays a critical role when applying bacteria for cancer therapy. To aid the bacteria in this war, we have adopted several approaches, including the engineering of <italic>E. coli</italic> to secret cyclic-di-GMP and salmochelin. These methods have demonstrated effectiveness in treating murine tumors, resulting in a significant portion of complete remission. Notably, the cured mice have also established durable anti-tumor immunological memory. Our iron-scavenging strategy opens new avenues by overcoming the nutritional immunity hurdles in the realm of bacteria-based cancer therapy.</p>

<title>Mouse experiments</title>
<p>All animal experiments were conducted under specific pathogen-free conditions according to the guidelines approved by the Animal Care and Usage Committee of Academia Sinica. Mice were housed at temperature of 19-23□ with a 12-hour light-dark cycle and a humidity of 50-60%. A maximum of five mice were housed in a single individually ventilated cage with soft wood for nesting. Tumor dimensions were measured using a caliper, and tumor volume was calculated using the following formula: 0.52 x ((tumor length + tumor width)/2)<sup>3</sup>. Mice aged 6-10 weeks were subcutaneously injected with 5 × 10□ MC38 murine colon cancer cells suspended in 100 μL PBS at the right flank. The <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain BL21(DE3) was cultured in LB medium at 37□ overnight. The overnight cultures were diluted 100-fold in fresh LB medium and incubated at 37□ for ∼3 hours until the log phage. Prior to the intratumoral injection, the bacteria density was determined by measuring the OD600 (1 OD = 4 × 10<sup>8</sup> CFU/ml). For the proteomic experiment, the tumor-bearing mice were intratumorally injected with 4 × 10<sup>8</sup> BL21(DE3) in 50 μL PBS when the tumor volumes reached approximately 150 mm<sup>3</sup>. The tumors were harvested the following day for the LC-MS/MS analysis. For the intratumor-injection-based therapeutic experiment, the tumor-bearing mice were treated when the tumor volume reached ∼150 mm<sup>3</sup>. The tumor-bearing mice were intratumorally injected with 4 × 10<sup>8</sup> BL21(DE3) on day 0 and day 9. VLX 600 (4.5 mg/kg) was administered via intravenous injection every three days for a total of four injections. For the intravenous-injection-based therapeutic experiment, the tumor-bearing mice were intravenously injected with 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> BL21(DE3) in 100 μL PBS every three days for four times. The Oxaliplatin (5 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally every three days for a total of five injections. For the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell depletion experiment, the mice received intraperitoneal injections of 100 μg anti-mouse CD8α antibodies (BioXCell, Cat# BE0061) on days -6, -2, 2, 6, and 10, along with the intratumoral injections of 4 × 10[ BL21(DE3) on days 0 and 9.</p>

<title>Proteomics sample preparation</title>
<p>For the tumor-colonized bacteria, the tumors were excised, and homogenized, and processed to extract intratumoral bacteria cells. Red blood cells were removed using RBC lysis buffer. The mouse cells were removed through low-speed centrifugation at 1,200 g for 2 min three times. The <italic>E coli</italic> was collected by centrifugation at 4,500 g for 20 min. The samples were lysed using 4% SDS, 100mM Tris-HCL (pH 9), and 1x protease inhibitor cocktail set III. The cell lysates were heated at 95[ for 5 minutes and sonicated for 15 min using a Bioruptor Plus (Diagenode). The supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 18,000 g for 30 min at 4□ .</p>
<p>Approximately 50 μL supernatant was mixed with 200 μL methanol, 50 μL chloroform, and 150 μL double-distilled water. The aqueous phase was removed after sitting the sample at room temperature for 10 minutes. Subsequently, the sample was mixed with another 150 μL methanol. The pellet was collected, dried for 20 minutes, and resuspended in 8 M urea and 50 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer. The samples were reduced with 10 mM DTT, alkylated with 50 mM IAA, and digested using LysC and trypsin. Following acidification, the supernatant was loaded onto the SDB-XC StageTips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Rappsilber et al. 2007</xref>) and eluted by 80% ACN containing 0.1%TFA.

BEH130 C18 column (Waters, USA) using a 5-35% buffer B (buffer A: 0.1% formic acid; buffer B: 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) gradient as the separation phase and a flow rate of 300 nl/min. The total running time was 120 min. The mass spectrometric data were collected on a high-resolution Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) operating in the data-dependent mode. Full MS resolution was set to 60,000 at 200 m/z and the mass range was set to 350−1600. dd-MS2 resolution was set to 15,000 at 200 m/z. Isolation width was set to 1.3 m/z. Normalized collision energy was set to 28%. The LC-MS/MS data were matched with the human SwissProt database using the Mascot search engine v.2.6.1 (Matrix Science, UK) with the following parameters: the mass tolerance of precursor peptide was set to 10 ppm, and the tolerance for MS/MS fragments was 0.02 Da.</p>

The statistical analysis was performed using Perseus version 1.6.15.0 and Prism version 8.0.2(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Tyanova et al. 2016</xref>). The proteinGroups output table from MaxQuant was utilized for proteomics analysis. The potential contaminant, reverse, and only-identified-by-site were filtered out. The LFQ-intensity was log2-transformed and filtered for validity. NaN values were imputed, and bacterial cell LFQ intensity was normalized using z-score. The LFQ intensity of bacterial cells was normalized using z-score (n-average/standard deviation). A t-test with an FDR of 0.05 and S0 of 1 was performed to extract significantly different proteins.

<p>In this manuscript, Huang and colleagues explored the role of iron in bacterial therapy for cancer. Using proteomics, they revealed the upregulation of bacterial genes that uptake iron, and reasoned that such regulation is an adaptation to the iron-deficient tumor microenvironment. Logically, they engineered E. Coli strains with enhanced iron-uptake efficiency, and showed that these strains, together with iron scavengers, suppress tumor growth in a mouse model. Lastly, they reported the tumor suppression by IroA-E. Coli provides immunological memory via CD8+ T cells. In general, I find the findings in the manuscript novel and the evidence convincing.</p>
<p>1. Although the genetic and proteomic data are convincing, would it be possible to directly quantify the iron concentration in (1) E. Coli in different growth environments, and (2) tumor microenvironment? This will provide the functional consequences of upregulating genes that import iron into the bacteria.</p>
<p>2. Related to 1, the experiment to study the synergistic effect of CDG and VLX600 (lines 139-175) is very nice and promising, but one flaw here is a lack of the measurement of iron concentration. Therefore, a possible explanation could be that CDG acts in another manner, unrelated to iron uptake, that synergizes with VLX600's function to deplete iron from cancer cells. Here, a direct measurement of iron concentration will show the effect of CDG on iron uptake, thus complementing the missing link.</p>
<p>3. Lines 250-268: Although statistically significant, I would recommend the authors characterize the CD8+ T cells a little more, as the mechanism now seems quite elusive. What signals or memories do CD8+ T cells acquire after IroA-E. Coli treatment to confer their long-term immunogenicity?</p>
<p>4. Perhaps this goes beyond the scope of the current manuscript, but how broadly applicable is the observed iron-transport phenomenon in other tumor models? I would recommend the authors to either experimentally test it in another model or at least discuss this question.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors provide strong evidence that bacteria, such as E. coli, compete with tumor cells for iron resources and consequently reduce tumor growth. When sequestration between LCN2 and bacterobactin is blocked by upregulating CDG(DGC-E. coli) or salmochelin(IroA-E.coli), E. coli increase iron uptake from the tumor microenvironment (TME) and restrict iron availability for tumor cells. Long-term remission in IroA-E.coli treated mice is associated with enhanced CD8+ T cell activity. Additionally, systemic delivery of IroA-E.coli shows a synergistic effect with chemotherapy reagent oxaliplatin to reduce tumor growth.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>It is important to identify the iron-related crosstalk between E. coli and TME. Blocking lcn2-bacterobactin sequestration by different strategies consistently reduces tumor growth.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>As engineered E.coli upregulate their function to uptake iron, they may increase the likelihood of escaping from nutritional immunity (LCN2 becomes insensitive to sequester iron from the bacteria). Would this raise the chance of developing sepsis? Do authors think that it is safe to administrate these engineered bacteria in mice or humans?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Based on their observation that tumor has an iron-deficient microenvironment, and the assumption that nutritional immunity is important in bacteria-mediated tumor modulation, the authors postulate that manipulation of iron homeostasis can affect tumor growth. They show that iron chelation and engineered DGC-E. coli have synergistic effects on tumor growth suppression. Using engineered IroA-E. coli that presumably have more resistance to LCN2, they show improved tumor suppression and survival rate. They also conclude that the IroA-E. coli treated mice develop immunological memory, as they are resistant to repeat tumor injections, and these effects are mediated by CD8+ T cells. Finally, they show synergistic effects of IroA-E. coli and oxaliplatin in tumor suppression, which may have important clinical implications.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This paper uses straightforward in vitro and in vivo techniques to examine a specific and important question of nutritional immunity in bacteria-mediated tumor therapy. They are successful in showing that manipulation of iron regulation during nutritional immunity does affect the virulence of the bacteria, and in turn the tumor. These findings open future avenues of investigation, including the use of different bacteria, different delivery systems for therapeutics, and different tumor types.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>-- There is no discussion of the cancer type and why this cancer type was chosen. Colon cancer is not one of the more prominently studied cancer types for LCN2 activity. While this is a proof-of-concept paper, there should be some recognition of the potential different effects on different tumor types. For example, this model is dependent on significant LCN production, and different tumors have variable levels of LCN expression. Would the response of the tumor depend on the role of iron in that cancer type? For example, breast cancer aggressiveness has been shown to be influenced by FPN levels and labile iron pools.</p>
<p>
-- Are the effects on tumor suppression assumed to be from E. coli virulence, i.e. Does the higher number of bacteria result in increased immune-mediated tumor suppression? Or are the effects partially from iron status in the tumor cells and the TME?</p>
<p>
-- If the effects are iron-related, could the authors provide some quantification of iron status in tumor cells and/or the TME? Could the proteomic data be queried for this data?</p>
