<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Volatiles emitted by herbivore-attacked plants (senders) can enhance defenses in neighboring plants (receivers), with important consequences for community dynamics. However, the temporal dynamics of this phenomenon remain poorly studied. Using a custom-built, high-throughput proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS) system, we explored temporal patterns of volatile transfer and responses between herbivore-attacked and undamaged maize plants. We found that continuous exposure to natural blends of herbivore-induced volatiles results in distinct temporal response patterns in neighboring plants, characterized by an induced terpene burst at the onset of the second day of exposure. This delayed burst is not explained by terpene accumulation during the night, but coincides with delayed jasmonate accumulation in receiver plants. The delayed burst occurs independent of day:night light transitions and cannot be fully explained by sender volatile dynamics. Instead, it is the result of a clocked stress memory from volatile exposure during the first day and secondary exposure to bioactive volatiles on the second day. Our study reveals that prolonged exposure to natural blends of stress-induced volatiles results in a response that integrates priming and direct induction into a distinct and predictable temporal response pattern, with potentially important consequences for plant-herbivore dynamics and tritrophic interactions. This work also contributes to answering the long-standing question of whether stress volatiles predominantly induce or prime plant defenses in neighboring plants.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Plants rely on chemical cues to identify and mount appropriate responses to herbivores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Among these cues are herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. When perceived by undamaged plants, HIPVs can enhance plant defenses, and thus increase plant resistance to future herbivory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. HIPVs can directly induce plant defenses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. HIPVs can also prime plant defenses. In this case, HIPV-exposed plants respond more strongly and/or more rapidly to a secondary stimulus such as herbivore attack [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Plant responses to environmental cues depend on temporal dynamics. For example, artificial damage that mimics spatiotemporal patterns of chewing herbivores induces a similar response to actual herbivore attack [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. The emission of HIPVs also follows discrete temporal dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], which, again, is likely to influence defense responses in receiver plants. Green leaf volatiles (GLVs), including (<italic>Z</italic>)-3-hexenyl acetate, (<italic>Z</italic>)-3 hexenal and (<italic>Z</italic>)-3-hexen-1-ol are catabolic products of the lipoxygenase/hydroperoxide lyase pathway and are emitted within minutes following damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Indole and terpenes are emitted within hours of herbivore attack [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Indole can mediate interactions between plants as well as between plants and other organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Terpenes are a very diverse group of volatile (&gt; 80,000 known structures) that are also important as both direct and indirect plant defenses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,20–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. Indole and terpenes take longer to produce in comparison to GLVs and are less transiently emitted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. In maize, GLVs have been implicated in direct induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], and both GLVs and indole are known to prime defenses, and are thus considered as ‘bioactive’ in information transfer between plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>].</p>
<p>Although it is clear that plants can either be primed or directly induced following HIPV exposure, if and how these two phenomena integrate in the context of a natural HIPV exposure sequence is unclear. Studies have yet to monitor induction and priming dynamics in real time and during continuous exposure to HIPVs. It is possible that, through time, continuous HIPV exposure may result in a self-enforced positive feedback loop, whereby priming enhances induction and induction serves as a priming event for subsequent induction. Further, temporal trends might be complicated by dynamic environmental conditions, such as light fluctuations; over a 24 hr period, plants can experience both full sun and darkness. In darkness, the emission of many volatiles, especially those released via stomata, is severely hindered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>].</p>
<p>In order to understand the kinetics of information transfer between plants and the importance of dynamic temporal emission patterns, we monitored the emission kinetics of terpenes as a marker of defense activation in maize plants that were exposed to HIPVs. We leveraged a highly temporally-resolved volatile multiplexing system that allowed us to track continuous volatile emissions in sender and receiver plants for the first time in real time. We further measured terpene pools, stress hormones and defense gene expression in receiver plants, and determined the impact of day:night light transitions in the observed defense induction kinetics. Finally, we measured defenses upon sequences of short-term HIPV and GLV exposure to unravel the relative importance of direct induction and priming. Together, our experiments reveal how the natural kinetics of herbivore attack result in a tightly clocked defense response in neighboring plants via volatile information transfer.</p>

<title>Delayed burst in induced volatile emissions in plants exposed to volatiles of an herbivore-attacked neighbor</title>
<p>When maize plants are exposed to volatiles from herbivore-attacked neighbors, they start to release terpenes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. To understand the temporal dynamics of this phenomenon, we conducted a detailed time-course analysis of terpene release by receiver plants exposed to volatiles from sender plants under attack by <italic>Spodoptera exigua</italic> caterpillars (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Within 2 hr, we detected a small induction of sesquiterpenes, monoterpenes, 4,8-dimethylnona-1,3,7-triene (DMNT) and 4,8,12-trimethyltrideca-1,3,7,11-tetraene (TMTT) in undamaged receiver plants. This response disappeared at night. Interestingly, as soon as the night was over, we observed a strong burst of terpene release from receiver plants, which was 2-5 times higher than the release the day before (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Thus, exposure to volatiles from an herbivore-attacked plant triggers a delayed burst in terpene emission in neighboring plants.</p>

<title>The delayed burst in terpene emission is not explained by overaccumulation during the night</title>
<p>Why do receiver plants show a delayed burst in volatile-induced terpenoid release? During the night, plants close their stomata to limit water loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>], which may also impair terpene release, thus leading to an accumulation of terpenes in the leaves and a burst once stomata open again [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. To determine if terpenes (over)accumulate in maize leaves of HIPV-exposed plants during the night, we measured internal foliar pools of the major sesquiterpenes, β-caryophyllene, β-farnesene, and α-bergamotene, as well as the homoterpene TMTT over time. Internal pools of β-caryophyllene, β-farnesene and TMTT started increasing after 3 hours, but only became significant after 8 hr of exposure to HIPVs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A, 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For all three, accumulation remained higher during the night (16.75 hr) as well as the following day. α-bergamotene only began accumulating in leaves on the second day (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Thus, internal sesquiterpene pools remain comparable between night and day, suggesting that even when volatiles are emitted in large amounts on day two, internal pools do not deplete below nighttime levels. To get insight into terpene biosynthesis we measured the expression of terpene synthases. In maize, farnesene pyrophosphate synthase 3 (FPPS3), terpene synthase 2 and 10 (TPS2 and TPS10) as well as dimethylnonatriene/trimethyltetradecatetraene synthase (CYP92C5) are rate limiting for terpene production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. All genes were induced by HIPV exposure during daytime, but not during the nighttime. FPPS3 was slightly induced after 3 hr and significantly induced after 8 hr HIPV exposure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). TPS2 was slightly induced 3, 8 and 22 hr after the onset of HIPV exposure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). TPS10 was significantly induced after 3 and 22 hr of HIPV exposure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2G</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). CYP92C5 was only significantly induced after 3 hr of HIPV exposure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2H</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The patterns of volatile terpene biosynthesis do not support a scenario where the terpene burst on the second day is due to continued biosynthesis but lack of emission during the night.</p>

<title>The delayed burst in terpenoid emission is associated with clocked jasmonate production</title>
<p>Volatile release in maize is regulated by jasmonates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. To understand whether the delayed terpene burst is associated with jasmonate signaling, we measured the levels of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA), jasmonic acid (JA) and jasmonic acid-isoleucine (JA-Ile), as well as the expression of oxo-phytodienoate reductase 7 (OPR7), which is critical for JA biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>].

<title>The delayed volatile burst cannot be fully explained by the emission kinetics of bioactive herbivory-induced volatiles</title>
<p>A simple explanation for the delayed volatile burst may be that the bioactive volatiles are more strongly emitted from sender plants at the onset of day two, thus triggering a stronger volatile response in the receiver plants at this time. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed volatile emission kinetics of <italic>S. exigua</italic>-infested plants over time. We focused our analysis on GLVs and indole, which are known to induce and/or prime volatile release in neighboring maize plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Terpenes are not known prime or induce volatile release in maize, and were thus not included in the sender plant analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. We analyzed GLV and indole emission data of the sender plants from the experiments depicted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>), and then correlated their emission with the induction of terpenes in receiver plants (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). We found strong positive correlations between hexenal, hexenyl acetate, hexen-1-ol and indole emissions in sender plants and terpene responses in receiver plants when plants had a dark period (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). Interestingly, this was not the case under continuous light, where the magnitude of the emission of bioactive volatiles was not directly correlated to the magnitude of terpene responses in receiver plants (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). Emissions by sender plants even showed slight negative correlations with terpene induction in receiver plants under continuous light. Thus, the emission kinetics of bioactive volatiles from sender plants cannot fully explain the delayed terpene burst.</p>

<title>The combination of direct induction and clocked priming can explain the delayed terpene burst in receiver plants</title>
<p>Based on the above observations, we reasoned that, under natural conditions, the strong delayed volatile burst may be due to the interaction of a volatile-induced, clocked component that primes plants for higher volatile release at the onset of the second day, and a secondary trigger in the form of bioactive volatiles released from sender plants at the onset of the second day. To test this hypothesis, we exposed receiver plants to volatiles from control plants or volatiles from herbivory-induced plants for 1.25 hr. We then disconnected the receiver plants and exposed them to clean air for 17 hr, until the beginning of the next day. Half of the plants were then exposed to (<italic>Z</italic>)-3-hexenyl acetate as a secondary trigger. (<italic>Z</italic>)-3-hexenyl acetate was selected as an inducer as it showed the strongest correlation with all measured terpenes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). Following the short exposure to HIPVs, we detected a generally small but significant induction of sesquiterpenes, monoterpenes, DMNT and TMTT emissions in receiver plants (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). During the night, no differences between treatments were detected any more. At the beginning of the next day, we found a slight induction in terpene emissions, most apparent for sesquiterpenes and TMTT, in plants that had been exposed to herbivory induced volatiles 18 hr prior (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). (<italic>Z</italic>)-3-hexenyl acetate exposure at the beginning of the next day also induced terpene emissions.

<p>Thus, exposure to HIPVs prompts maize plants to release more terpenes the next day and also primes maize plants to respond more strongly to a secondary HIPV trigger. Together, these two phenomena result in a pronounced terpene burst.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) play an important role in mediating interactions between damaged and undamaged plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. However, the kinetics and temporal dynamics of this information transfer remain poorly understood. We show that, somewhat surprisingly, upon continuous exposure to HIPVs, receiver plants show a pronounced activation of defenses at the onset of the second day. We find that this is the result of volatile-mediated priming on the first day that yields a strong clocked response to the volatiles that are perceived on the next day. Here, we discuss the mechanisms and biological implications of this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Plants are well known to respond to herbivore-induced volatiles by increasing their own defenses. Defense activation can happen directly, with plants increasing their defense hormone production and volatile release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], and/or via priming effects, with plants increasing their defenses more strongly upon a secondary stimulus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Here, we show that these two phenomena operate together to trigger strong defense activation in receiver plants with predictable temporal kinetics. So far, studies in maize and other plants showing priming effects have often exposed receiver plants to HIPVs for several hours, overnight, or even for multiple days, and induced them, e.g. by simulated herbivory, on the following day in the absence of HIPVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,35–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. Indeed, such a setup would reveal clear priming, with minor or no direct induction by the volatile treatment. Our findings demonstrate that more natural continuous exposure to volatiles results in the same pattern without the need of another stimulus. We thus conclude that HIPVs are sufficient to trigger robust, clocked defense activation in neighboring plants.</p>
<p>What is the mechanism that results in a strong activation of defenses on the onset of the second day of exposure to HIPVs? In maize, green leaf volatiles (GLVs) directly induce and prime jasmonate production and terpene release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Indole can prime, but not directly induce these two responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. GLVs and indole again can interact to increase defense priming upon a secondary stimulus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Given these considerations, together with the observed volatile release, response kinetics, and our manipulative experiments, we can draw up the following scenario: On day one, maize plants are exposed to GLVs, which trigger a small burst of terpene release in receiver plants. At the same time, receiver plants are primed to respond more strongly on the next day. At the onset of the second day, three things happen simultaneously. First, the emission of GLVs from the neighboring plants increases. Second, the defense priming mechanism responding to these cues kicks into gear. Third, terpene production and release are activated. Together, these elements result in a strong terpene burst. The orchestration of these elements is noteworthy and results in a constant and predictable response patters under variable HIPV exposure. Further experiments will reveal whether similar patterns are observed in other plants, and how they may operate on a mechanistic level. Our experiments reveal the importance of tracking plant defense responses in real time as they perceive the dynamic natural volatile blend of herbivore attacked neighbors.</p>
<p>What is the ecological relevance of the distinct temporal kinetics of defense activation in neighboring plants? We propose several hypotheses. First, responding most strongly to volatile cues on the second day may avoid unnecessary energy expenditure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. GLVs are emitted both upon herbivore attack and upon mechanical damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. However, when damage is not sustained, GLVs will dissipate rapidly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Thus, responding most strongly to repeated GLV exposure could avoid false negatives and allow plants to respond more robustly to the presence of actual herbivory. Second, sending out volatiles on the second day may maximize indirect defenses. Attracting natural enemies too early to herbivore-free plants could have fitness costs for both the plant and herbivore natural enemies. Responding on the second day could be advantageous, as by this time, the natural enemies would have located and interacted with the herbivores on sender plants, and would thus be ready to move over to the next plant in anticipation of herbivore arrival. As fitness outcomes are likely highly nuanced, especially considering HIPVs also attract herbivores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>], investigation into information transfer on the multi-plant scale, namely in the context of multi-trophic interactions, will be critical. Considerable work will be needed to understand whether the observed defense activation pattern have any adaptive benefit.</p>
<p>Airborne information transfer has the potential to play a major role in plant communities, as it functions as a signaling viaduct between plants not physically connected to one another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. Although it has been established for decades that plants transmit airborne chemical information between individuals, we are only scratching the surface of the dynamic nature of this phenomenon. The kinetics of information transfer at the detailed temporal resolution of this study provide some insights regarding how HIPVs act across time and space. On this basis, a more comprehensive understanding of volatile-mediated information transfer between plants can be built.</p>

<p><italic>Zea mays</italic> (maize, B73) was used throughout this study. Maize plants were grown in commercial potting soil (Selmaterra, BiglerSamen, Switzerland) in 180 ml pots. Plants were grown in a greenhouse supplemented with artificial lights (300 µmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>). The greenhouse was maintained at 22 ± 2 °C, 40–60% relative humidity, with a 14 h: 10 h, light: dark cycle.

<sec id="s4b">
<title>Herbivore treatment and experimental setup</title>
<p>The herbivore treatment consisted of adding three 4<sup>th</sup> instar larvae onto plants (sender plants). Two principal experimental setups were used to determine the kinetics of herbivore-induced plant volatile (HIPV) emissions in both sender plants (damaged by herbivores) and receiver plants (exposed to HIPVs from sender plants).</p>
<sec id="s4b1">
<title>Setup 1</title>
<p>Single plants (senders) in transparent glass chambers (Ø×H 12 × 45 cm) were connected with PTFE tubing to a second transparent glass chamber that was either left empty or filled with a second plant (receiver). Chambers were sealed other than an airflow inlet on the first chamber and an air outlet on the second chamber, allowing HIPVs from sender plants to pass through the second chamber. Cumulative HIPV emissions from senders and receivers were measured as described in the section “Volatile emission sampling”. In order to determine emissions from receiver plants alone, HIPV emissions from sender plants connected to an empty chamber were subtracted from sender plants connected to receiver plants (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental fig 1</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4b2">
<title>Setup 2</title>
<p>To isolate emissions solely from receiver plants, chambers containing sender and receiver plants were initially kept separate for basal HIPV emission profiling. Chambers were then connected as in setup 1 for 30 min before herbivore treatment. After herbivores were added to sender plants, chambers remained connected for 1.25 hr, after which time sender and receiver plants were once again disconnected and rearranged so that receiver plants had both clean air flowing through the inlet and an outlet for volatile collection and profiling (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental fig 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Volatile emission sampling</title>
<p>Volatile emissions were collected using setup 1 and 2.

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study examines the effects of herbivory-induced maize volatiles on neighboring plants and their responses over time. Measurements of volatile compound classes and gene expression in receiver plants exposed to these volatiles led to the conclusion that the delayed emission of certain terpenes in receiver plants after the onset of light may be a result of stress memory, highlighting the role of priming and induction in plant defenses triggered by herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). Most experimental data are <bold>compelling</bold> but additional experiments and accurate quantifications of the compounds would be required to confirm some of the main claims.</p>

<p>The authors of the manuscript &quot;High-resolution kinetics of herbivore-induced plant volatile transfer reveal tightly clocked responses in neighboring plants&quot; assessed the effects of herbivory-induced maize volatiles on receiver plants over a period of time in order to assess the dynamics of the responses of receiver plants. Different volatile compound classes were measured over a period of time using PTR-ToF-MS and GC-MS, under both natural light:dark conditions, and continuous light. They also measured gene expression of related genes as well as defense-related phytohormones. The effects of a secondary exposure to GLVs on primed receiver plants were also measured.</p>
<p>The paper addresses some interesting points, however, some questions arise regarding some of the methods employed. Firstly, I am wondering why VOCs (as measured by GC-MS) were not quantified. While I understand that quantification is time-consuming and requires more work, it allows for comparisons to be made between lines of the same species, as well as across other literature on the subject. As experiments with VOC dispensers were also used in this experiment, I find it even more baffling that the authors didn't confirm the concentration of the emission from the plants they used to make sure they matched. The references cited justifying the concentration used (saying it was within the range of GLVs emitted by their plants) to prepare the dispenser were for either a different variety of maize (delprim versus B73) or arabidopsis. Simply relying on the area under the curve and presenting results using arbitrary units is not enough for analyses like these.</p>
<p>With regards to the correlation analyses shown in Figure 6, the results presented in many of the correlation plots are not actually informative. By blindly reporting the correlation coefficient important trends are being ignored, as there are clearly either bimodal relationships (e.g. upper left panel, HAC/TMTT, HAC/MNT) or even stranger relationships (e.g. upper left panel, IND/SQT, IND/MNT) that are not being well explained by a correlation plot. It is not appropriate to discuss the correlation factors presented here and to draw such strong conclusions on emission kinetics. The comparison between plants under continuous light and normal light:dark conditions is interesting, but I think there are better ways to examine these relationships, for example, multivariate analysis might reveal some patterns.</p>
<p>In Figure 2, the elevated concentrations of beta-caryophyllene found in the control plants at 8h and 16.75h measurement timepoints are curious. Is this something that is commonly seen in B73? While there can be discrepancies between emissions and compounds actually present within leaf tissue, it is a little bit odd that such high levels of b-caryophyllene were found at these timepoints, however, this is not reflected in the PTR-ToF-MS measurements of sesquiterpenes. It would be beneficial to include an overview of the mechanism of production and storage of sesquiterpenes in maize leaves, which would clarify why high amounts were found only in the GC-MS analysis and not the PTR-ToF-MS analysis, which is a more sensitive analytical tool. It is possible that the amounts of b-caryophyllene present in the leaf are actually extremely low, however as the values are not given as a concentration but rather arbitrary units, it is not possible to tell. I would include a line explaining what is seen with b-caryophyllene. Additionally, it seems like the amounts of TMTT within the leaf are extraordinarily high (judging only by the au values given for scale), far higher than one would expect from maize.</p>

<p>The exact dynamics of responses to volatiles from herbivore-attacked neighbouring plants have been little studied so far. Also, we still lack evidence of whether herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) induce or prime plant defences of neighbours. The authors investigated the volatile emission patterns of receiver plants that respond to the volatile emission of neighbouring sender plants which are fed upon by herbivorous caterpillars. They applied a very elegant approach (more rigorous than the current state-of-the-art) to monitor temporal response patterns of neighbouring plants to HIPVs by measuring volatile emissions of senders and receivers, senders only and receivers only. Different terpenoids were produced within 2 h of such exposure in receiver plants, but not during the dark phase. Once the light turned on again, large amounts of terpenoids were released from the receiver plants. This may indicate a delayed terpene burst, but terpenoids may also be induced by the sudden change in light. A potential caveat exists with respect to the exact timing and the day-night cycle. The timing may be critical, i.e. at which time-point after onset of light herbivores were placed on the plants and how long the terpene emission lasted before the light was turned off. If the rhythm or a potential internal clock matters, then this information should also be highly relevant. Moreover, light on/off is a rather arbitrary treatment that is practical for experiments in the laboratory but which is not a very realistic setting. Particularly with regard to terpene emission, the sudden turning on of light instead of a smooth and continuous change to lighter conditions may trigger emission responses that are not found in nature. As one contrasting control, the authors also studied the time-delay in volatile emission when plants were just kept under continuous light (just for the experiment or continuously?). Here they also found a delayed terpenoid production, but this seemed to be lower compared to the plants exposed to the day-night-cycle. Another helpful control would be to start the herbivory treatment in the evening hours and leave the light on. If then again plants only release volatiles after a 17 h delay, the response is indeed independent of the diurnal clock of the plant.</p>
<p>Interestingly, internal terpene pools of one of the leaves tested here remained more comparable between night and day, indicating that their pools stay higher in plants exposed to HIPVs. In contrast, terpene synthases were only induced during the light-phase, not in the dark-phase. Moreover, jasmonates were only significantly induced 22 h after the onset of the volatile exposure and thus parallel with the burst of terpene release.</p>
<p>An additional experiment exposing plants to the green leaf volatile (glv) (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate revealed that plants can be primed by this glv, leading to a stronger terpene burst. The results are discussed with nice logic and considering potential ecological consequences. Some data are not discussed, e.g. the jasmonate and gene induction pattern.</p>
<p>Overall, this study provides intriguing insights into the potential interplay between priming and induction, which may co-occur, enhancing (indirect and direct) plant defence. Follow-up studies are suggested that may provide additional evidence.</p>
