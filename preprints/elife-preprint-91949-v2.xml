<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Neural activity contains rich spatio-temporal structure that corresponds to cognition. This includes oscillatory bursting and dynamic activity that span across networks of brain regions, all of which can occur on timescales of a tens of milliseconds. While these processes can be accessed through brain recordings and imaging, modelling them presents methodological challenges due to their fast and transient nature. Furthermore, the exact timing and duration of interesting cognitive events is often a priori unknown. Here we present the OHBA Software Library Dynamics Toolbox (<monospace>osl-dynamics</monospace>), a Python-based package that can identify and describe recurrent dynamics in functional neuroimaging data on timescales as fast as tens of milliseconds. At its core are machine learning generative models that are able to adapt to the data and learn the timing, as well as the spatial and spectral characteristics, of brain activity with few assumptions. <monospace>osl-dynamics</monospace> incorporates state-of-the-art approaches that can be, and have been, used to elucidate brain dynamics in a wide range of data types, including magneto/electroencephalography, functional magnetic resonance imaging, invasive local field potential recordings and electrocorticography. It also provides novel summary measures of brain dynamics that can be used to inform our understanding of cognition, behaviour and disease. We hope <monospace>osl-dynamics</monospace> will further our understanding of brain function, through its ability to enhance the modelling of fast dynamic processes.</p></abstract>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There is growing evidence for the importance of oscillatory activity in brain function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Neural oscillations have been linked to cognitive processes, such as information encoding and processing, as well as attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>] and distinct oscillatory activity has been observed in different states of consciousness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, the synchronisation of neural oscillations has been proposed as a mechanism for communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Neural oscillations have also been a useful tool for understanding brain dysfunction; for example, changes have been observed in the oscillatory activity of diseased and healthy cohorts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>].</p>
<p>An aspect of neural oscillations that remains to be fully understood is its dynamic nature, particularly at fast timescales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Recently, it has been proposed that neuronal populations exhibit short <italic>bursts</italic> of oscillatory activity on timescales of 100 ms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] rather than the classical view of ongoing oscillations that are modulated in amplitude. This has important implications for how we should be modelling oscillatory activity changes in cognition and disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Unfortunately, the methods available to detect bursts in oscillatory data are limited, often requiring arbitrary choices for parameters relating to the frequency content, amplitude and duration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. These choices can significantly impact the conclusions reached by such analyses.</p>
<p>Furthermore, oscillatory bursting is not isolated to individual brain regions. It has been shown that bursting can occur across cortical networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], and there are bursts of coherent activity in networks that lasts on the order of 50-100 ms in both resting-state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>] and in task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Precise knowledge of these fast network dynamics is a valuable insight that can help us understand cognitive processes; for example, the dynamics of specific functional resting-state networks have been linked to memory replay (a <monospace>â¤</monospace> 50 ms process that occurs in memory consolidation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Changes in the dynamics of functional networks have also been shown to be predictive of behavioural traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>] and disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. The key barrier that prevents us from fully utilising a network perspective is that the accurate estimation of dynamic functional networks is challenging. This is in part due to the timing and duration of interesting cognitive events, and the corresponding activity in functional networks, not being known. Consequently, we need to rely on methods that can adapt to the data and automatically identify when networks activate.</p>
<p>Here, we present the OHBA Software Library Dynamics Toolbox (<monospace>osl-dynamics</monospace>), a Python package that meets two far-reaching methodological challenges that limit the field of cognitive neuroscience: burst detection and the identification of dynamic functional brain networks. It does so by deploying data driven generative models that have a proven ability to adapt to the data from a wide range of imaging modalities, and can learn the spatio-temporal characteristics of brain activity, with few assumptions and at fast timescales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>].</p>
<p>In applications for burst detection, <monospace>osl-dynamics</monospace> can automatically detect oscillatory bursts without the need to specify the frequencies, amplitude threshold or duration of the bursts. This allows <monospace>osl-dynamics</monospace> to answer questions such as: when do oscillatory bursts occur; what is their oscillatory frequency; and what are their characteristic features (e.g. average lifetime, interval, occurrence and amplitude)?</p>
<p>In the detection of dynamic functional brain networks, <monospace>osl-dynamics</monospace> can automatically detect network dynamics at fast timescales with few assumptions. This allows <monospace>osl-dynamics</monospace> to answer questions such as: what large-scale functional networks do individuals or groups exhibit; when do these functional networks activate and what are their characteristic dynamics; what functional networks activate in response to a task; do individuals differ in their functional network activations? On top of this, <monospace>osl-dynamics</monospace> can characterise functional networks from a more conventional, static (time-averaged), perspective using the same methodology where appropriate as the dynamic methods.</p>
<p>Here, we will illustrate the use of <monospace>osl-dynamics</monospace> using publicly available magnetoencephalography (MEG) datasets. However, we emphasise that the scope of the toolbox extends well beyond MEG, containing approaches that can be used, and have been used, to elucidate network and oscillatory dynamics in a range of applications that include electroencephalography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>], functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], invasive local field potential recordings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>] and electrocorticography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>].</p>

<title>Generative Models</title>
<p>In the study of dynamics, we are often interested in the properties of a time series, such as power spectral density (PSD), mean, covariance, etc., at a given time point. A common heuristic approach for calculating this is to use a sliding window. However, this approach only utilises a short window around the time point of interest and suffers from a tradeoff between the temporal precision of dynamics and an accurate estimation of the properties (via a sufficiently large window). In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], it was shown that this approach is inadequate for studying fast changes in functional connectivity. In <monospace>osl-dynamics</monospace>, we adopt an alternative approach based on <italic>generative models</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. These are models that learn the probability distribution of the training data. In this report, we will focus on two generative models for time series data: the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>] and Dynamic Network Modes (DyNeMo) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Both of these models (discussed further below) incorporate an underlying dynamic latent variable in the generative process. The objective during training is to learn the most likely latent variables to have generated the observed time series (we minimise the <italic>variational free energy</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">1</xref></sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]). In doing this, the model can identify non-contiguous segments of the time series that share the same latent variable. Pooling this information leads to more robust estimates of the local properties of the data.</p>
<p>The generative model for the HMM (shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) is

<monospace>osl-dynamics</monospace> uses variational Bayesian inference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>] to learn the most likely state to have generated the observed data.

The HMM has been successfully used to study dynamics in neuroimaging data in a variety of settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>].</p>

<p>A) Hidden Markov Model (HMM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. Here, data is generated using a hidden state (<italic>Î¸</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>) and observation model, which in our case is a multivariate normal distribution parameterised by a state mean (<bold><italic>Âµ</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>) and covariance (<bold><italic>D</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>). Only one state can be active at a given time point. Dynamics are modelled via state switching using a transition probability matrix (A<sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>), which forecasts the probability of the current state based on the previous state. B) Dynamic Network Modes (DyNeMo) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Here, the data is generated using a linear combination of <italic>modes</italic> (<bold><italic>Âµ</italic></bold><sub><italic>j</italic></sub> and D<sub><italic>j</italic></sub>) and dynamics are modelled using a recurrent neural network (RNN: f and g), which forecasts the probability of a particular mixing ratio (<bold><italic>Î±</italic></bold><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>) based on a long history of previous values via the underlying logits (<italic>Î¸</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>).</p></caption>

<p>DyNeMo is a recently proposed model that overcomes two key limitations of the HMM: the mutually exclusive states and limited memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. The generative model for DyNeMo (shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) is

where <italic>Î¸</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> is a latent vector at time t (referred to as a <italic>logit</italic>) and <bold><italic>x</italic></bold><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> is the generated data. The observation model we use is

Dynamics in the latent vector are generated through p(<bold><italic>Î¸</italic></bold><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>|<bold><italic>Î¸</italic></bold><sub>1:<italic>t-</italic>1</sub>), which is a distribution parameterised using a recurrent neural network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. Specifically,
<disp-formula id="eqn7">
<graphic xlink:href="549346v2_eqn7.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where f and g are calculated using a recurrent neural network. <monospace>osl-dynamics</monospace> uses <italic>amortised</italic> variational Bayesian inference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>] to learn the most likely latent vector to have generated the observed data. This is a highly efficient inference scheme that is scalable to large datasets. For more information regarding the implementation of DyNeMo in <monospace>osl-dynamics</monospace> see the documentation: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osl-dynamics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models/dynemo.html">https://osl-dynamics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models/dynemo.html</ext-link>.</p>
<p>Once trained, both models reveal a dynamic latent description of the training data. For the HMM, the latent description is a hidden state time course<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2">2</xref></sup>, which is the most likely state inferred at each time point in the training data. For DyNeMo, it is a mode time course, which is the mixing coefficient time series for each mode inferred from the training data. We will discuss in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2e1">Sections 2.5.1</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2e2">2.5.2</xref> how these latent descriptions can be used to summarise dynamics in the training data.</p>

<title>Data Preparation</title>
<p>We usually prepare the source data before training a model. The data preparation can be different depending on what aspect of the data we are interested in studying.</p>
<p><bold>Amplitude Envelope (AE)</bold> If we are interested in studying dynamics in the amplitude of oscillations, we can train a model on AE data. Here, we typically bandpass filter a frequency range of interest and calculate an AE using the absolute value of a Hilbert transform. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> shows what happens when we calculate the AE of oscillatory data. We can see the AE data tracks changes in the amplitude of oscillations.</p>

</fig>
<p><bold>Time-Delay Embedding (TDE)</bold> Studying the amplitude dynamics of oscillations does not reveal any insights into how different regions interact via phase synchronisation. For this, we need to prepare the data using TDE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. This augments the time series with extra channels containing time-lagged versions of the original channels. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C.I</xref> shows an example of this. To perform TDE, we need to specify the number of lagged channels to add (number of embeddings) and the lag to shift each additional channel by. In <monospace>osl-dynamics</monospace>, we always shift by one time point, so we only need to specify the number of lags. By adding extra channels, we embed the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the original data (as well as the cross-correlation function) into the covariance matrix of the TDE data. This is illustrated in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C.II</xref>. We plot the ACF taken from the TDE covariance matrix and the PSD (calculated using a Fourier transform) in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C.III</xref>. By using TDE data we make the covariance matrix sensitive to the frequency of oscillations in the original data. The covariance matrix is also sensitive to cross channel phase synchronisation via of the off-diagonal elements. Training on TDE data allows us to study dynamics in oscillatory amplitude and phase synchronisation between channels. When we prepare TDE data, we are normally only interested in looking for dynamics in the auto/cross correlation function via the covariance matrix, so we fix the mean to zero in the generative model.</p>

<title>First-Level and Group-Level Analysis</title>
<p>Starting from the source reconstructed data, we study a dataset with a two-stage process:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p><bold>First-level analysis</bold>. Here, our objective is to estimate subject-specific quantities. In the static (time-averaged) analysis, we calculate these quantities directly from the source data. However, if we are doing a dynamic analysis, we first train a generative model, such as the HMM or DyNeMo. Note, the HMM/DyNeMo are typically trained as group-level models using the concatenated data from all subjects. This means the models are unaware that the data originates from different subjects and allows the model to pool information across subjects, which can lead to more robust estimates of dynamic quantities. We use the latent description provided by the model with the source data to estimate the quantities of interest - this approach is known as <italic>dual estimation</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7">7</xref></sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>].</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Group-level analysis</bold>. Quantities estimated for individual subjects, such as network metrics or summary statistics for dynamics, are used to model a group. For example, this could be predicting behavioural traits or characteristics of individual subjects, comparing two groups, or calculating the group average of an network response to a task. Typically, statistical significance testing is done at the group-level to verify that any observed differences or inferred relationships are not simply due to chance.</p></list-item>

<p>We will present the results of applying five pipelines to source reconstructed data calculated from the datasets mentioned in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2b">Section 2.2</xref>: a burst detection pipeline based on the HMM (discussed in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2e1">Section 2.5.1</xref>); three dynamic network analysis pipelines based on the HMM and DyNeMo (discussed in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2e2">Section 2.5.2</xref>) and a static network analysis pipeline (discussed in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2e3">Section 2.5.3</xref>).

<title>Burst Detection</title>
<p>We use an approach based on the HMM to detect bursts of oscillatory activity. In this approach, we prepare the source data using TDE. A typical TDE-HMM burst detection pipeline is shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>. When the HMM state time courses are inferred on the training data, each âvisitâ to a particular state corresponds to a burst, or transient spectral event, with spectral properties specific to the state (e.g. an increase in <italic>Î²</italic>-band power). This approach assumes that we are looking for bursting in a single channel (brain region) at a time; separate HMMs can be used to detect bursting in each channel. We use the state time course to calculate summary statistics that characterise the dynamics of bursts. Typical summary statistics are:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><bold>Mean lifetime</bold><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8">8</xref></sup>. This is the average duration a state is active.</p></list-item>

<list-item><p><bold>Burst count</bold>. This is the number of times a state activates in a second on average.</p></list-item>

<title>Identifying Dynamic Functional Networks</title>
<p><monospace>osl-dynamics</monospace> provides more options for modelling dynamic functional networks. Note, in this case we train on multivariate data containing the activity at multiple regions of interest, rather than a single region, which is what we did in the burst detection pipeline (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2e1">Section 2.5.1</xref>). Indeed, one perspective on using <monospace>osl-dynamics</monospace> to model dynamic functional networks, is that it is identifying bursts that span across multiple brain regions. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> shows the different combinations of data preparation and generative models that are available for a dynamic network analysis pipeline. We discuss each of these options and when they should be used below.</p>

<p><bold>AE-HMM</bold>. If we are interested in identifying dynamics in amplitude, we can train on AE data. Once we have trained a model, we can estimate subject and state-specific networks (amplitude maps) using the training data and inferred state time course. Additionally, we can calculate summary statistics that characterise the dynamics from the inferred state time course. These summary statistics are:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><bold>Fractional occupancy</bold>. This is the fraction of the total time that each state is active.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Mean lifetime</bold>. This is the average duration that a state is active.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Mean interval</bold>. This is the average duration between successive state visits.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Switching rate</bold>. This is the number of activations per second of a particular state.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>We calculate each of these for a particular state and subject. The averages are taken over all state activations. We present the results of an AE-HMM pipeline on the Elekta task MEG dataset in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3b">Section 3.2</xref>.</p>
<p><bold>TDE-HMM</bold>. We can use TDE data to study dynamics in phase synchronisation as well as dynamics in amplitude. In a dynamic network analysis pipeline we train on a multivariate time series (i.e. the time series for all regions of interest together). This means after TDE we have a very large number of channels (number of embeddings times number of regions). Therefore, we often need to perform principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction to ensure the data fits into computer memory.</p>
<p>In the TDE-HMM pipeline, we can calculate the same summary statistics as the AE-HMM pipeline. However, to estimate the functional networks we use the multitaper approach described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Here, we use the source data and inferred state time course to estimate subject, region and state-specific PSDs and cross PSDs. When then use the PSDs to calculate power maps and cross PSDs to calculate coherence networks, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>] for further details. Note, we also use the spectral decomposition approached introduced in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>] to specify a frequency range for calculating power maps and coherence networks. This involves applying non-negative matrix factorisation to the stacked subject and state-specific coherence spectra to identify common frequency bands of coherent activity. In this report, we fit two spectral components and only present the networks for the first band, which typically cover 1-25 Hz. We will see the results of applying a TDE-HMM pipeline for dynamic network analysis on both the CTF rest and Elekta task MEG dataset in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3c">Section 3.3</xref>.</p>
<p><bold>TDE-DyNeMo</bold>. This this pipeline, we replace the HMM with DyNeMo and train on TDE data. Unlike the mutually exclusive state description provided by the HMM, DyNeMo infers mode time courses, which describe the mixing ratio of each mode at each time point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. This mixture description complicates the calculation of subject-specific quantities, such as networks and summary statistics. To calculate mode and region-specific PSDs, we use the approach based on the General Linear Model (GLM) proposed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>] where we regress the mixing coefficients onto a (cross) spectrogram, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] for further details. We then use the mode PSDs and cross PSDs to calculate power maps and coherence networks respectively. We can summarise the dynamics of each mode time course with quantities such as the mean, standard deviation and pairwise Pearson correlation. Alternatively, if we were interested in calculating the same summary statistics as the HMM (fractional occupancy, lifetime, interval, switching rate) we would first need to binarise the mode time courses. This can be done using a two-component Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), which is discussed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Note, an additional complication related to the mode time course is that it does not contain any information regarding the relative magnitude of each mode covariance. For example, a mode with a small value for the mixing ratio can still be a large contributor to the instantaneous covariance if the values in the mode covariance matrix are relatively large. We account for this by renormalising the mode time course<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9">9</xref></sup>, this is discussed further in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. We present the results of a TDE-DyNeMo pipeline on the CTF rest MEG dataset in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3d">Section 3.4</xref>.</p>
<p>AE-DyNeMo. The final option is to train DyNeMo on AE data. In this case, the amplitude maps are calculated using the GLM approach by regressing the mixing coefficients on a sliding window AE time course. Summary statistics for dynamics are calculated in the same way as the TDE-DyNeMo pipeline.</p>
<p>When we display the networks inferred by each of the pipelines above, we will threshold them to only show the strongest connections. In this work, we will specify the threshold using a datadriven approach where we fit a two-component GMM to the distribution of connections in each network. We interpret one of the components as the distribution for background connections and the other as the distribution for atypically strong connections, which is what we display in each plot.</p>

<title>Identifying Static Functional Networks</title>
<p>A feature of <monospace>osl-dynamics</monospace> is that more conventional, static (time-averaged), network analyses can be carried out using the same methodology that we use in the dynamic methods. This allows for a much more straightforward comparison between static and dynamic analyses. To model static functional networks we simply need to specific the metrics we would like to use to summarise the networks and we calculate these directly from the source data. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> shows a typical static network analysis pipeline. We present the result of a static network analysis pipeline on the CTF rest MEG dataset in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3e">Section 3.5</xref>. Note, for the static networks we select the top 5% of connections to display in each plot rather than the GMM approached we used to threshold the dynamic functional networks.</p>

<title>Run-to-Run Variability</title>
<p>The HMM and DyNeMo are trained by minimising a cost function (in <monospace>osl-dynamics</monospace>, we use the <italic>variational free energy</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]). As is typical, this approach suffers from a local optimum issue, where the model can converge to different explanations (latent descriptions) of the data during training. I.e., different state/mode time courses can lead to similar values for the variational free energy. The final description can be sensitive to the stochasticity in updating model parameters and the initial parameter values.</p>
<p>A strategy for dealing with this that has worked well in the past is to train multiple models from scratch (each model is referred to as a <italic>run</italic>) and only the model with the lowest variational free energy is analysed. We consider this model as the best description of the data. We ensure any conclusions based on this model are reproducible in the best model from another set of independent runs. In all of our figures here, we present the results from the best run from a set of 10. In the supplementary information (SI) we show these results are reproducible in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>] an independent set of runs.

<p>The pipeline in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> was applied to do burst detection on a single parcel in the left motor cortex. The source data was calculated using the CTF rest MEG dataset. All subjects were concatenated temporally and used to train the TDE-HMM. The results are shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>. We see from the wavelet transform in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A.I</xref> that there are short bursts of oscillatory activity in this time series. This illustrates how it would be non-trivial, using conventional bandpass filtering and thresholding methods, to identify when exactly a burst occurs and what frequencies are contained within it. Instead of a conventional burst detection method, we use a 3 state TDE-HMM to identify bursts in a data-driven fashion. We see from the inferred state probability time course (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B.I</xref>) that there are short-lived states that describe this data. We can see from <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B.II</xref> that each state corresponds to unique oscillatory activity. State 1 is interpreted as a non-oscillatory background state because it does not show any significant peaks in its PSD.

<p>For the high-power networks (states 1-4), we see the same spatial patterns in TDE-HMM power maps (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A.I</xref>, top) and AE-HMM amplitude maps (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A.I</xref>). We can see from the state PSDs (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A.I</xref>, bottom) that the networks identified by the TDE-HMM exhibit distinct spectral (oscillatory) activity. The TDE-HMM networks also have fast dynamics (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A.III</xref>) with lifetimes of around 50 ms. In <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B</xref>.I, we can see we are able to reproduce the network response analysis we did using the AE-HMM (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B.I</xref>).

<p>The Elekta MEG dataset was recorded during a visual perception task. For comparison, we perform the same analysis on the CTF rest MEG dataset. All subjects were concatenated temporally and used to train the model. <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref> shows the results of applying a TDE-HMM pipeline to this dataset. We observe similar networks in rest (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10A</xref>) as in task (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref>), which is a known result from fMRI studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. We also include the coherence networks in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figures 9A.I</xref> and <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10A.I</xref>.

<p>To illustrate a group-level analysis we could do with a dynamic network perspective, we compared two groups: 27 subjects in a young group (18-34 years old) and 38 subjects in an old group (34-60 years). <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10B.I</xref> shows summary statistics for each group. We see the fractional occupancy and switching rate of the sensorimotor network (state 4) is increased in the older group (<italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05). The mean lifetime of the visual network (state 6) is also decreased in the older group (p-value &lt; 0.05). The older group also has a wider distribution of mean intervals for the default mode network (state 1) and suppressed state (8) (p-value &lt; 0.05). The reproducibility of these results is shown in SI <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4</xref>.

<title>Dynamic network detection using multi-region TDE-DyNeMo</title>
<p>The TDE-DyNeMo pipeline in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> was applied to the CTF rest MEG dataset. All subjects were concatenated temporally and used to train the model. The results are shown in <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11</xref>. Note, for DyNeMo we found that learning 7 modes (rather than 8) led to more reproducible results. Therefore, we present the 7 mode fit in <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>We can see from the power maps and coherence networks (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11A.I</xref>) that DyNeMo identifies much more localised power activations and a cleaner network structure than was seen with the TDE-HMM. We can see from the PSDs (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11A.I</xref>, bottom) that these networks also exhibit distinct spectral characteristics.</p>
<p>From the (renormalised) mode time course (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11A.II</xref>) we see the description provided by DyNeMo is that of overlapping networks that dynamically vary in mixing ratios. This is a complementary perspective to the state description provided by the HMM. Co-activations of each mode can be understood by looking at the Pearson correlation between (renormalised) mode time courses (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11A.III</xref>). We observe modes with activity in neighbouring regions show more co-activation. We summarise the (renormalised) mode time course using statistics (the mean and standard deviation) in <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11A.IV</xref>.</p>
<p>To compare DyNeMo to the HMM in a group-level analysis, we repeat the young vs old study using the DyNeMo-specific summary statistics (i.e. the mean and standard deviation of the renormalised mode time courses). <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11B.I</xref> shows significant group differences for young (18-34 years old) and old (34-60 years old) participants. We can see an increased mode contribution (mean renormalised mode time course) for the sensorimotor network (mode 4), which reflects the increase in fractional occupancy we saw in the TDE-HMM (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10B.I</xref>). We see DyNeMo is able to reveal a stronger effect size with a <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.01 compared to the TDE-HMM, which had a <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05. DyNeMo also shows a decrease in the variability (standard deviation of the renormalised mode time course) for the left temporal network (mode 5, <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.01).

<title>Estimating Static Functional Networks</title>
<p>For comparison, we also apply a typical static network analysis pipeline (including static functional connectivity) to the CTF rest MEG dataset. We also consider how the static perspective in a young vs old group-level analysis compares to the dynamic perspective provided by the TDE-HMM in <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref> and TDE-DyNeMo in <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11</xref>, illustrating the benefits of being able to do static and dynamic analyses within the same toolbox.</p>

We observe 5-power is strongest in anterior regions and Î±-power is strongest in posterior regions. We also observe qualitatively similar coherence and AEC networks. In particular, we see strong occipital connectivity in the Î±-band in both the coherence and AEC networks.</p>

<p><xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12B</xref> shows significant (<italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05) differences in the power maps (B.I) and AEC networks (B.II) for old (34-60 years old) minus young (18-34 years old) groups. We observe a significant reduction in temporal <italic>Î´</italic>-power and increase in sensorimotor <italic>Î²</italic>-power. We also observe a significant increase in sensorimotor AEC in the, <italic>Î²</italic>-band (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12B.II</xref>).</p>
<p>The static (time-averaged) differences we see in young vs old participants can arise in many ways from the underlying dynamics of resting-state networks (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10A.I</xref> and <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">11A.I</xref>). For example, an increase in static power could due to more frequent activations of a particular network. Conversely, the dynamics of the networks may be unaffected and the power within a network could be altered. Studying the dynamic network perspective using the HMM and/or DyNeMo can help provide further insights into how the static differences arise. Looking at the dynamic network perspective provided by the TDE-HMM, we see an increase in the fractional occupancy of state 4 (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10B.I</xref>), which is a network with high <italic>Î²</italic>-power and connectivity (coherence) in the sensorimotor region. This is consistent with the static increase in <italic>Î²</italic>-power and AEC connectivity we observe here; i.e. the increase in static, <italic>Î²</italic>-power and connectivity with age can be linked to a larger fraction of time spent in the sensorimotor network. The perspective provided by TDE-DyNeMo shows an increase with age in the contribution of mode 4 (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11B.I</xref>), which represents a sensorimotor network. This is a complementary explanation for the increase in static, <italic>Î²</italic>-power and connectivity as a larger contribution from the sensorimotor network to the overall brain activity of older participants.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3a">Section 3.1</xref>, we use the TDE-HMM to identify oscillatory bursts in a data-driven manner with much fewer assumptions than conventional burst detection methods based on amplitude thresholding. The advantages of using a data-driven approach like the TDE-HMM are discussed further in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. In short, with a conventional approach we must pre-specify a frequency of interest and we may miss oscillatory bursts that do not reach an arbitrary threshold. In contrast, the TDE-HMM is less sensitive to the amplitude (it is better able to identify low-amplitude oscillatory bursts) and can identify the frequency of oscillations automatically.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3b">Sections 3.2</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3c">3.3</xref>, we presented the functional networks identified by HMMs in a variety of settings. These networks were identified automatically at fast (sub-second) timescales from the data (unsupervised) with no input from the user. We found a set of plausible networks that were related to task (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>) and demographics (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>). These networks were very reproducible: across multiple HMM runs; across different data preparation techniques (AE and TDE); across different experimental paradigms (task and rest) and across different scanners (Elekta and CTF).</p>
<p>Given we observe similar networks with the AE-HMM and TDE-HMM (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8</xref> and <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref> respectively), one may ask which pipeline is recommended. The TDE-HMM approach is able to model dynamics in oscillatory amplitude and phase synchronisation whereas the AE-HMM can only model dynamics in amplitude. This means the TDE-HMM is generally a better model for oscillatory dynamics. An occasion where the AE-HMM may be preferred is if the extra computational load of training on TDE/PCA data prohibits the TDE-HMM.</p>
<p>An important choice that has to be made when training an HMM/DyNeMo is the number of states/modes. For burst detection, we are often interested in identifying the time points when a burst occurs. This can be achieved by fitting a two state HMM: and âonâ and âoffâ state. If weâre interested in multiple burst types, we can increase the number of states. In this work, we chose a three state HMM to stay close to the on/off description while allowing for multiple burst types. For the dynamic network analysis, we want a low number of states/modes to give us a compact representation of the data. A common choice is between 6 and 12. We can use the reproducibility analysis (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">section 2</xref> in the SI) to show a given number of states/modes is reproducible and use this to find an upper limit for the number of states/modes that can be reliably inferred.</p>
<p><monospace>osl-dynamics</monospace> offers a choice of two generative models for detecting network dynamics: the HMM and DyNeMo. The HMM assumes that there are mutually exclusive network states, whereas DyNeMo assumes the network modes are mixed differently at each time point. While DyNeMoâs assumption is arguably more realistic, the HMMâs stronger assumption has the benefit of simplifying the decomposition, which can make interpreting the network dynamics more straightforward. In short, the HMM and DyNeMo provide complementary descriptions of network dynamics, with either one being potentially useful depending on the context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. DyNeMo does have the additional advantage of using a richer temporal regularisation through the use of a deep recurrent network. This has been shown to capture longer range temporal structure than the HMM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>], and exploring the cognitive importance of long-range temporal structure is an interesting area of future investigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. It is possible to quantify which model is better using a downstream task. In this manuscript, the downsteam tasks are the evoked network response and young vs old group differences. We argue a better performance in the downstream task indicates a more useful model.</p>
<p><monospace>osl-dynamics</monospace> can also be used to compute static network descriptions, including conventional static functional connectivity. This uses the same methodology as the state (or mode) specific network estimation in the dynamic approaches, making comparisons between dynamic and static perspectives more straightforward. In <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3e">Section 3.5</xref>, we used this feature to relate the static functional network description to a dynamic perspective. We would like to stress that the young vs old study is used as an example of the type of group analyses that can be performed with this toolbox and that a more rigorous study with a larger population dataset is needed to understand the impact of ageing on functional networks. The results in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3e">Section 3.5</xref> should be taken as just an indication of possible ageing effects that can be investigated in a future study. In this report, we focus on the presentation of the tools needed to make such studies possible.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We present a new toolbox for studying time series data: <monospace>osl-dynamics</monospace>. This is an open-source package written in Python. We believe the availability of this package in Python improves the accessibility of these tools, in particular for non-technical users. Additionally, it avoids the need for a paid license. Using Python also enables us to take advantage of modern deep learning libraries (in particular <monospace>TensorFlow</monospace> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]) which enables us to scale these methods to very large datasets, something that is currently not possible with existing toolboxes.</p>
<p><monospace>osl-dynamics</monospace> can be used, and has been used, in a wide range of applications and on a variety of data modalities: electrophysiological, invasive local field potential, functional magnetic resonance imaging, etc. Here, we illustrated its use in applications of burst detection and dynamic network analysis using MEG data. This package also allows the user to study the static (time averaged) properties of a time series alongside dynamics within the same toolbox. The methods contained in <monospace>osl-dynamics</monospace> provide novel summary measures for dynamics and group-level analysis tools that can be used to inform our understanding of cognition, behaviour and disease.</p>

<title>Overview of <monospace>osl-dynamics</monospace></title>
<p>In this section, we provide an overview of the <monospace>osl-dynamics</monospace> package. This include a description of the source code (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s7a1">Section 1.1</xref>), installation (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s7a2">Section 1.2</xref>), documentation and tutorials (Section 1.3).</p>
<p>Note, <monospace>osl-dynamics</monospace> utilises many popular open-source scientific computing and data science packages in python: <monospace>numpy, scipy, pandas, sklearn,</monospace> etc<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11">11</xref></sup>. Virtually all the the plotting functions are wrappers for <monospace>matplotlib or nilearn. osl-dynamics</monospace> also uses the deep learning library <monospace>TensorFlow</monospace> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc1">1</xref>] to implement the models. This package enables us to easily scale to large datasets and take advantage of graphical processing units (GPUs), which can speed up training a model by a factor of 10.</p>

<title>Installation</title>
<p><monospace>osl-dynamics</monospace> can be installed on most modern computers in a similar fashion to other popular python packages via <monospace>pip</monospace> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc3">3</xref>]. Installation instructions can be found here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osl-dynamics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html">https://osl-dynamics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html</ext-link>. In short, <monospace>osl-dynamics</monospace> can be installed in three steps:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Create a virtual environment.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Install <monospace>TensorFlow</monospace> (and add ons).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Install <monospace>osl-dynamics</monospace>.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Note, the installation of <monospace>TensorFlow</monospace> is separate to <monospace>osl-dynamics</monospace> because there maybe computer/hardware specific differences which may require different installations of <monospace>TensorFlow</monospace>, see the <monospace>TensorFlow</monospace> documentation for further details [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc1">1</xref>].</p>
<p>For people who wish to contribute to development or would like to have access to the latest development version, <monospace>osl-dynamics</monospace> can also be installed from source using the instructions on the GitHub repository <monospace>README.md</monospace>.</p>

<title>Documentation and Tutorials</title>
<p>The official documentation for the <monospace>osl-dynamics</monospace> package is here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osl-dynamics.readthedocs.io/en/latest">https://osl-dynamics.readthedocs.io/en/latest</ext-link>. The documentation contains a short description of the models contained in osl-dynamics, a page for frequently asked questions (FAQs) and an API reference guide, which lists all the modules/classes and functions in the package. The API reference guide is useful for looking up the inputs and outputs of various functions/classes. The documentation also includes comprehensive tutorials describing each pipeline (as well as other analyses such as sliding windows and estimation of static networks) in more detail.</p>

<title>Reproducibility</title>
<p>We use variational Bayesian inference to learn model parameters (state/mode time courses and observation model means/covariances). This process involves updating the model parameters to minimise the <italic>variational free energy</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc4">4</xref>].</p>
<p>Each time we train an HMM (Hidden Markov Model) or DyNeMo (Dynamic Network Modes), we start from random model parameters and use a stochastic procedure to update the parameters. This leads to some variability in the final model parameters we converge to and their corresponding variational free energy. We deem the model parameters with the lowest free energy as the ones that best describe the data and use these for subsequence analysis. We deem a set of results as reproducible if we are consistently able to infer the same model parameters from a dataset. Empirically, we find picking the best run from a set of 10 consistently finds the same set of model parameters. Note, for a given set of hyperparameters, only the relative difference between values for the variational free energy is important.</p>
<p>We show the variational free energy for 3 sets of 10 runs in <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figures S1</xref>-<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">S5 (A)</xref>. In red we highlight the variational free energy for the best run (i.e. the one with the lowest value). Within a set of runs, we see large variability in the variational free energy which would reflect variability in the model parameters. Only looking at the best run across sets we see similar values for the variational free energy. In <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figures S1</xref>-<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">S5 (B)</xref>, we see the summary statistics for the best run from each set is very similar indicating we infer the same dynamics in each best run. In <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figures S2</xref>-<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">S5 (C)</xref>, we see we infer the same amplitude/power maps. In <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figures S2</xref>-<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">S5 (D)</xref>, we see we observe the same results from the group-level analysis across all 3 sets.</p>

<p>In their revised manuscript, the authors have addressed all the concerns raised earlier (written below for completeness).</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>These types of analyses use many underlying assumptions about the data, which are not easy to verify. Hence, one way to test how the algorithm is performing in a task is to study its performance on synthetic data in which the properties of the variable of interest can be apriori fixed. For example, for burst detection, synthetic data can be generated by injected bursts of known durations, and checking if the algorithm can pick it up. Burst detection is difficult in the spectral domain since direct spectral estimators have high variance (see Subhash Chandran et al., 2018, J Neurophysiol). Therefore, detected burst lengths are typically much lower than injected burst lengths (see their Figure 3). This problem can be solved by doing burst estimation in the time domain itself, for example, using Matching Pursuit (MP). I think the approach presented in this paper would also work since this model is also trained on data in the time domain. Indeed, the synthetic data can be made more &quot;challenging&quot; by injecting multiple oscillatory bursts that are overlapping in time, for which a greedy approach like MP may fail. It would be very interesting to test whether this method can &quot;keep up&quot; as the data is made more challenging. While showing results from brain signals directly (e.g., Figure 7) is nice, it will be even more impactful if it is backed up with results obtained from synthetic data with known properties.</p>
<p>I was wondering about what kind of &quot;synthetic data&quot; could be used for the results shown in Figure 8-12 but could not come up with a good answer. Perhaps data in which different sensory systems are activated (visual versus auditory) or sensory versus movement epochs are compared to see if the activation maps change as expected? We see similarities between states across multiple runs (reproducibility analysis) and across tasks (e.g. Figure 8 vs 9) and even methods (Figure 8 vs 10), which is great. However, we should also expect emergence of new modes specific to sensory activation (say auditory cortex for an auditory task). This will allow us to independently check the performance of this method.</p>
<p>The authors should explain the reproducibility results (variational free energy and best run analysis) in the Results section itself, to better orient the reader on what to look for.</p>
<p>Page 15: the comparison across subjects is interesting, but it is not clear why sensory-motor areas show a difference and the mean lifetime of the visual network decreases. Can you please explain this better? The promised discussion in section 3.5 can be expanded as well.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors have developed a comprehensive set of tools to describe dynamics within a single time-series or across multiple time-series. The motivation is to better understand interacting networks within the human brain. The time-series used here are from direct estimates of the brain's electrical activity; however the tools have been used with other metrics of brain function and would be applicable to many other fields.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The methods described are principled, based on generative probabilistic models.</p>
<p>
This makes them compact descriptors of the complex time-frequency data.</p>
<p>
Few initial assumptions are necessary in order to reveal this compact description.</p>
<p>
The methods are well described and demonstrated within multiple peer reviewed articles.</p>
<p>
This toolbox will be a great asset to the brain imaging community.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The only question I had (originally) was how to objectively/quantitatively compare different network models. This has now been addressed by the authors in the latest revision.</p>

<p>We completely agree with the reviewer that testing the methods using synthetic data is an important part of validating such an approach. Each of the original papers that apply these methods to a particular application do this. The focus of this manuscript is to present a toolbox for applying these methods rather than to introduce/validate the methods themselves. For a detailed validation of the methods, the reader should see the citations. For example, the following paper introduces the HMM as a method for oscillatory burst detection:</p>

<p>We have added text to paragraph 2 in section 2.5 to clarify this burst detection method has been validated using simulated data and added references.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>It is well known that the frequency and amplitude of neuronal oscillations changes with age. E.g. see the following review: Ishii, Ryouhei, et al. &quot;Healthy and pathological brain aging: from the perspective of oscillations, functional connectivity, and signal complexity.&quot; Neuropsychobiology 75.4 (2018): 151-161. We observe older people have more beta activity and less alpha activity. These changes are seen in time-averaged calculations, i.e. the amplitude of oscillations are calculated using the entire time series for each subject.</p>
<p>The dynamic analysis presented in the paper provides further insight into how changes in the time-averaged quantities can occur through changes in the dynamics of frequency-specific networks. The sensorimotor network, which is a network with high beta activity, has a higher fractional occupancy. This indicates the change we observe in time-average beta power may be due to a longer amount of time spent in the sensorimotor network. The visual network, which is a network with high alpha activity, shows reduced lifetimes, which can explain the reduced time-averaged alpha activity seen with ageing.</p>
<p>We hope the improved text in the last paragraph of section 3.5 clarifies this. It should also be taken into account that the focus of this manuscript is the tools rather than an in-depth analysis of ageing. We use the age effect as an example of the potential analysis this toolbox enables.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>This is a great paper outlining a resource that can be applied to many different fields. I have relatively minor comments apart from one.</p>
<p>How does one quantitatively compare network descriptors (from DyNeMo and TDE-HMM for example)? At the moment the word 'cleaner' (P17) is used, but is there any non-subjective way? (eg Free energy/ cross validation etc). At the moment it is useful that one method gives a larger effect size (in a comparison between groups).. but could the authors say something about the use of these methods as more/less faithful descriptors of the data? Or in other words, do all methods generate datasets (from the latent space) that can be quantitatively compared with the original data?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In principle, the variational free energy could be used to compare models. However, because we use an approximate variational free energy (an exact measure is not attainable) for DyNeMo and an exact free energy for the HMM, it is possible that any differences we see in the variational free energy between the HMM and Dynemo are caused by the errors in its approximation. This makes it unreliable for comparing across models.  That said, we can still use the variational free energy to compare within models. Indeed, we use the variational free energy for quantitative model comparisons when we select the best run to analyse from a set of 10.</p>
<p>One viable approach for comparing models is to assess their performance on downstream tasks. In this manuscript, examples of downstream tasks are the evoked network response and the young vs old group difference. We argue a better performance in the downstream task indicates a more useful model within that context. This performance is a quantitative measure. Note, there is no straightforward answer to which is the best model. It is likely different models will be useful for different downstream tasks.</p>
<p>In terms of which model provides a more faithful description of the data. The more flexible generative model for DyNeMo means it will generate more realistic data. However, this doesnât necessarily mean itâs the best model (for a particular downstream task). Both the HMM and DyNeMo provide complementary descriptions that can be useful.</p>
<p>We have clarified the above in paragraph 5 of section 4.</p>

<p>By concatenating the data across subjects, we learn a group-level model. By doing this, we pool information across all subjects to estimate the networks. This can lead to more robust estimates. We have moved this footnote to the main text in paragraph 1 of section 2.5 and added further information.</p>

<list-item><p>In the TDE burst detection section- please expand on why/how a specific number of states was chosen.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>As with the HMM dynamic network analysis, the number of states must be pre-specified. For burst detection, we are often interested in an on/off type segmentation, which can be achieved with a 2 state HMM. However, if there are multiple burst types, these will all be combined into a single âonâ state. Therefore, we might want to increase the number of states to model multiple burst types. 3 was chosen as a trade-off to stay close to the on/off description but allow the model to learn more than 1 burst type. We have added text discussing this in paragraph 4 of section 4.</p>

<list-item><p>Normally the value of free energy is just a function of the data - and only relative magnitude is important. I think figures (eg 7c) would be clearer if the offset could be removed.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree only the relative magnitude is important. We added text clarifying this in section 2 of the SI. We think it would still be worthwhile to include the offset so that future users can be sure they have correctly trained a model and calculated the free energy.</p>

<list-item><p>Related to the above- there are large differences in model evidence shown between sets. Yet all sets are the same data, and all parameter estimates are more or less the same. Could the authors account for this please (i.e. is there some other parameter that differentiates the best model in one set from the other sets, or is the free energy estimate a bit variable).</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to clarify only the model parameters for the best run are shown in the group-level analysis. This is the run with the lowest variational free energy, which is highlighted in red. We have now clarified this in the caption of each figure. The difference in free energy for the best runs (across sets) is relatively small compared to the variation across runs within a set. If we were to plot the model parameters for each of the 10 runs in a set, we would see more variability. We have now clarified this in section 2 of the SI.</p>
<p>Also note, the group analysis usually involves taking an average. Small differences in the variational free energy could reflect small differences in subject-specific model parameters, which are then averaged out, giving virtually identical group effects.</p>

<list-item><p>And related once again, if the data are always the same, I wonder if the free-energy plots and identical parameter estimates could be removed to free up space in figures?</p>

<list-item><p>Not sure of the value of tiny power maps in 9C. Would consider making it larger or removing it?</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>The scale of these power maps is identical to part (A.I). We have moved the reproducibility analysis to the SI, enlarged the figure and added colour bars. We hope the values are now legible.</p>

<list-item><p>Figure 3. I think the embedding in the caption doesn't match the figure (+-5 vs +-7 lags). Would be useful to add in the units of covariance (cii).</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>The number of embeddings in the caption has been fixed. Regarding the units for the covariances, as this is simulated data there arenât really any units. Note, there is already a colour bar to indicate the values of each element.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion. We have added a footnote (1).</p>

<list-item><p>Final question- and related to the Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data presented. These data are projected into source space using a beamformer algorithm (with its own implicit assumptions and vulnerabilities). Would be interested in the authors' opinion on what is standing between this work and a complete generative model of the MEG data - i.e. starting with cortical electrical current sources with interactions modeled and a dynamic environmental noise model (i.e. packing all assumptions into one model)?</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>In principle, there is nothing preventing us from including the forward model in the generative model and training on sensor level MEG data. This would be a generative model starting from the dipoles inside the brain to the MEG sensors. This is under active research. If the reviewer is referring to a biophysical model for brain activity, the main barrier for this is the inference of model parameters. However, note that the new inference framework presented in the DyNeMo paper (Gohil, et al. 2022) actually makes this more feasible. Given the scope of this manuscript is to present a toolbox for studying dynamics with existing methods, we leave this topic as future work.</p>
