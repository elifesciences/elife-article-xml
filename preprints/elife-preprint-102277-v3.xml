<title>Abstract</title><p>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), remains a global public health threat with considerable economic consequences. The non-structural protein 16 (nsp16), in complex with nsp10, facilitates the final viral mRNA capping step through its 2′-O-methylase activity, helping the virus to evade host immunity and prevent mRNA degradation. However, nsp16 regulation by host factors remains poorly understood. While various E3 ubiquitin ligases interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins, their roles in targeting nsp16 for degradation are unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that nsp16 undergoes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation mediated by the host E3 ligases UBR5 and MARCHF7. UBR5 induces K48-linked ubiquitination, whereas MARCHF7 promotes K27-linked ubiquitination, independently suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro and in vivo. Notably, UBR5 and MARCHF7 also degrade nsp16 variants from different viral strains, exhibiting broad-spectrum antiviral activity. Our findings reveal novel antiviral mechanisms of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and highlight their potential therapeutic targets against COVID-19.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains a global public health threat, with over 641 million coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and 6.6 million deaths as of December 2022 (Carabelli et al., 2023; Markov et al., 2023). The virus encodes four structural proteins, 16 non-structural proteins (nsps) involved in replication and transcription, and several accessory proteins (ORFs) linked to immune evasion (V’kovski et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2020). Many viruses, including Ebola (Valle et al., 2021), dengue (Jung et al., 2018), and reovirus (Furuichi et al., 1975), encode 2’-O methyltransferases (2’-O-MTases) that mimic the host 5’ cap structure to evade innate immune recognition (Daffis et al., 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Züst et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 nsp16, in complex with nsp10, functions as a 2′-O-MTase, modifying capped viral RNA from ‘cap-0’ to ‘cap-1’ (Benoni et al., 2021; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Park et al., 2022</xref>). This modification protects the virus from host antiviral defences, such as MDA5 recognition and IFIT1 restriction (Bergant et al., 2022; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Russ et al., 2022</xref>). Beyond immune evasion, nsp16 disrupts global host mRNA splicing, reducing cellular protein and mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Banerjee et al., 2020</xref>). Nsp16 also enhances SARS-CoV-2 entry by upregulating TMPRSS2 expression (Han et al., 2023), underscoring its role as a virulence factor. Notably, nsp16-deficient strains exhibit low pathogenicity and elicit robust immune responses, suggesting their potential as live-attenuated vaccines (Ye et al., 2022). Given the critical functions of nsp16, inhibitors targeting nsp16 or the nsp16<monospace>-</monospace>nsp10 complex have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Klima et al., 2022</xref>; Nguyen et al., 2022). Therefore, understanding host factors that regulate nsp16 is essential for identifying new therapeutic strategies.</p>
<p>The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is a key pathway for targeted protein degradation, often described as ‘the molecular kiss of death’ (Dongdem &amp; Wezena, 2021; Park et al., 2020). Substrate ubiquitination involves a cascade of three enzymes: E1 activating enzyme, E2 conjugating enzyme, and E3 ubiquitin ligase (Zheng &amp; Shabek, 2017). Some E3 ubiquitin ligases function as monomers, whereas others assemble into multi-subunit complexes. Regardless of their structure, all E3 ligases play a crucial role in substrate recognition, dictating UPS specificity. In certain complexes, an additional protein may function as a substrate receptor, mediating substrate-specific recognition (Iconomou &amp; Saunders, 2016; Yang et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022). Over 600 E3 ligases encoded in the human genome regulate diverse cellular processes in response to various signals (Dongdem &amp; Wezena, 2021; Garcia-Barcena et al., 2020). Dysregulation of their activity is linked to multiple diseases, making them attractive therapeutic targets (Humphreys et al., 2021). Based on conserved domains and ubiquitin (Ub) transfer mechanisms, E3 ligases are categorised into three classes: Really Interesting New Gene (RING), homologous to the E6AP carboxyl terminus (HECT), and RING-between-RING (RBR) ligases (Garcia-Barcena et al., 2020; Morreale &amp; Walden, 2016). RING E3s transfer Ub directly from the E2-Ub complex to substrates (Deshaies &amp; Joazeiro, 2009), whereas HECT-type E3s first attach Ub to their own catalytic cysteine before transferring it (Huibregtse et al., 1995). These distinct mechanisms highlight the complexity and versatility of E3 ligase function in cellular regulation (Walden &amp; Rittinger, 2018; Garcia-Barcena et al., 2020).</p>
<p>To investigate the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and host factors, we focused on UPS proteins that interact with nsp16. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that nsp16 undergoes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Notably, two E3 ligases from distinct families—RING-type MARCHF7 and HECT-type UBR5—independently target nsp16 for degradation, disrupting its function and exhibiting strong antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Our findings reveal novel therapeutic targets for combating SARS-CoV-2 and treating COVID-19.</p>

<title>SARS-CoV-2 nsp16 is degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway</title>
<p>Ubiquitination plays a crucial role in SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Gao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Guo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Li et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Zhang et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). To determine whether SARS-CoV-2 non-structural proteins (nsps) are UPS-regulated, we examined the effect of the proteasome inhibitor, MG132, on nsps expression. MG132 treatment significantly increased the nsp8, nsp11, and nsp16 abundance in HEK293T cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), suggesting UPS-mediated degradation. Nsp8 undergoes TRIM22-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Fan et al., 2024</xref>). In this study, we focused on nsp16 for further investigation. To confirm UPS-mediated nsp16 degradation, we tested additional proteasome inhibitors, Bortezomib and Carfilzomib, both of which enhanced nsp16 stability. In contrast, lysosomal inhibitors (Bafilomycin A1 and NH<sub>4</sub>Cl) and the autophagy-lysosomal inhibitor, Vinblastine, had no such effect (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). To further assess the role of the UPS in regulating nsp16 stability, we treated nsp16-expressing cells with cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, and measured the half-life of nsp16. MG132 treatment significantly prolonged nsp16 stability, extending its half-life from 2 h to 15 h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>).</p>

    <caption><title>The non-structural protein nsp16 of SARS-CoV-2 was identified that can be degraded through the proteasome pathway.</title><p>A. The non-structural proteins nsp8, nsp11 and nsp16 could be restored by the proteasome inhibitor MG132. HEK293T cells in 12-well plates were transfected with the plasmids of 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1-16) encoded by SARS-CoV-2. Thirty-six hours later, the cells were treated with MG132 (10 µM) or DMSO for 12 h before collection. The protein level was detected by Immunoblotting (IB). Quantification of nsp protein levels relative to the control protein is shown. Data are representative of three independent experiments and shown as average ±SD (n = 3). Significance was determined by a two-tailed t-test: *P &lt; 0.05; **P &lt; 0.01; ***P &lt; 0.001. B. Proteasomal inhibitors but no other inhibitors stabilized nsp16 protein. HEK293T cells transfected with the nsp16-Flag expression vector were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), MG132 (10 µM), Bortezomib (10 µM), Carfilzomib (10 µM), Bafilomycin A1 (5 µM), Vinblastine (2.5 µM), or NH<sub>4</sub>CL (2.5 µM) for 12 h prior to harvest. The cell lysates were analyzed by anti-Flag antibody. (C-D). The half-life of nsp16 was prolonged by the proteasome inhibitor MG132. C. HEK293T cells were transfected with the nsp16-Flag-expressing plasmids. 12 hours later, the cells were treated with DMSO or MG132 (10 µM) for 12 h, then 50 µg/mL cycloheximide (CHX) was added. Cells were harvested at the indicated times to detect the level of viral protein by anti-Flag antibody. D. Quantification of nsp16 protein levels relative to tubulin at different time points is shown. The half-life of the nsp16 protein was determined based on protein quantification using Image J, combined with the protein half-life formula for calculation. Results are shown as mean ± SD (n = 3 independent experiments). ***, P &lt; 0.001 by by a two-tailed t-test. E. Samples were prepared for mass spectrometry, and nsp16 interacting proteins were obtained by immunoprecipitation (IP) (created with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://BioRender.com/h43f612">BioRender.com</ext-link> and the agreement no. is LC27PCBEOF). The plasmids were transfected into HEK293T cells for 48 h. Treat cells with or without MG132 (10 µM) for 12 h prior to harvest. The whole-cell lysates were incubated with protein G agarose beads conjugated with anti-Flag antibodies and used for IB with anti-Flag antibodies to detect the nsp16 protein. Samples enriched for proteins were analyzed by mass spectrometry.</p></caption>

<p>To identify nsp16-interacting proteins, we performed co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) followed by mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, comparing nsp16-expressing cells with and without MG132 treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) analyses (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A) revealed that inhibiting nsp16 degradation increased its interacting proteins, including 43 associated with viral processes, 22 involved in mRNA stability regulation, and five linked to cellular antiviral defence. Additionally, interactions related to mRNA splicing and RNA methylation were identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Banerjee et al., 2020</xref>), consistent with the function of nsp16 as a 2′-O-MTase. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 exploits nsp16 to disrupt host mRNA splicing, which promotes infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Park et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Russ et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Züst et al., 2011</xref>), further validating our MS data.</p>
<p>As expected, several nsp16-binding proteins were associated with ubiquitination and degradation pathways (Figure 1-figure supplement 1B). We identified four deubiquitinases (DUBs), the E2 ligase UBE2D3, and 14 proteasomal enzymes. Among them, six E3 ligases—UBR5, MARCHF7, HECTD1, TRIM32, MYCBP2, and TRIM21—were selected for further investigation.</p>

<title>E3 ligases, UBR5 and MARCHF7, independently mediate nsp16 degradation</title>
<p>To identify the E3 ligases responsible for nsp16 degradation, we designed small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting six candidate E3 ligases and assessed their effects on nsp16 abundance. UBR5 and MARCHF7 knockdown significantly stabilised nsp16 protein levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). To further investigate their roles in nsp16 degradation, we generated stable cell lines with UBR5 or MARCHF7 knockdowns and confirmed silencing efficiency (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). To determine whether UBR5 and MARCHF7 function cooperatively, we performed dual knockdowns. Silencing UBR5 in MARCHF7-knockdown cells, and vice versa, further enhanced nsp16 stability, indicating that these ligases act independently (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Overexpression studies further supported their independent roles—MARCHF7 overexpression induced nsp16 degradation even in MARCHF7-knockdown and MARCHF7/UBR5 double-knockdown cells. Similarly, UBR5 overexpression promoted nsp16 degradation despite MARCHF7 knockdown. Silencing efficiencies were validated across all experiments (Figure 2 — figure supplement 1A and 1B). Notably, wild-type MARCHF7 and UBR5, but not their mutants lacking functional RING (1-542 aa) or HECT domains, respectively, effectively degraded nsp16 in knockdown cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). These findings confirm that UBR5 and MARCHF7 independently mediate nsp16 ubiquitination via their HECT and RING domains, targeting it for proteasomal degradation.</p>

<caption><title>MARCHF7 and UBR5 were identified as E3 ubiquitin ligases involves in nsp16 protein degradation.</title><p>A. Knockdown of MARCHF7 or UBR5 resulted in nsp16 restoration. HEK293T cells were transfected with siRNA of E3 ligase candidates for 24 h, followed by co-incubation with the nsp16-Flag-expressing plasmids for 48 h, treated with MG132 (10 µM) for 16h before harvesting, lysed, and subjected to IB assay using anti-Flag antibody. RT-qPCR was conducted to determine the mRNA expression levels of E3 ligase candidates. The si-RNA targeting regions for the candidate E3 ubiquitin ligase proteins and the targeted regions for RT-qPCR are shown in Appendix-figure S1A. Data are representative of three independent experiments and shown as average ± SD (n = 3). Significance was determined by a two-tailed t-test: ***P &lt; 0.001. B. RNA levels of UBR5 or MARCHF7 from HEK293T cells infected with lentivirus containing control or shRNA targeting UBR5 or MARCHF7 for 48 h and screened with antibiotics for 48 h. Knockdown cell lines were transfected with plasmids expressing nsp16-Flag, collected at the indicated times, and the protein levels of nsp16, MARCHF7, and UBR5 were detected by IB.C. MARCHF7 and UBR5 acted separately and did not depend on each other. HEK293T cells stably expressing UBR5 shRNA or MARCHF7 shRNA were transfected with siRNA of MARCHF7 or UBR5 for 24 h, respectively, followed by co-incubation with the nsp16-Flag-expressing plasmids for 48 h. The protein levels and the RNA levels of nsp16, UBR5 and MARCHF7 were measured by IB and RT-qPCR, respectively. (D-E). In HEK293T cells stably expressing UBR5 shRNA or MARCHF7 shRNA, nsp16 was degraded by overexpressed UBR5 or MARCHF7, respectively, whereas the mutant failed to degrade nsp16. The cell lysates were analyzed by anti-Flag antibody.</p></caption>

<p>We first confirmed nsp16 ubiquitination both with and without exogenous ubiquitin (Ub) expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-B</xref>). To investigate the role of E3 ligases in this process, we examined the impact of UBR5 and MARCHF7 knockdown on nsp16 ubiquitination. Silencing either ligase reduced nsp16 ubiquitination compared to the negative control, indicating their involvement in this modification (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Ub contains seven lysine residues (K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, and K63), which form polyubiquitin chains with distinct functions that determine the fate of the attached protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Grice &amp; Nathan, 2016</xref>). To identify the specific polyubiquitin chain types formed on nsp16 by UBR5 and MARCHF7, we used a series of Ub mutants, each retaining only a single lysine residue. Except for K33, all single-lysine Ub mutants supported nsp16 ubiquitination to varying degrees, suggesting a complex ubiquitin architecture potentially regulated by multiple E3 ligases or E2-E3 pairs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Further analysis of lysine-specific linkages revealed that MARCHF7 primarily mediates K27-linked ubiquitination of nsp16, whereas UBR5 facilitates K48-linked ubiquitination (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>). These findings establish that UBR5 and MARCHF7 independently regulate nsp16 degradation through distinct ubiquitin linkages.</p>

The level of ubiquitination of nsp16 decreased with decreasing the protein levels of MARCHF7 or UBR5.

Whole cell lysates were incubated with anti-HA beads, and polyubiquitinated chains of nsp16 were detected by IB with anti-Myc or anti-HA antibodies. D. Nsp16 can be modified by a variety of ubiquitin chains. HEK293T cells were transfected with either nsp16-HA alone or together with plasmids encoding various mutants of ubiquitin (K6 only, K11 only, K27 only, K29 only, K33 only, K48 only, K63 only).

<title>UBR5 and MARCHF7 directly interact and colocalise with nsp16 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)</title>
<p>MS analysis suggested interactions between nsp16 and both UBR5 and MARCHF7. Co-IP experiments confirmed that Myc-tagged MARCHF7 and endogenous UBR5 bind to nsp16 (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and 1B). To assess whether these interactions are direct, we performed fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays. When nsp16-YFP was bleached, the fluorescence intensity of CFP-UBR5 and CFP-MARCHF7 increased, confirming direct interactions (Figure 4 — figure supplement 1C). ImageJ software was used to quantify relative fluorescence intensities (Figure 4 — figure supplement 1D). To determine whether UBR5 and MARCHF7 depend on each other for nsp16 binding, we examined the effect of MARCHF7 knockdown on UBR5-nsp16 interactions, and vice versa, using Co-IP. The interactions remained unchanged, indicating that UBR5 and MARCHF7 independently bind to nsp16 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). Nsp16 localises to both the nucleus and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). UBR5 (containing two nuclear localization signals) and MARCHF7 are also present in both compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Muñoz-Escobar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Shearer et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Nathan et al., 2008</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining revealed that UBR5 and MARCHF7 colocalised with nsp16 predominantly in the cytoplasm, with some nuclear colocalization observed in HeLa cells (Figure 4—figure supplement 1E). Similar results were obtained in nsp16-transfected HEK293T cells using antibodies against endogenous UBR5 and MARCHF7 (Figure 4—figure supplement 1F).</p>

Notably, UBR5 and MARCHF7 both interacted with nsp16 and colocalised with PDI, but not with COX5A or GM130 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>), indicating that both E3 ligases interact with nsp16 primarily in the ER.</p>

<title>Functional domains of UBR5 and MARCHF7 are required for nsp16 interaction and ubiquitination</title>
<p>UBR5 is a four-domain E3 ligase containing two nuclear localization signals. Its domains include UBA, UBR, PABC, and HECT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Muñoz-Escobar et al., 2015</xref>) (Figure 4— figure supplement 2A). Notably, the HECT domain is critical for its E3 ligase activity, as UBR5 must first conjugate to Ub before transferring it to substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kim et al., 2021</xref>). To determine which UBR5 domain mediates nsp16 ubiquitination, we used UBR5 mutants with individual domain inactivations. Only the HECT domain mutant failed to degrade nsp16 (Figure 4—figure supplement 2B), consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). This mutant also lost the ability to ubiquitinate nsp16, confirming the essential role of the HECT domain in this process (Figure 4—figure supplement 2C).</p>
<p>To identify the MARCHF7 region responsible for nsp16 degradation, we generated a series of truncation mutants as described previously (Figure 4—figure supplement 2D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Nathan et al., 2008</xref>). All mutants lost the ability to degrade nsp16 (Figure 4 — figure supplement 2E). Further analysis revealed that only the mutant containing the intact N-terminal region (aa 1–542) strongly bound to nsp16, while those retaining the active RING domain region (aa 543–616) did not. Consistently, only wild-type MARCHF7 promoted K27-linked ubiquitination of nsp16 (Figure 4—figure supplement 2F).</p>
<p>These results indicate that the N-terminal region of MARCHF7 is essential for nsp16 binding, whereas its RING domain is required for K27-linked ubiquitination activity.</p>

<title>UBR5 and MARCHF7 suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication by targeting nsp16 for degradation</title>
<p>To assess the impact of nsp16 degradation on viral replication, we used a biosafety level 2 system to generate SARS-CoV-2 transmissible virus-like particles capable of infecting Caco2-N<sup>int</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ju et al., 2021</xref>). Knockdown of either UBR5 or MARCHF7 significantly increased SARS-CoV-2 replication, with simultaneous knockdown further enhancing viral replication (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and 1B).</p>
<p>To investigate nsp16 modifications following infection, we infected HEK293T-ACE2 cells with the Wuhan strain for 48 h. Co-IP using an anti-nsp16 antibody confirmed its interaction with endogenous MARCHF7 and UBR5, along with ubiquitination (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). In a biosafety level 3 facility, we further validated the antiviral roles of UBR5 and MARCHF7 using the Wuhan (MOI 0.01) and Omicron strains (MOI 0.001). Knockdown of either E3 ligase in Caco2 cells significantly increased intracellular and secreted viral mRNA levels (M and E genes) for both strains. Viral titres in the supernatants also increased, with UBR5 knockdown causing over a 1-log rise for the Wuhan strain and even greater effects for Omicron (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C–E</xref> and 5F–H for the Wuhan and Omicron strains, respectively). Immunoblotting confirmed increased intracellular and secreted N protein levels upon UBR5 or MARCHF7 knockdown (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>), with knockdown efficiencies verified (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Due to low transfection efficiency in Caco2 cells, we overexpressed UBR5-Myc or MARCH7-Myc in HEK293T-ACE2 cells. Overexpression significantly reduced viral mRNA (M and E genes) and N protein levels in both strains, accompanied by a 0.5-log decrease in viral titres. However, co-transfection with increasing nsp16 levels counteracted these inhibitory effects (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A–H</xref> and Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–H). To confirm the role of UBR5 and MARCHF7 enzymatic activity, we overexpressed catalytically inactive mutants (UBR5-Δ HECT or MARCHF7-aa 1-542) alongside nsp16. These mutants failed to suppress viral replication. Additionally, gradual increases in nsp16 expression did not further enhance viral replication, with only a slight increase in M mRNA, while E and N protein levels remained unchanged (Figure 6—figure supplement 2A–H). These findings demonstrate that UBR5 and MARCHF7 exert antiviral effects by ubiquitinating and degrading nsp16, thereby significantly inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication.</p>

<title>UBR5 and MARCHF7 mediate nsp16 variant degradation</title>
<p>With the continuous emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, broad-spectrum antiviral strategies have become essential. To assess whether UBR5 and MARCHF7 mediate various nsp16 variants, we analysed nsp16 amino acid sequences from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (Figure 6 — figure supplement 3A). Most variants had one or two mutations, except for XBB.1.9.1, XBB.1.5, and XBB.1.16, which contained more mutations, suggesting a conserved sequence. We used mutagenesis to synthesise nsp16 sequences for these three variants, along with several single-site mutants from other variants. Treatment with MG132 restored nsp16 protein levels for all variants (Figure 6 — figure supplement 3B), confirming UPS-mediated degradation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, UBR5 or MARCHF7 knockdown stabilised nsp16 proteins from these variants, though to varying degrees (Figure 6 — figure supplement 3C). These results suggest that UBR5 and MARCHF7 contribute to broad-spectrum antiviral activity by targeting nsp16 from diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants for degradation.</p>

<title>SARS-CoV-2 infection reduces UBR5 and MARCHF7 expression</title>
<p>To investigate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on UBR5 and MARCHF7 expression, we analysed their mRNA and protein levels following infection with the Wuhan and Omicron strains at varying MOIs using RT-qPCR and immunoblotting. MARCHF7 expression decreased consistently with increasing viral titres, whereas UBR5 levels initially rose at low titres before declining as infection progressed (Figure 6—figure supplement 4A-4C). This transient UBR5 upregulation may be linked to its role in interferon-γ-mediated pathways, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Wu et al., 2022</xref>). To confirm these findings in vivo, we examined UBR5 and MARCHF7 mRNA levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with varying disease severity. UBR5 expression negatively correlated with disease progression, whereas MARCHF7 levels showed no significant correlation (Figure 6—figure supplement 4D). These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may actively suppress host antiviral defences by downregulating UBR5 and MARCHF7 expression.</p>

E3 ligase overexpression significantly reduced viral E gene copy numbers in the lungs and markedly decreased viral titres (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C-D</xref>). Additionally, treated mice experienced less weight loss compared to controls (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>).

Immunoblotting further confirmed lower N protein abundance in treated mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 nsp16 functions as a 2′-O-methyltransferase (2′-O-MTase), catalysing penultimate nucleotide methylation of the viral RNA cap. This modification allows SARS-CoV-2 to mimic host mRNA, evading immune detection and response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lin et al., 2020</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Balieiro et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Russ et al., 2022</xref>). High-resolution structures of nsp16 and nsp16-nsp10 heterodimers have been characterised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Rosas-Lemus et al., 2020</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Klima et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lugari et al., 2010</xref>), providing a foundation for antiviral drug development targeting these complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Balieiro et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Melo-Filho et al., 2022</xref>). However, host factors that interact with and regulate nsp16 remain largely unknown.</p>
<p>Previous studies, including work from our group, have highlighted the role of the UPS in modulating SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Xu et al., 2022</xref>). Several host E3 ligases—such as RNF5, Cullin4-DDB1-PRPF19, ZNF598, and TRIM7 — ubiquitinate and degrade key SARS-CoV-2 proteins, thereby suppressing viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Li et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Liang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Maimaitiyiming et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Zhang et al., 2024</xref>). In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 uses deubiquitinases (DUBs) to counteract these defences and enhance viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Gao et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Gao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Guo et al., 2021</xref>). In this study, we identify nsp16 as a short-lived protein with a half-life of only 2 – 3 h, which is targeted for ubiquitination and degradation via the UPS. Using MS and bioinformatics screening, we identified two E3 ligases, UBR5 and MARCHF7, that directly interact with nsp16 and mediate nsp16 ubiquitination and degradation.</p>
<p>UBR5, a member of the UBR box protein family, contains a HECT domain essential for its E3 ligase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kim et al., 2021</xref>). UBR5 regulates tumour growth, metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Xiang et al., 2022</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Qiao et al., 2020</xref>), and viral infections. For instance, UBR5 targets the ORF4b protein of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) for degradation, reducing its ability to counteract the host immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). Conversely, UBR5 supports Zika virus replication by assisting TER94/VCP in degrading the capsid protein, allowing viral genome release into the cytoplasm (Gestuveo et al.).</p>
<p>MARCHF7, a RING E3 ligase, plays a role in T cell proliferation, neuronal development, inflammasome regulation, and tumour progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Zheng, 2021</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cai et al., 2022</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). However, its involvement in viral infections remains largely unexplored, with one study identifying it as a host protein interacting with the 2C protein of foot-and-mouth disease virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Mahajan et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Our findings demonstrate that UBR5 and MARCHF7 independently interact with nsp16 and facilitate its degradation, primarily on the cytoplasmic ER. Our findings highlight the ongoing evolutionary battle between viruses, which evolve strategies to evade host defences, and hosts, which deploy multiple mechanisms to counteract viral infections. One such strategy is the use of multiple E3 ligases targeting the same viral protein for degradation. Functional analyses revealed that knocking down UBR5 or MARCHF7 enhanced SARS-CoV-2 replication, whereas their overexpression impaired it. Moreover, when their enzymatic activity was inactivated, the antiviral effect was abolished, confirming that their E3 ligase activity is essential for viral suppression. Notably, nsp16 overexpression alone did not increase viral levels in the absence of functional UBR5 or MARCHF7. This underscores the critical antiviral role of UBR5 and MARCHF7 in restricting SARS-CoV-2 by promoting nsp16 degradation.</p>
<p>Due to the presence of 18 lysine residues in nsp16, identifying specific ubiquitination sites was challenging. Using structural data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Decroly et al., 2011</xref>), we constructed truncated nsp16 mutants to assess their degradation profiles. Our results showed that nsp16 mutants degradation occurred to varying degrees (Appendix-figure S2A-B), suggesting that multiple lysine residues serve as recognition sites for E3 ligases. Furthermore, MG132 recovery experiments provided valuable insights. The Δ2-17 mutant, which lacks this segment, exhibited more than a two-fold increase in nsp16 expression, whereas the Δ204-212 mutant showed significantly reduced recovery after MG132 treatment compared to the wild-type. These observations offer important clues for further investigation into the interaction regions between nsp16 and MARCHF7 or UBR5, as well as potential ubiquitination sites. MS analysis identified K76 as a ubiquitination site (Appendix-figure S2C). However, the nsp16 K76R mutant still underwent degradation, though its ubiquitination level was reduced compared to that of the wild-type, indicating that K76 is one of several ubiquitination sites (Appendix-figure S2D-E). This suggests that nsp16 may undergo ubiquitination at multiple sites or through non-canonical pathways at non-lysine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">McClellan et al., 2019</xref>). Beyond UBR5 and MARCHF7, other E3 ligases may also contribute to nsp16 regulation, warranting further investigation into additional host factors involved in SARS-CoV-2 restriction.</p>
<p>Currently, no specific activators or inhibitors exist for UBR5 or MARCHF7. To assess their antiviral effects in vivo, we used high-pressure tail vein injection, a gene delivery method primarily targeting the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Kamimura et al., 2014</xref>) but also effective for lung tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bonamassa et al., 2011</xref>). Gene expression was successfully detected in the lungs, and while this method induced mild immune activation, its effect was minimal compared to other techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Suda et al., 2023</xref>). Notably, mice and non-human primates exhibit greater resistance to innate immune activation than humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Raper et al., 2003</xref>), suggesting that immune activation had little influence on our results. However, translating these findings into therapeutic applications remains challenging. For instance, human trials using naked DNA injections (e.g., OTC cDNA) have shown variable immune responses, with one case of fatal immune activation reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Raper et al., 2003</xref>). This underscores the variability of human immune responses and the challenges in translating findings from animal models to clinical applications. Such variability may also explain the inconsistent trends in MARCHF7 mRNA levels observed in peripheral blood samples from patients with different disease severities. Additionally, the small sample size in our study may have contributed to this observation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, in this study, we identified the host E3 ligases UBR5 and MARCHF7 as key regulators of SARS-CoV-2 nsp16, facilitating its ubiquitination and degradation. We observed a negative correlation between their expression levels and infection severity, highlighting their antiviral function. Moreover, both ligases effectively suppressed SARS-CoV-2 replication. These findings provide a foundation for developing UPS-targeted therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 treatment.</p>

<p>In this study, Tiang et al. explore the role of ubiquitination of non-structural protein 16 (nsp16) in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. nsp16, in conjunction with nsp10, performs the final step of viral mRNA capping through its 2'-O-methylase activity. This modification allows the virus to evade host immune responses and protects its mRNA from degradation. The authors demonstrate that nsp16 undergoes ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the host E3 ubiquitin ligases UBR5 and MARCHF7 via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Specifically, UBR5 and MARCHF7 mediate nsp16 degradation through K48- and K27-linked ubiquitination, respectively. Notably, degradation of nsp16 by either UBR5 or MARCHF7 operates independently, with both mechanisms effectively inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, UBR5 and MARCHF7 exhibit broad-spectrum antiviral activity by targeting nsp16 variants from various SARS-CoV-2 strains. This research advances our understanding of how nsp16 ubiquitination impacts viral replication and highlights potential targets for developing broadly effective antiviral therapies.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The proposed study is of significant interest to the virology community because it aims to elucidate the biological role of ubiquitination in coronavirus proteins and its impact on the viral life cycle. Understanding these mechanisms will address broadly applicable questions about coronavirus biology and enhance our overall knowledge of ubiquitination's diverse functions in cell biology. Employing in vivo studies is a strength.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript &quot;SARS-CoV-2 nsp16 is regulated by host E3 ubiquitin ligases, UBR5 and MARCHF7&quot; is an interesting work by Tian et al. describing the degradation/ stability of NSP16 of SARS CoV2 via K48 and K27-linked Ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. The authors have demonstrated that UBR5 and MARCHF7, an E3 ubiquitin ligase bring about the ubiquitination of NSP16. The concept, and experimental approach to prove the hypothesis looks ok. The in vivo data looks ok with the controls. Overall, the manuscript is good.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study identified important E3 ligases (MARCHF7 and UBR5) that can ubiquitinate NSP16, an important viral factor.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>I had gone through the revised form of the manuscript thoroughly. The authors have addressed all of my concerns. To me, the experimental approach looks convincing that the host E3 ubiquitin ligases (UBR5 and MARCHF7) ubiquitinate NSP16 and mark it for proteasomal degradation via K48- and K27- linkage. The authors have represented the final figure (Fig.8) in a convincing manner, opening a new window to explore the mechanism of capping the vRNA bu NSP16.</p>
