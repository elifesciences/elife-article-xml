<title>Abstract</title><p>Spontaneous activity of neurons during early ontogenesis is instrumental for stabilization and refinement of developing neuronal connections. The role of spontaneous activity in synaptic development has been described in detail for cortical-like structures. Yet, very little is known about activity-dependent development of long-range inhibitory projections, such as projections from striatum. Here, we show that striatal projection neurons (SPNs) in dorsal striatum are spontaneously active in P4-P14 mice. Spontaneous activity was detected in both direct-pathway SPNs (dSPNs) and indirect-pathway SPNs (iSPNs). Most of the spontaneously active cells were in striosomes – a chemical compartment in striatum defined by expression of µ-opioid receptor. Higher excitability of both striosomal dSPNs and iSPNs was related to their intrinsic excitability properties (higher action potential half-width and IV slope). Tonic activation of muscarinic M1 receptor maintains the spontaneous activity of striosomal SPNs, the effect being stronger in iSPNs and weaker in dSPNs. To investigate if the neonatal spontaneous activity is needed for the stabilization of SPN long-range projections, we chemogenetically inhibited striosomal SPNs in neonatal animals and studied the efficiency of striatonigral projections in adult animals. Inhibition of striosomal SPNs by chronic CNO administration to P6-14 pups caused a reduction in the functional GABAergic innervation and in the density of gephyrin puncta in dopaminergic neurons of substantia nigra pars compacta of the adult (P52-79) animals. Chronic administration of CNO later in development (P21-29), on the contrary, resulted in higher mIPSC frequency in dopaminergic cells of the adult animals. Thus, the activity-dependent stabilization of striosomal projections has different developmental phases, and the long-term outcome of perturbations in these processes depends on the developmental period when they occur. Taken together, our results demonstrate that spontaneous activity of SPNs is essential for the maturation and stabilization of striatal efferents.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>During early stages of brain development, when sensory inputs are not yet fully functional, maturation of the neuronal networks is guided by the spontaneous activity, generated by the developing neurons. Activity-dependent development is described in detail for the brain areas, where projection neurons are glutamatergic (e.g. cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Molnár et al., 2020</xref>), thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Martini et al., 2021</xref>) and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cossart &amp; Khazipov, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Huupponen et al., 2013</xref>)). However, maturation of the neuronal networks in the subcortical regions interconnected with the inhibitory pathways is not yet fully understood. One of such inhibitory nodes of the brain is the striatum.</p>
<p>The dorsal striatum is a subcortical part of the forebrain and an input site of the basal ganglia. It coordinates multiple aspects of cognition, including initiation of spontaneous movements, goal-directed and procedural behavior, motivation and reward perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Balleine &amp; O’Doherty, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Floresco, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gremel &amp; Costa, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Tecuapetla et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Varin et al., 2023</xref>). Striatal projection neurons (SPNs) are GABAergic, and exert a strong inhibition on projection targets and within the striatal microcircuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Nelson &amp; Kreitzer, 2014</xref>). Main information flows reach striatum from cortex, thalamus and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc); and SPNs pass it along the thalamo-cortical loop and then towards the motor nuclei of the brain stem. Striatal projections form two distinct pathways, one initiating, and another inhibiting movement (direct-pathway SPNs, dSPNs and indirect-pathway SPNs, iSPNs). SPNs are located in striosomal and matrix compartments – two neurochemically distinct regions of striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Prager &amp; Plotkin, 2019</xref>). Matrix-located SPNs form parts of sensorimotor and associative circuits, whereas striosomes contain SPNs that receive input from limbic cortex and project to the dopamine-containing neurons of SNpc.</p>
<p>During early development, SPNs are hyperexcitable and spontaneously active, generating calcium transients and action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Comhair et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dehorter et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kozorovitskiy et al., 2012</xref>). Starting from embryonic day 16 (E16), a fraction of neonatal SPNs display spontaneous calcium transients, accompanied by action potentials. Spontaneously active SPNs are present until postnatal day 10 (P10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dehorter et al., 2011</xref>), after which they become silent and acquire adult-type electrophysiological profile due to expression of potassium inward rectifier channels (KIRs). At the behavioral level, this corresponds to the time when pups start to move actively and exit the nest. Spontaneous activity, however, was detected only in 30% of the neonatal SPNs recorded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Comhair et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dehorter et al., 2011</xref>). Neonatal activity of SPNs has also been shown by multi-channel recording <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Klavinskis-Whiting et al., 2023</xref>). This neonatal activity is organized in bursts, which have different frequency structure, than the adult-type ones, and spreads along the cortico-striato-thalamic loop, probably mediating distinct directional interactions among the basal ganglia structures.</p>
<p>Neuronal activity and subsequent glutamate release are essential for stabilizing cortico-striatal synapses during early postnatal development <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kuhlmann et al., 2021</xref>) and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kozorovitskiy et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">2015</xref>). Arresting the GABAergic transmission or hyperpolarization of the SPNs by chemogenetic approach during first three weeks resulted in the changes of cortical input in P15 animals, assuming the neonatal activity-dependent modulation of the whole basal ganglia circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kozorovitskiy et al., 2012</xref>). However, nothing is known about the activity-dependent maturation of the long-range GABAergic projections.</p>
<p>Taken together, these data show that, like other brain structures, striatum generates and conducts neonatal activity waves, which have frequency characteristics, distinct from adult-type activity. These neonatal waves propagate along the basal ganglia network and support the development and stabilization of synaptic connections. However, two important questions were left open: do all types of SPNs display spontaneous activity in a similar way, and how does neonatal activity guide the development of striatal GABAergic projections – does the “fire together – wire together” rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Katz &amp; Shatz, 1996</xref>) still apply there? We approached these questions here by characterizing the spontaneous activity of neonatal dSPNs and iSPNs, located in either striosomes or matrix; and evaluating the impact of chemogenetic silencing of striosomal SPNs on the development of striato-nigral projections.</p>
</sec>

<title>Results</title>
<p>It has been shown before that about 30% of SPNs in the dorsal striatum of one-week old mice fire spontaneous action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Comhair et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dehorter et al., 2011</xref>). This low number of spontaneously active SPNs may reflect the heterogeneity in the timing and properties of development of different functional domains of striatum. To check this hypothesis, we evaluated the spontaneous activity and intrinsic excitability of developing SPNs of direct (dSPNs) and indirect (iSPNs) pathways, located either in striosomal or matrix compartments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1A</xref>). dSPNs and iSPNs were recorded in the dorsal striatum of D1-Cre/Ai14 and A2a-Cre/Ai14 animals. Striosomal compartments were recognized in the slices by the higher density of tdTomato signal. Striosomal SPNs are generated two days earlier than matrix SPNs, and consequently, start to express the identity marker proteins earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Passante et al., 2008</xref>). We confirmed that clusters of dense tdTomato fluorescence in the neonatal striatum correspond to striosomes by immunostaining of striatal slices of one-week-old D1-Cre/Ai14 and A2a-Cre/Ai14 animals for the specific striosomal marker µ-opioid receptor (MOR, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Specific tdTomato clustering was not visible in D1-Cre/Ai14 slices after P10 and in A2a-Cre/Ai14 slices after P14.</p>

<p>Some developing SPNs fire irregular spontaneous action potentials (APs, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). This activity pattern with a stable baseline membrane potential and clear APs, crossing the threshold of 0 mV, was detected in P3-4 dSPNs and P6-7 iSPNs at the earliest. At P4, cells expressing tdTomato after A2a-Cre recombination were present in the striatal slices, but electrophysiological recordings were not stable and no APs, crossing 0 mV were detected. The number of spontaneously active cells decreased with age, striosomal cells being spontaneously active at later developmental stages, compared to matrix ones (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). However, the frequency of APs did not differ between neonatal striosomal and matrix SPNs (dSPNs: striosomes 1.67±0.45 Hz, matrix 2.75±0.71 Hz; p=0.22; iSPNs: striosomes 2.88±0.73 Hz, matrix 1.62±0.57 Hz; p=0.25). Although the cortical projections are present in the tilted slice preparations, we did not see the decrease in generation of spontaneous APs after inhibition of glutamatergic transmission. The frequency of APs recorded in cell-attached configuration from striosomal dSPNs did not change after application of AMPA receptor blocker NBQX (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>, baseline 2.25±0.73 Hz; NBQX 2.30±0.68 Hz, p=0.94), and the frequency of APs in iSPNs increased (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C</xref>, baseline 1.88±0.51 Hz; NBQX 3.60±2.24 Hz, p&lt;0.05). We confirmed the spontaneous activity of developing SPNs in the form of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref> for dSPNs and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref> for iSPNs). The percentage of spontaneously active dSPN and iSPN cells from all active cells in the presence of 8 mM KCl was significantly higher in the striosomal compartment, compared to the matrix one (dSPNs: striosomes 35.00±4.13 %, matrix 21.91±3.13 %, p&lt;0.05; iSPNs: striosomes 45.45±4.82 %, matrix 26.52±2.85 %, p&lt;0.01).</p>

<p>The presence of neonatal spontaneous activity, which disappears in adulthood, is usually a feature of developing neurons. At the early developmental stages striosomal cells are a bit more mature than adult cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Passante et al., 2008</xref>). To investigate why the number of spontaneously active SPNs is higher in striosomes, we compared passive membrane properties and intrinsic excitability of striosomal and matrix dSPNs and iSPNs at three age points. It is known that dSPNs are in general less excitable than iSPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gerfen &amp; Surmeier, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gertler et al., 2008</xref>), so in our analysis we focused only on the age- and domain-related effects. Like in the spontaneous activity recordings, we compared dSPN properties at P4, P7 and P10; and iSPN properties at P7, P10 and P14. We also recorded passive and active membrane properties of dSPNs and iSPNs at P21.</p>
<p>With our approach, it was not possible to distinguish striosomal and matrix domains at this late age point, so these data were not included into the statistical analysis. However, data are presented in the tables for the reference (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> and <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">3</xref>; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Since in adulthood striosomes occupy roughly 15 % of the total striatal volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Johnston et al., 1990a</xref>), we estimate that our data collected at P21 mostly represent matrix-located neurons.</p>

<p>We compared two passive membrane properties from the voltage-clamp recordings (input resistance, R<sub>in</sub> and membrane capacitance, C<sub>m</sub>), membrane potential (V<sub>m</sub>) and nine parameters of the active membrane properties from the current-clamp recordings. Descriptive statistics, estimation statistics and two-way ANOVA values for all the analyzed parameters are presented in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref>,<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref> (dSPNs) and <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Tables 3</xref>,<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">4</xref> (iSPNs). Most of the parameters analyzed changed with the maturation state of the neurons. In dSPNs, during P4-P10 time interval there were no changes in Cm, AP threshold and AHP (afterhyperpolarization) amplitude. However, by P21 C<sub>m</sub> significantly increased (P10 matrix dSPNs: 71.27±6.22 pF; P21 dSPNs: 133.50±8.40 pF, p=0.004 by t-test). In iSPNs, only AP threshold and AHP latency did not change with age. Two-way ANOVA analysis has shown that domain factor (location of the cell in striosomal or matrix compartment) significantly contributed to the variation in seven membrane parameters of dSPNs and six membrane parameters of iSPNs. To study the impact of the domain factor during three age points, we performed estimation statistics and calculated the mean difference (striosomal value minus matrix value) for each age point analyzed.</p>
<p>In dSPNs, AP half-width, IV ratio slope, R<sub>in</sub>, rheobase, Vm, AHP latency, and first AP delay showed the significant contribution of the domain factor in two-way ANOVA analysis (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The difference in the AP half-width and I-V ratio slope was maximal in P4 dSPNs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), decreasing with age and disappearing in P10 dSPNs. Differences in the R<sub>in</sub> and rheobase, on the contrary, appeared only with age (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). V<sub>m</sub>, AHP latency and the first AP delay were different in striosomal and matrix dSPNs in all ages analyzed, AHP latency being higher in striosomal neurons, and the first AP delay in matrix neurons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Higher R<sub>in</sub>, V<sub>m</sub>, AHP latency, lower rheobase, and first AP delay may signify the higher excitability of striosomal dSPNs at later developmental time points; and wider APs and higher IV slope may be linked to the higher excitability at P4-P7.</p>
<p>In iSPNs, the domain factor contributed to the variance in AP half-width, I-V ratio slope, R<sub>in</sub>, AHP latency, V<sub>m</sub> and AP threshold (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The difference in the first four parameters was the highest in P7 animals, and disappeared with age, being non-significant in P14 animals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The difference in the V<sub>m</sub>, on the contrary, only appeared with age, being maximal at P14 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). AP threshold was significantly higher in striosomal iSPNs in P7 and P14 animals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Higher AP half-width, IV slope, R<sub>in</sub>, and AHP latency may be linked to the increased excitability of striosomal iSPNs at P7, and higher V<sub>m</sub> and AP threshold is in line with the higher excitability of these cells at later developmental stages.</p>

<p>Given that both dSPNs and iSPNs located in striosomes are most likely being spontaneously active than their martrix counterparts, and both cell types have wider APs and higher IV slope, we hypothesize the presence of a common molecular mechanism, keeping these cells active during development. Developing striosomes receive denser cholinergic and dopaminergic innervation, compared to matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Graybiel et al., 1981</xref>). dSPNs and iSPNs express distinct types of dopaminergic receptors, but they both express muscarinic receptor M1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bernard et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yan et al., 2001</xref>). Using Oprm1-Cre/Ai14 animals, we confirmed that choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunoreactivity is denser in neuropil of striosomes of P7 animals, compared to matrix neuropil (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, striosomes 59.72±2.48 A.U., matrix 47.89±1.83 A.U., p&lt;0.0001). This ratio changes during development, and in the adult striatum ChAT immunoreactivity is higher in the matrix compartment (striosomes 61.39±3.07 A.U., matrix 64.30±3.16 A.U., p&lt;0.0001). Application of the M1 inhibitor VU0255035 significantly reduces the frequency of spontaneous APs in striosomal iSPNs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>, baseline 2.53±0.29 Hz, VU0255035 1.69±0.31 Hz, p&lt;0.05), but not in matrix ones (baseline 1.92±0.54 Hz, VU0255035 2.19±0.57 Hz, p=0.70). Application of VU0255035 did not change the frequency of spontaneous APs both in striosomal dSPNs (baseline 1.60±0.36 Hz, VU0255035 1.36±0.46 Hz, p=0.62) and in matrix dSPNs (baseline 1.76±0.54 Hz, VU0255035 1.84±0.47 Hz, p=0.80). Inhibition of M1 receptors affected the occurrence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes in striosomal, but not matrix iSPNs and dSPNs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). The number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes was significantly decreased in striosomal iSPNs (baseline 73.28±7.89 events/min, VU0255035 30.97±4.81 events/min, p&lt;0.0001), but not affected in matrix ones (baseline 41.77±6.71 events/min, VU0255035 37.35±6.14 events/min, p=0.30). We also observed a decrease in the number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes in striosomal dSPNs (baseline 50.17±8.35 events/min, VU0255035 35.72±9.56 events/min, p&lt;0.001), although the size of the effect was smaller. VU0255035 did not affect Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes in matrix dSPNs (baseline 58.18±8.23 events/min, VU0255035 48.29±10.15 events/min, p=0.07).</p>

<p>It is generally thought that spontaneous activity of developing neurons is needed for stabilization of synaptic contacts. We tested if spontaneous activity of SPNs affects the maturation of their long-range projections. Since spontaneous activity is more profound in the striosomal compartment, we decided to study the activity-dependent development of the direct projection, originating from striosomes and ending on the dopaminergic (DA) neurons of SNpc, called striosome-dendron bouquets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Crittenden et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">McGregor et al., 2019</xref>). We inhibited striosomal SPNs during the second week of life using a chemogenetic approach and evaluated the striato-nigral connectivity in adult animals (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Striosomal SPNs of Oprm1-Cre animals and wild-type littermates were transfected with pAAV-hSyn-DIO-HA-hM4D(Gi)-IRES-mCitrine at the age of P1. At P10, mCitrine was densely expressed in the striosomal areas of Oprm1-Cre animals (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B</xref>), and bath application of CNO blocked spontaneous APs (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2C</xref>, activity block verified using 3 spontaneously active cells). After transfection, animals were chronically injected with CNO or saline during P6-P14, and the GABAergic functional innervation of DA neurons was evaluated in adult animals (P52-79). DA neurons of SNpc were located by their position in the slice, large cell body and the presence of I<sub>h</sub> current, and the identity of recorded and biocytin-filled neurons was confirmed by <italic>post-hoc</italic> immunostaining for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). The frequency of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) was significantly reduced in Oprm1-Cre animals which had been chronically injected with CNO (1.82±0.33 Hz), compared to Oprm1-Cre saline control (3.81±0.5 Hz, p&lt;0.05), wild-type saline control (4.11±0.73 Hz, p&lt;0.05) or wild-type CNO control (4.19±0.59 Hz, p&lt;0.05). Injection of CNO did not change the amplitude of mIPSCs of Oprm1-Cre animals (17.71±1.78 pA, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B,C</xref>), compared to controls (Oprm1-Cre+saline 14.32±1.09 pA, p=0.5; wild-type+saline 15.5±1.53 pA, p=0.83; wild-type+CNO 20.04±2.4 pA, p=0.72). The capacitance of DA neurons was also not affected (Oprm1-Cre+CNO 83.7±7.87 pF; Oprm1-Cre+saline 84.17±4.41 pF, p&gt;0.99; wild-type+saline 80.95±6.3 pF, p=0.98; wild-type+CNO 84.69±7.26 pF, p=0.99). However, chronic injection of CNO significantly elevated the R<sub>in</sub> of DA cells in Oprm1-Cre animals (877.4±156.1 MOhm), compared to controls (Oprm1-Cre+saline 490.5±69.78 MOhm, p&lt;0.05; wild-type+saline 298.7±23.09 MOhm, p&lt;0.001; wild-type+CNO 473.8±71.13 MOhm, p&lt;0.01). CNO treatment and activity silencing in the neonatal period did not affect the shape of the DA neuron dendritic tree, analyzed by imaging of biocytin-filled DA neurons from all four experimental groups (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A, B</xref>).</p>

<p>Our electrophysiological data show that chronic suppression of striosomal SPN activity during the second week of life leads to reduced GABAergic drive to DA neurons of the SNpc. To confirm that this effect may be related to reduced innervation of DA neurons by striosomal SPNs, we transfected Oprm1-Cre animals with pAAV-hSyn-DIO-HA-hM4D(Gi)-IRES-mCitrine together with pAAV-hSyn-DIO-EGFP at the age of P1. Transfected animals received chronic CNO or saline injections similarly as for electrophysiological recordings, and animals were sacrificed for immunostaining at the age of P52-79. Coronal slices, containing SNpc, were stained for the DA marker TH and the marker of GABAergic synapses gephyrin. The structure of striosome-dendron bouquets was clearly visible in both animal groups (receiving either CNO or saline injection, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). With our slice preparation, it was difficult to ensure that the whole striosome-dendron bouquet structure was imaged. Therefore, the density of GFP and gephyrin signals were measured around TH-positive cell bodies (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> E). GFP signal was measured as voxel volume of green signal per total voxel volume of image, and gephyrin signal – as number of dots per image volume. Injection of CNO caused a significant reduction in the density of GFP signal, which marks striosomal projections (saline 0.044±0.002 RV, CNO 0.032±0.001 RV, p&lt;0.0001). The density of gephyrin staining was also reduced (saline 0.081±0.003 RV, CNO 0.072±0.003 RV, p&lt;0.05), although the effect size was smaller than for GFP.</p>
<p>Our data suggest that reducing the activity of developing SPNs causes a decrease in the density of their projections. To confirm that this effect is specific for the neonatal period, we repeated the activity suppression protocol, but administered CNO to juvenile animals (during P21-29 – the period, where SPNs are already tonically silent, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). Activity suppression during the juvenile period did not decrease, but even increase the frequency of mIPSCs recorded from adult DA neurons (Oprm1-Cre+CNO 5.24±3.93 Hz, wild-type+CNO 3.93±0.35 Hz, p&lt;0.05), and it did not affect the amplitude of these events (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B,C</xref>; Oprm1-Cre+CNO 26.04±1.57 pA, wild-type+CNO 20.98±1.95 pA, p=0.11). There were no differences in the Rin of DA neurons (Oprm1-Cre+CNO 427.1±80.51 MOhm, wild-type+CNO 403.0±51.43 MOhm, p=0.8), but the C<sub>m</sub> of DA neurons increased in Oprm1-Cre animals after the juvenile treatment with CNO (Oprm1-Cre+CNO 107.6±9.16 pF, wild-type+CNO 78.92±4.81 pF, p&lt;0.01).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Cortical and thalamic excitatory inputs contribute to the spontaneous firing of developing SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dehorter et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kozorovitskiy et al., 2015</xref>). However, not all neonatal bursts in the striatum are coherent with cortical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Klavinskis-Whiting et al., 2023</xref>). It is very likely that similar to the multiple origins of neonatal spontaneous activity in other brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Blankenship &amp; Feller, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Luhmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Molnár et al., 2020</xref>), the striatum also generates the activity in the intrinsic networks. Our data show that there are spontaneous calcium oscillations and spontaneous action potentials generated by a fraction of SPNs, an observation that applies to all four types of SPNs we were analyzing (strisosmal dSPNs, strisomal iSPNs, matrix dSPNs, matrix iSPNs). It should be noted that striatum contains a fraction of SPNs, co-expressing D1 receptor and D2 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bonnavion et al., 2023</xref>). D1R/D2R co-expressing cells accounted for 6-7% of all cells, and in our experiments, we will see these cells as dSPNs. With our approach, we cannot distinguish if this activity is purely spontaneous or driven by cortical inputs. We have not seen any decrease in spontaneous AP frequency upon inhibition of AMPA receptors, but it is possible that the cortex is contributing to SPN activity by other means. Regardless, the important finding is that the electrical behavior of neonatal SPNs drastically differs from adult ones, promoting the activity through the basal ganglia circuit.</p>
<p>The general trend is that both dSPNs and iSPNs located in striosomes are more likely to be spontaneously active. This is especially evident when comparing the presence of spontaneous activity in different age groups. Striosomal SPNs stay spontaneously active longer during development, compared to matrix SPNs. Since striosomes occupy roughly 15 % of the striatal volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Johnston et al., 1990b</xref>), higher excitability of these neurons may explain earlier data of SPNs of any type saying that only 30% of neonatal SPNs are spontaneously active.</p>
<p>If we consider neonatal activity as a feature of developing neurons, we could assume that early born neurons (like striosomal SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Passante et al., 2008</xref>)) will develop lower membrane potential sooner than matrix SPNs. Since that is not the case, it is likely that there are additional intrinsic excitability mechanisms keeping striosomal SPNs active for a longer time. The development of intrinsic excitability in dSPNs and iSPNs has been addressed in detail before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gertler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Krajeski et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lieberman et al., 2018</xref>). The electrical properties of both populations of the projection neurons develop in parallel during the first three postnatal weeks, and the excitability differences between dSPNs and iSPNs are evident from the early developmental stages. Here, we focus more on the comparison of striosomal vs. matrix SPNs.</p>
<p>Striosomes contain both dSPNs and iSPNs, dSPNs being roughly 70 % of the total SPN count in striosomes of the adult striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">McGregor et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Miyamoto et al., 2018</xref>). Our analysis of the membrane properties of striosomal and matrix dSPNs and iSPNs showed that striosomal projection neurons may be in general more excitable, compared to the matrix ones. However, the specific mechanisms may differ, depending on the developmental stage. Striosomal SPNs in the adult striatum are more excitable than matrix SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Crittenden et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">McGregor et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Prager et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Smith et al., 2016</xref>). These studies, either not distinguishing between the pathway-specific populations, or focusing on dSPNs only, showed that striosomal neurons have higher V<sub>m</sub> and R<sub>in</sub> and lower rheobase. In our dataset, we see similar differences in striosomal vs. matrix dSPN properties. Differences in the R<sub>in</sub> and rheobase appeared by P10, and differences in the V<sub>m</sub>, first AP delay, and AHP latency were evident in all time points analyzed. The excitability properties of adult striosomal and matrix iSPNs have not been studied before. We have shown that P14 striosomal iSPNs have higher V<sub>m</sub> and AP threshold, which may also contribute to the higher excitability of striosomal SPNs in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Crittenden et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the abovementioned parameters may explain the higher excitability of striosomal SPNs in adulthood, they are most likely not responsible for the higher occurrence of the spontaneously firing AP cells in early developmental stages. During very early time points, both striosomal dSPNs and iSPNs have wider APs and steeper I-V ratio slope, compared to the corresponding matrix cells. In addition, neonatal striosomal iSPNs have higher R<sub>in</sub> and AHP latency, compared to the matrix iSPNs. It has been shown that steep IV slope of SPNs during development correlates with the delayed expression of inward rectifying potassium channels (KIRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dehorter et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lieberman et al., 2018</xref>). The adult-type properties of KIRs appear in SPNs only after the age of two weeks, at the time when pups start to leave the nest and actively explore the surrounding environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dehorter et al., 2011</xref>). The dynamics of the AP waveform development has not been studied in striatum before. The membrane repolarization after an AP is usually mediated by Kv1, 3 and 4 channels and large conductance calcium-activated potassium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bean, 2007</xref>). It is possible that the expression or activity of both KIRs and voltage- or calcium-dependent potassium channels increase in all SPNs during the first weeks of life, but their activity is specifically downregulated in striosomal SPNs, contributing to the higher spontaneous activity in these cells.</p>
<p>Potassium and calcium conductance are strongly regulated by metabotropic receptors, coupled to G proteins. Striatal SPNs receive a dense cholinergic (from local cholinergic interneurons, ChINs) and DA (long-range projections from SNpc) innervation, which regulates their excitability. During development, both DA and cholinergic synapses appear in the striatum during the first postnatal week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ferrari et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Schlösser et al., 1999</xref>). During the early development of the cat, both DA and cholinergic innervation has been shown to be denser in striosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Graybiel, 1984</xref>). Based on these data, both neuromodulators may be responsible for the higher excitability of striosomal SPNs during mammalian development. However, since DA affects the maturation of SPNs only starting from P18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lieberman et al., 2018</xref>), we decided to focus on the role of muscarinic neuromodulation of striosomal vs matrix SPNs. We confirmed that during early development, cholinergic innervation is denser in striosomal regions, and this is changing with maturation, shifting to denser innervation of matrix regions in the adult brain.</p>
<p>Both dSPNs and iSPNs express muscarinic M1 receptors – metabotropic receptors, coupled to the G<sub>q</sub> pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bernard et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yan et al., 2001</xref>). Initiation of G<sub>q</sub>-coupled signaling results in the activation of PLCβ, degradation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, and release of IP<sub>3</sub>. IP<sub>3</sub> release induces the efflux of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from endoplasmic reticulum, while a decrease in the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> membrane content shuts down the function of many potassium channels, including KIRs and BKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hille et al., 2015</xref>). Activation of M1 receptors elevates the excitability of presumably both types of SPNs by suppressing KCNQ channel current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Shen et al., 2005</xref>) and inhibits Kir2 channels only in iSPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Shen et al., 2007</xref>). We found that pharmacological inhibition of M1 receptors effectively decreases the frequency of spontaneous APs and calcium oscillations in striosomal iSPNs. The effect on dSPNs was much smaller. In those cells, the inhibition of M1 receptors affected only the frequency of spontaneous calcium oscillations, and the effect size was small. It may be so, that some other mechanism contributes to the elevated excitability of striosomal dSPNs, together with M1 receptor.</p>
<p>Finally, we wanted to investigate if spontaneous activity of SPNs is needed for the stabilization of their projections. We approached this task by chemogenetically reducing the probability of SPNs to fire the APs during defined time window in early development. We selected to focus on striosomal SPNs because these neurons generate spontaneous APs for a longer developmental period than matrix ones. Striosomes contain both dSPNs and iSPNs. Similar to matrix iSPNs, striosomal iSPNs project to globus pallidus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fujiyama et al., 2011</xref>). However, striosomal dSPNs are the only striatal cells projecting to DA neurons in SNpc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fujiyama et al., 2011</xref>). These projections cross substantia nigra pars reticulata in a dense bundle and innervate DA neurons in SNpc, forming a morphological structure called “striosome-dendron bouquet” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Crittenden et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">McGregor et al., 2019</xref>). During development, striatonigral projections are formed embryonically (peak at E12), but the critical time window for stabilization of these projections has not been described yet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Matsushima &amp; Graybiel, 2020</xref>). Striosomal dSPNs form inhibitory GABAergic synapses onto DA neurons, and activation of striosomal input inhibits spontaneous firing of DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Evans et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">McGregor et al., 2019</xref>). We demonstrated that chemogenetic silencing of striosomal SPNs in the neonatal period of development caused the weakening of functional GABAergic connectivity to DA cells and decreased the density of striosomal projections to SNpc and gephyrin puncta on DA cells, even though DA neurons also receive GABAergic innervation from substantia nigra pars reticulata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Paladini &amp; Tepper, 2016</xref>) and globus pallidus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Evans et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Mechanisms underlying the activity-dependent stabilization of long-range GABAergic projections are still unclear. Most of the previous studies concentrated on the synapses formed by interneurons. During the early development in the cortical structures GABA released by interneurons is depolarizing due to low efficiency of Cl<sup>-</sup> extrusion from the cell by K-Cl cotransporter KCC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Oh &amp; Smith, 2019</xref>). In the mechanism stabilizing synapses, the activation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors causes depolarization and Ca<sup>2+</sup> entrance at the post-synaptic site, and the stabilization of the synapse by cAMP-dependent mechanism of recruiting the scaffolding protein gephyrin to the postsynaptic site. DA neurons do not express KCC2, and Cl<sup>-</sup> extrusion is due to activation of sodium-dependent anion (Cl<sup>-</sup>-HCO3<sup>-</sup>) exchanger and voltage-sensitive chloride channel 2 (CIC2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gulácsi et al., 2003</xref>). The Cl<sup>-</sup> reversal in DA neurons is significantly less negative than in neighboring GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gulácsi et al., 2003</xref>), but striatal input is still inhibitory in adult SNpc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Evans et al., 2020</xref>). The development of Cl<sup>-</sup> extrusion mechanisms in DA neurons has never been studied, and it is difficult to directly apply the Cl<sup>-</sup>-based mechanisms in activity-dependent stabilization of striosome projections to DA neurons. It was found that the development of striatonigral projections is negatively controlled by cannabinoid receptor 1, although the exact mechanism is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Crittenden et al., 2022</xref>). More research is needed to address that in detail.</p>
<p>In contrast to what was seen after neonatal suppression of striosomal SPNs, chemogenetic inhibition of striosomal SPNs during juvenile period resulted in higher mIPSC frequency and C<sub>m</sub> of DA cells in the adult animals. Thus, the activity-dependent stabilization of striosomal projections has different developmental phases, and the long-term outcome of perturbations in these processes depends on the developmental period when they occur. Suppression of activity later in life may cause some homeostatic changes, directed to maintain the overall activity levels at the silenced synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen et al., 2022</xref>). This is important for studies of neurodevelopmental disorders in animal models when gene expressions or neuronal activity are affected in a time-restricted manner.</p>

<title>Slice preparation</title>
<p>Animals were deeply anesthetized using isoflurane before sacrifice by decapitation. Brains were rapidly removed and placed in ice-cold cutting solution. Tilted at 30° horizontal cortico-striatal slices or horizontal slices containing SNpc were prepared on a vibratome (Leica VT 1200S, Leica Biosystems) in ice-cold choline chloride-based cutting solution of the following composition (mM): 117 C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>14</sub>ClNO (choline chloride), 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 7 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 15 D-glucose equilibrated with 95% O<sub>2</sub>-5% CO<sub>2</sub> mixture. Slice thickness varied depending on the age of the animals (300 μm for P7–P21, 220 μm for adults). After preparation, brain slices were allowed to recover for 1 h at 34°C in artificial CSF with Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration elevated to 3 mM. Electrophysiological recordings were done at 30° in ACSF (mM: 124 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 15 D-glucose) with perfusion speed 1-2ml/min. In cortico-striatal slices, the recording region was dorsal striatum, without distinguishing between dorso-medial and dorso-lateral parts. Cells were visualized with Olympus BX51WI microscope, equipped with LUMPlanFL N 40x/0.8w water immersion objective and Prime BSI Express sCMOS camera (Teledyne Photometrics). CoolLED pE-300 was used as a source of green/blue light. Whole-cell patch-clamp borosilicate-glass pipets (Harvard Apparatus) were obtained with a horizontal two-stage puller (P-1000, Sutter Instruments) and had a resistance typically between 4 and 6 MΩ. Current- and voltage-clamp recordings were obtained with Multiclamp 700A and Digidata 1440A (Molecular Devices) or NI USB-6341 (National Instruments). Online filtering was achieved using the Bessel 10 kHz filtering with a sampling interval of 20 kHz. All cells were first recorded in voltage-clamp mode at holding potential of -70 mV. Series resistance was monitored by injection of 5 mV voltage steps, and if the change in series resistance during the experiment exceeded 30%, the recording was discarded. Either Clampex 10.7 or WinLTP2.32 were used for the acquisition. Data analysis was done with Clampfit10.7, WinLTP2.32(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Anderson &amp; Collingridge, 2007</xref>) and MiniAnalysis 6.0.3.</p>

RMP was recorded without injecting any background current. AP firing was evoked by current injections, increased in steps of 10 pA, starting from the holding current, needed to keep the cell at -70 mV.

<p>DA neurons in SNpc were selected visually based on the location and large cell bodies. DA identity was then confirmed by the presence of I<sub>h</sub> and co-staining of biocytin-filled cells with TH in the slices fixed after electrophysiological experiment. Cells were recorded in whole-cell configuration and voltage clamp mode at -60 mV, using filling solution of the following composition (in millimolar): 105 CsCl, 5.3 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 10 EGTA, 5 lidocaine <italic>N</italic>-ethyl chloride, 5 Na<sub>2</sub>-phosphocreatine, 4 MgATP, and 0.5 Na<sub>2</sub>GTP, 2% biocytin, pH 7.2. I<sub>h</sub> was recorded immediately after breaking the seal by applying voltage injections, decreased in steps of 10 mV. mIPSCs were recorded during 10 minutes in the presence of 1 µM voltage-gated sodium channel blocker TTX, 10 µM AMPA receptor blocker NBQX and 1 µM GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor blocker CGP55845. After recording, brain slices were transferred to 4% PFA-PBS solution and stored overnight at 4°.</p>

<title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging</title>
<p>Living cortico-striatal slices were prepared from neonatal D1-Cre/Ai95D and A2a-Cre/Ai95D animals similarly as for electrophysiological recordings. After recovery period, slices were placed to the recording chamber of the electrophysiological setup and perfused with ACSF at a rate of 2 ml/min. Imaging was done with Prime BSI Express camera and open-source imaging application Micro-Manager1.4/ImageJ at 200 ms interval, 2×2 binning and 50 ms exposure time. Baseline, drug application and wash-out were recorded for 1 minute. Imaging analysis was done using ImageJ and custom-made software for MATLAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bonifazi et al., 2009</xref>). Striosomal region was selected on the maximal projection of the image stack, based on the brighter GCaMP signal. Active cells were selected on the standard deviation projection of the image stack. Frequency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> events was calculated as the number of events per minute in all active cells of striosomal or matrix region of the slice.</p>

<title>Viral transfection and CNO injections</title>
<p>Oprm1-Cre animals and wild type littermates received the injection of the viral construct to dorsal striatum at P1, following the method described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Olivetti et al., 2020</xref>) with modifications. Animals were deeply anesthetized by isoflurane and placed into stereotaxic frame with the body temperature controlled. The target coordinates were determined in reference to the vascular lambda (AP 2.4; ML 1.2; DV 2.3 and 2.7). The skin and scull were gently perforated with needle, which was later used to deliver the viral constructs. pAAV-hSyn-DIO-HA-hM4D(Gi)-IRES-mCitrine alone or with pAAV-hSyn-DIO-EGFP were slowly injected into striatum, total injection volume was 150-200 nL per injection point. pAAV-hSyn-DIO-HA-hM4D(Gi)-IRES-mCitrine and pAAV-hSyn-DIO-EGFP were a gift from Bryan Roth (Addgene viral prep # 50455-AAV8, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://n2t.net/addgene:50455">http://n2t.net/addgene:50455</ext-link>, RRID:Addgene_50455; Addgene viral prep # 50457-AAV1, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://n2t.net/addgene:50457">http://n2t.net/addgene:50457</ext-link>, RRID:Addgene_50457). After injection, animals were left to recover on the heating pad and returned to the home cage after that.</p>
<p>Starting from P6 mice were subcutaneously injected, twice a day (9:00 and 18:00) with CNO dissolved in sterile saline solution, 30 mg/kg (clozapine-N-oxide dihydrochloride, cat #HB6149, HelloBio) or sterile saline solution (0.9% NaCl), consecutively for 9 days. At P52-P79 mice were sacrificed for electrophysiology or immunostaining experiments. The administration method was chosen based on the fact that it takes longer for the concentration of small molecules to reach maximal levels in the interstitial brain fluid when they are injected subcutaneously, compared to intraperitoneally injected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Durk et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Shoyaib et al., 2019</xref>). This approach helps to prolong the effective time of the drug, without sharply reaching the maximal concentration of the drug in the brain. Pharmacokinetics of CNO after subcutaneous injection was estimated in non-human primates only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Raper et al., 2017</xref>). Maximal concentration of CNO in cerebrospinal fluid after 10 mg/kg injection reached the values of 120 nM. Based on the facts that EC50 for hM4Di is 8 nM, but the effective concentration of CNO in the slices <italic>in vivo</italic> is 10 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jendryka et al., 2019</xref>), we increased the injection dosage three times. CNO treatment of wild-type animals, not expressing hM4Di, did not cause any detectable effects in our dataset (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study offers a comprehensive examination of the early postnatal development of the patch and matrix compartments within the striatum. These are segregated circuits within the striatum circuits with distinct embryonic origins and functional roles in mature brain physiology. Despite the recognized significance of these circuits, a comprehensive understanding of their postnatal maturation remains elusive.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors undertake a thorough investigation, characterizing the intrinsic properties of direct pathway spiny projection neurons (dSPNs) and indirect pathway spiny projection neurons (iSPNs) across both matrix and striosome compartments throughout development. The authors identify the regulatory role of M1 receptors in modulating spontaneous activity in SPNs, and demonstrate the impact of chemogenetic inhibition of MOR-positive neurons during development on GABAergic synapses in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopamine (DA) neurons. These findings significantly advance our understanding of striatal development and function.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Certain methodological considerations warrant attention. Notably, the reliance on TdTomato expression for the identification of striosomes raises concerns, particularly regarding the substantial difference in slice thickness between the immunohistochemistry (IHC) images (50um) shown in Figure 2 and those utilized for whole-cell recordings (300um).</p>
<p>Enhanced clarification regarding the identification of cell patches is possible in the electrophysiology rig conditions. Using a widefield microscope rather than a confocal would strengthen the reliability of this methodology.</p>
<p>In the Ca2+ imaging experiments of Figure 2, striosomes were defined as the regions of brighter GCaMP fluorescence. This presents a potential limitation because it presupposes higher activity levels within patch cells, which is what the experiment is designed to test. Based on this criteria, neurons of this region will necessarily have more activity than in others.</p>
<p>There is also no information on how Ca2+ imaging traces were analyzed. In the examples provided, putative matrix neurons seem to exhibit different Ca2+ dynamics compared to striosome neurons. The plateau responses might reflect even higher activity than the transient signals observed in striosome neurons. It'll be important to know how the data was quantified. For example, calculations of F0 based on rolling functions tend to underestimate dF/F in traces like this. Calculations of the area under the curve can also provide valuable information in these cases.</p>
<p>There is no description of the 8mM KCl treatment in the methods. Was this only used for the Ca2+ imaging experiments? The percentage of active cells in Figures 2C-D is similar to or lower than that described in Figure 2B, which is confusing. Were recordings always performed in 8mM KCl?</p>
<p>Lastly, while the findings of Figure 6 suggest a deficit in striosomal inputs to SNc DA neurons, they do not conclusively demonstrate this point (DA neurons receive many sources of inhibition, and local interneurons in SNc are highly plastic). Given the availability of Opmr1-Cre mice and the utilization of multiple viruses in Figure 6 experiments, the inclusion of experiments employing ChR2 to directly assess striatal/striosome inputs would substantially strengthen this claim. This is the main claim stated in the manuscript title, so it is important to provide evidence of specific striatonigral deficits.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Kokinovic et al. presents evidence that a significant portion of striatal projection neurons (SPNs) are spontaneously active early in development. This spontaneous activity (as measured in ex vivo brain slices) is due to intrinsic mechanisms, and subsides over the course of the first few postnatal weeks in a cell-type specific way: striosome direct and indirect pathway SPNs (dSPNs and iSPNs, respectively) remain spontaneously active until postnatal days 10-14, by which time matrix dSPNs and iSPNs have become entirely silent. The authors suggest that this early spontaneous activity may be in part due to M1 muscarinic receptor signaling. Through chemogenetic inhibition of striosome SPNs (of which dSPNs target dopaminergic neurons of the SNc), the authors present evidence that critical postnatal windows of SPN activity shape the strength of GABAergic innervation of the SNc (measured in adults). This study provides a useful and solid characterization of the functional, postnatal compartmental development of the striatum. However, some weaknesses in the experimental design should be addressed before definitively concluding that postnatal striosome SPN activity determines its functional innervation of dopaminergic SNc neurons.</p>
<p>Specific Comments:</p>
<p>(1) While certainly interesting and possibly true, evidence for the necessity of early striosome dSPN activity in shaping their functional innervation of dopaminergic SNc neurons is not entirely convincing. The functional measure of GABAergic innervation of dopamine neurons is inferred from mIPSCs. As the authors state, dopaminergic neurons have numerous other sources of GABAergic inputs in addition to striosome dSPNs. So while manipulating striosome activity may ultimately alter the overall GABAergic innervation of SNc dopamine neurons, the specificity of this to striosome dSPN inputs is not known. Optogenetic stimulation of striosome-&gt;SNc neurons after chemogenetic silencing would help support the authors' interpretation. Related to this point, while striatonigral projections form embryonically, is there evidence that striosome-&gt;SNc synapses are indeed functional by P6-14 when CNO is delivered?</p>
<p>(2) One big caveat that needs to be addressed is that all measures of early postnatal spontaneous SPN activity were performed in ex vivo slices. Are SPNs active (in pathway/compartmental specific ways) in vivo during this time? If it is unknown, is there other evidence (e.g. immediate early gene expression, etc...) that may suggest this is indeed the case in vivo?</p>
<p>(3) It appears that 8mM KCl (external) was only used while measuring spontaneous calcium oscillations, not spontaneous spiking (Figure 2). Was there any evidence of spontaneous calcium activity in the lower KCl concentration (3mM?) used for cell-attached recordings? One caveat is that experiments demonstrating that SPNs fire spontaneously in the presence of AMPA receptor blockers (Figure S1) were presumably performed in 3mM KCl. Does elevated KCl increases spontaneous EPSPs during the ages examined? If so, are the calcium oscillations shown in Figure 2 synaptically driven or intrinsically generated? Somewhat related, speculation on why M1 receptor blockade reduces calcium oscillations but not spontaneous spikes in striosome dSPNs would be useful.</p>
<p>(4) Several statements in the introduction could use references.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Kokinovic et al. presents an interesting paper that addresses an important gap in knowledge about the differences in the development of direct and indirect pathway striatal neurons in the striosome and matrix compartments. The division of the striatum into 4 distinct populations, striosome-dSPNs, striosome-iSPNs, matrix-dSPNs, and matrix-iSPNs is important, but rarely done. This study records all four populations across early development and shows differences in action potential characteristics and intrinsic properties. They also suppress striosome activity during postnatal development and evaluate the characteristics of adult dopaminergic neurons in control and previously striosome-quieted conditions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The striatal electrophysiology is beautifully and carefully done and shows important developmental differences between neural subtypes.</p>
<p>The idea to test the striatonigral connection is a good idea.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors didn't actually test the striatonigral connection. The experiments they do instead don't convincingly show that the striosomal or even striatal connection to the dopaminergic neurons is altered after postnatal striosome suppression.</p>
<p>Major concerns:</p>
<p>(1) mIPSCs are measured and are reduced after chemogenetic suppression of striosomal neurons during development. This is an interesting finding, but these mIPSCs could be coming from any inhibitory input onto the SNc neurons. It is unlikely that most of the mIPSCs are coming from the striosomal inputs. The GPe is much more likely to be the source of these mIPSCs than the striatum because the GPe inputs form synapses nearer the soma and have a higher probability of release (Evans et al., 2020). dSPNs inhibit GPe neurons through a non-canonical pathway (Cui et al., 2021; Spix et al., 2021) and striosomes also inhibit the SNr (McGregor et al., 2019). The striatum has the potential to disinhibit SNc neurons through both the SNr or the GPe (Evans, 2022), and modification of the striosome-SNr or striosome-GPe connections during development could be what is causing the mIPSC changes. To claim that the striosome-SNc connection is altered, a direct test of this connection is necessary.</p>
<p>(2) The dopaminergic neurons recorded seem to be randomly selected, but the striosomes do not inhibit all SNc dopamine neurons. They selectively inhibit the ventral tier SNc neurons (Evans et al., 2020). In the present manuscript, it is impossible to know which subpopulation of SNc neurons was recorded, so it is impossible to tell whether the dopaminergic neurons recorded are the ones expected to receive striosomal input.</p>
<p>(3) Very similarly, the striosomes selectively wrap around the &quot;SNr dendrite&quot; of SNc neurons that participate in striosome-dendron bouquets (Crittenden et al., 2016). However, not all SNc neurons have prominent SNr dendrites (Henny et al., 2012). In the morphological images of Supplemental Figure 3, it looks like the recorded cells sometimes have an SNr dendrite and sometimes don't (but it is hard to tell because the medial-lateral rostral-caudal axis is not labeled in the images). The presence or absence of the &quot;SNr dendrite&quot; is a strong determinant of whether an individual dopaminergic neuron receives striosomal inhibition or not (Evans et al., 2020). As above, not knowing whether the neurons recorded have SNr dendrites makes it impossible to know whether they should be receiving striosomal input at all.</p>
<p>(4) It's quite interesting that the dendron-bouquet structure is intact even after striosomal activity suppression, as cannabinoid receptor knockout greatly disrupts the structural integrity of bouquets (Crittenden et al., 2022). However, going along with point 3, the gephyrin puncta analysis only at the somas is very limiting. The striosome-SNc relevant puncta would be primarily on the SNr dendrite. Gephyrin density on the SNr dendrites or in bouquets would be much more informative than density on the soma.</p>
<p>(5) The authors claim that &quot;CNO didn't affect the shape of the DA neuron dendritic tree&quot;, but more information about the morphological analysis should be added. It is not clear how the sholl analysis was conducted or whether a full 3D reconstruction was made. This claim seems to be based on only one dendritic measurement (sholl analysis), but many other dendritic or morphological features could be altered.</p>

<p>We are deeply grateful for the highly professional analysis of our work by the Journal Editor and Reviewers. Here is our provisional response to some of the reviewer comments. In our response, we would like to address two comments that were common to all Reviewers' responses. We will thoroughly address all of the Reviewers' comments in the final version of the paper.</p>

<p>Incomplete analysis of maturational changes of striato-nigral connections.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the initial study, we showed that chronic inhibition of striosomal neurons with the DREADD approach during early postnatal development leads to decreased functional innervation of dopaminergic cells by striosomes in adulthood. We have shown that by two approaches: (1) analysis of miniature inhibitory post-synaptic currents (mIPSCs) and (2) analysis of GFP and gephyrin puncta densities around dopaminergic cells. The results from these experiments strongly suggest a decrease in inhibitory drive to dopaminergic neurons of substantia nigra pars compacta, yet we agree that  only GFP puncta density can be considered as a direct evidence for weakened striatonigral connections. Reviewers indicated that additional direct measurements of striatonigral synaptic efficacy would be needed to strengthen our conclusions. We completely agree with this statement and will evaluate the possibility of doing the suggested experiments, using optogenetic stimulation of striosomal inputs to dopaminergic neurons.</p>

<p>Inconsistent description of Ca2+ imaging experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Unfortunately, there was a general misunderstanding in interpreting the Ca2+ imaging methods description. All our experiments were done so that baseline Ca2+ oscillations and oscillations in the presence of a drug were recorded in the usual ACSF (containing 3 mM KCl) at the patch-clamp setup chamber. So, conditions were exactly the same as for cell-attached and whole-cell recordings. At the end of each experiment, ACSF containing 8 mM KCl was applied. This high-KCl condition was used to calculate the total number of viable cells reacting to elevated potassium concentrations, and this number was taken as 100 %. Therefore, the percents displayed in the paper represent the actively oscillating cells in common ACSF (3 mM KCl), counted as a percent of the total number of cells that responded to the following high potassium stimulation (8 mM KCl). The formula was: (Number of active cells in 3 mM KCl / number of viable cells active at 8 mM KCl)*100.</p>
