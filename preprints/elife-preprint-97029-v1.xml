<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>The circadian clock allows organisms to coordinate biochemical and physiological processes over one day. Changes in lighting conditions as they occur naturally over seasons or manmade by jet lag or shift work, advance or delay clock phase to synchronize physiology to the environment. Within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, circadian timekeeping and resetting have been shown to depend on both membrane depolarization and intracellular second-messenger signaling. In both processes, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) mediate calcium influx resulting in the activation of intracellular signaling pathways that activate <italic>Period</italic> (<italic>Per</italic>) gene expression. However, the precise mechanism how these processes are gated in a concerted manner is unknown. Here we show that cycling-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) activity is modulated by light and gates phase shifts of the circadian clock. We found that knock-down of <italic>Cdk5</italic> in the SCN of mice affects phase delays but not phase advances. This is associated with uncontrolled calcium influx into SCN neurons and an unregulated protein kinase A (PKA) – calcium calmodulin dependent kinase (CaMK) – cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) signaling pathway. Accordingly, genes such as <italic>Per1</italic> are not induced by light in the SCN of <italic>Cdk5</italic> knock-down mice. Our experiments identified an important light modulated kinase that affects rapid clock phase adaptation. This finding indicates how light responsiveness and clock phase are coordinated to adapt activity onset to seasonal changes, jet-lag and shift work.</p>

<sec id="s1">
<p>The circadian system coordinates biochemical and physiological functions in our body and synchronizes them to the environmental day-night cycle. Misalignment of the internal body clock with the external light-dark cycle, induced by shift work or jet lag, leads to inefficient regulation of body functions. As a consequence, circadian misalignment can lead to obesity, cancer, addictive behaviors, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how the environment impacts the clock and how these entities interact.</p>
<p>In mammals, the master circadian clock is located in the ventral part of the hypothalamus just above the optic chiasm in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), which coordinate daily cycles of physiology and behavior <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Molecular daily oscillations are generated at the cellular level by a cell-autonomous transcription-translation feedback loop (TTFL) involving a set of clock genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> and post-translational modifiers such as kinases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Circuit-level interactions among SCN cells produce a coherent daily oscillation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, which can be modulated by light signals to match the environmental light-dark cycle. Light is perceived by melanopsin containing photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (pRGCs) in the eye, and the signal produced in these cells travels via the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT) to the SCN <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. The release of glutamate at the RHT terminals stimulates AMPA/NMDA receptors, leading to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into the SCN <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Additionally, the activity of various kinases is changed, including DARPP-32 (dopamine and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of 32 kD), PKA (protein kinase A), and CaMK (Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent kinases). This cascade finally culminates in the phosphorylation of CREB (cyclic AMP response element binding protein) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. This event promotes chromatin phosphorylation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> and acetylation via the recruitment of CRTC1 (cAMP-regulated transcriptional co-activator 1) and the histone acetyltransferase CBP (CREB-binding protein), involving the clock protein PER2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. As a consequence, immediate-early gene and clock gene expression is induced <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, causing a phase shift of the TTFL in oscillating cells of the SCN <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. This manifests at the behavioral level in a change of locomotor activity onset (phase shift) the day after the light pulse. The direction of the phase shift depends on the clock’s temporal state. Light perceived in the early night promotes phase delays. On the other hand, a light pulse late at night promotes phase advances, whereas light in the middle of the day does not alter the clock phase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. For this so-called resetting of the circadian clock, the <italic>Per1</italic> and <italic>Per2</italic> genes appear to be important in the mouse. While <italic>Per1</italic> is essential for phase advances, <italic>Per2</italic> function is necessary for phase delays <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) are classified into high voltage-activated channels (HVA), which include L-type and low voltage-activated (LVA) subtypes, also known as T-type channels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. T-type VGCCs are involved in phase delays, whereas L-type VGCCs are related to phase advances <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1, Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2, and Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 belong to the T-type channel family, which is critically important for neuronal excitability <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. The activity of these T-type channels are regulated by various kinases, including PKA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, PKC <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, and CDK5 (cyclin-dependent kinase 5) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Cdk5 is a proline-directed serine/threonine kinase that forms a complex with its neural activators p35 or p39 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> and cyclin I <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. The complex of Cdk5 and its activators controls various neuronal processes such as neurogenesis, neuronal migration, and synaptogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. <italic>In vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments show that Cdk5 kinase activity is low in the light phase and high in the dark phase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. It regulates the circadian clock in the SCN via phosphorylation of PER2 at serine 394 (<italic>Per2<sup>Brdm</sup></italic> domain). Upon phosphorylation by Cdk5, PER2 is stabilized and enters the nucleus to participate in the regulation of the TTFL and CREB-related transcriptional events <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Since Cdk5 regulates the T-type channel Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>and the circadian clock via PER2 phosphorylation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, we analyzed a potential role of Cdk5 in the light-mediated clock resetting mechanism.</p>

<title>Cdk5 knock-down in the SCN impairs light-induced phase delays</title>
<p>Light perceived in the dark period elicits changes in the clock phase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. To test whether <italic>Cdk5</italic> plays a role in this process, we knocked down <italic>Cdk5</italic> in the SCN via stereotaxic application of adeno-associated viruses (AAVs). We injected an adenovirus expressing shRNA to silence <italic>Cdk5</italic> (shCdk5) and, as a control, an adenovirus expressing a control shRNA (scr) into the SCN <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Consistent with our previous observations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, we found that silencing <italic>Cdk5</italic> in the SCN reduced its expression in the SCN (Supplementary Fig. 1a) and the expression of PER2 (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Under constant darkness (DD) conditions this knock-down of <italic>Cdk5</italic> shortened clock period in mice as assessed by wheel-running activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a, b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 1c). This period was not influenced by light pulses (Supplementary Fig. 1d). However, onset of activity was affected after releasing mice into constant darkness (DD). Light at zeitgeber time (ZT) 14 (where ZT0 is lights on and ZT12 is lights off) delayed the clock phase, whereas light at ZT22 advanced it in control (scr) animals, with light at ZT10 having no effect (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a, c</xref>, Aschoff type II protocol). The animals with silenced <italic>Cdk5</italic> in the SCN (shCdk5) behaved similarly to controls (scr), except for ZT14. Light did not elicit a phase delay at this time, suggesting that <italic>Cdk5</italic> plays a role in the phase delay mechanism.</p>

<p>To corroborate our observations, we performed the same experiment in DD (Aschoff type I protocol). The shCdk5 animals displayed a shorter period compared to scr controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d, e</xref>), consistent with previous observations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. After determination of each animal’s clock period, we administered light pulses of 15 min. at circadian times (CT) 10, CT14, and CT22 for each animal (orange stars, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). Light at CT10 had no effect on both the shCdk5 and scr control mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>). Light applied at CT14 promoted a phase delay in scr control mice. However, silencing of <italic>Cdk5</italic> impaired the delay of the clock phase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d, f</xref>), which is consistent with the observation at ZT14 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a, c</xref>). Light at CT22 elicited normal phase advances in shCdk5 and scr controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d, f</xref>), similar to the light pulse applied at ZT22 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a, c</xref>). From these experiments, we conclude that <italic>Cdk5</italic> plays a role in delaying the clock phase in response to a light pulse in the early activity period of mice.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Cdk5 activity is modulated by light in the early night</title>
<p>Since we observed that Cdk5 plays a significant role in the phase shift of the circadian clock, we questioned whether the light signal at ZT14 could affect the levels of Cdk5 and its co-activator p35 in the SCN. To this end, we collected SCN samples at ZT14 in the dark or after a 15 min. light pulse, and we performed a western blot on total protein extracts. To control proper light induction, we measured the light-dependent phosphorylation of PKA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, b</xref>) and CaMKII (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). We confirmed that PKA and CaMKII phosphorylation levels were increased by light in the SCN (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). Interestingly, we observed that light could also increase the p35 protein level, although the levels of Cdk5 were not affected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, c</xref>). Because the levels of the Cdk5 co-activator p35 were increased by light, we wondered whether this event would affect the kinase activity of Cdk5/p35. We performed an <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay using the immunoprecipitated Cdk5 present in SCN tissue collected from mice not exposed to light or exposed to light at ZT14. We used the recombinant histone H1 as substrate in the presence of radioactive ATP <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Surprisingly, our results indicated that Cdk5 kinase activity was decreased by light (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d, e</xref>), suggesting that light may affect the interaction between Cdk5 and p35. Therefore, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation experiment using an antibody against Cdk5 as bait to challenge this hypothesis. Our results revealed that the SCN extract from mice that received a light pulse at ZT14 contained less pulled down p35 in a complex with Cdk5 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>). Taken together, the results support the hypothesis that light affects Cdk5 activity via interference with the formation of a complex of Cdk5 with its co-activator p35. Interestingly, the light pulse at ZT14 might affect more than just Cdk5/p35 protein: protein interactions and additional unknown proteins may be involved (Supplementary Fig. 2c).</p>

<p>The CREB/CRE transcriptional pathway has been shown to be activated by calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Pharmacological inhibition of CaMKII but not of MAPK affected light-induced phase delays in hamsters <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Therefore, we tested whether phosphorylated CaMKII (p-CaMKII) is affected by the knock-down of <italic>Cdk5</italic> in the SCN of mice. We observed that p-CaMKII presence (alpha isoform) in the cytoplasm of SCN cells increased after light at ZT14 compared to no light in control animals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, left panels). In shCdk5 SCN, however, p-CaMKII was already present before the light pulse in significantly higher levels than controls (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, control Supplementary Fig. 3d). This result indicates that <italic>Cdk5</italic> is gating the phosphorylation of CaMKII alpha.</p>
<p>CaMKII has been shown to shuttle Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin (Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CAM) to the nucleus to trigger CREB phosphorylation and gene expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Therefore, we investigated whether CAM localization was influenced by a light pulse and whether <italic>Cdk5</italic> plays a role in this process. We observed that in control animals, CAM was distributed evenly in the cytoplasm of cells in SCN tissue before a light pulse. However, after the light pulse, it was localized around the nuclei (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). Interestingly, in the SCN of shCdk5 animals, CAM was already localized around the nuclei before the light administration and remained there after the light pulse, suggesting that <italic>Cdk5</italic> is gating CAM localization in the cell.</p>
<p>Once delivered to the nucleus, Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CAM triggers a highly cooperative activation of the nuclear CaMK cascade, including CaMKIV, to rapidly phosphorylate CREB for the transcription of target genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Therefore, we tested whether a light pulse affected the phosphorylation of CaMKIV and whether this was influenced by <italic>Cdk5</italic>. In control animals, we detected p-CaMKIV to be strongly present in the SCN after but not before a light pulse (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>, control Supplementary Fig. 3e). In shCdk5 SCN, p-CaMKIV was always detectable independent of the light pulse (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). This indicated that Cdk5 was gating phosphorylation of CaMKIV.</p>
<p>Calcium entry is regulated by channels, such as T-type VGCC, which are involved in phase delays <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Previous reports show that Cdk5 directly or indirectly can phosphorylate Cav3.1 <italic>in vitro</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Thus, we looked at the influence of light and <italic>Cdk5</italic> on the T-type channel Cav3.1 using immunohistochemical staining. We observed that the level of Cav3.1 protein was significantly increased on the surface of SCN cells after the light pulse (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>, blue bars). This suggests that light inhibits internalization and degradation of this channel. Interestingly, in the <italic>Cdk5</italic> depleted SCN cells, Cav3.1 staining was already high on the cell surface before the light signal (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>, red bars). We observed no difference in the Cav3.1 signal between SCN samples obtained from shCdk5 mice before and after the light pulse (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>, red bars), suggesting that <italic>Cdk5</italic> may be directly or indirectly involved in the regulation of Cav3.1 localization. This is consistent with previously described effects of Cdk5 on the cellular localization of other receptors such as the D2 and TRPV1 receptors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Cdk5 modulates neuronal activity in response to light at ZT14</title>
<p>Neuronal activity in response to light at ZT14 requires calcium influx. At night neuronal cell membranes are hyperpolarized, creating a Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient. A light stimulus at night promotes membrane depolarization and VGCC activation, which evokes a Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into SCN neurons ultimately changing the phase of the circadian clock <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Our results shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref> indicate that Cdk5 regulates the gating between light and the CaMKII pathway, which relies on Ca<sup>2+</sup> availability. Thus, we tested whether Cdk5 regulated the light-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into SCN neurons. To this end, we employed <italic>in vivo</italic> calcium imaging to assess changes in calcium levels in the SCN in freely moving mice after 15 minutes of a light pulse given at ZT14. First, we injected an adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing the shCdk5 sequence into the SCN to silence <italic>Cdk5</italic>. This AAV is co-expressing the calcium indicator GCaMP7 under the neuron-specific synapsin 1 promoter. As a control, we injected an AAV carrying a NSshRNA (scrambled sequence) instead of shCdk5 (see Materials and Methods). Consistent with our previous results, the construct expressing shCdk5 in the SCN produced a shortened free-running period in mice (Supplementary Fig. 4a-c). Animals injected with AAV were implanted with a chronic optical fiber placed above the SCN to allow for longitudinal imaging of GCaMP7 signals using fiber photometry. After habituation, ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> (or the ratio of change in GCaMP7 fluorescence to the baseline fluorescence, see methods) was recorded before and after light pulse delivery at ZT14 in both groups of mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>).</p>

<title>Cdk5 regulates the DARPP32-PKA axis</title>

<p>Previous studies have described that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated CREB transcription of target genes requires PKA activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. However, to date it is not clear whether there is a parallel (synergistic) relationship between PKA and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathways or whether they are sequentially depending on each other (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5b</xref>, cartoon model). To address this question, we performed the following FRET experiment. NIH 3T3 cells were stimulated with forskolin in either the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> with EGTA (Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>, orange line), without EGTA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>, blue line) or completely depleted of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>, salmon colored line). We observed that under normal conditions the FRET signal goes down, comparable to the signal seen in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">figure 5a</xref>, indicating a higher Ser-133 KID phosphorylation compared to the baseline (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5b</xref>, blue signal). When we added EGTA (removing Ca<sup>2+</sup>), the FRET signal increased to the baseline level after the forskolin treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5b</xref>, orange signal). The cells depleted of Ca<sup>2+</sup> were also not responsive to the forskolin stimulus since the FRET signal moved towards the baseline level within 30 min. (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>, salmon colored signal). Together, our results indicate that CREB phosphorylation is modulated by Cdk5 via Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling as suggested in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref>. Interestingly, PKA appeared not to directly phosphorylate CREB, because CREB did not pull-down p-PKA in an immunoprecipitation experiment. In contrast p-CaMKIV did interact with CREB (Supplementary Fig. 5b, c) suggesting that CREB is most likely phosphorylated by CaMKIV, which is probably indirectly regulated by PKA activity.</p>
<p>Next, we aimed to investigate what the possible pathway could be through which PKA regulates CaMKIV. Previous studies have shown that Cdk5 regulates PKA activity via DARPP32 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). Therefore, we asked whether DARPP32 phosphorylation was light-dependent and whether Cdk5 would modulate this process. We sacrificed mice either receiving a light pulse at ZT14 or no light. Cryo-sections containing the SCN were stained with an antibody recognizing phosphorylated Thr-75 (pThr-75) of DARPP32. We observed that DARPP32 is highly phosphorylated at ZT14 with the light signal reducing the phosphorylation levels in the cytoplasm and nuclei significantly (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>, blue bars; Supplementary Fig. 5d, e). In contrast, silencing of <italic>Cdk5</italic> led to a dramatic decrease of the pThr-75 signal in the cytoplasm and nuclei of SCN cells at ZT14 and light did not have an effect (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>, red bars, Supplementary Fig. 5e). These observations are consistent with the view that Cdk5 phosphorylates DARPP32 and that light inhibits this process probably through an unknown mechanism inactivating Cdk5.</p>
<p>Non phosphorylated DARPP32 promotes PKA activity, which is characterized by phosphorylation at Thr-197 in the catalytic site of PKA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Therefore, we asked whether decreased levels of p-DARPP32 after the light stimulus at ZT14 could inversely correlate with the phosphorylation state of PKA. Thus, we performed immunostaining on coronal brain sections containing the SCN using an antibody recognizing the phosphorylated Thr-197 of PKA. We observed that PKA phosphorylation significantly increased after the light pulse in the SCN tissue obtained from control (scr) mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>, right panel, blue bars). However, in SCN from shCdk5 mice, the phosphorylation level was already elevated before the light pulse compared to scr control (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>, left panels, top micrographs), and it was also sustained after the light pulse (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>, left panels, bottom micrographs, right panel, red bars). Our results indicate that Cdk5 gates PKA phosphorylation induced by the light pulse at ZT14. Many observations indicate that active PKA can stimulate the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through Cav3 T-type voltage gated channels, including Cav3.1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. The molecular mechanism normally requires physical interaction between the channel and PKA, followed by phosphorylation which influences the gating properties <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Therefore, we performed a co-immunostaining in the same SCN sections collected before (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) to detect both Cav3.1 and phospho-PKA (the active form). We observed that the colocalization between Cav3.1 and phospho-PKA dramatically increased after the light pulse in the SCN tissue of control (scr) mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>, scr left panels yellow color, and blue bars in the right panel). Interestingly, the colocalization level of the two proteins was already high in the shCdk5 SCN tissue before the light pulse, compared to controls (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref> scramble vs. shCdk5, left panel, top micrographs). The colocalization level between Cav3.1 and phospho-PKA in the shCdk5 tissues was not influenced by the light pulse (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>, right panel, red bars). Altogether our results suggest that Cdk5 gates the PKA-Cav3.1 interaction in response to the light signal at ZT14 in an indirect way via DARPP32.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the knock-down of <italic>Cdk5</italic> did not affect light-mediated induction of <italic>cFos</italic> expression, which peaked at 0.5h after the light pulse (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6g</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Egr1</italic>, another immediate early gene, which is involved in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>, was light-inducible in control but not in shCdk5 animals (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6h</xref>). This suggests that the immediate early gene <italic>cFos</italic> is regulated by a different mechanism compared to <italic>Egr1</italic> and the clock genes <italic>Per1</italic> and <italic>Dec1</italic> in response to a light stimulus at ZT14.</p>
<p>Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) was described to play a role in phase-shifting the SCN clock <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the light-induced expression of clock genes is localized in VIP-positive cells in the SCN that are essential for clock resetting <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. Therefore, we tested whether <italic>Vip</italic> gene expression is affected by shCdk5. We observed that a light pulse did not induce <italic>Vip</italic> expression significantly in the SCN, nor did shCdk5 affect its general expression (Supplementary Fig. 6a). This suggests that <italic>Cdk5</italic> does not regulate <italic>Vip</italic> expression and modulate phase shifts via VIP.</p>
<p>Salt inducible kinase 1 (<italic>Sik1</italic>) is involved in the regulation of the magnitude and duration of phase shifts by acting as a suppressor of the effects of light on the clock <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. Therefore, we tested how a light pulse affected <italic>Sik1</italic> expression in the SCN and whether <italic>Cdk5</italic> might play a role in its regulation. We observed that <italic>Sik1</italic> was significantly induced by a light pulse in the SCN of control mice after 0.5 h. However, the knock-down of <italic>Cdk5</italic> abolished this induction (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6i</xref>). This suggests that <italic>Cdk5</italic> modulates <italic>Sik1</italic> expression to regulate the magnitude of the behavioral response to light.</p>
<p>The light-inducible small G-protein Gem limits the circadian clock phase-shift magnitude by inhibiting voltage-dependent calcium channels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. We tested whether a light pulse affected <italic>Gem</italic> expression in the SCN and whether this was involving Cdk5. We observed that Gem was significantly induced by light 1 hour after light administration (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6j</xref>, blue bars). Interestingly, knock-down of <italic>Cdk5</italic> abolished this induction (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6i</xref>, red bars), but <italic>Gem</italic> levels seemed to be slightly but not significantly elevated already before light administration (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6i</xref>, time point 0). This indicates that Cdk5 influences light induced <italic>Gem</italic> expression and that Cdk5 may also affect basal <italic>Gem</italic> expression before the light pulse. Interestingly, similar results as for light induced gene expression in shCdk5 SCN were observed in SCN of <italic>Per2<sup>Brdm1</sup></italic> mutant mice (Supplementary Fig. 6b, c).</p>
<p>Phase shifts of the circadian clock can also be studied in cell cultures using forskolin instead of light as a stimulus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. In accordance with our <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), expression of <italic>Per1</italic> but not <italic>Per2</italic> mRNA was induced in synchronized NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells after forskolin treatment (Supplementary Fig. 6d, e, blue bars). Comparable to the experiments in the SCN, <italic>Per1</italic> induction was abolished in <italic>Cdk5</italic> knock-out cells (Supplementary Fig. 6d). In contrast<italic>, cFos</italic> mRNA induction was not affected in <italic>Cdk5</italic> knock-out cells (Supplementary Fig. 6f), which is consistent with our observations in the SCN (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6g</xref>).</p>
<p>Collectively, our expression data provide evidence that <italic>Cdk5</italic> regulates light and forskolin-mediated expression of genes critical for the regulation of phase delays of the circadian clock. Immediate early genes, such as <italic>Egr1</italic>, are regulated in a similar manner, whereas others, such as <italic>cFos</italic>, are regulated by another mechanism not involving <italic>Cdk5</italic>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we investigated the role of Cdk5 in rapid phase shifts of the circadian clock. We found that Cdk5 activity is regulated by light and that Cdk5 is necessary for phase delays but not phase advances. We identified Cdk5 to play a major role in the modulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and gating of the PKA-CaMK-CREB signaling pathway and coordinate it with the presence of PER2 in the nucleus of SCN cells.</p>
<p>In a previous study, we identified the protein kinase Cdk5 to regulate the phosphorylation and nuclear localization of the clock protein PER2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Because PER2 and protein kinases are involved in the photic signaling mechanism of clock phase adaptation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>, we tested the involvement of Cdk5 in this process. The phenotype of <italic>Cdk5</italic> knock-down (shCdk5) in the SCN of mice resembled the phenotypes observed in <italic>Per2</italic> mutant (<italic>Per2<sup>Brdm1</sup></italic>) and neuronal <italic>Per2</italic> knock-out (n<italic>Per2</italic> ko) mice. ShCdk5, as well as <italic>Per2<sup>Brdm1</sup></italic>and n<italic>Per2</italic> ko animals, showed strongly reduced phase delays in response to a short light pulse given at ZT14 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a, c</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> or CT14 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d, f</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>. These mouse lines displayed a shortened period consistent with previous observations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b, e</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. Our results indicate that Cdk5 is not only involved in the regulation of the circadian clock mechanism via nuclear localization of PER2 but also plays an important role in the molecular mechanism that leads to a delay of clock phase in response to a light pulse in the early dark phase or early subjective night.</p>
<p>Since Cdk5 mediates the effects of light at the behavioral (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) level, we tested the influence of light on Cdk5 protein accumulation and kinase activity in the SCN at ZT14 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). We observed no change in the protein accumulation of Cdk5. On the other hand, Cdk5 kinase activity was reduced in the SCN after a light pulse at ZT14 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d, e</xref>) which was surprising in the context of increased p35 levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, c</xref>) and augmented PKA phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, b</xref>). However, this observation is in line with what we previously reported, where we demonstrated that Cdk5 kinase activity was low during the light phase and higher during the dark phase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. It appeared, however, that p35 was not interacting with Cdk5 after light at ZT14 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>). Additional interactions of Cdk5 with unknown proteins may also be lost (Supplementary Fig. 2c). These observations suggest that Cdk5 was most likely modified in response to light leading to loss of interaction with p35 and other proteins. Ser159 of Cdk5 mediates the specificity of the Cdk5-p35 interaction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>, and therefore, phosphorylation of this site by an unknown kinase may mediate the loss of Cdk5 activity. Several additional phosphorylation sites in Cdk5 have been identified, of which phosphorylation of S47 renders Cdk5 inactive <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. Which one of the phosphorylation sites in Cdk5 is modulated by light and what additional interactors may be involved in this process remains to be established.</p>
<p>Light in the early portion of the dark phase elicits phase delays, which involve T-type calcium channels, PKA-signaling, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, ending in the phosphorylation of CREB (reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>). We observed that in shCdk5 mice, CREB was already phosphorylated in the absence of light, although the total protein amount did not change (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 3a, b). Similarly, CaMKII and CaMKIV were shown to be phosphorylated and, therefore, activated only after the light pulse in control animals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b, d</xref>). Conversely, these kinases were highly phosphorylated in a light-independent manner in the SCN of shCdk5 animals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b, d</xref>) indicating that Cdk5 had a suppressive function on the phosphorylation of CaMKII and CaMKIV.</p>
<p>A stimulus can promote calmodulin (CAM) involving CaMKII gamma to translocate from calcium channels to the nucleus to promote CaMKIV phosphorylation and activation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Unexpectedly, we observed that a light stimulus can have a similar but distinct effect on CAM in SCN cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). CaMKII alpha was phosphorylated after a light pulse at ZT14, which lead to perinuclear localization of CAM in control mice, while this localization pattern was already observed in shCdk5 animals independently of the light stimulus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). In control mice that received no light CAM showed a diffuse expression pattern similar to the T-type calcium channel Cav3.1 at ZT14.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this light driven localization pattern was echoed by the change in cellular distribution of the T-type calcium channel Cav3.1 known as internalization/externalization. Again, the presence of Cdk5 suppressed the localization of this channel to the cell membrane in the absence of light, with light allowing localization to the cell membrane (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). This observation is reminiscent of investigations described previously in which Cdk5 appeared to play an important role in channel translocation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup> as well as in receptor translocation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Thus, our findings are in accordance with the view that Cdk5 plays a crucial role in light stimulus driven cell dynamics.</p>
<p>Calcium plays an important role in circadian and phase-shifting biology <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Circadian calcium fluxes in the cytosol of SCN neurons have been demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup> and they change rapidly as a response to light perceived by the retina <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. We performed <italic>in vivo</italic> live imaging to detect Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in the SCN using fiber photometry with protein-based Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators such as GCaMP <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup>. With this approach, we observed that calcium fluxes in the SCN of control mice increased during and after a light pulse, but this change was significantly dampened in shCdk5 animals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b, c</xref>). Interestingly, although the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was generally reduced in the SCN of shCdk5 mice, we observed random Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity, which were independent of any light stimulus. These transients were observed also at the beginning of ZT14, before the light pulse (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b, c</xref>). These results may indicate the presence of a calcium leak reminiscent of the already active phosphorylation cascade observed in the shCdk5 SCN in the absence of light (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). We do not know, however, whether internal calcium stores involving ryanodine receptors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup> are altered by Cdk5 as well and how this would contribute to the observed phenotypes.</p>
<p>The PKA signaling pathway is involved in the resetting of the circadian phase (reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>). Interference with PKA activation in the early subjective night led to reduced phase delay responses as observed <italic>in vitro</italic> in the SCN <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Here we find that Cdk5 plays an inhibitory role in PKA phosphorylation and activation. The FRET approach shows that in cells the lack of Cdk5 makes cells unresponsive to forskolin (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>), an agent known to mitigate phase shifts in cells via PKA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Interestingly, PKA appears to influence phase shifts and CREB phosphorylation indirectly via a Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent mechanism (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>) with phosphorylated CaMKIV being the kinase that phosphorylates CREB (Supplementary Fig. 5b, c). This observation is in contrast with previous studies that suggested a direct phosphorylation of CREB by PKA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. However, p-PKA is mostly located in the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>) while p-CaMKIV is in the nuclei (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). Furthermore, our experiments indicate that CREB did not interact with p-PKA but did with p-CaMKIV (suppl Fig. 5b, c), supporting the notion that PKA regulates CREB phosphorylation indirectly via CaMKIV in the SCN.</p>
<p>Because we observed that PKA was already phosphorylated in the dark when Cdk5 was silenced (Fig.5e), we asked how Cdk5 could negatively regulate PKA phosphorylation. A previous study described that Cdk5 can phosphorylate DARPP32 to suppresses PKA activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup>. Furthermore, <italic>Darpp-32</italic> KO mice show attenuated phase delays <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> resembling shCdk5 mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). In accordance with these studies, we found an inverse correlation between p-DARPP32 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>) and p-PKA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>), implying that Cdk5 indirectly inhibits PKA activity via DARPP32.</p>
<p>Our results imply that PKA action on CREB might be mediated via T-type calcium channels such as Cav 3.1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>). This assumption is reasonable because PKA can phosphorylate Cav 3.1 channels and increase electrical conductivity, which leads to a higher influx of Ca<sup>2+ 26</sup>. To that extent, our results indicate that a higher co-localization of p-PKA with Cav 3.1 is associated with an activation of the CaMKinase pathway and CREB phosphorylation.</p>
<p>Light induced phosphorylation of CREB leads to induction of immediate early genes and clock genes (reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>). Accordingly, we observed that the clock genes <italic>Per1</italic> and <italic>Dec1</italic> but not <italic>Per2</italic>, <italic>Dec2,</italic> and <italic>Bmal1</italic> were induced in the SCN by light at ZT14 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a-e</xref>, blue bars) consistent with previous findings <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. The light induction of <italic>Per1</italic> and <italic>Dec1</italic> was abolished in shCdk5 animals (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a, c</xref>, red bars) as well as in <italic>Per2<sup>Brdm1</sup></italic>mutant mice (Supplementary Fig. 6b, c), suggesting involvement of Cdk5 and Per2 in induction of these genes. In contrast, light induction of the immediate early gene <italic>cFos</italic> was neither affected in shCdk5 nor <italic>Per2<sup>Brdm1</sup></italic>SCN (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6g</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 6f), resembling the normal <italic>cFos</italic> induction in <italic>Per2</italic> KO animals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. This indicates that the light signaling mechanism for <italic>cFos</italic> induction is different from the one mediating induction of <italic>Per1</italic> and <italic>Dec1</italic>. Interestingly, however, the light-inducible genes <italic>Sik1</italic> and <italic>Gem,</italic> which are involved in limiting the effects of light on the clock <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup> were not light-inducible in shCdk5 animals (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6i, j</xref>) supporting the view that the factors that drive (<italic>Per1, Dec1</italic>) or limit (<italic>Sik1, Gem</italic>) the effects of light on the clock are regulated by the same mechanism. Interestingly, neither lack of <italic>Per1</italic>, <italic>Dec1</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup> nor <italic>Sik1</italic> or <italic>Gem</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup> alone abolish phase delays. Of note is that lack of <italic>cFos</italic> or <italic>Egr1</italic> did not affect phase delays either <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), which is important in circadian light responses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>, was not inducible by a light pulse at ZT14 in control as well as shCdk5 animals (Supplementary Fig. 6a), indicating that Cdk5 acts upstream of VIP signaling. Overall, our data suggest that Cdk5 not only regulates the light sensitive PKA – CaMK-CREB signaling pathway but ultimately also affects gene expression. The combination of lack of induction of many genes in the Cdk5-regulated pathway is responsible for the manifestation of rapid behavioral phase delays.</p>
<p>Based on this and our previous studies, we propose the following molecular model for light-mediated phase delays (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). The model is divided into two parts. One part describes the state before the light pulse, and the second part the mechanism after the light pulse. The state before the light pulse (ZT12-14) is depicted in the gray area in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>. As reported previously, Cdk5 is active right after dark onset <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, depicted as the active Cdk5/p35 complex (blue). This has two consequences: 1) PER2 (red) is phosphorylated and translocates to the nucleus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, and 2) DARPP32 is phosphorylated and thus inhibiting PKA activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup>. Hence, before the light pulse at ZT14, the nucleus is supplied with PER2, which appears to be necessary for light-mediated behavioral phase delays <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>. In parallel, the signaling pathway necessary to phosphorylate CREB is turned off. This state can then be dramatically changed when light is applied at ZT14 evoking glutamate and PACAP release at the synapses between the RHT and the SCN. Interaction between p35 and Cdk5 is abolished (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) thereby inactivating Cdk5 and stopping phosphorylation of PER2 and DARPP32. Since significant amounts of PER2 are already in the nucleus this probably has no consequences on nuclear PER2 function. However, DARPP32 is not phosphorylated anymore and the block on PKA is released. At the same time, PKA becomes phosphorylated due to PACAP and cAMP signaling, leading to activation of Cav3.1 by PKA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>). This leads to CaMKII and CaMKIV phosphorylation and, ultimately, to the phosphorylation of CREB in the nucleus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>). Phospho-CREB builds up a complex with CRTC1/CBP and PER2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> to activate gene expression of the <italic>Per1, Dec1, Sik1,</italic> and <italic>Gem</italic> genes. In the activation complex the amount of PER2 present in the nucleus may at least in part affect the magnitude of the phase delay, which is depending on the time the light pulse is given. In conclusion, Cdk5 activity is gating both processes, the pre-light condition as well as the post-light condition, leading to a concerted activation of a set of light-responsive genes that impinge on behavioral phase delays in response to nocturnal light exposure.</p>

<caption><title>Model of Cdk5 gated light signal.</title>
<p>(<bold>a</bold>) Cdk5 is active during the dark portion of the day. Active Cdk5 with its co-activator p35 phosphorylates PER2, which leads to stabilization and nuclear translocation of this protein that is abundant at ZT12. At the same time CDK5 phosphorylates DARPP32, which inhibits the PKA signaling pathway. (<bold>b</bold>) Light perceived in the dark phase at ZT14 leads to detachment of p35 from Cdk5 stopping Cdk5 activity. DARPP32 is not phosphorylated and hence can’t inhibit PKA. PKA that is activated by the light signal is phosphorylated and can mediate CREB phosphorylation via T-type calcium channels (Cav3.1) and the CaMK pathway leading to a transcriptionally active complex on the CRE element present in the promoters of many light responsive genes such as <italic>Per1</italic>, <italic>Dec1</italic>, <italic>Gem</italic> and <italic>Sik1</italic>. Overall, a light pulse at ZT14 will activate CREB phosphorylation and a protein complex will form. This complex needs phosphorylated PER2 that has accumulated in the nucleus between ZT12 and ZT14 to initiate transcription of light responsive genes. Both arms are necessary to build up a transcriptionally functional complex. Both arms depend on the presence and activity of CDK5, which therefore gates the light signal at ZT14. It is very likely that the amount of PER2 protein in the nucleus determines at least in part the magnitude of the phase delay, which depends on the timing of the light signal.</p></caption>

<title>Animals and housing</title>
<p>All mice were housed with chow food (3432PX, Kliba-Nafag) and water ad libitum in transparent plastic cages (267 mm long, ×207 mm wide, ×140 mm high; Techniplast Makrolon type 2 1264C001) with a stainless-steel wire lid (Techniplast 1264C116), kept in soundproof ventilated chambers at constant temperature (22 ± 2 °C) and humidity (40 – 50%). All mice were entrained to a 12-h light–dark cycle (LD cycle), and the time of day was expressed as Zeitgeber time (ZT; ZT0 lights on, ZT12 lights off). Four-month-old 129/C57BL6 mixed males were used for the experiments.

<title>Locomotor activity monitoring</title>
<p>Locomotor activity parameters were analyzed by monitoring wheel-running activity, as described in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup>, and calculated using the ClockLab software (Actimetrics). To analyze free-running rhythms, animals were entrained to LD 12:12 and released into constant darkness (DD). The internal period length was determined from a regression line drawn through the activity onsets of ten days of stable rhythmicity under constant conditions, calculated using the respective inbuilt functions of the ClockLab software (Acquisition Version 3.208, Analysis Version 6.0.36). For better visualization of daily rhythms, locomotor activity records were double-plotted, which means that each day’s activity is plotted twice, to the right and below that of the previous day. For the analysis of light-induced resetting, we used an Aschoff type II and I protocol <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup>. For type II, mice maintained in LD 12:12 were subjected to a 15 min. light pulse (LP, 500 lux) at ZT10 (no phase shift), 14 (phase delay), and 22 (phase advance). Subsequently, they were released into DD for ten days, and phase shift was measured. For type I, mice maintained in DD were subjected to a 15 min. light pulse at Circadian Time (CT) 10, 14, or 22. A circadian hour equals 1/24 of the endogenous period (τ), calculated as follows: circadian hour = tau/24 hours. To convert ZT hours to CT hours, we multiply the circadian hour by the actual hours needed to apply the light pulse at a specific time [i.e., CT14= (tau/24 hours) *14]. The phase shift was determined by fitting a regression line through the activity onsets of at least 7 days under LD conditions before the light pulse and a second line through the activity onsets of at least 7 days under DD after the light pulse. The first two days after the administration of the light pulse were not considered for the calculation of the phase shift. The distance between the two regression lines determined the phase shift. Before starting any new protocol, mice were allowed to stabilize their circadian oscillator for 10 days. The corresponding figure legends indicate the number of animals used in the behavioral studies.</p>

For baseline normalization, the FRET ratio R was expressed as a ΔR/R, where ΔR is R–R0, and R0 is the average of R over the last 120 s prior stimulus.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analysis of all experiments was performed using GraphPad Prism6 software. Depending on the data type, either an unpaired t-test or one- or two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni or Tukey’s post-hoc test was performed. Values considered significantly different are highlighted. [p&lt;0.05 (*), p&lt;0.01 (**), or p&lt;0.001 (***)].</p>
<p>Data were compared via two-way repeated-measures ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni’s corrections for multiple comparisons. Data distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally tested. All data are displayed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). No power calculations were performed to determine sample sizes, but similarly sized cohorts were used in previous studies. The experimenters were not blind to the conditions when acquiring or analyzing the data.</p>
<p>Sample numbers are indicated in the corresponding figure legends, and test details are only reported for significant results. Figures were prepared in Adobe Illustrator 2022.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> chronobiological study in mice suggests that light modulated activity of Cdk5 activity on the PKA-CaMK-CREB signaling pathway provides missing molecular mechanistic details to understand light- induced circadian clock phase delays during the early night, but not for phase advances in the morning. The authors provide overall <bold>convincing</bold> evidence bridging from behavioral to molecular/cellular experiments to neural activity imaging.</p>

<p>In the manuscript &quot;Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) activity is modulated by light and gates rapid phase shifts of the circadian clock&quot;, Brenna et al study the role of Cdk5 on circadian rhythms and they conclude that the CDK5 gates the activity of light on phase shifts at ZT by showing that the behavioural shifts to light as a result of CDK5 silencing only affect light-induced phase shifts at ZT/CT 14 but not at other times.</p>
<p>Further, they delineate the mechanism behind this phenotype and demonstrate that 1) CDK5 activity is downregulated following a light pulse via a loss of interaction with p35 and demonstrate this via an activity assay. 2) knock-down of CDK5: increases CREB, CAMK-ii/iv phosphorylation, likely via increasing calcium levels along with alterations to the localisation of Cav3.1, 3) reduces: light-induced response in vivo at ZT14 in the SCN.</p>
<p>They suggest this mechanism involves light 'silencing' CDK5-pathway (possibly by disrupting P35 interaction and dysregulating this pathway) which under basal conditions phosphorylates DARP32 leading to PKA inhibition and by extension reduction in activation of the calcium-calmodulin kinase activity and leading to reduced CREB activity. The authors finally evaluate gene expression changes of previously described light-responsive-genes in at ZT14 and the SCN.</p>
<p>This is an interesting piece of work that explains how circadian responses to light could be gated and is generally well supported by a wealth of data. Whilst I found the overall involvement of CDK5 in gating light response interesting and convincing, I have some concerns about their interpretation of the data surrounding the mechanism, which I have detailed below. I also think this manuscript could be improved with a slightly different structure and concise discussion for the benefit of a broader scientific audience.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Definition of the role of CdK5 in circadian locator activity and light induced neural activity in the mouse SCN in-vivo revealing its mode of action through PKA-CaMK-CREB signaling pathway.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The experimental approaches are carried from in-vivo, to cellular and molecular level and provide first evidence for the specific involvement of CdK5 in light-induced phase advance of the free-running rhythm.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The behavioral analyses are limited to some selected parameters.</p>
<p>
Downstream effects on circadian oscillation of gene expression and physiological functions in other brain regions, and organs is missing.</p>
