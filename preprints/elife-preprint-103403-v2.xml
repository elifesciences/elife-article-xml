<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) relies on association with PP1-interacting proteins (PIPs) to generate substrate-specific PIP/PP1 holoenzymes, but the lack of well-defined substrates has hindered elucidation of the mechanisms involved. We previously demonstrated that the Phactr1 PIP confers sequence specificity on the Phactr1/PP1 holoenzyme by remodelling the PP1 hydrophobic substrate groove. Phactr1 defines a group of “RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W” PIPs that all interact with PP1 in a similar fashion. Here we use a PP1-PIP fusion approach to address sequence specificity and identify substrates of the RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W family PIPs. We show that the four Phactr proteins confer identical sequence specificities on their holoenzymes. We identify the 4E-BP and p70 S6K translational regulators as substrates for the Neurabin/Spinophilin PIPs, implicated in neuronal plasticity, pointing to a role for their holoenzymes in mTORC1-dependent translational control. Biochemical and structural experiments show that in contrast to the Phactrs, substrate recruitment and catalytic efficiency of the PP1-Neurabin and PP1-Spinophilin fusions is primarily determined by substrate interaction with the PDZ domain adjoining their RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W motifs, rather than by recognition of the remodelled PP1 hydrophobic groove. Thus, even PIPs that interact with PP1 in a similar manner use different mechanisms to ensure substrate selectivity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Phosphoprotein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) is a member of the PPP superfamily of protein phosphatases, responsible for most cellular serine/threonine dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bollen et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brautigan and Shenolikar, 2018</xref>). The three PP1 isoforms possess a central metal-binding active centre from which radiate three putative substrate-binding grooves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Egloff et al, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Goldberg et al, 1995</xref>), but have little intrinsic sequence specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hoermann et al, 2020</xref>). Instead, PP1 substrate specificity and activity is controlled by over 200 PP1 interacting proteins (PIPs), which use a number of short linear motifs (SLIMs) to dock with distinct regions of the PP1 surface, including the substrate-binding grooves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cohen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bollen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Casamayor and Arino, 2020</xref>). PIPs can target PP1 to specific subcellular locations, and can control substrate specificity through autonomous substrate-binding domains, occupation or extension of the substrate grooves, or modification of PP1 surface electrostatics (for references see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bollen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fedoryshchak et al, 2020</xref>). Only a few PIP-PP1-substrate interactions are understood in molecular detail, however, and the question of whether PIP interaction imposes sequence specificity on PP1, as opposed to simply bringing enzyme and substrate into close apposition, has remained largely unexplored.</p>
<p>The Phactr family of actin-regulated PP1 cofactors are the only PIPs known to directly impose substrate sequence-specificity at the dephosphorylation site itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fedoryshchak et al., 2020</xref>). Like many PIPs, they interact with PP1 using the previously defined “RVxF”, “ΦΦ”, and “R” motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Choy et al, 2014</xref>). Structural alignment showed that the Phactrs belong to a subset of RVxF-ΦΦ-R PIPs whose shared trajectory across the PP1 surface continues to the edge of the hydrophobic groove, making an additional PP1 contact through an additional motif that we termed the “W” SLIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ragusa et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Choy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fedoryshchak et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Yan et al, 2021</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-S1A</xref>). These “RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W string” PIPs include Neurabin/Spinophilin (PPP1R9A/B), which play important roles in PP1-dependent regulation of neuronal plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Allen et al, 1997</xref>; Burnett, 1998 #87, reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sarrouilhe et al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Foley et al, 2021</xref>); PNUTS (PPP1R10), which regulates PolII and chromatin dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lee et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cortazar et al, 2019</xref>); and PPP1R15A/B, which mediate translational regulation through control of eIF2α dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Novoa et al, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Yan et al., 2021</xref>)(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). In the Phactr1-PP1 holoenzyme, Phactr1 sequences C-terminal to the RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W string interact with the PP1 hydrophobic groove to form a composite hydrophobic pocket, topped by a basic rim. This imposes strong sequence selectivity on substrates, favouring hydrophobic residues at positions +4/+5 relative to the phosphorylated residue, within an acidic context (consensus pS/T-x<sub>(2-3)</sub>-Φ-L, the “LLD motif”). Strikingly, this specificity is maintained in a PP1-Phactr1 fusion protein comprising PP1(1-304) linked to Phactr1 sequences from residue 526, just C-terminal to its RVxF motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fedoryshchak et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Neurabin and Spinophilin remodel the PP1 hydrophobic groove differently from Phactr1, generating a structurally distinct surface on the holoenzyme, and it is likely that the other RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W PIPs do so as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ragusa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fedoryshchak et al., 2020</xref>) (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-S2</xref>). Whether and how these diverse surfaces might play a role in the substrate specificity of these PIP/PP1 holoenzymes has remained unclear, largely because little is known about their substrates. Here we investigate determinants of substrate specificity in the other RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W PIPs, focussing on Neurabin/Spinophilin, which also contain a PDZ domain previously suggested to be involved in substrate recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Burnett et al, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kelker et al, 2007</xref>). We use the PP1-PIP fusion approach to show that the four Phactr1 holoenzymes have indistinguishable substrate specificities, and to identify novel candidate substrates for the other RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W PIP/PP1 complexes. We use 4E-BP1, a new Neurabin/PP1 substrate, to show that unlike the Phactr1/PP1 holoenzyme, substrate specificity of Neurabin/PP1 is largely determined by interaction with the Neurabin PDZ domain rather than the primary sequences of the dephosphorylation site itself.</p>

<title>PP1-PIP fusion proteins</title>
<p>The PP1 C-terminal sequences closely approach the Phactr1 RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W string in the vicinity of the ΦΦ motif, which allowed the construction of a single chain PP1α-PIP fusion derivative comprising PP1α(7-304) linked to Phactr1 sequences from a point just C-terminal to its RVxF motif (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-S1A</xref>, <xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">S2A</xref>). The remodelled hydrophobic groove of this fusion is structurally identical to that of the Phactr/PP1 holoenzyme, and it retains similar activity and specificity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fedoryshchak et al., 2020</xref>). Guided by the structures of the other RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W PIPs, we generated analogous fusions of N-terminally Flag-tagged PP1 with fragments of Neurabin and Spinophilin (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-S2B, S2C</xref>) (PPP1R9A/B,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ragusa et al., 2010</xref>), PNUTS (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-S2C</xref>) (PPP1R10, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Choy et al., 2014</xref>), and PPP1R15A and PPP1R15B (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-S2E, 1-S2F</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Yan et al., 2021</xref>), comprising the PP1-interacting sequences and any known protein interaction domains immediately C-terminal to them. We also constructed fusions with each the four Phactr proteins to explore any variation in their sequence specificities (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-S1A</xref>, <xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">1-S2A</xref>).</p>
<p>Each fusion protein was stably expressed in 293 Flp-In T-Rex cells using a tetracycline-inducible vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ward et al, 2011</xref>). Tetracycline titration of PP1-Phactr1 cells induced increasing expression of the fusion protein, leading to corresponding dephosphorylation of its substrates IRSp53 pS455 and Afadin pS1275 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fedoryshchak et al., 2020</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Afadin pS1275 was dephosphorylated by all four PP1-Phactr fusions, but not by the other PP1-PIP fusions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Similar results were observed with exogenously expressed wildtype IRSp53. In this setting, alanine substitution of IRSp53 L460, which contacts the novel Phactr1/PP1 hydrophobic pocket and impairs dephosphorylation by the intact Phactr1/PP1 holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fedoryshchak et al., 2020</xref>), also impaired dephosphorylation by all the PP1-Phactr fusions, indicating that they recognise phosphorylated IRSp53 in a similar way (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-S1B</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Proteomic analysis of PP1-fusion specificity</title>
<p>To investigate the substrate specificities of the fusion proteins, we performed Tandem-Mass-Tag (TMT) phosphoproteomics. Fractionated peptides were measured in both MS2 and MS3 modes for maximal identification and quantification (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Phosphorylation site abundances within triplicate samples from the same cell line were comparable between replicates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). First, we identified phosphorylation sites significantly depleted by expression of PP1α(7-304) alone compared with vector only, using Perseus software and a t-test with a 1% permutation-based false-discovery rate cutoff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Tyanova et al, 2016</xref>). In agreement with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hoermann et al., 2020</xref>), PP1 exhibited little sequence specificity, other than a preference for positively charged residues in positions-3,-1 and +3 to the dephosphorylation site (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-S1A, 2-S1B</xref>).</p>

<p>We then compared the specificities of the four PP1-Phactr fusion proteins. Expression of PP1-Phactr1 revealed numerous phosphorylation sites that were specifically depleted compared with cells expressing PP1α alone (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). This population contained many of the Phactr1/PP1 holoenzyme substrates previously identified in neurons or NIH3T3 fibroblasts, including IRSp53 pS455 and Afadin pS1275 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fedoryshchak et al., 2020</xref>). Of the 28 top Phactr1/PP1 hits previously identified in NIH3T3 cells, 18 were detectable in the 293 system, of which 13 also registered as PP1-Phactr1 hits (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-S1C</xref>). The putative PP1-Phactr1 substrates were also substantially enriched in the Phactr1/PP1 consensus dephosphorylation motif S/T-x<sub>2,3</sub>-Φ-L (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). The profiles of PP1-Phactr2, PP1-Phactr3, and PP1-Phactr4 cells were substantially similar to that of PP1-Phactr1 (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-S1D,E,F</xref>), exhibiting good overall correlations both between total phosphorylation site profiles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), and significant enrichment for both the S/T-x<sub>2,3</sub>-Φ-L motif and specific Phactr1/PP1 substrates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-S1C</xref>); over 60% of the depleted phosphorylation sites were in common between all four fusions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). These data show that the PP1-Phactr fusions recapitulate the specificity of the Phactr1/PP1 holoenzyme.</p>
<p>We next used the proteomics approach to investigate protein dephosphorylation by the PP1-R15A/B and PP1-PNUTS fusion proteins, comparing each fusion to all the others (other than its paralog) or PP1α alone (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>PPP1R15A has a well-validated substrate, eIF2α pS51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Novoa et al., 2001</xref>), whose effective dephosphorylation requires additional recruitment of G-actin to the PPP1R15A/PP1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Yan et al., 2021</xref>). The eIF2α pS51 phosphorylation site was not detected in the dataset, however, and no other phosphorylation sites were detectably depleted, apart from PPP6R1 S531, in cells expressing PPP1R15B (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-S2A,B</xref>). Expression of the PP1-PNUTS fusion, which includes sequences that recruit WDR82 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lee et al., 2010</xref>), led to specific depletion of phosphorylation sites from CXXC1/CFP1 and SET1B, which along with WDR82 are components of the COMPASS histone lysine <italic>N</italic>-methyl transferase complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cenik and Shilatifard, 2021</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-S2C</xref>).

<p>Phosphorylation sites from two other proteins, DTL and CAMSAP3, were also significantly depleted upon expression of both PP1-Spinophilin and PP1-Neurabin fusions, while a further 7 were specific to one fusion or the other (see Discussion). However, apart from a preference for proline at position +1, inspection these sequences did not reveal any obvious sequence similarities in the vicinity of the dephosphorylation site (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Substrates identified in the PP1-Phactr and PP1- PNUTS screens showed no detectable depletion, and <italic>vice versa</italic>, indicating that the substrates identified were specific for each fusion. Consistent with the phosphoproteomics data, immunoblotting analysis with phosphorylation-specific antibodies demonstrated that induction of PP1-Neurabin resulted in decreased phosphorylation of T70, S65/S101 and possibly T37/T46, while total 4E-BP1 resolved from a heterogeneous distribution to a largely monodisperse species (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-S1B,C</xref>).</p>

<title>The PP1-Neurabin PDZ domain is required for 4E-BP1 dephosphorylation</title>
<p>To demonstrate a direct enzyme-substrate relationship between 4E-BP1 and PP1-Neurabin we expressed mCherry-tagged 4E-BP1 in 293 cells, recovered it on RFP-trap affinity beads, and incubated it with increasing amounts recombinant PP1- Neurabin. Analysis with the phospho-specific antibodies confirmed that pT37/46, pS65/101 and pT70 are all direct targets for dephosphorylation by PP1-Neurabin, with pT70 being somewhat preferred (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, 4B).

<p>Simple deletion of the 4E-BP1 C-terminal residues substantially blocked phosphorylation of transfected mCherry-4E-BP1 (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-S1A</xref>), reflecting the loss of the C-terminal TOR signalling (TOS) motif required for mTORC1 kinase recruitment and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Schalm and Blenis, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Yang et al, 2017</xref>). Noting that the TOS motif does not include the C-terminal carboxylate, an essential part of the classical PBM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Harris and Lim, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Tonikian et al, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Subbaiah et al, 2011</xref>), we generated mCherry-4E-BP1(118+A): this contains an additional C-terminal alanine, which leaves the TOS motif intact but inactivates the PBM. Indeed, although mCherry-4E-BP1(118+A) was efficiently phosphorylated upon expression in 293 cells (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-S1A</xref>), its dephosphorylation <italic>in vitro</italic> required PP1-Neurabin concentrations some 20-50 times greater than the wildtype protein (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, 4B). These results suggest that the 4E-BP1 C-terminal sequences constitute a PDZ binding motif (PBM), and point to a role for the Neurabin and Spinophilin PDZ domains in substrate recognition.</p>
<p>We next used a fluorescence polarization assay to compare the PDZ-binding affinity of the 4E-BP C-terminal sequences with those of p70 S6K, and other proteins reported to be Neurabin/Spinophilin PDZ ligands (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Burnett et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Penzes et al, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kelker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ragusa et al., 2010</xref>). The 4E-BP1 PBM, which is identical amongst all three 4E-BP isoforms, bound the PDZ domains with comparable affinities in the micromolar range, and binding was abolished by substitution of the C-terminal hydrophobic residues (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C,4D</xref>; <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-S1B</xref>).</p>

<title>PDZ domain interaction determines PP1-Neurabin specificity</title>

<p>PP1-Neurabin dephosphorylated 4E-BP1<sup>PBM</sup> with a catalytic efficiency some 100-fold greater than PP1 alone, while peptide 4E-BP1<sup>MUT</sup>, which cannot bind the Neurabin PDZ domain, was 30-fold less reactive (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-S1A,B</xref>).

The Neurabin sequences, specifically the PDZ domain, thus play a critical role in specific 4E-BP1 pT70 substrate recognition.

<title>Substrate interactions with the remodelled PP1 hydrophobic groove do not affect PP1-Neurabin specificity</title>
<p>We next assessed the potential role of the remodelled hydrophobic groove in substrate recognition. Positions +3 to +6 relative to the dephosphorylation site are critical for recognition of the remodelled hydrophobic groove by Phactr1/PP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fedoryshchak et al., 2020</xref>), so we assessed the effect of mutations at these positions on catalytic activity. PP1-Neurabin dephosphorylated 4E-BP1<sup>PBM</sup> containing alanine substitutions, or IRSp53 sequences, at positions +3/4 or +5/6 with slightly increased catalytic efficiency (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-S1A,C</xref>). These mutations had strikingly different effects on 4E-BP1<sup>PBM</sup> dephosphorylation by PP1-Phactr1, however. While the alanine substitutions at positions +3/4 or +5/6 had little effect, conversion of +4 to +6 to the IRSp53 sequence LLD increased catalytic efficiency some 20-fold (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-S1A,C</xref>).

Strikingly, alanine substitutions at +1 and +2 in 4E-BP1<sup>PBM</sup> significantly increased catalytic efficiency by both PP1-Neurabin and PP1-Phactr1, perhaps reflecting changes at the catalytic site itself (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-S1A,E</xref>; see Discussion).</p>
<p>Taken together with the results in the preceding section, these data support a model in which PP1-Neurabin substrate specificity is driven predominantly by the ability of substrates to interact with the Neurabin PDZ domain rather than the remodelled PP1 hydrophobic groove (<xref rid="fig5s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-S2</xref>).

The 4E-BP1 PBM, 113(QFEMDI)118, uses a beta-strand addition mechanism to make extensive contacts with the Neurabin PDZ domain, similar to those seen in other PDZ-ligand complexes, that widen the PBM-binding groove (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-S1B</xref>): 4E-BP1 F114, M116 and I118 side chains make hydrophobic contacts, while their main chain carbonyl and amide groups, and the C-terminal carboxylate, form an extensive hydrogen bonding network with Neurabin main chain residues L514, G515, I516, I518, and G520 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>).</p>
<p>Apart from the C-terminal PBM, the 4E-BP1 T70 substrate sequences were largely unresolved in the crystal structure. Unlike the Phactr1 substrate chimera, no interactions were seen with the remodelled PP1-Neurabin hydrophobic groove; and no virtual enzyme-product complex and solvent phosphate were detected at the active site, perhaps reflecting the absence of stabilising hydrophobic groove interactions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). To gain insight into potential interactions at the PP1 catalytic site, we therefore used AlphaFold3 to model the PP1-4E-BP1 substrate chimera in its phosphorylated and unphosphorylated states (<xref rid="fig6s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-S2A, 6-S2B</xref>).</p>
<p>While the 4E-BP1/ PDZ interaction was correctly predicted regardless of phosphorylation status (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref rid="fig6s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-S2E</xref>), only the phosphorylated substrate was predicted to interact directly with the PP1 active site. The 4E-BP1 substrate sequence <sup>68</sup>TK(pT70)PPR<sup>73</sup>, predicted with high confidence, docks at the catalytic site, with K69 interacting with D220<sup>PP1</sup>, pT70 interacting with the metal ions, H125<sup>PP1</sup> and R221<sup>PP1</sup>, and P71 interacting with Y134<sup>PP1</sup>, but the remodelled PP1 hydrophobic groove remains unoccupied (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref rid="fig6s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-S2C</xref>). In contrast, AlphaFold3 gives only a low confidence prediction for the unphosphorylated substrate site D74 and L75 interacting with H125<sup>PP1</sup>, and Y134<sup>PP1</sup> (<xref rid="fig6s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-S2D</xref>).These results are consistent with the biochemical studies, and support the notion that interaction with the remodelled hydrophobic groove plays no part in recognition of 4E-BP1 by the Neurabin/PP1 holoenzyme.</p>
<p>Finally we used AlphaFold3 to predict interactions between Neurabin/PP1 and full-length 4E-BP1 phosphorylated on T37, T46, S65, T70, or S101 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>, <xref rid="fig6s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-S2F</xref>). All the predictions placed the C-terminus of 4E-BP1 in the ligand-binding groove of the PDZ domain, docking the phosphorylated T70 site in the PP1 active site in a similar manner way to that seen in the substrate chimera predictions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>; <xref rid="fig6s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-S2C</xref>). Taken together with the crystallography and biochemical data, our observations support the view that the primary determinant of substrate specificity for Neurabin/PP1 is interaction with the PDZ domain adjacent to the RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W string.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The PP1 catalytic subunit possesses little intrinsic sequence specificity.</p>
<p>Instead it recognises specific substrates by forming holoenzymes in which it partners with a variety of PP1 interacting proteins (PIPs) to direct dephosphorylation to specific substrates. We previously showed that interaction of the Phactr1 PIP with PP1 remodels the PP1 hydrophobic substrate groove in such a way as to allowing specific recognition of substrate sequences C-terminal to the dephosphorylation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fedoryshchak et al., 2020</xref>). Phactr1 belongs to a group of PIPs that recognise PP1 using a common RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W string, all of which potentially remodel the hydrophobic groove; indeed, structural studies confirm that Neurabin and Spinophilin (PPP1R9A, PPP1R9B) do this differently from the Phactrs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ragusa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fedoryshchak et al., 2020</xref>). We identified potential substrates for the other RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W PIPs, and elucidate mechanisms of substrate recognition, focussing on the Neurabin and Spinophilin PIPs.</p>
<p>Our previous study showed that a fusion protein comprising PP1 joined to Phactr1 sequences C-terminal to the RVxF motif maintains both the structure and the sequence-specificity of the intact Phactr1/PP1 holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fedoryshchak et al., 2020</xref>). We used this fusion approach, in conjunction with MS phosphoproteomics in 293 cells, to compare the specificities of the different Phactr family members, and to identify potential substrates for other RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W PIPs. All four PP1-Phactr fusions exhibited virtually identical substrate specificities, which were substantially similar to that of the authentic Phactr1/PP1 holoenzyme, giving confidence that findings made with the fusions are also applicable to other RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W PIP/PP1 holoenzymes. It is likely that differential intracellular targeting and/or tissue-specific expression of the four different Phactr/PP1 holoenzymes allows further refinement of substrate specificity.</p>
<p>Expression of the other PP1-(RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W PIP) fusions revealed potential substrates for PNUTS and PP1-Neurabin/-Spinophilin. Unlike the PP1-Phactr substrates, however, these exhibited no obvious sequence similarities in the substrate sequences adjacent to the targeted dephosphorylation remodelled hydrophobic groove. For PNUTS, we identified only the SET1A/B-COMPASS complex components CXXC1/CFP1 and SETD1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cenik and Shilatifard, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>These may be recruited to PNUTS by interaction with its binding partner WDR82, which is also present in SET1A/B-COMPASS complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cenik and Shilatifard, 2021</xref>), but further work will be necessary to confirm this. We did not recover potential substrates for PP1-PPP1R15A/B. It is possible that the use of the PP1 fusion approach for these PIPs is confounded by interaction of these PIPs with G-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Yan et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Expression of the PP1-Neurabin and PP1-Spinophilin fusions identified nine potential substrates with eighteen candidate dephosphorylation sites, of which eight represented conserved mTORC1 dependent phosphorylations of the translational regulators 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2. Using immunoblotting we found that the p70 S6K activating phosphorylation at T389 also appears to be a substrate for PP1-Neurabin. The 4E-BPs and p70 S6K are critical targets of the mTORC1 pathway, which links translational control to cell nutrient status and extracellular signals in multiple settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hoeffer and Klann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Liu and Sabatini, 2020</xref>). Consistent with this, we found that overexpression of PP1-Neurabin can suppress translation when expressed in 293 cells. It therefore is likely that Neurabin and Spinophilin can negatively regulate both arms of the mTORC1 protein synthesis pathway (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-S1C</xref>).</p>
<p>The presence of multiple dephosphorylation sites on the 4E-BPs with no obvious primary sequence homology raised the question of how these targets are recognised. We found that dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 by PP1-Neurabin requires its C-terminal sequences, which constitute a classical PDZ-binding motif (PBM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Harris and Lim, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Tonikian et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Subbaiah et al., 2011</xref>). The micromolar affinity of this interaction, which is stronger than that previously reported for p70 S6K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Burnett et al., 1998</xref>), may reflect the necessity for effective competition with the mTORC1 kinase complex, which binds the 4E-BPs using a C-terminal TOS motif that overlaps the PBM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Schalm and Blenis, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). Although we recovered a number of other potential Neurabin and Spinophilin substrates in the proteomics screen, none contains an obvious potential C-terminal PBM; further work will be necessary to establish whether they are <italic>bona fide</italic> substrates. We found that other reported ligands, such as the glutamatergic and dopaminergic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kelker et al., 2007</xref>) bind the Neurabin/Spinophilin PDZ domains with much lower affinity than 4E-BP1 or even p70 S6K. In neurons, association of these receptors with Neurabin and PP1 correlates with channel activity and dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wu et al, 2008</xref>; Yan, 1999 #29, reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Foley et al., 2021</xref>). It may be that Neurabin/Spinophilin oligomerisation and/or F-actin binding, and membrane localisation, effectively increases the avidity of such weak PBM-PDZ interactions, but more work is required to establish whether these channels are direct Neurabin/PP1 substrates.</p>
<p>We used synthetic peptide substrates derived from 4E-BP1, or the Phactr1/PP1 substrate IRSp53, to investigate how the substrate recognition mechanisms differ between the PP1-Neurabin and PP1-Phactr fusions. In the context of the PP1-PIP fusions, and by extension in that of the PIP/PP1 holoenzyme, the PIP sequences play a critical role in directing substrate specificity and potentiating catalytic efficiency. In the PP1-Neurabin fusion, interaction with the PDZ domain is the critical determinant of both catalytic efficiency and specificity (<xref rid="fig5s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-S2</xref>). It increases catalytic efficiency 100-fold above that seen with PP1 alone, or the PP1-Phactr1 fusion. Moreover, the PP1-Neurabin fusion was inactive with the Phactr1/PP1 substrate IRSp53 unless the latter was made competent to bind the Neurabin PDZ domain. Our observations suggest a model in which 4E-BPs are recruited to Neurabin/PP1 via high affinity PBM-PDZ interaction, with the relatively low affinity of active-site interaction allowing dephosphorylation of the multiple sites during one round of PDZ binding (<xref rid="fig5s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-S2</xref>). In contrast, dephosphorylation of the Phactr1/PP1 target IRSp53 pS455 by the PP1-Phactr1 fusion protein was critically dependent on interaction with the remodelled hydrophobic groove, consistent with our previous data (<xref rid="fig5s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-S2</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fedoryshchak et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Several lines of evidence support the view that interaction with the remodelled PP1 hydrophobic groove plays no role in PP1-Neurabin substrate recognition. First, the PP1-Neurabin substrates we identified have no obvious sequence similarity at positions +3 to +6, the sequences that potentially interact with the remodelled hydrophobic groove, and alanine substitutions at these positions do not influence PP1-Neurabin catalytic activity. Structural analysis of a PP1-4E-BP1 substrate fusion complexed with Neurabin, also revealed no substrate contacts with PP1, although the PDZ-4E-BP1 interaction was well-resolved. Finally AlphaFold modelling of complexes formed between 4E-BP1 substrates and the Spinophilin/PP1 holoenzyme predicted phosphorylation-specific interactions with the PP1 catalytic site, but no interactions with the remodelled hydrophobic groove. We were intrigued to note, however, that alanine substitutions at +1 and +2 in relative to 4E-BP1 pT70 increased reactivity with both PP1-Neurabin and PP1-Phactr1. We speculate that this “suboptimal” reactivity may reflect a requirement to balance dephosphorylation rates between the multiple 4E-BP1 phosphorylation sites, especially if multiple rounds of dephosphorylation occur for each PBM-PDZ interaction.</p>
<p>Although the remodelled hydrophobic groove does not play a role in 4E-BP recognition by Neurabin/PP1, this does not necessarily mean that sequence-specific dephosphorylation by other PIP/PP1 complexes and substrate recruitment by protein interactions are inherently mutually exclusive: in principle a PIP could recruit substrates through protein interactions, and remodel the PP1 substrate binding grooves to allow discrimination between different phosphorylated sites on the target protein. That said, we think it likely that the other RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W PIPs will also recruit substrates by interaction with other PIP domains, or proteins bound to them. Such interactions might involve WDR82 for PNUTS, and G-actin for PPP1R15A/B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Yan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Erickson et al, 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>Our findings establish Neurabin/PP1 and Spinophilin/PP1 holoenzymes as new candidate regulators of the mTORC1 pathway. Many studies have focussed on mTORC1 regulation of translation on the control of cell growth, particularly in cancer settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Liu and Sabatini, 2020</xref>), and previous work has shown that endogenous PP2Cγ/ PPM1G contributes to 4E-BP1 dephosphorylation in 293 and HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Liu et al, 2013</xref>). Localised translational regulation is also important in other settings, however, including neuronal development and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Holt et al, 2019</xref>). Here, mTORC1 signalling plays an important role in neuronal plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hoeffer and Klann, 2010</xref>), as do both Neurabin and Spinophilin, which are largely neuron specific and enriched in dendritic spines (Wu, 2008 #75, reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Foley et al., 2021</xref>), and the 4E-BPs, particularly 4E-BP2 (for references see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Aguilar-Valles et al, 2015</xref>). Our finding that 4E-BPs are Neurabin/PP1 substrates potentially establishes a direct link between Neurabin and neuronal mTORC1 signalling (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-S1C</xref>), which will be an interesting topic for future investigation.</p>

Sitting drops of 1 μl consisted of a 1:1 (vol:vol) mixture of protein and well solution (20% PEG 6000, 0.2M MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 M MES pH 6.0). Crystals appeared within 5 days and reached maximum size after 7 days. Crystals were cryoprotected in well solution supplemented with 15% Glycerol + 15% ethylene glycol and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. 100 K at beamlines I04 (mx25587-44) of the Diamond Light Source Synchrotron (Oxford, UK). Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Data sets were indexed, scaled and merged with xia2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Winter et al, 2013</xref>). Molecular replacement used the atomic coordinates of human PP1 from PDB 4M0V (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Choy et al., 2014</xref>) in PHASER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">McCoy et al, 2007</xref>).</p>

<p>Refinement used Phenix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Adams et al, 2010</xref>). Model building used COOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Emsley et al, 2010</xref>) with validation by PROCHECK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Vaguine et al, 1999</xref>). Two copies of the complex were modelled in the asymmetric unit, but the entire PDZ domain of one copy was poorly defined in the density and therefore not modelled. The same issue was previously observed for the unliganded Spinophilin/PP1 structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ragusa et al., 2010</xref>). For structure analysis we used the second copy of the complex showing well-resolved density for PP1-4E-BP1 chimera and Neurabin. AlphaFold3 predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abramson et al, 2024</xref>) were performed using the AlphaFold3 server. Output structure prediction and parameter files are presented in Supplementary Data File 1.</p>

<title>Fluorescence polarisation assay</title>
<p>FAM-labelled peptides were dissolve in a buffer 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 250 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP. Peptide concentration was measured using Thermo Scientific NanoDrop One by FAM fluorescence at 495 nm. FP assays (10 µl final volume) were performed in 384-well plates. 2 µl of 500 nM peptide solutions were added to each well (100 nM final concentration). 8 µl of Neurabin PDZ or Spinophilin PDZ was added as a serial dilution, starting at 1000 µM (800 µM final concentration). Anisotropies were read out on BMG Labtech CLARIOstar Plus microplate reader.</p>
<p>Binding constants were estimated in GraphPad Prism 8 by fitting readouts with the following equation:

<title>Phosphatase activity assays</title>
<p>Phosphopeptides were dissolved in 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 250 mM NaCl buffer. Peptide concentration was measured using DeNovix DS-11 based on absorbance values at 215 nm. Assays (10 µl final volume) were performed in 384- well plates. The activity of the PP1 fusion preparation was established on the day of each experiment, using 50 µM pIRSp53<sup>PBM</sup> peptide as standard, with PP1-Phactr1 and PP1-Neurabin at various dilutions.</p>
<p>Peptides (4 µl) were serially diluted 2-fold from 1mM in complex buffer (1 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 250 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP). 2 µl of 5x Phosphate sensor (Thermo) was added to the wells. 2 µl of PP1-fusion protein was added to the wells and fluorescence measurements were started immediately and taken every 3 min or 5 min using BMG Labtech CLARIOstar Plus microplate reader. Data was collected for 15 min at room temperature. Phosphate standards were measured to convert fluorescence readouts into phosphate concentration using a standard curve. Difference in fluorescence between the last and first data point was used as a readout.</p>
<p>A concentration of PP1-Phactr1 and PP1-Neurabin was chosen such that readouts were in the linear range of the Phosphate sensor detection. To measure K<sub>M</sub> and catalytic efficiency (CE), an assay with varying dilutions of phosphopeptides was set up. 4 µl of a corresponding peptide dilution was added to wells, followed by 2 µl of 5x Phosphate sensor. 2 µl of PP1-fusion protein was added to the wells and fluorescence measurements were started immediately and taken every 3 min (alternatively, every 5 min). Data was collected for 15 min at room temperature.</p>
<p>Phosphate standards were measured to convert fluorescence readouts into phosphate concentration using a standard curve. Difference in fluorescence between the last and first data point was used as a readout. Rate constants were estimated in GraphPad Prizm 8 by fitting readouts to the rearranged Michaelis-Menten equation:

<title>4E-BP1 dephosphorylation immunoblot assay</title>
<p>293 Flp-In T-REx cells were transfected with mCherry-4E-BP1 (WT or 118+A mutant). Cells were lysed on the following day in the Tris-Triton buffer (see above). mCherry tagged constructs were enriched from the lysates using RFP-trap magnetic agarose beads (ChromoTek, rtma-20) using manufacturer’s protocol. Enriched fractions were eluted from the beads with 500 µl 200 mM glycine pH 2.5, resulting in pure phosphorylated solution of mCherry-4E-BP1 (WT or 118+A mutant). Serial dilutions of PP1-Neurabin (0-1000 nM final concentration) were added to 40 µl aliquots of mCherry-4E-BP1 (WT or 118+A mutant) 8 µl and incubated for 15 min at room temperature before addition of 18 µl 4x LDS sample buffer with DTT.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript the Treisman and colleagues address the question of how protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) regulatory subunits (or PP1-interacting protein (PIPs)) confer specificity on the PP1 catalytic subunit which by itself possesses little substrate specificity. In prior work the authors showed that the PIP Phactrs confers specificity by remodelling a hydrophobic groove immediately adjacent to the PP1 catalytic site through residues within the RVxF- ø ø -R-W string of Phactrs. Specifically, the residues proximal and including the 'W' of the RVxF- ø ø -R-W string remodel the hydrophobic groove. Other residues the of the RVxF- ø ø -R-W string (i.e. the RVxF- ø ø -R) are not involved in this remodelling.</p>
<p>The authors suggest that the RVxF- ø ø -R-W string is a conserved feature of many PIPs including PNUTS, Neurabin/spinophilin and R15A. However from a sequence and structural perspective only the RVxF- ø ø -R- is conserved. The W is not conserved in most and in the R15A structure (PDB:7NZM) the Trp side chain points away from the hydrophobic channel - this could be a questionable interpretation due to model building into the low resolution cryo-EM map (4 A).</p>
<p>In this paper the authors convincingly show that Neurabin confers substrate specificity through interactions of its PDZ domain with the PDZ domain-binding motif (PBM) of 4E-BP. They show the PBM motif is required for Neurabin to increase PP1 activity towards 4E-BP and a synthetic peptide modelled on 4E-BP and also a synthetic peptide based on IRSp53 with a PBM added. The PBM of 4E-BP1 confers high affinity binding to the Neurabin PDZ domain. A crystal structure of a PP1-4E-BP1 fusion with Neurabin shows that the PBM of 4E-BP interacts with the PDZ domain of Neurabin. No interactions of 4E-BP and the catalytic site of PP1 are observed. Cell biology work showed that Neurabin-PP1 regulates the TOR signalling pathway by dephosphorylating 4E-BPs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work demonstrates convincingly using a variety of cell biology, proteomics, biophysics and structural biology that the PP1 interacting protein Neurabin confers specificity on PP1 through an interaction of its PDZ domain with a PDZ-binding motif of 4E-BP1 proteins. Remodelling of the hydrophobic groove of the PP1 catalytic subunit is not involved in Neurabin-dependent substrate specificity, in contrast to how Phactrs confers specificity on PP1. The active site of the Neurabin/PP1 complex does not recognise residues in the vicinity of the phospho-residue, thus allowing for multiple phospho-sites on 4E-BP to be dephosphorylated by Neurabin/PP1. This contrasts with substrate specificity conferred by the Phactrs PIP that confers specificity of Phactrs/PP1 towards its substrates in a sequence-specific context by remodelling the hydrophobic groove immediately adjacent to the catalytic. The structural and biochemical insights are used to explore the role of Neurabin/PP1 in dephosphorylation 4E-BPs in vivo, showing that Neurabin/PP1 regulates the TOR signalling pathway, specifically mTORC1-dependent translational control.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The only weakness is the suggestion that a conserved RVxF- ø ø -R-W string exists in PIPs. The 'W' is not conserved in sequence and 3-dimensions in most of the PIPs discussed in this manuscript. The lack of conservation of the W would be consistent with the finding based on multiple PP1-PIP structures that apart from Phactrs, no other PIP appears to remodel the PP1 hydrophobic channel.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The authors have addressed my comments.</p>
<p>One aspect of the manuscript and response to reviewers is misleading regarding the statement: 'Like many PIPs, they interact with PP1 using the previously defined &quot;RVxF&quot;, &quot;ΦΦ&quot;, and &quot;R&quot; motifs (Choy et al, 2014).' This statement, and similar in the authors' response, implies that Choy et al discovered the &quot;RVxF&quot; and &quot;ΦΦ&quot; motifs. The Choy et al, 2014 paper reports the discovery of the &quot;R&quot; motif. The &quot;RVxF&quot; and &quot;ΦΦ&quot; motifs were discovered and reported in earlier papers not cited in the authors' manuscript. Perhaps the authors can correct this.</p>

<p>This manuscript explores the molecular mechanisms that are involved in substrate recognition by the PP1 phosphatase. The authors previously showed that the PP1 interacting protein (PPI), PhactrI, conferred substrate specificity by remodelling the PP1 hydrophobic substrate groove. In this work, the authors aimed to understand the key determinant of how other PIPs, Neurabin and Spinophilin, mediate substrate recognition.</p>
<p>The authors generated a few PP1-PIP fusion constructs, undertook TMT phosphoproteomics and validated their method using PP1-Phactr1/2/3/4 fusion constructs. Using this method, the authors identified phsophorylation sites controlled by PP1-Neurabin and focussed their work on 4E-BP1, thereby linking PP1-Neurabin to mTORC1 signalling. Upon validating that PP1-Neurabin dephosphorylates 4E-BP1, they determined that 4E-BP1 PBM binds to the PDZ domain of Neurabin with an affinity that was greater than 30 fold as compared to other substrates. PP1-Neurabin dephosphorylated 4E-BP1WT and IRSp53WT with a catalytic efficiency much greater than PP1 alone. However, PP1-Neurabin bound to 4E-BP1 and IRSp53 mutants lacking the Neurabin PDZ domain with a catalytic efficiency lesser than that observed with 4E-BP1WT. These results indicate the involvement of the PDZ domain in facilitating substrate recruitment by PP1-Neurabin. Interestingly, PP1-Phactr1 dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 phenocopies PP1 alone, while PP1-Phactr1 dephosphorylates IRSp53 to a much higher extent than PP1 alone. These results highlights the importance of the PDZ domain and also shed light on how different PP1-PIP holoenzymes mediate substrate recognition using distinct mechanisms. The authors also show that the remodelling of the hydrophobic PP1 substrate groove which is essential for substrate recognition by PP1-Phactr1, was not required by PP1-Neurabin. Additionally, the authors also resolved the structure of a PP1-4E-BP1 fusion with the PDZ-containing C-terminal of Neurabin and observed that the Neurabin/PP1-4E-BP1 complex structure was oriented at 21{degree sign} to that in the unliganded Spinophilin/PP1 complex (resolved by Ragusa et al., 2010) owing to a slight bend in the C-terminal section that connects it to the RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W string. Since, no interaction was observed with the remodelled PP1-Neurabin hydrophobic groove, the authors utilised AlphaFold3 to further answer this. They observed a high confidence of interaction between the groove and phosphorylated substrate and a low confidence of interaction between the groove and unphosphorylated substrate, thereby suggesting that the hydrophobic groove remodelling is not involved in PP1-Neurabin recognition and dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1.</p>
<p>In this work, the authors provide novel insights into how Neurabin depends on the interaction between its PDZ domain and PBM domains of potential substrates to mediate its recruitment by PP1. Additionally, they uncover a novel PP1-Neurabin substrate, 4E-BP1. They systematically employ phosphoproteomics, biochemical and structural methods to investigate substrate specifity in a robust fashion. Furthermore, the authors also compares the interactions between PP1-Neurabin to 4E-BP1 and IRSp53 (PP1-Phactr1 substrate) with PP1-Phactr1, to showcase the specificity of the mode of action employed by these complexes in mediating substrate specificity. The authors do employ an innovative PP1-PIP fusion strategy previously explored by Oberoi et al., 2016 and the authors themselves in Fedoryshchak et al., 2020. This method, allows for a more controlled investigation of the interactions between PP1-PIPs and its substrates. Furthermore, the authors have substantially characterised the importance of the PDZ domain using their fusion constructs, however, I believe that a further exploration into either structural or AlphaFold3 modelling of PBM domain substrate mutants, or a Neurabin PDZ-domain mutant might further strengthen this claim. Overall, the paper makes a substantial contribution to understanding substrate recognition and specificity in PP1-PIP complexes. The study's innovative methods, biological relevance, and mechanistic insights are strengths, but whether this mechanism occurs in a physiological context is unclear.</p>

<p>Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1), a vital member of the PPP superfamily, drives most cellular serine/threonine dephosphorylation. Despite PP1's low intrinsic sequence preference, its substrate specificity is finely tuned by over 200 PP1-interacting proteins (PIPs), which employ short linear motifs (SLIMs) to bind specific PP1 surface regions. By targeting PP1 to cellular sites, modifying substrate grooves, or altering surface electrostatics, PIPs influence substrate specificity. Although many PIP-PP1-substrate interactions remain uncharacterized, the Phactr family of PIPs uniquely imposes sequence specificity at dephosphorylation sites through a conserved &quot;RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W&quot; motif. In Phactr1-PP1, this motif forms a hydrophobic pocket that favors substrates with hydrophobic residues at +4/+5 in acidic contexts (the &quot;LLD motif&quot;), a specificity that endures even in PP1-Phactr1 fusions. Neurabin/Spinophilin remodel PP1's hydrophobic groove in distinct ways, creating unique holoenzyme surfaces, though the impact on substrate specificity remains underexplored. This study investigates Neurabin/Spinophilin specificity via PDZ domain-driven interactions, showing that Neurabin/PP1 specificity is governed more by PDZ domain interactions than by substrate sequence, unlike Phactr1/PP1.</p>
<p>A significant strength of this work is the use of PP1-PIP fusion proteins to effectively model intact PP1•PIP holoenzymes by replicating the interactions that remodel the PP1 interface and confer site-specific substrate specificity. When combined with proteomic analyses to assess phospho-site depletion in mammalian cells, these fusions offer critical insights into holoenzyme specificity, revealing new candidate substrates for Neurabin and Spinophilin. The studies present compelling evidence that the PDZ domain of PP1-Neurabin directs its specificity, with the remodeled PP1 hydrophobic groove interactions having minimal impact. This mechanism is supported by structural analysis of the PP1-4E-BP1 substrate fusion bound to a Neurabin construct, highlighting the 4E-BP1/PDZ interaction. This work delivers crucial insights into PP1-PIP holoenzyme function, combining biochemical, proteomic, and structural approaches. It validates the PP1-PIP fusion protein model as a powerful tool, suggesting it may extend to studying additional holoenzymes. While an extremely useful model, it must be considered unlikely the PP1-PIP fusions fully recapitulate the specificity and regulation of the holoenzyme.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p>
<p>Response to the public reviews:</p>
<p>We are very pleased to see these positive reviews of our preprint.</p>
<p>Reviewers 1 and 3 raise issues around PIP-PP1 interactions.</p>
<p>(1) Role of the “RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W string”</p>
<p>Most PIPs interact with the globular PP1 catalytic core through short linear interaction motifs (SLiMs) and Choy et al (PNAS 2014) previously showed that many PIPs interact with PP1 through conserved trio of SLiMs, RVxF-ΦΦ-R, which is also present in the Phactrs.</p>
<p>Previous structural analysis showed the trajectory of the PPP1R15A/B, Neurabin/Spinphilin (PPP1R9A/B), and PNUTS (PPP1R10) PIPs across the PP1 surface encompasses not only the RVxF-ΦΦ-R trio, but also additional sequences C-terminal to it (Chen et al, eLife, 2015). This extended trajectory is maintained in the Phactr1-PP1 complex (Fedoryshchak et al, eLife (2020). Based on structural alignment we proposed the existence of an additional hydrophobic “W” SLiM that interacts with the PP1 residues I133 and Y134.</p>
<p>The extended “RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W” interaction brings sequences C-terminal to the “W” SLiM into the vicinity of the hydrophobic groove that adjoins the PP1 catalytic centre. In the Phactr1/PP1 complex, these sequences remodel the groove, generating a novel pocket that facilitates sequence-specific substrate recognition.</p>
<p>This raises the possibility that sequences C-terminal to the extended “RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W string” in the other complexes also confer sequence-specific substrate recognition, and our study aims to test this hypothesis. Indeed, the hydrophobic groove structures of the Neurabin/Spinophilin/PP1 and Phactr1/PP1 complexes differ significantly (Ragusa et al, 2010; see Fedoryshchak et al 2020, Fig2 FigSupp1).</p>
<p>(2) Orientation of the W side chain</p>
<p>Reviewer 1 points out that in the substrate-bound PP1/PPP1R15A/Actin/eIF2 pre-dephosphorylation complex the W sidechain is inverted with respect to its orientation in  PP1-PPP1R15B complex (Yan et al, NSMB 2021). The authors proposed that this may reflect the role of actin in assembly of the quaternary complex. This does not necessarily invalidate the notion that sequences C-terminal to the “W” motif might play a role in actin-independent substrate recognition, and we therefore consider our inclusion of the R15A/B fusions in our analysis to be reasonable.</p>
<p>(3) Conservation of W</p>
<p>The motif ‘W’ does not mandate tryptophan - Phactrs and PPP1R15A/B indeed have W at this position but Neurabin/spinophilin contain VDP, which makes similar interactions. Similarly the “RVxF” motifs in Phactr1, Neurabin/Spinophilin, PPP1R15A/B and PNUTS are LIRF, KIKF, KV(R/T)F and TVTW respectively.</p>
<p>In our revision, we will present comparisons of the differentially remodelled/modified PP1 hydrophobic groove in the various complexes, discuss the different orientations of the tryptophan in the previously published PPP1R15A/PP1 and PPP1R15B/PP1 structures. We will also address the other issues raised by the referees.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Comments and suggestions for revisions</p>
<p>(1) The authors do not provide strong evidence that the interactions of the 'W' of the RVxF- øø -R-W string with the hydrophobic groove of PP1 is conserved in PIPs. Whereas the RVxF motif is well conserved and validated since its discovery in 1997, as are the øø - (an extension of the RVxF motif), and the 'R', the conservation of the Trp residue in the RVxF-øø-R-W string is not conserved.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did not mean to imply that the W motif is conserved amongst all PIPs.</p>
<p>Most PIPs interact with the globular PP1 catalytic core through short linear interaction motifs (SLiMs). Choy et al (PNAS 2014) previously showed that many PIPs interact with PP1 through a conserved trio of SLiMs, RVxF-ΦΦ-R, which is also present in the Phactrs.</p>
<p>Previous structural analysis showed that the PPP1R15A/B, Neurabin/Spinophilin (PPP1R9A/B), and PNUTS (PPP1R10) PIPs share a trajectory across the PP1 surface that encompasses not only the RVxF-ΦΦ-R SLIMs, but also additional sequences C-terminal to the R SLIM (Chen et al, eLife, 2015). This trajectory is also shared by the Phactr1-PP1 complex (Fedoryshchak et al, eLife, 2020). Based on this structural alignment we proposed the existence of an additional hydrophobic “W” SLiM that interacts with the PP1 residues I133 and Y134 (See Fedoryshchak et al, 2020, Figure 1 figure supplement 2).</p>
<p>Introduction, paragraph 2 is rewritten to make this clearer.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The sequence and positions of W differ in amino acid type and position relative to the RVxF-øø-R string.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The motif ‘W’ does not mandate tryptophan, it is our name for a common structurally aligned motif: although the Phactrs and PPP1R15A/B indeed have W at this position, Neurabin and spinophilin contain VDP, which nevertheless makes similar interactions. Similarly the _“_RVxF” motifs in Phactr1, Neurabin/Spinophilin, PPP1R15A/B and PNUTS are LIRF, KIKF, KV(R/T)F and TVTW respectively.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In the Discussion the authors state that the hydrophobic groove of PP1 is remodelled by Neurabin. However, details of this are not described or shown in the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The shared trajectory determined by the RVxF-øø-R-W string brings the sequences C-terminal to the W SLIM into the vicinity of the PP1 hydrophobic groove. In the Phactr1/PP1 holoenzyme this generates a novel pocket required for substrate recognition (Fedoryshchak et al, 2020). These observations raised the possibility that sequences C-terminal to the “W” motif in the other RVxF-øø-R-W PIPs also play a role in substrate recognition.</p>
<p>Introduction paragraph 3 now cites a new Figure 1-S2, which shows how the hydrophobic groove is remodelled in the various different PIP/PP1 complexes. A revised Figure 1A now indicates the hydrophobic residues defining the hydrophobic groove by grey shading.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) To add to the confidence of the structure, the authors should include a 2Fo-Fc simulated annealing omit map, perhaps showing the R and W interactions of the RVxF-øø-R-W string.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is now included as new Figure 6 Figure supplement 1. Note that in Neurabin, the W motif is VDP, where the valine and proline sidechains interact similarly to the tryptophan (see also new Figure 1-S2G,H).</p>
<p>We also add a new supplementary Figure 6-S1 comparing our PBM-liganded Neurabin PDZ domain with the previously published unliganded structure (Ragusa et al 2010).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Page 16. The authors state that spinophilin remodels the PP1 hydrophobic groove differently from Phactrs. Arguably spinophilin does not remodel the PP1 hydrophobic groove at all. There are no contacts between spinophilin and the PP1 hydrophobic groove in the spinophilin-PP1 structure, correlating with the absence of 'W&quot; in the RVxF-øø-R-W string in spinophilin.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The VDP sequence corresponding to the W motif in spinophilin and neurabin makes analogous contacts to those made by the W in Phactr1 (see Fedoryshchak et al 2020).</p>
<p>Remodelling is meant in the sense of altering the structure of the major groove by bringing new sequences into its vicinity rather than necessarily directly interacting with it. The spinophilin/PP1 and Phactr/PP1 hydrophobic grooves are compared in new Figure 1-S2 (see also Fedoryshchak et al 2020, Figure 2 figure supplement 1)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Page 8. For the cell-based/proteomics-dephosphorylation assay in Figure 2, it isn't clear why there were no dephosphorylation sites detected for the PPP1R15A/B-PP1 fusion (except PPP6R1 S531 for PPP1R15B). One might have expected a correlation with PP1 alone. Does this imply that PPP1R15A/B are inhibiting PP1 catalytic activity? Was the activity tested in vitro?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The R15A/B data are compared to average abundance of all the phosphosites in the dataset, including those of PP1.</p>
<p>We have not tested for a general inhibitory effect of R15A/B on PP1 activity. Many PIPs including R15A/B do occlude one or more of the PP1 substrate groove and therefore generally act as inhibitors of PP1 activity against some potential substrates, while enhancing activities against others.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>The work undertaken by the authors is extensive and robust, however, I believe that some improvement in the writing and some detailed explanation of certain results sections would help with the presentation of the work and clarity for the readers.</p>
<p>(1) The introduction should contain more information about the interaction between PP1 and Neurabin, given that this is the focus of the paper. This would give the reader the necessary background required to follow the paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Introduction paragraph 2 revised to describe the different SLIMs in more detail. New Figure 1-S2 shows detail of the different remodelled hydrophobic grooves in the various PIP/PP1 complexes.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Sentence explaining that IRSp53 L460 docks with the remodelled PP1 hydrophobic groove in the Phactr1/PP1 holoenzyme added in Results paragraph 2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Page 6: &quot;as expected, the +5 residue L460A mutation, which impairs dephosphorylation by the intact Phactr1/PP1 holoenzyme, impaired sensitivity to all the fusions, indicating that they recognise phosphorylated IRSp53 in a similar way (Figure S1B)&quot;. Statistics between IRSp53 and IRSp53L460A across PP1-PIPs need to be conducted before concluding the above. From the graph and the images, the impairment to dephosphorylation is not convincing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>For each of the four PP1-Phactr fusions, the IRSp53 L460A peptide shows significantly less reactivity than the IRSp53WT peptide (p&lt;0.05 for each fusion).</p>
<p>Since the proteomics studes in Figure 2 show that the substrate specificity of the four PP1-Phactr1 fusions is virtually identical, we combined the data for the four different fusions. The IRSp53 L460A peptide shows significantly less reactivity than the IRSp53WT peptide in this analysis (p&lt; 0.0001). This result shown in revised Figure S1B and legend.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) mCherry-4E-BP1(118+A), in which an additional C-terminal alanine should still allow TOSmediated phosphorylation, but prevent PDZ interaction. Does 4EBP1 (118+A) actually prevent interaction between PP1-Neurabin? This interaction needs to be validated, especially since spinophilin was shown to bind to multiple regions of PP1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is not clear what the referee is asking for here. The biochemical analysis in Figure 4C shows that the C-terminus of 4E-BP1 constitutes a classical PBM. The X-ray crystallography in Figure 6 confirms this, demonstrating H-bond interactions between the 4E-BP1 C-terminal carboxylate and main chain amides of L514, G515 and I516.</p>
<p>We consider the possibility that the 4E-BP1(118+A) mutant inhibits the activity of PP1-neurabin via a mechanism other than direct blocking 4E-BP1 / PDZ interaction to be unlikely for the following reasons:</p>
<p>(1) Addition of a C-terminal alanine will disrupt the PBM interaction because the extra residue sterically blocks access to the PBM-binding groove. This is the most parsimonious explanation, and is based on our solid structural and biochemical evidence that the 4E-BP1 C-terminus is a classical PBM.</p>
<p>(2) Alphafold3 modelling predicts Neurabin PDZ / 4E-BP1 PBM interaction with high confidence (shown in Figure 6-S2E), but it does not predict any PDZ interaction with 4E-BP1(118+A). Note added in Figure 6-S2 legend.</p>
<p>(3) Recognition of the 4E-BP1(118+A) mutation without loss of binding affinity would require that the mutant becapable of binding formally equivalent to recognition of an “internal” PDZ-binding peptide. Recognition of such “internal peptides” is dependent on their adopting a specifically constrained conformation, which typically requires reorganisation of the PDZ carboxylate-binding GLGF loop. Such “internal site” recognition typically involves more than one residue C-terminal to the conventional PDZ “0” position (see Penkert et al NSMB 2004, doi:10.1038/nsmb839; Gee et al JBC 1998, DOI: 10.1074/jbc.273.34.21980; Hillier et al 1999, Science PMID: 10221915).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) It is nice to see that the various PP1-Phactr fusions have around 60% substrate overlap between them. Would it be possible to compare these results with previously published mass spec data of Phactr1XXX from the group? There is mention of some substrates being picked up, but a comparison much like in Figure 2E would be more informative about the extent to which the described method captures relevant information.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is difficult to do directly as the PP1-Phactr fusion data are from human cells while that in Fedoryshchak et al 2020 is from mouse.</p>
<p>However, manual curation shows that of the 28 top hits seen in our previous analysis of Phactr1XXX in NIH3T3 cells, 18 were also detectable in the HEK293 system; of these, 13 were also detected as as PP1-Phactr fusion hits. Data summarised in new Figure 2-S1C. Text amended in Results, “Proteomic analysis...”, paragraph 2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Figure 3D Why are the levels of pT70, pT37/46 and total protein in vector controls much lower as compared to 0nM Tet in PP1-Neurabin conditions? It is also weird that given total protein is so low, why are the pS65/101 levels high compared to the rest?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We think it likely these phenomena reflect a low level expression of PP1-Neurabin expression in uninduced cells. Now noted in Figure 3D legend, basal PP1-Neurabin expression shown in new Figure 3-S1C. This alters the relative levels of the different species detected by the total 4E-BP1 antibody in favour of the faster migrating forms, which are less phosphorylated than the slower ones, and the total amount increases about 2-fold (Figure 3D, compare 0nM Tet lanes).</p>
<p>The altered p65/101-pT70 ratio is also likely to reflect the leaky PP1-Neurabin expression, since the relative intensities of the various phosphorylated species are dependent on both the relative rates of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Expression of a phosphatase would therefore be expected to differentially affect the phosphorlyation levels of different sites according to their reactivity.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Figure 3E: Does inhibiting mTORC further reduce translation when PP1-Neurabin is expressed? If this is the case, this might suggest that they might not necessarily be mTORC inhibitors?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have not done this experiment. Since Rapamycin cannot be guaranteed to completely block 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, and PP1-Neurabin cannot be guaranteed to completely dephosphorylate 4E-BP1, any further reduction upon their combination would be hard to interpret.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Substrate interactions with the remodelled PP1 hydrophobic groove do not affect PP1-Neurabin specificity. Is there evidence that PP1-Neurabin remodels the hydrophobic groove? Is it not possible that Neurabin does not remodel the PP1 groove to begin with and hence there is no effect observed with the various mutants? If this is not the case, it should be explained in a bit more detail.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Comparison of the Neurabin/PP1 and Phactr1/PP1 structures shows that the hydrophobic groove is remodelled differently in the two complexes. Now shown in new Figure 1-S2B,C,G.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) Figure 5B has a lot of interesting information, which I believe has not been discussed at all in the results section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To help interpretation of the enzymology in Figure 5 we have renamed 4E-BP1WT and IRSp53WT to 4E-BP1PBM and IRSp53PBM respectively, emphasising the inclusion of the wildtype or mutated PBM from 4E-BP1 on these peptides. Text in Results, “PDZ domain interaction…”, paragraph 1, and Figures 5 and S5 revised accordingly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Why does the 4E-BP1Mut affect catalytic efficiency of PP1 alone when compared with WT, while no difference is observed with IRSp53WT and mutant?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We do not understand the basis for the differential reactivity of 4E-BP1PBM and 4E-BP1MUT with PP1 alone; we suspect that it reflects the hydrophobicity change resulting from the MDI -&gt; SGS substitution. However this is unlikely to be biologically significant as PP1 is sequestered in PIP-PP1 complexes.</p>
<p>Importantly, the two PP1 fusion proteins behave consistently in this assay – the presence of the intact PBM increases reactivity with PP1-Neurabin, but has no effect on dephosphorylation by PP1-Phactr1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Why does PP1 alone not have a difference between IRSp53WT and mutant, while PP1-Neurabin does have a difference?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is due to the presence of the PBM in IRSp53WT (now renamed IRSp53PBM), which affects increases affinity for PP1 Neurabin, but not PP1 alone. Likewise, PP1-Phactr1, which does not possess a PDZ domain, is also unaffected by the integrity of the PBM.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) “Strikingly, alanine substitutions at +1 and +2 in 4E-BP1WT increased catalytic efficiency by both fusions, perhaps reflecting changes at the catalytic site itself (Figure 5E, Figure S5E)”. This could be expanded upon, because this suggests a mechanism that makes the substrate refractory to PDZ/hydrophobic groove remodelling?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We favour the idea that this reflects a requirement to balance dephosphorylation rates between the multiple 4E-BP1 phosphorylation sites, especially if multiple rounds of dephosphorylation occur for each PBM—PDZ interaction. Additional sentences added in Discussion paragraph 7.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Typographical errors and minor comments:</p>
<p>a) PIPs can target PP1 to specific subcellular locations, and control substrate specificity through autonomous substrate-binding domains, occupation or extension of the substrate grooves, or modification of PP1 surface electrostatics.</p>
<p>b) Phosphophorylation side site abundances within triplicate samples from the same cell line were comparable between replicates (Figure 2B).</p>
<p>c) While the alanine substitutions had little effect, conversion of +4 to +6 to the IRSp534E-BP1 sequence LLD increased catalytic efficiency some 20-fold (Figure 5C, Figure S5C).</p>
