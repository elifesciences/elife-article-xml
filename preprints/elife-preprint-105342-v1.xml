<title>Abstract</title><p>The degeneration of neurons in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is commonly associated with accumulation of misfolded, insoluble proteins. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are central regulators of protein homeostasis as they fold newly synthesized proteins and refold damaged proteins. Heterozygous loss-of- function mutations in the <italic>DNAJC7</italic> gene that encodes an HSP co-chaperone were recently identified as a cause for rare forms of ALS, yet the mechanisms underlying pathogenesis remain unclear. Using mass spectrometry, we found that the DNAJC7 interactome in human motor neurons (MNs) is enriched for RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and stress response chaperones. MNs generated from iPSCs with the ALS-associated mutation R156X in <italic>DNAJC7</italic> exhibit increased insolubility of its client RBP HNRNPU and associated RNA metabolism alterations. Additionally, DNAJC7 haploinsufficiency renders MNs increasingly susceptible to proteotoxic stress and cell death as a result of an ablated HSF1 stress response pathway. Critically, expression of HSF1 in mutant DNAJC7 MNs is sufficient to rescue their sensitivity to proteotoxic stress, while postmortem ALS patient cortical neurons exhibit a reduction in the expression of HSF1 pathway genes. Taken together, our work identifies DNAJC7 as a crucial mediator of HNRNPU function and stress response pathways in human MNs and highlights HSF1 as a therapeutic target in ALS.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a devasting neurodegenerative disease which is driven by the dysfunction and degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons (MNs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. The progressive loss of MNs leads to muscle atrophy and diminished ability to stimulate and control movement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. ALS cases are predominantly sporadic in nature, but a relatively small proportion of patients (&lt;12%) suffers from familial forms of the disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. The genetic etiology underlying these familial cases is complex, comprised of over 30 disease-causing genes encoding functionally diverse proteins involved in cellular functions ranging from RNA processing, cytoskeletal homeostasis, and axonal transport to protein quality control pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p><italic>DNAJC7</italic> is a recently identified ALS-associated gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> that is of particular interest because it encodes a co-chaperone protein with an ostensible but relatively unexplored role in protein homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, a process known to be perturbed in ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. It was first identified as an ALS-associated gene in a whole-exome sequencing (WES) study that highlighted a significant enrichment for protein truncating variants (PTVs) in <italic>DNAJC7</italic>, including nonsense and rare missense variants predicted to be pathogenic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Importantly, additional disease-causative variants in <italic>DNAJC7</italic> have been identified in a series of subsequent independent studies on small cohorts of ALS patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Most ALS enriched variants in <italic>DNAJC7</italic> are nonsense, while many missense variants are located within functional protein domains, strongly suggesting disease mechanisms driven by DNAJC7 haploinsufficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. However, the mechanisms by which mutant DNAJC7 causes MN dysfunction and eventual degeneration remain unknown.</p>
<p>The DNAJC7 protein is highly expressed within the central nervous system (CNS) and belongs to a superfamily of co-chaperone proteins known as HSP40s that are responsible for maintenance of protein homeostasis processes including <italic>de novo</italic> protein folding and cellular stress response pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. The specific role of the HSP40s co-chaperones such as DNAJC7 is to facilitate the unambiguous selection of substrates for HSP70/HSP90 chaperones amongst the promiscuous pool of available client proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. As such, the known interacting partners of DNAJC7 include several protein components of the HSP family including HSP70s (e.g., HSPA4, HSPA8) and HSP90s, where it has been shown to “bridge” clients between HSP70 and 90<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. While very little is known about the specific role or binding partners of DNAJC7 in neurons, the HSP70/90 complexes play critical roles in cellular proteostasis pathways. One such pathway is the heat shock response (HSR) pathway, which is governed by the highly conserved master transcription factor heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), and is broadly utilized by cells to cope with proteotoxic stress (e.g., stress caused by misfolded proteins) by upregulating the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) and chaperones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Here, we sought to determine how mutant DNAJC7 causes MN dysfunction. We discovered novel DNAJC7 interactors in human MNs, which were enriched for proteins participating in RNA metabolism and cellular responses to stress. Using CRISPR-Cas9 edited iPSC-derived MN models, we found that DNAJC7 haploinsufficiency disrupts mRNA metabolism through increased insolubility of HNRNPU. Most notably we found that mutant DNAJC7 MNs are sensitized to proteotoxic stress and exhibit degeneration because of a disruption in the timely activation of HSF1. Overexpression of HSF1 in mutant DNAJC7-MNs rescued their premature degeneration upon prolonged exposure to proteotoxic insult. Our findings elucidate the mechanisms by which DNAJC7 regulates MN proteostasis and highlight the potential of HSF1 stimulation as a therapeutic target in ALS to counter MN vulnerability.</p>

<title>DNAJC7 interacts with RNA binding proteins and regulators of stress response pathways in human MNs</title>
<p>In order to investigate the functional role of DNAJC7 in the context of ALS we sought to identify its binding partners in human MNs, which represent the most vulnerable cell type in the disease. We used a healthy control iPSC line (line CS0002, see Methods) to generate lower MNs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, and performed immunoprecipitation (IP) of endogenous DNAJC7, followed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based proteomic analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-B</xref> and S1A). We conducted the IP-MS experiment using MN cultures from 3 independent differentiations and identified 88 proteins that were consistently co-purified within the DNAJC7 IP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Of these, 48 proteins were found to co-purify exclusively with DNAJC7, while 13 were significantly enriched within the DNAJC7 IPs, relative to the IgG control IPs (p&lt;0.05) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, Figure S1B). To add further context to the DNAJC7 interactome we performed STRING and gene ontology (GO) bioinformatic analysis, which collectively highlighted “RNA binding”, “ATP binding”, “cellular response to stress” and “cytoskeleton” as significantly enriched categories (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-E</xref> and S1C). Importantly, these terms have been previously implicated in ALS pathogenesis in both genetic analysis and observations from disease models and post-mortem patient tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. We specifically identified several RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) including MATR3 and members of the family of heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particle (HNRNP) proteins such as HNRNPK, HNRNPU, HNRNPD, HNRNPC and HNRNPA1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and Table S1). Notably, genetic mutations in <italic>MATR3</italic> and <italic>HNRNPA1</italic> themselves are responsible for rare forms of ALS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, suggesting a converging functional interaction between independent causal genes. DNAJC7 has been previously shown to interact with another ALS-causal RBP in FUS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, although we did not confirm this in our unbiased proteomics analysis. The “cellular response to stress” enrichment was driven by several HSPs with chaperone activity including HSPA1A, HSPA8, and HSP90 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and Table S1). In fact, one of the main DNAJC7 interactors was HSPA1A, an HSP70 that is tightly linked to stress response pathways and has previously been shown to interact with DNAJC7 in multiple non neuronal cell models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. To independently validate these findings, we performed IP-Western blot (WB) analysis and probed for representative proteins from the “stress response” and “RNA binding” pathways in HSPA1A, HSP90AB1 and MATR3 respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F-H</xref>). Collectively, analysis of the DNAJC7 interactome in MNs showed that it physically interacts, potentially through HSP70/90 complexes, with a small and specific set of proteins enriched for RBPs and HSPs.</p>

<title>DNAJC7 haploinsufficiency disrupts HNRNPU solubility and target mRNA expression</title>
<p>We next sought to develop a cellular model to investigate the functional ramifications of ALS-associated DNAJC7 mutations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). We used CRISPR-Cas9 to knock-in a premature truncation point mutation (p466 C&gt;T [R156X]) into the endogenous gene locus in a healthy control iPSC stem cell line (line CS0002, see Methods) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). We targeted this mutation out of more than 15 that have been reported so far (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) because is the most common ALS-causing variant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, and it is predicted to be deleterious. The editing generated an isogenic pair of iPSC clones with two distinct genotypes: a heterozygous clone containing one copy of the mutation (DNAJC7<sup>R156X/+</sup>), and a targeted but unedited isogenic wild type (WT) control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). WB analysis showed that the DNAJC7 protein was reduced by ∼75% in heterozygous mutant iPSC-derived MNs (p&lt;0.0001), consistent with previous work demonstrating a similar level of DNAJC7 reduction in ALS patients harboring 1 copy of R156X<sup>7</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Importantly, DNAJC7 haploinsufficiency did not impede the efficiency of motor neurogenesis, as the mutant DNAJC7 and isogenic control iPSC lines exhibited equal efficiency of differentiation as measured by immunofluorescence (IF) for the MN markers ISL1/2 and MAP2 (Figure S2A-C).</p>

<p>Given the potential role of DNAJC7 in <italic>de novo</italic> protein folding, we next sought to utilize this isogenic iPSC platform to determine if DNAJC7 client RBPs have increased insolubility, indicating potential misfolding and subsequent dysfunction (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Intriguingly, we found that while most RBPs were not affected, the level of HNRNPU within the insoluble biochemical fraction, was significantly higher in mutant DNAJC7 MNs relative to isogenic controls (p&lt;0.0001) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Given HNRNPU’s relatively promiscuous role as an RNA binding protein, we next performed RNA-Sequencing (RNA Seq) in differentiated MNs to capture any potential HNRNPU- dependent changes in gene expression downstream of this altered solubility. We found ∼1600 differentially expressed genes in mutant DNAJC7 MNs (FDR &lt; 0.05), and upon performing gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on known HNRNPU target mRNAs within the dataset, we found that they were significantly under- represented in DNAJC7<sup>R156X/+</sup> cultures (normalized enrichment score [NES] = -1.56, FDR = 0.008) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>- G, Figure S2D). As a negative control, we also performed GSEA on mRNAs associated with other RBPs (e.g., MATR3, HNRNPL) whose solubility was unaffected in mutant DNAJC7 MNs and found no significant enrichment (Figure S2E-G). Together, these data demonstrate that ALS-associated DNAJC7 haploinsufficiency impacts the solubility of HNRNPU and the expression level of some of its client mRNAs.</p>

<title>DNAJC7 haploinsufficiency sensitizes MNs to proteotoxic stress</title>
<p>We next focused on dissecting the significance of DNAJC7 haploinsufficiency in cellular stress response pathways. Several chaperones including HSPA1A, HSPA8, and HSP90 that we found to bind DNAJC7 in MNs are involved in the handling of proteotoxic stress (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that loss of DNAJC7 might disrupt the ability of MNs to respond to proteotoxic stress and make them more sensitive to various relevant insults (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we treated DNAJC7<sup>R156X/+</sup> and isogenic control MNs with a series of small molecules that trigger endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (Brefeldin, 100nM), proteasomal stress (MG132, 5μM) and cytoplasmic stress (Ganetespib, 150nM) and monitored neuronal survival by live cell imaging (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). To track the survival of individual cells we used a neuron-specific fluorescent reporter (<italic>SYN1</italic>::GFP) in combination with the cell death indicating dye propidium iodide (PI) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>) and acquired single-cell resolution images of labeled MNs every 6 hours for 4 days after treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). We found that mutant DNAJC7 MNs degenerated significantly faster compared to their isogenic controls when exposed to MG132 (p&lt;0.0001) and Ganetespib (p=0.0001), but not Brefeldin (p=0.8095), suggesting this increased sensitivity was relatively specific (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D-F</xref>). Importantly these effects were robust across n=3 independent differentiations (Figure S3A-C), while we did not observe any spontaneous degeneration after vehicle DMSO treatment in either genotype. Although the specific mechanism of action of MG132 and Ganetespib is different (MG132 blocks the proteosome and Ganetespib inhibits HSP90 activity), a notable converging consequence of both molecules is an accumulation of excess proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, suggesting that DNAJC7 haploinsufficiency renders MNs vulnerable to the toxic accumulation of proteins.</p>

<p>We next used tandem mass tag mass spectrometry (TMT-MS) to compare the proteomic response of heterozygous DNAJC7<sup>R156X/+</sup> and isogenic control MNs following 8 hours of MG132 treatment, as this stressor elicited a very robust survival phenotype (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). TMT-MS employs multiplexed isobaric labeling that confers the advantage of enabling the pooling of all biological replicates, thereby eliminating batch variability and facilitating a highly quantitative method by which to directly compare the relative abundance of proteins from the same pool of identified peptides (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). We quantified 3,606 proteins and critically found that the labeling efficiency was equal across all biological replicates and experimental conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>). While most proteins were not alerted 8 hours after blocking the proteosome, 357 proteins, corresponding to approximately 9.9% of the quantified proteome, exhibited a significant change in their abundance in control MNs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J-K</xref> and Figure S3D). In stark contrast, only 48 proteins or only 1.3% of the quantified proteome, exhibited measurable changes in mutant DNAJC7 MNs subjected to the same treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J-K</xref> and Figure S3D). Notably, the proteins that become elevated in control MNs are enriched for pathways associated with “cellular responses to stress” suggesting a lack of such a canonical and potentially protective response in mutant MNs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3L</xref>). This robust lack of proteome remodeling in DNAJC7<sup>R156X/+</sup> MNs is in accordance with their increased rates of degeneration in response to proteotoxic stress.</p>

<title>DNAJC7 haploinsufficiency confers a basal reduction in HSF1 signaling in MNs</title>
<p>We next sought to better understand the molecular mechanisms driving the increased sensitivity of mutant DNAJC7 MNs to proteotoxic stress. We first carefully examined baseline gene and protein expression differences between DNAJC7<sup>R156X/+</sup> and isogenic control MNs with a focus on stress-associated terms. We identified 398 significantly altered proteins between the two genotypes and observed that several of the proteins that were significantly downregulated in DNAJC7<sup>R156X/+</sup> MNs represented known targets of the heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Accordingly, a targeted gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of 47 unique terms directly related to “stress”, revealed a highly significant downregulation of HSF1 target proteins (FDR&lt;0.0001) (MSigDB#: M19734) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B-C</xref>). Critically, this effect was highly specific, as no terms associated with other types of stress such as DNA damage response (MSigDB#: M13636), unfolded protein response (MSigDB#: M5922), cellular response to oxidative stress (MSigDB#: M45123), or cellular response to chemical stress (MSigDB#: M29264) were significantly changed in mutant DNAJC7 MNs (Figure S4A). Two of the most downregulated HSF1 target proteins in the MS dataset were CRYZ (p=0.0002) and HSPB1 (p&lt;0.0001) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), and we validated the reduction in their levels by WB in independently differentiated MN samples from DNAJC7<sup>R156X/+</sup> and isogenic control iPSC lines (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). GSEA on RNA-Seq datasets revealed a moderate but significant downregulation in the expression of HSF1 target genes in mutant DNAJC7 MNs (FDR = 0.02) (Figure S4B), further validating the effects on this pathway at both the transcriptional and proteomic level.</p>

<p>HSF1 is a highly conserved transcription factor that acts as a master regulator of cellular stress response, by activating a transcriptional cascade of chaperones, foldases and metabolic genes to counter proteotoxic stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Thus, a reduction in HSF1 signaling in heterozygous DNAJC7<sup>R156X/+</sup> MNs may be central to their increased vulnerability to proteotoxicity. Notably, HSPA1A and HSPA8, two proteins which we found to interact with DNAJC7 in MNs, are known to play a direct role in regulating HSF1 activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. The activation of this pathway has been previously associated with ALS pathophysiology, which is characterized by the accumulation of misfolded and aggregated proteins such as SOD1, FUS and TDP-43<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. To add further context to the significance of HSF1 signaling for neuronal homeostasis we used publicly available single-cell RNA Seq datasets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> to examine the expression of HSF1 and its target mRNAs within distinct cell types in the human CNS (Figure S4C-D). We found that all neurons in the cortex and spinal cord including spinal MNs, expressed higher levels of HSF1 targets relative to glia, vascular and immune cells within the CNS, suggesting a potential reliance of this pathway for neuronal homeostasis.</p>

<title>DNAJC7 haploinsufficiency delays stress-induced activation of HSF1</title>
<p>Given the converging evidence pointing to reduced baseline HSF1 signaling, we next interrogated the molecular activation of this pathway in mutant DNAJC7 and isogenic control MNs in response to stress (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Activation of the HSF1 pathway consists of several well-defined steps including a dynamic coupling/decoupling of HSF1 with HSP70, HSF1 hyperphosphorylation, nuclear translocation and ultimately transcriptional upregulation of stress-response target genes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). We first measured the level of phosphorylated HSF1 (Ser326), a marker of active HSF1, and found that while both sets of MNs showed increased phosphorylation after MG132 treatment, the ratio of pHSF1 over total HSF1 was significantly reduced in DNAJC7<sup>R156X/+</sup> MNs (n=3; p=0.033) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). To directly measure stress-dependent HSF1 activity we used RT-qPCR to evaluate the transcriptional level of the canonical HSF1 target <italic>HSP70</italic> and found reduced upregulation in mutant DNAJC7 MNs (n=3; p=0.0107) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>). These data suggest that DNAJC7 haploinsufficiency in MNs disrupts the timely activation of HSF1 upon induction of proteotoxic stress.</p>

<title>Activation of HSF1 rescues the sensitivity of mutant DNAJC7-MN to stress</title>
<p>To directly determine the contribution of HSF1 signaling to the vulnerability of mutant DNAJC7 MNs we next evaluated the effect of inhibiting or activating this pathway on neuronal survival. We first treated mutant and wildtype MNs with the highly specific HSF1 inhibitor DTHIB, which acts by binding to the DNA-binding domain of HSF1 and performed longitudinal live cell imaging analysis as described before. At low doses of treatment (10μM), DNAJC7<sup>R156X/+</sup> MNs demonstrated a ∼25% reduction in survival, whereas isogenic control MNs were virtually unaffected with only &lt;1% reduction in survival (n=3; p&lt;0.0001) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>). Similarly, treatment with a higher dose of DTHIB (20μM) caused a substantially larger reduction in the survival of DNAJC7<sup>R156X/+</sup> MNs (61%) relative to its effect in control MNs (40%) (n=3; p&lt;0.0001) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>), demonstrating a dose-dependent sensitivity of MNs to this molecule, which is dramatically heightened by DNAJC7 haploinsufficiency.</p>
<p>We next used a lentiviral vector to infect MG132-treated MNs with HSF1 (HSF1-LV) or an empty vector as a control (ORF-LV). We ensured that the overexpression level of HSF1 was equal across both genotypes (Figure S4F), and that the empty vector did not have any effect on neuronal survival (Figure S4E). As we observed previously (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D-F</xref>), mutant DNAJC7 MNs were substantially more vulnerable to proteasomal inhibition than controls (WT-ORF <italic>vs.</italic> R156X-ORF; n=3, p&lt;0.0001) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>). Remarkably an only 1.5-fold level of HSF1 overexpression selectively improved the survival of mutant DNAJC7 MNs by 40% (R156X-ORF <italic>vs.</italic> R156X-HSF1; n=3, p&lt;0.0001) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>). The effect of HSF1 was minor in isogenic control MNs, resulting in no quantifiable differences in survival between the two groups of HSF1-treated MN genotypes (WT-HSF1 <italic>vs.</italic> R156X-HSF1; n=3, p=0.177) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>). Taken together, our results demonstrate that mutant DNAJC7-MNs <italic>in vitro</italic> are particularly sensitive to HSF1 modulation, with overexpression being neuroprotective and inhibition causing neurodegeneration (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K</xref>).</p>
<p>Lastly, given that our findings revealed a bidirectional sensitivity of mutant DNAJC7 MNs to HSF1 modulation, we investigated whether the HSF1 pathway is relevant in the context of sporadic ALS disease. We used a single-cell RNA Seq dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> derived from human post-mortem cortical tissue comparing ALS patients (n=33, sporadic and mutant C9orf72) to age-matched healthy controls (n=16) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4L</xref>). We employed a “pseudo-bulk” analysis pipeline to measure cell-type-specific effects in ALS patient and control samples and found a significant reduction in the expression of HSF1 target genes in ALS inhibitory neurons (FDR = 0.006) and excitatory neurons (FDR = 0.031) relative to controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4M</xref>, left). Moreover, targeted GSEA showed a significant downregulation of HSF1 pathway genes in cortical ALS neurons including HSPB1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4M</xref>, right), analogous to the transcriptomic (Figure S4B) and proteomic (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>) profiles of iPSC-derived DNAJC7-MNs. This analysis suggests that HSF1-associated dysfunction may be a broadly pervasive feature of ALS.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>HSPs play a crucial role in the proteostasis deficits that pervade ALS pathophysiology. However, how loss of DNAJC7, which represents the only genetically linked HSP to ALS, causes MN dysfunction had remained unknown. To address this gap in knowledge, we identified DNAJC7 interacting partners and developed human iPSC-based models to interrogate functional defects in DNAJC7-deficient spinal MNs. We found that DNAJC7 haploinsufficiency reduced the solubility of the RBP HNRNPU and caused alterations in associated target mRNAs. We also found that DNAJC7 haploinsufficiency reduced the basal activity of HSF1 and impeded the timely activation of the HSF1 pathway in response to proteotoxic stress. These defects, which caused substantial vulnerability of MNs to proteotoxic stress, could be rescued by mild HSF1 overexpression. Our findings establish an indispensable role for HSF1 signaling in MN homeostasis, demonstrate that DNAJC7-associated sensitivity to stress is driven by a disruption in HSF1 activation, and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting HSF1 to combat MN degeneration.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, we found a strong enrichment of RBPs that associate with DNAJC7 in human MNs including two proteins that can cause rare forms of ALS when mutated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, MATR3 and HNRNPA1, suggesting a converging interaction. We focused on HNRNPU because we found clear evidence for increased insolubility for this protein in mutant DNAJC7 MNs, at least under basal conditions. HNRNPU is an RBP that targets multiple RNAs to regulate their splicing and expression and plays a key role in cortical development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, while mutations in <italic>HNRNPU</italic> have been associated with rare forms of pediatric neurodevelopmental epilepsy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. The role if any at all, of HNRNPU in ALS pathophysiology has not been extensively explored, although it has been shown to directly bind to TDP-43 in nucleus and modulate TDP-43-dependent splicing and neurotoxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. It has also been flagged as an RBP with strong relevance to ALS by AI-based analysis of gene expression datasets and published literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. While we found a disruption in the HNRNPU target gene expression signature in DNAJC7<sup>R156X/+</sup> MNs, our work did not explore the functional relevance of these alterations or the potential implications of this phenotype in the context of sporadic ALS disease.</p>
<p>Beyond RBPs the DNAJC7 interactome analysis we conducted in MNs identified several components of cytoskeletal homeostasis including the microtubule proteins TUBA1B and TUBA4A. Although we did not observe any overt defects in relevant pathways such as neuronal morphology in our <italic>in vitro</italic> models of DNAJC7, cytoskeletal defects have been directly implicated in other forms of genetic ALS as well as sporadic disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Interestingly, recent studies have highlighted a functional interaction between DNAJC7, and the microtubule associated protein tau that is encoded by <italic>MAPT</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. DnaJC7 was shown to coprecipitate with soluble human tau from brain preparations of a tauopathy mouse model and displayed higher binding affinity to natively folded WT relative to mutant tau, suppressing tau aggregation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. In a separate study, DNAJC7 was purified with insoluble mutant tau in HEK-293 cells, and subsequent knockdown of DNAJC7 both decreased the clearance of aggregated tau and exacerbated the seeding of tau <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Interestingly, overexpression of WT DNAJC7 abrogated mutant tau seeding, while introduction of ALS-associated mutations on the J-Domain of <italic>DNAJC7</italic>, which mediates interaction with HSP70, nullified this rescue. Tau aggregates are seen in as much as 50% of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>, a neurological disorder characterized by speech and executive dysfunction that shares genetic and pathological overlap with ALS, while 50% of ALS patients are also characterized by FTD symptoms. Although we did not specifically identify tau in our native human MN models, these studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> flag another potential neurodegenerative disease-relevant function of DNAJC7. Additionally, it is currently unknown whether ALS patients with <italic>DNAJC7</italic> mutations exhibit any tau pathology and whether mutations in <italic>DNAJC7</italic> can cause FTD-TAU. The continuous characterization of DNAJC7 patients and expanding ALS/FTD genetic studies will provide important clarity.</p>
<p>Our findings on DNAJC7 are in strong accordance with multiple studies that have demonstrated the neuronal protection qualities of other DNAJ co-chaperones in ALS, FTD, and Parkinson’s disease models, highlighting the converging importance of this class of proteins in neurodegenerative disease through their critical role in neuronal proteostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. In accordance with the canonical role of DNAJ co-chaperones we found that DNAJC7 was associated with several other HSPs, including HSP70s and HSP90s, which are involved in the modulation of cellular stress responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. Consequently, we found DNAJC7-deficient MNs were highly sensitive to proteotoxic stress induced by small molecule treatments including MG132, which causes a buildup of proteins by blocking the proteasome, and Ganetespib that leads to a similar toxic accumulation of proteins by decoupling HSP90 from its clients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. These molecules undoubtedly trigger several stress pathways, but we focused on HSF1 based on unbiased gene and protein expression data supporting a DNAJC7-associated reduction in the levels of HSF1 associated chaperones both at basal conditions, as well as after stress induction. The HSR is a highly conserved proteostasis response and forms a cyclical regulatory network with several HSPs including DNAJC7 and its interacting partners such as HSP70 and HSP90<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. HSF1 is a master transcription factor that elicits the HSR cascade by binding to heat shock elements (HSEs) on the promoter regions of heat shock responsive genes and activates their expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. HSP70 and HSP90 are two such HSR genes, and upon sufficient protein expression act to suppress the activity of HSF1, forming a closed loop of autoregulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. We provide experimental evidence supporting a key regulatory role for DNAJC7 in the timely activation of HSF1, likely through its co-chaperone activity on HSP70 and HSP90.</p>
<p>The canonical transactivation of the HSF1 pathway follows a cyclical HSP70-titration model and is thought to be driven by the dynamic coupling/uncoupling of the inhibitory HSP70/HSF1 complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. This on/off chaperone switch is finely tuned<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, and any disruptions in its cycling render the acute HSF1 stress response largely inadequate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. We found that iPSC-MNs show high expression levels of established HSF1 target genes such as HSPB1 and CRYZ, which were downregulated in mutant DNAJC7 MNs. These findings were also supported by our analysis of gene expression in CNS tissues that showed healthy control cortical neurons and spinal MNs distinctly favoring high HSF1 signaling. These data suggest that the pathway might already be active in MNs. We have similarly previously shown that iPSC-MNs as well as human spinal cord tissue neurons exhibit high basal levels of ER-stress as measured by XBP1-splicing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. It may be that post mitotic cells such as MNs constitutively utilize these stress pathways in order to cope with accumulated proteostasis insults over their especially long lifespan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. In this context, a DNAJC7-dependent disruption in HSF1 signaling would sensitize MNs to age-associated stress. At the same time, mouse MNs have previously been shown to maintain a high threshold of induction of the HSF1-mediated stress response relative to other cell types including glial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>, with the suggestion that this contributes to their vulnerability to stress signals such as insoluble proteins. How exactly DNAJC7 depletion disrupts HSF1 activation remain to be determined but given its strong interaction with HSP70 and HSP90 it likely disrupts the HSF1 transactivation complex.</p>
<p>Our work highlights the HSF1 pathway as a therapeutic target in ALS patients with DNAJC7 mutations, and perhaps beyond<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>, as RNA-Seq analysis revealed a reduction in the expression of HSF1 pathway genes in sporadic and C9orf72 patient neurons. There have been several notable associations between ALS pathophysiology and dysfunction in elements directly downstream of HSF1 activation in response to stress, including accumulation of misfolded and aggregated proteins such as mutant FUS, SOD1 and OPTN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, perturbed HSP-mediated autophagic clearance of TDP-43<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, and reduced expression of HSP40 and HSP70 in sporadic ALS spinal cord tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Notably, HSF1 has been shown to prolong the survival of a mutant SOD1- ALS mouse model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>, while <italic>Chen et al</italic>., found evidence of a compromised HSF1 response pathway in transgenic TDP-43 mouse models and ALS patients, and showed that a constitutively active form of HSF1 reduced the level of insoluble TDP-43 in mammalian cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Similarly, studies have shown that both FUS and C9ORF72 mutations trigger the HSF1 stress response pathway as an early means of neuronal protection, further illustrating the pervasive relevance of the timely activation of HSF1 in ALS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. The therapeutic potential of HSF1 is further bolstered by the finding that Riluzole, an FDA-approved drug that has a moderate but reproducible effect on extending ALS patient survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>, is thought to at least in part, elicit its benefit by increasing latent HSF1 levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. At the same time, a phase 3 clinical trial in ALS patients using Arimoclomol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>, which is a related HSP70 inducer that had shown promise in preclinical mouse models, was terminated as it did not lead to measurable efficacy outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>. HSF1 stimulation may be a challenging target with a narrow therapeutic index as most available molecules, agonize the pathway by causing mild stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. A better understanding of the mechanisms by which HSF1 stimulation is protective in human MNs might allow for the design of more specific and safer molecules. Lastly, our findings underscore the importance of conducting a comprehensive characterization of this pathway and its specific gene targets in human MNs, which likely require a high basal level of HSF1 signaling for their homeostasis.</p>

<title>Limitations of the study</title>
<p>While iPSC-models offer some unique advantages related to the ability of study human neurons, they are also limited on account of the fact that they represent <italic>in vitro</italic> models, without the context of an intact nervous system of a model organism. Additionally, our work is focused exclusively on the impact of DNAJC7 loss-of-function effects on spinal-like MNs, which are the cells that are primarily affected in ALS disease pathogenesis, but any potential non-cell autonomous effects remain unexplored. Lastly, while we show that HSF1 overexpression substantially ameliorates proteotoxic neurodegeneration of mutant DNAJC7 MNs, we did not define the mechanistic effects of HSF1 activation. It remains to be determined whether other genes that act downstream of HSF1 such the Bcl2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>, a pro-survival co-chaperone to HSP70, would act in a similar way to protect mutant DNAJC7 MNs.</p>

<p>Differentiation of lower motor neurons (MNs) from iPSCs were performed as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>. Briefly, ∼70% confluent iPSCs were dissociated using Accutate to achieve single-cell suspension and replated with mTeSR1 medium supplemented with 10µM ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632, DNSK International) at a density of 1.2 million cells/well of a 6 well plate. The next day, the mTeSR1 was removed and replaced with N2B27 differentiation medium (base of 50% Neurobasal and 50% DMEM:F12, supplemented with nonessential amino acids, GlutaMAX, N2, and B27; Gibco), further supplemented with small molecules: 10 μM SB431542 (DNSK International), 100 nM LDN-193189 (Tocris), 1 μM retinoic acid (RA; Sigma), and 1 μM Smoothened Agonist (SAG; DNSK International). This medium was maintained and changed daily until day 6 in culture, and subsequently replaced with N2B27 differentiation medium supplemented with 1 μM RA, 1 μM SAG, 5 μM DAPT (Tocris), and 4 μM SU5402 (DNSK International) to generate postmitotic spinal MNs. These cultures were then fed on a daily basis until day 14 in culture, and next were dissociated using TrpLE Express (Gibco) supplemented with DNase I (Worthington). MNs were then plated directly on Matrigel (BD Biosciences) coated cell culture plates and growth in NBM (base of neurobasal medium supplemented with nonessential amino acids, GlutaMAX, N2, B27, ascorbic acid (0.2 μg/ml, Sigma), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) (10 ng/ml, R&amp;D Systems). For experiments requiring imaging or survival analysis, MNs were plated initially onto pre-coated Matrigel surfaces and allowed to attach for 24 hours, and the following day primary mouse glia cells (harvested from P0 mixed male and female pups of the CD1 strain as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>) were plated on top of MNs.</p>

<title>Coimmunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry or WB</title>
<p>MNs lysates were collected in IP buffer (10mM Hepes [pH 7.6], 100mM NaCl, 1mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1x protease inhibitor cocktail, and 1x phosphatase inhibitor cocktail. Insoluble material from cell extracts was then cleared by centrifugation, and protein concentrations were determined with a BCA kit (Pierce). Endogenous DNAJC7 was immunoprecipitated from 1mg of protein with anti-DNAJC7 antibody (Abcam, ab179830). IP of the antigen was conducted using Dynabeads Protein A magnetic beads (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s protocol. <italic>For preparation of mass spectrometry (MS)</italic>: eluted IP’d material was purified for compatibility to MS detection by briefly being run through precast polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) to embed the material, followed by cutting out entire gel stack and subject to further processing for MS-based proteomics. <italic>For preparation of western bot</italic>: eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and subsequent transfer to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). Membranes were then blocked in tris-buffered saline (TBS) + 0.1% Tween 20 (Bio-Rad) + 5% nonfat dry milk (LabScientific) and subject to overnight incubation at 4°C primary antibodies: DNAJC7 (1:1000, Abcam), HSP90 (1:500, Santa Cruz), MATR3 (1:10,000, Abcam), HSPA1A (1:1000, Novus), HNRNPU (1:500, Santa Cruz), and HNRNPK (1:000, Cell Signaling). All primary antibodies were diluted in TBS + 0.1% Tween + 5% nonfat dry milk. After multiple washes with TBS + 0.1% Tween, membranes were incubated with their corresponding secondary anti-mouse and anti- rabbit HRP-conjugated antibodies (1:5000, LI-COR Biotechnology).

<title>MN survival tracking</title>
<p>For MN survival experiments, lentiviral <italic>SYN1-GFP</italic> (PZ196, Addgene) was added to MNs in suspension prior to seeding onto ImageLock 96 well plates (Sartorius) precoated with Matrigel. MNs were then plated in NBM supplemented with neurotrophic growth factors BDNF, CNTF, GDNF, and AA with SYN1-GFP virus for 24 hours before undergoing a full medium change to remove virus. In the case of lentiviral rescue experiments, LV- ORF/HSF1/BAG3 were co-transduced with SYN1-GFP at this time. Following the 24-hour incubation period, viral medium are removed and replaced with fresh medium and primary mouse glial cells. MN medium is then replenished every 2 days. After 7 days (21 days in culture), MNs are then treated individually with one of several variety of pharmacological agents including DMSO control (Sigma), MG132 (Calbiochem), Ganetespib (Mendillo Lab via Selleckchem), Brefeldin (Mendillo Lab via InvivoGen), Direct Targeted HSF1 InhiBitor (DTHIB, Mendillo Lab via Medchem) supplemented with cell death indicator propidium iodide (1:5000, Sigma). MN survival was then tracked with live imaging using IncuCyte S3 system (Sartorius) for green (GFP) and red (PI) signal emitted from cells. Image analysis was performed using Fiji software (U. S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA), where cells were marked as dead when PI displays focal accumulation in the nucleus.</p>

<title>Lentivirus production</title>
<p>To produce viruses (SYN1-GFP, LV-HSF1 [VectorBuilder], LV-ORF [VectorBuilder], LV-BAG3 [VectorBuilder]), HEK-293 cells were co-transfected with individual target lentivirus plasmids combined with packaging plasmids pMD2.G and psPAX2 vectors with HilyMax (Dojino Molecular Technologies). Virus was then collected from the cell medium 72 hours after transfection, filtered through a 0.22 μm PVDF syringe filter, and concentrated by centrifugation at 25,000g for 2 hours at 4°C. Concentrated virus was then resuspended in neurobasal medium (Gibco), aliquoted in appropriate volumes, and stored at -80°C.</p>

<title>Co-immunoprecipiation mass spectrometry</title>
<p><italic>Mass spectrometry sample preparation:</italic> Proteins were submitted as gel bands. Bands were destained by successive washes in acetonitrile and 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Disulfide bonds were reduced by incubating in 20 mM dithiothreitol (30 minutes at room temperature). Resulting free thiols were capped by incubating in 50 mM iodoacetamide (30 minutes at room temperature protected from light). Bands were then washed in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate prior to addition of 2 µg of trypsin enzyme (Promega) followed by overnight incubation at 37 °C. The following day, the digestion was halted by acidification with 20 % formic acid and the peptide solution was dried in a vacuum centrifuge. The samples were re-suspended in 30 µl of 0.1 % formic acid, sonicated for 5 minutes to fully dissolve, then benchtop centrifuged. The supernatant was transferred to a glass vial and placed in the cooled auto-sampler rack.</p>
<p><italic>LC-MS/MS analysis</italic>: Peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS using a Dionex UltiMate 3000 Rapid Separation LC system coupled to a linear ion trap—Orbitrap hybrid Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA). Four-microliter peptide samples were loaded onto the trap column, which was 150 μm × 3 cm in- house packed with 3 μm ReproSil-Pur beads (New Objective, Woburn, MA). The analytical column was a 75 μm × 10.5 cm PicoChip column packed with 3-μm ReproSil-Pur beads. Solvent A was 0.1 % aqueous formic acid and solvent B was 0.1 % formic acid in acetonitrile. Peptides were separated on a 120-minute analytical gradient from 5 % to 40 % solvent B at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. The mass spectrometer settings included positive data- dependent acquisition (DDA) mode, a 2.40 kV source voltage, and 275 °C capillary temperature. MS1 scans were acquired from 400 to 2000 m/z at 60,000 resolving power and 1E6 automatic gain control in the orbitrap. The top fifteen most abundant precursor ions in each MS1 scan were selected for fragmentation with an isolation width of 1 Da. Collision-induced dissociation (CID) at 35 % normalized collision energy in the ion trap was applied for fragmentation. Previously selected ions were dynamically excluded from re-selection for 60 seconds. A value of 3E5 was set for the MS2 automatic gain control.</p>
<p><italic>Mass spectrometry data analysis:</italic> Raw files were converted to mgf format and analyzed using the Mascot search engine (Matrix Science, London, UK. version 2.7). MS/MS spectra were searched against the SwissProt human database (2021 version). All searches included carbamidomethyl cysteine as a fixed modification and oxidized methionine, deamidated asparagine and glutamine, and acetylated N-terminal as variable modifications. Three missed tryptic cleavages were allowed. Mass tolerances of 10 ppm (MS1 precursor) and 0.6 Da (MS2) were applied. Results were imported into Scaffold 5 software (Proteome Software, Portland, USA) for visualization.</p>

Briefly, 200 µg of whole cell extracts were methanol-chloroform precipitated. Extracted protein was resuspended in 6M guanidine in 100 mM TEAB and further reduced of disulfide bonds with DTT, followed by alkylation of cysteine residues with IAA. Proteins were then digested overnight at 37°C with 3 μg Trypsin/LysC (Promega). The digest was then acidified with formic acid and desalted (C18 HyperSep columns). Peptides were resuspended in 100mM TEAB and100μg for used for each respective isobaric TMT tag. After a 75 min incubation at RT, the reaction was quenched with 5% (v/v) hydroxylamine to 0.3%. Isobarically labeled samples were then combined 1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1 and subsequently desalted. The sample was then fractionated using high pH reversed-Phase columns (Pierce) and dried before reconstituted in LC-MS Buffer A (5% acetonitrile, 0.125% formic acid) for LC-MS/MS analysis.</p>

Fully and half- tryptic peptide candidates were included in search space, all that fell within the mass tolerance window with no miscleavage constraint, assembled and filtered with DTASelect2 (ver. 2.1.3). Static modifications at 57.02146 C and 304.2071 K at N-term were included. Minimum peptide number was 2. The target-decoy strategy was used to verify peptide probabilities and false discovery ratios <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup>. Minimum peptide length of six was set for the process of each protein identification and each dataset included a 1% FDR rate at the protein level based on the target- decoy strategy and Isobaric labeling analysis was established with Census 2 with no intensity threshold applied.</p>

All numbers (<italic>n</italic>), significance values (<italic>P</italic> or <italic>Q</italic> value), and statistical test performed are specified either in the Results section or in each specific corresponding figure legend. To ensure that pooling of data in each experiment was appropriate, we first tested whether datasets variances were significantly different using Brown-Forsythe analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. Following this, we next used the D’Agostino-Pearson test to test whether sample data fit a Gaussian distribution. For experiments that included at least n = 3, we performed one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc for parametric test, and Kruskal-Wallis rank test with Dunn’s correction for multiple comparisons for nonparametric test).

These <bold>important</bold> findings advance our understanding of DNAJC7 in motor neurons while providing clues to how its loss may be causal for ALS; nonetheless, the experiments were performed with a single iPSC line, while at least 3 are deemed to be required to validate the results.

<p>Summary</p>
<p>Fleming et al. present the first, proteomics-based attempt to identify the possible mechanism of action of ALS-linked DNAJC7 molecular chaperone in pathology. Impressively, it is the first report of DNAJC7 interactome studies, using a suitable iPSC-derived lower motor neuron model. Using a co-immunoprecipitation approach the authors identified that the interactome of DNAJC7 is predominantly composed of proteins engaged in response to stress, but also that this interactome is enriched in RNA-binding proteins. The authors also created a DNAJC7 haploinsufficiency cellular model and show the resulting increased insolubility of HNRNPU protein which causes disruptions in its functionality as shown by analysis of its transcriptional targets. Finally, this study uses pharmacological agents to test the effect of decreased DNAJC7 expression on cell response to proteotoxic stress and finds evidence that DNAJC7 regulates the activation of Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) protein upon stress conditions.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>(1)This study uses the best so far model to study the interactome and possible mechanism of action of DNAJC7 molecular chaperone in an iPSC-derived cellular model of motor neurons. Furthermore, the authors also looked into available transcriptome databases of ALS patient samples to further test whether their findings may yield relevance to pathology.</p>
<p>(2) The extent to which the authors are explicit about the sample sizes, protocols, and statistical tests used throughout this manuscript, should be applauded. This will help the whole field in their efforts to reliably replicate the results in this study.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>(1) The most significant caveat of interactome experiments inherently comes from the method of choice. It is possible that by using the co-purification approach of DNAJC7 IP the resulting pool of binding partners is depleted in proteins that interact with DNAJC7 weakly or transiently. An alternative approach presumably more sensitive towards weaker binders could use the TurboID-based proximity-labeling method.</p>
<p>(2) The authors mention in Results (and Figure 2D) that HNRNPA1 was identified as DNAJC7-interacting protein in their co-IP experiments, however, an identifier for this protein cannot be found in Figure 1C and Table S1 listing the proteomics results. Could the authors appropriately update Figure 1C and Table S1, or if HNRNPA1 wasn't really a hit then remove it from listed HNRNPs?</p>
<p>(3) No further validation of DNAJC7-interacting proteins from the heat-shock protein (HSP) family. Current validation of mass spectrometry-identified proteins comes from IP-western blots with antibodies against HSPs. It would be interesting to further inspect possible interactions of these proteins by inspecting co-localization with immunocytochemistry.</p>
<p>(4) Similarly, the observation of DNAJC7 haploinsufficiency causing an increase in HNRNPU insolubility could be also easily further confirmed by checking for the emergence of &quot;puncta&quot; under a fluorescence microscope, in addition to provided WB experiments from MN lysates.</p>
<p>(5) I would like to recommend the authors to also provide with this manuscript a complete dataset (possibly in the form of a table, presented similarly as Table S1) resulting from experiments presented in Figures 2F and S2D. The information on upregulated and downregulated targets in their DNAJC7 haploinsufficiency model would be a valuable resource for the field and enable further investigations.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript titled &quot;The ALS-associated co-chaperone DNAJC7 mediates neuroprotection against proteotoxic stress by modulating HSF1 activity&quot; describes experiments carried out in iPS cells re-differentiated into motor neurons (iNeuons, MNs) seeking to assess the functions of the J protein DnaJC7 in proteostasis. This study also investigates how an ALS-associated mutant variant (R156X) alters DnaJC7 function.</p>
<p>The proteomic studies identify proteins interacting with DnaJC7. Using mRNA profiling in haplo-insufficient cells (+/R156X) compared to wild-type cells, the study seeks to identify pathways modulated by partial loss of DnaJC7 function. Studies in the DnaJC7 haplo-insufficient cells also indicate changes in the properties of ALS-associated proteins, such as HNRNPU and Matrin3 both of which are involved in the regulation of gene expression. The study also shows data indicating that DnaJC7 haploinsufficiency sensitizes cells to proteostatic stress induced by proteosome inhibition by MG132 and Hsp90 inhibition by Ganetespib. Lastly, the study investigates how DnaJC7 modulates the activity of the heat shock transcription factor (Hsf1) and thus the heat shock response.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is well presented and most of the data is of high quality and convincing. The figures and supplementary figures are clear and easy to follow.</p>
<p>This study overall provides important new insights into a mostly underexplored molecular co-chaperone and its role in proteostasis. The proteomic and transcriptomic experiments certainly advance our understanding of DnaJC7. The MN model is well-suited for these studies addressing the role of DnaJC7, particularly regarding ALS. The haplo-insufficient MNs are also a suitable model to study a potential loss of function mechanism caused by (some) fALS-associated mutants in ALS, such as the R156X mutation used here.</p>
<p>Since so little is known about DnaJC7 function, the exploratory approaches applied here are particularly useful.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Without follow-up studies, however, e.g., with select interacting proteins, the study provides merely a descriptive list of possible interactions without mechanistic insights. Also, most interactions have not been extensively (only a few examples) validated by other methods or individual experiments.</p>
<p>A major limitation of the study in its current form is that none of the experimental approaches allow for assessing the specific functions of JC7. In the absence of specificity controls, e.g., other J proteins or HOP, which, like DnaJC7, contains TPR domains and can interact with Hsp70 and Hsp90, it remains unclear if the proposed functions of DnaJC7 are specific/unique or shared by other J proteins or molecular chaperones. Accordingly, it would be highly informative to add experiments to assess if some of the reported DnaJC7 protein-protein interactions and the transcriptional alterations in haplo-insufficient cells are DnaJC7specific or also occur with other J proteins or molecular chaperones. This seems particularly important to discern specific DnaJC7 functions from general effects caused by impaired proteostasis.</p>
<p>It would be informative to explore how cellular stress (e.g., MG132 treatment) alters DnaJC7 interactions with other proteins (J proteins, HOP), ideally in additional/comparative proteomic studies.</p>
<p>
The mechanism underlying the proposed regulation of Hsf1 by DnaJC7 is not quite clear to me (Figures 4 A-I). There is no evidence of a direct physical interaction between DnJC7 and Hsf1 in the proteomic data or elsewhere. It seems plausible that Hsf1/HSR dysregulation in the haplo-insufficient cells might be due to rather indirect effects, e.g., increased protein misfolding. Also, additional data showing differential activation of Hsf1 in +/+ versus +/- cells would strengthen this part, e.g. showing differences in Hsf1 trimerization, Hsp70 interactions, nuclear localization, etc.</p>
<p>The manuscript might also benefit from considering the literature showing an unusually inactive HSR and Hsf1 activity in motor neurons (e.g. published by the Durham lab).</p>
<p>The correlation with transcriptomic data from ALS patients compared to neurotypical controls (Figures 4 L, M) suggesting a direct role of Hsf1/HSR seems unlikely at this point. In my view, the transcriptional dysregulation in ALS patients could be unrelated to Hsf1 dysregulation and caused by rather non-specific effects of neuronal decay in ALS.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Fleming et al sought to better understand DNAJC7's function in motor neurons as mutations in this gene have been associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The research question is relevant and important. The authors use an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line to derive motor neurons (iMNs) finding that DNAJC7 interacts with RNA-binding proteins (RBP) in wild-type cells and a truncated mutant DNAJC7[R156*] disrupts the RBP, hnRNPU, by promoting its accumulation into insoluble fractions. Given that DNAJC7 is predicted to regulate stress responses, the authors then find that DNAJC7[R156*] expression sensitizes the iMNs to proteosomal stress by disrupting the expression of the key heat stress response regulator, HSF1. These findings support that loss-of-function mutations in DNAJC7 will indeed sensitize motor neurons to proteotoxic stress, potentially driving ALS. The association with RBPs, which routinely are found to be disrupted in ALS, is of interest and warrants further study.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The research question is relevant and important. The authors provide interesting data that DNAJC7 mutations impact two important features in ALS, the dysregulation of RNA binding proteins and the sensitivity of motor neurons to proteotoxic stress.</p>
<p>(2) The authors provide solid data to support their findings and the assays are appropriate.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors rely on a single iPSC line throughout the text, using the same line to make the mutation-carrying cells. iPSCs are highly variable and at minimum 3 lines, typically 5 lines, should be used to define consistent findings. This work would be greatly strengthened if 3 or more lines were used to confirm consistent effects. This is particularly concerning given that iPSCs were differentiated using growth factors versus genetic induction. Growth-factor-based differentiations are more variable.</p>
<p>(2) The authors argue that HSF1 and its targets are downregulated in sporadic ALS and mutant C9orf72 ALS. The first concern is that these transcriptomics data were derived from cortical tissue which does not contain motor neurons (Pineda et al. 2024 Cell 187: 1971-1989.e1916). The second concern is that the inclusion of C9orf72 mutant tissue is not well justified as (1) this mutation is associated with an upregulation of HSF1 and its targets in patients (Mordes et al, Acta Neuropathol Commun 2018 6(1):55; Lee et al Neuron 2023 111(9):1381-1390) and (2) the C9orf72 mutation is associated with a ALS/FTD spectrum disorder defined by TDP-43 pathology. Disease mechanisms associated with this spectrum disorder may not overlap with traditional ALS which is typically defined by SOD1 pathology.</p>
<p>(3) As a whole, the findings are mechanistically disjointed, and additional experiments or discussion would help to connect the dots a bit more.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>Fleming et al. present the first, proteomics-based attempt to identify the possible mechanism of action of ALS-linked DNAJC7 molecular chaperone in pathology. Impressively, it is the first report of DNAJC7 interactome studies, using a suitable iPSC-derived lower motor neuron model. Using a co-immunoprecipitation approach the authors identified that the interactome of DNAJC7 is predominantly composed of proteins engaged in response to stress, but also that this interactome is enriched in RNA-binding proteins. The authors also created a DNAJC7 haploinsufficiency cellular model and show the resulting increased insolubility of HNRNPU protein which causes disruptions in its functionality as shown by analysis of its transcriptional targets. Finally, this study uses pharmacological agents to test the effect of decreased DNAJC7 expression on cell response to proteotoxic stress and finds evidence that DNAJC7 regulates the activation of Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) protein upon stress conditions.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>(1) This study uses the best so far model to study the interactome and possible mechanism of action of DNAJC7 molecular chaperone in an iPSC-derived cellular model of motor neurons. Furthermore, the authors also looked into available transcriptome databases of ALS patient samples to further test whether their findings may yield relevance to pathology.</p>
<p>(2) The extent to which the authors are explicit about the sample sizes, protocols, and statistical tests used throughout this manuscript, should be applauded. This will help the whole field in their efforts to reliably replicate the results in this study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting the strengths of our study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>(1) The most significant caveat of interactome experiments inherently comes from the method of choice. It is possible that by using the co-purification approach of DNAJC7 IP the resulting pool of binding partners is depleted in proteins that interact with DNAJC7 weakly or transiently. An alternative approach presumably more sensitive towards weaker binders could use the TurboID-based proximity-labeling method.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer raises a valid point that TurboID-based proximity biotinylation could be a more sensitive approach for identifying DNAJC7 protein-protein interactions compared to IP-MS. We agree that this strategy could be better suited to detect weak or transient interactions, and we have previously used it to characterize protein nanoenvironments and interactomes <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (Wang et al. Mol Psychiatry 2024, Quan et al. mBio 2024). However, proximity biotinylation also has significant limitations, such as potential artifacts due to overexpression and high background levels. We selected the IP-MS approach to identify DNAJC7 binding partners in neurons without the need of genetically modifying or over-expressing DNAJC7.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors mention in Results (and Figure 2D) that HNRNPA1 was identified as DNAJC7-interacting protein in their co-IP experiments, however, an identifier for this protein cannot be found in Figure 1C and Table S1 listing the proteomics results. Could the authors appropriately update Figure 1C and Table S1, or if HNRNPA1 wasn't really a hit then remove it from listed HNRNPs?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the confusion. HNRNPA1 was pulled down exclusively with DNAJC7 in 2/3 independent experiments and was initially included in our list of targets. However, in our final and most stringent analysis we only considered proteins that appeared in 3/3 experiments and thus HNRNPA1 was filtered out of Figure 1C and Table S1. We will therefore remove it from Figure 2D in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) No further validation of DNAJC7-interacting proteins from the heat-shock protein (HSP) family. Current validation of mass spectrometry-identified proteins comes from IP-western blots with antibodies against HSPs. It would be interesting to further inspect possible interactions of these proteins by inspecting co-localization with immunocytochemistry.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As the reviewer points out we did in fact validate the interaction of DNAJC7 with HSP90 and HSP70 (HSP90AB1 and HSPA1A) by IP-WB as shown in Fig 1F. We agree that examining co-localization of these proteins by immunocytochemistry (ICC) would be important to investigate. However, we have been unable to do this due to technical limitations. Specifically, we have tried to perform ICC using 6 commercially available DNAJC7 antibodies and have so far been unsuccessful. In our hands the DNAJC7 ICC signal appears to be non-specific as it is not reduced when using DNAJC7 knockout and knockdown cells as controls.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Similarly, the observation of DNAJC7 haploinsufficiency causing an increase in HNRNPU insolubility could be also easily further confirmed by checking for the emergence of &quot;puncta&quot; under a fluorescence microscope, in addition to provided WB experiments from MN lysates.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a good suggestion, and we can assess the emergence of HNRNPU &quot;puncta&quot; by ICC in DNAJC7 mutant iPSC-derived neurons and/or postmortem sporadic ALS patient tissue.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) I would like to recommend the authors to also provide with this manuscript a complete dataset (possibly in the form of a table, presented similarly as Table S1) resulting from experiments presented in Figures 2F and S2D. The information on upregulated and downregulated targets in their DNAJC7 haploinsufficiency model would be a valuable resource for the field and enable further investigations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a good suggestion and in the revised version we will provide in Table S2 the dataset presented in Figs. 2F and S2D.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript titled &quot;The ALS-associated co-chaperone DNAJC7 mediates neuroprotection against proteotoxic stress by modulating HSF1 activity&quot; describes experiments carried out in iPS cells re-differentiated into motor neurons (iNeuons, MNs) seeking to assess the functions of the J protein DnaJC7 in proteostasis. This study also investigates how an ALS-associated mutant variant (R156X) alters DnaJC7 function. The proteomic studies identify proteins interacting with DnaJC7. Using mRNA profiling in haplo-insufficient cells (+/R156X) compared to wild-type cells, the study seeks to identify pathways modulated by partial loss of DnaJC7 function. Studies in the DnaJC7 haplo-insufficient cells also indicate changes in the properties of ALS-associated proteins, such as HNRNPU and Matrin3 both of which are involved in the regulation of gene expression. The study also shows data indicating that DnaJC7 haploinsufficiency sensitizes cells to proteostatic stress induced by proteosome inhibition by MG132 and Hsp90 inhibition by Ganetespib. Lastly, the study investigates how DnaJC7 modulates the activity of the heat shock transcription factor (Hsf1) and thus the heat shock response.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>
(1) The manuscript is well presented and most of the data is of high quality and convincing. The figures and supplementary figures are clear and easy to follow.</p>
<p>(2) This study overall provides important new insights into a mostly underexplored molecular co-chaperone and its role in proteostasis. The proteomic and transcriptomic experiments certainly advance our understanding of DnaJC7. The MN model is well-suited for these studies addressing the role of DnaJC7, particularly regarding ALS. The haplo-insufficient MNs are also a suitable model to study a potential loss of function mechanism caused by (some) fALS-associated mutants in ALS, such as the R156X mutation used here.</p>
<p>(3) Since so little is known about DnaJC7 function, the exploratory approaches applied here are particularly useful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting the strengths of our study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>(1) Without follow-up studies, however, e.g., with select interacting proteins, the study provides merely a descriptive list of possible interactions without mechanistic insights. Also, most interactions have not been extensively (only a few examples) validated by other methods or individual experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewers concern and agree that there are several intriguing DNAJC7 interactors worth studying further, that is why we wanted to share this resource with the broader community as quickly as possible. As the first study focused on DNAJC7 and its link to ALS we could not possibly investigate multiple potential interactors and focused on two: HNRNPU and HSP70/HSP90, associated with RNA metabolism and stress response respectively, as these are two pathways have previously been implicated in ALS pathogenesis. We do provide validation of these interactions and some mechanistic insight into how DNAJC7 haploinsufficiency impairs their function.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>A major limitation of the study in its current form is that none of the experimental approaches allow for assessing the specific functions of JC7. In the absence of specificity controls, e.g., other J proteins or HOP, which, like DnaJC7, contains TPR domains and can interact with Hsp70 and Hsp90, it remains unclear if the proposed functions of DnaJC7 are specific/unique or shared by other J proteins or molecular chaperones. Accordingly, it would be highly informative to add experiments to assess if some of the reported DnaJC7 protein-protein interactions and the transcriptional alterations in haplo-insufficient cells are DnaJC7specific or also occur with other J proteins or molecular chaperones. This seems particularly important to discern specific DnaJC7 functions from general effects caused by impaired proteostasis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that is a very interesting question, as for example mutations in <italic>DNAJC6</italic> can cause rare forms of Parkinson’s Disease1. However, addressing the functional overlap of DNAJC7 with other J proteins such as DNAJC6 would require substantial time and resources and is out of scope of the current manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It would be informative to explore how cellular stress (e.g., MG132 treatment) alters DnaJC7 interactions with other proteins (J proteins, HOP), ideally in additional/comparative proteomic studies. The mechanism underlying the proposed regulation of Hsf1 by DnaJC7 is not quite clear to me (Figures 4 A-I). There is no evidence of a direct physical interaction between DnJC7 and Hsf1 in the proteomic data or elsewhere. It seems plausible that Hsf1/HSR dysregulation in the haplo-insufficient cells might be due to rather indirect effects, e.g., increased protein misfolding. Also, additional data showing differential activation of Hsf1 in +/+ versus +/- cells would strengthen this part, e.g. showing differences in Hsf1 trimerization, Hsp70 interactions, nuclear localization, etc.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer makes two good points here. Firstly, we do agree we should provide additional data to better understand the differential activation of HSF1 in DNACJ7 heterozygous neurons and we will focus on this question during the revision. We also agree that the mechanism underlying the regulation of HSF1 by DNAJC7 is not well defined and we acknowledge it could be indirect. Of note, HSF1 activation is regulated by HSP70, of which DNAJC7 is a co-chaperone. We will attempt to define this mechanism better during the revision.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The manuscript might also benefit from considering the literature showing an unusually inactive HSR and Hsf1 activity in motor neurons (e.g. published by the Durham lab).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes—we did in fact note this in our discussion: “At the same time, mouse MNs have previously been shown to maintain a high threshold of induction of the HSF1-mediated stress response relative to other cell types including glial cells, with the suggestion that this contributes to their vulnerability to stress signals such as insoluble proteins.” We will further consider how our findings are in line with those of Durham et al., in the revised discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The correlation with transcriptomic data from ALS patients compared to neurotypical controls (Figures 4 L, M) suggesting a direct role of Hsf1/HSR seems unlikely at this point. In my view, the transcriptional dysregulation in ALS patients could be unrelated to Hsf1 dysregulation and caused by rather non-specific effects of neuronal decay in ALS.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a very reasonable concern.  We acknowledge that the HSF1 effects in patients could be driven by multiple other factors including C9-DPRs etc. However, the point of this analysis is not to claim that DNAJC7 is the cause; but rather to highlight the importance of the HSF1 pathway, which we identified as being mis-regulated in DNAJC7 mutant neurons, as broadly relevant in sporadic and other forms of genetic ALS.</p>

<p>We will substantiate the major findings by the use of additional models and genetic backgrounds during the revision. However, our experiments utilize isogenic controls and extensive quality control assays (on-target, off target analysis, whole genome sequencing, karyotype etc.) to ensure that our isogenic lines are genomically identical --other than the <italic>DNAJC7</italic> mutation-- and thus any phenotypes are likely caused by mutant DNAJC7 itself.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors argue that HSF1 and its targets are downregulated in sporadic ALS and mutant C9orf72 ALS. The first concern is that these transcriptomics data were derived from cortical tissue which does not contain motor neurons (Pineda et al. 2024 Cell 187: 1971-1989.e1916).

</disp-quote>
<p>SOD1 pathology represents only a small fraction (&lt;2%) of all ALS patients and is therefore not traditional ALS. The majority (&lt;97%) of sporadic and familial ALS cases (including C9orf72 but excluding SOD1 and FUS cases) are uniformly characterized by TDP-43 pathology. Nevertheless, we do agree that it would be better to assess spinal cord data but unfortunately such single cell datasets form ALS patients do not currently exist. We acknowledge that the HSF1 effects in patients could be driven by multiple other factors including C9-DPRs etc. However, the point of this analysis is not to claim that DNAJC7 is the cause; but rather to highlight the importance of the HSF1 pathway, which we identified as being mis-regulated in DNAJC7 mutant neuron, as being broadly relevant in sporadic and other forms of genetic ALS.</p>
