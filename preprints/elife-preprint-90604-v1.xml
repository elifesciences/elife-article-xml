<title>Abstract</title><p>The function of the smooth muscle cells lining the walls of systemic arteries and arterioles is to regulate the diameter of the vessels to control blood flow and blood pressure. Here, we describe an <italic>in silico</italic> model, which we call the “Hernandez-Hernandez model”, of electrical and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in arterial myocytes based on new experimental data indicating sex-specific differences in male and female arterial myocytes from resistance arteries. The model suggests the fundamental ionic mechanisms underlying membrane potential and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling during the development of myogenic tone in arterial blood vessels. Although experimental data suggest that K<sub>V</sub>1.5 channel currents have similar amplitudes, kinetics, and voltage dependencies in male and female myocytes, simulations suggest that K<sub>V</sub>1.5 current is the dominant current regulating membrane potential in male myocytes. In female cells, which have larger K<sub>V</sub>2.1 channel expression and longer time constants for activation than male myocytes, predictions from simulated female myocytes suggest that K<sub>V</sub>2.1 plays a primary role in the control of membrane potential. Over the physiological range of membrane potentials, the gating of a small number of voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels and L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels are predicted to drive sex-specific differences in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and excitability. We also show that in an idealized computational model of a vessel, female arterial smooth muscle exhibits heightened sensitivity to commonly used Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blockers compared to male. In summary, we present a new model framework to investigate the potential sex-specific impact of anti-hypertensive drugs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Our primary objective was to develop and implement a novel computational model that comprehensively describes the essential mechanisms underlying electrical activity and Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in arterial myocytes. We aimed to uncover the key components that were necessary and sufficient to fully understand the behavior of arterial vascular smooth muscle myocytes and the cellular response to variations in pressure. The model represents the first-ever integration of sex-specific variations in voltage-gated K<sub>V</sub>2.1 and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels, enabling the prediction of sex-specific disparities in membrane potential and the regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in smooth muscle cells from systemic arteries. To further investigate sex-specific responses to antihypertensive medications, we extended our investigation to include a one-dimensional (1D) representation of tissue. This approach enabled us to simulate and forecast the effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blockers within the controlled environment of an idealized mesenteric vessel. It is worth noting that this computational framework can be expanded to predict the consequences of antihypertensive drugs and other perturbations, transitioning seamlessly from single-cell to tissue-level simulations.</p>
<p>Previous mathematical models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> of vascular smooth muscle myocytes generated to describe the membrane potential and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells have described the activation of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) by endogenous or pharmacological vasoactive agents activating inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) and ryanodine (RyR) receptors resulting in the initiation of calcium waves. Earlier models have provided insights into the contraction activation by agonists and the behavior of vasomotion. In a major step forward, the Karlin model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> incorporated new cell structure data and electrophysiology experimental data in a computational model that predicted the essential behavior of membrane potential and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling arising from intracellular domains found in arterial myocytes. One notable limitation of earlier models is that they are based entirely on data from male animals. Furthermore, many data used to parameterize the Karlin model were obtained from smooth muscle from cerebral arteries. While cerebral arteries are important for brain blood flow, they do not control systemic blood pressure. Furthermore, they do not take into consideration the role of K<sub>V</sub>2.1 channels in the regulation of smooth muscle cell membrane potential.</p>
<p>The function of the smooth muscle cells that wrap around small arteries is to regulate the diameter of these vessels. Arterial myocytes contract in response to increases in the intravascular pressure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Based on work largely done using cerebral arterial smooth muscle, a model has been proposed in which this myogenic response is initiated when membrane stretch activates Na<sup>+</sup>-permeable canonical TRPC6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> and melastatin-type TRPM4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. A recent study in smooth muscle from mesenteric arteries identified two additional TRP channels to the chain of events that link increases in intravascular pressure to arterial myocyte depolarization: TRPP1 (PKD1) and TRPP2(PKD2) channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Together, these studies point to an elaborate multiprotein complex that plays a critical role in sensing pressure and initiating the myogenic response by inducing membrane depolarization and activating voltage-gated, dihydropyridine-sensitive L-type Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry via a single or small cluster of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels produces a local increase in intracellular free Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) called a “Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 sparklet”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Activation of multiple Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 sparklets produces a global increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> that activates myosin light chain kinase, which initiates actin-myosin cross-bridge cycling and thus contraction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Negative feedback regulation of membrane depolarization and Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparklet activation occurs through the activation of large-conductance, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> (BK<sub>Ca</sub>) channels as well as voltage-dependent K<sub>V</sub>2.1 and K<sub>V</sub>1.5/1.2 K<sup>+</sup> channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. BK<sub>Ca</sub> channels are organized into clusters along the sarcolemma of arterial myocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> and are activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks resulting from the simultaneous opening of ryanodine receptors type 2 (RyR2) located in a specialized junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Because the input resistance of arterial myocytes is high<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>(about 2-10 GΩ), even relatively small currents (10-30 pA) produced by the activation of a small cluster<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> of 6-12 BK<sub>Ca</sub> channels by a Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark can transiently hyperpolarize the membrane potential of these cells by 10-30 mV. Accordingly, decreases in BK<sub>Ca</sub>, K<sub>V</sub>1.2, K<sub>V</sub>1.5, and/or K<sub>V</sub>2.1 channels depolarize arterial myocytes, increasing Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel activity, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, and contraction of arterial smooth muscle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>A recent study by O’Dwyer <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> suggested that K<sub>V</sub>2.1 channels have dual conducting and structural roles in mesenteric artery smooth muscle with opposing functional consequences. Conductive K<sub>V</sub>2.1 channels oppose vasoconstriction by inducing membrane hyperpolarization. Paradoxically, by promoting the structural clustering of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel, K<sub>V</sub>2.1 enhances Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and induces vasoconstriction. Interestingly, K<sub>V</sub>2.1 protein is expressed to a larger extent in female than in male arterial smooth muscle. This induced larger Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 clusters and activity in female than in male arterial myocytes.</p>
<p>Here, we describe a new model, which we call the “Hernandez-Hernandez model”, of mesenteric smooth muscle myocytes that incorporates new electrophysiological and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling data suggesting key sex-specific differences in male and female arterial myocytes. The model simulates membrane currents and their impact on membrane potential as well as local and global [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> signaling in male and female myocytes. The Hernandez-Hernandez model predicts that K<sub>V</sub>2.1 channels play a critical, unexpectedly large role in the control of membrane potential in female myocytes compared to male myocytes. Importantly, our model predicts that clinically used antihypertensive Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel blockers cause larger reductions in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 currents in female than in male arterial myocytes.</p>
<p>Finally, we present a one-dimensional (1D) vessel representation of electrotonically coupled arterial myocytes connected in series. Predictions from the idealized vessel suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blockers are more potent in females resulting in a more substantial [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> reduction in female arterial smooth muscle compared to male. The Hernandez-Hernandez model demonstrates the importance of sex-specific differences in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 and K<sub>V</sub>2.1 channels and suggests the fundamental electrophysiological and Ca<sup>2+</sup>linked mechanisms of the myogenic tone. The model also points to testable hypotheses underlying differential sex-based pathogenesis of hypertension and distinct responses to antihypertensive agents.</p>

<title>Section 1. Experimental</title>
<sec id="s2a1">
<label>1.1</label><title>Animals</title>
<p>We used 8-to 12-week-old male and female C57BL/6J (The Jackson Laboratory, Sacramento, CA) in this study. Animals were euthanized with a single lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital (250 mg/kg) intraperitoneally. All experiments were conducted as approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</p>

<sec id="s2a2">
<label>1.2</label><title>Isolation of arterial myocytes from systemic resistance arterioles</title>
<p>Third and fourth-order mesenteric arteries were carefully cleaned of surrounding adipose and connective tissues, dissected, and held in ice-cold dissecting solution (Mg<sup>2+</sup>-PSS; 5 mM KCl, 140 mM NaCl, 2mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM glucose, and 10 mM HEPES adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH). Arteries were first placed in dissecting solution supplemented with 1.23 mg/ml papain (Worthington Biochemical, Lakewood, NJ) and 1 mg/ml DTT for 14 minutes at 37°C. This was followed by a second 5-minute incubation in dissecting solution supplemented with 1.6 mg/ml collagenase H (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 0.5 mg/ml elastase (Worthington Biochemical, Lakewood, NJ), and 1 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor from <italic>Glycine max</italic> (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at 37°C. Arteries were rinsed three times with dissection solution and single cells were obtained by gentle trituration with a wide-bore glass pipette. Myocytes were maintained at 4°C in dissecting solution until used.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2a3">
<label>1.3</label><title>Patch-clamp electrophysiology</title>
<p>All electrophysiological recordings were acquired at room temperature (22–25°C) with an Axopatch 200B amplifier and Digidata 1440 digitizer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Borosilicate patch pipettes were pulled and polished to resistances of 3-6 MΩ for all experiments using a micropipette puller (model P-97, Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA). Voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents (I<sub>Ca</sub>) were measured using conventional whole-cell voltage-clamp sampled at a frequency of 50 kHz and low-pass filtered at 2 kHz. Arterial myocytes were continuously perfused with 115 mM NaCl,10 mM TEA-Cl, 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5.5 mM glucose, 5 mM CsCl, 20 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 mM HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with CsOH. Micropipettes were filled with an internal solution containing 20 mM CsCl, 87 mM Aspartic acid, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM MgATP, and 10 mM EGTA adjusted to pH 7.2 using CsOH. Current-voltage relationships were obtained by exposing cells to a series of 300 ms depolarizing pulses from a holding potential of -70 mV to test potentials ranging from -70 to +60 mV. A voltage error of 9.4 mV due to the liquid junction potential of the recording solutions was corrected offline. Voltage dependence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activation (G/G<sub>max</sub>) was obtained from the resultant currents by converting them to conductance via the equation G = I<sub>Ca</sub>/(test potential – reversal potential of I<sub>Ca</sub>); normalized G/G<sub>max</sub> was plotted as a function of test potential. Time constants of activation and inactivation of I<sub>Ca</sub> were fitted with a single exponential function.</p>
<p>I<sub>Kv</sub> recordings were performed in the whole-cell configuration with myocytes exposed to an external solution containing 130 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM Glucose, and 10 mM HEPES adjusted to 7.4 using NaOH. The internal pipette solution constituted of 87 mM K-Aspartate, 20 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM MgATP, 10 mM EGTA, and 10 mM HEPES adjusted to 7.2 by KOH. A resultant liquid junction potential of 12.7 mV from these solutions was corrected offline. To obtain current-voltage relationships cells were subjected to a series of 500 ms test pulses increasing from -70 to +70 mV. To isolate the different K<sup>+</sup> channels attributed to composite I<sub>K</sub>, cells were first bathed in external I<sub>K</sub> solution, subsequently exposed to 100 nM Iberiotoxin (Alomone, Jerusalem, Israel) to eliminate any BK<sub>Ca</sub> channel activity and finally immersed in an external solution containing both 100 nM Iberiotoxin and 100 nM Stromatoxin (Alomone, Jerusalem, Israel) to block both BK<sub>Ca</sub> and K<sub>V</sub>2.1 activity. Ionic current was converted to conductance via the equation G = I(V-E<sub>K</sub>). E<sub>K</sub> was calculated to be -78 mV. Activation time constants for K<sub>V</sub>2.1 currents were obtained by fitting the rising phase of these currents with a single exponential function.</p>
<p>BK<sub>ca</sub>-mediated spontaneous transient outward currents (STOCs) and membrane potential were recorded using the perforated whole-cell configuration. To measure both, myocytes were continuously exposed to a bath solution consisting of 130 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM glucose, and 10 mM HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. Pipettes were filled with an internal solution containing 110 mM K-aspartate, 30 mM KCl, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM EGTA, and 10 mM HEPES adjusted to a pH of 7.3 with KOH. The internal solution was supplemented with 250 µg/ml amphotericin B (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). STOCs were measured in the voltage-clamp mode and were analyzed with the threshold detection algorithm in Clampfit 10 (Axon Instruments, Inc). Membrane potential was measured using the current clamp mode.</p>
<p>STOCs were recorded using the perforated whole-cell configuration. The composition of the external bath solution consisted of 134 mM NaCl, 6 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>,2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>,10 mM glucose, and 10 mM HEPES adjusted to a pH of 7.4 using NaOH. Pipettes were filled with an internal solution of 110 mM K-aspartate, 10 mM NaCL, 30 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 160 μg/ml amphotericin B, and 10 mM HEPES using NaOH to adjust to pH to 7.2. Myocytes were sustained at a holding potential of -70 mV before being exposed to a 400 ms ramp protocol from -140 to +60 mV. A voltage error of 12.8 mV resulting from the liquid junction potential was corrected for offline. K<sub>ir</sub> channels were blocked using 100 µM Ba<sup>2+</sup>.</p>

<p>The mean capacitance of the cells was experimentally calculated to be 16±3 pF based on all the male and female WT mesenteric C57BL/6J cells utilized in the experiments (N=45). Assuming the cells are roughly cylindrical in shape, the expected radius should be 2.485 𝜇𝑚 and a length of 100 𝜇𝑚 leading to a surface area of 1.6×10<sup>-5</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> and a total volume of approximately 1.94×10<sup>-12</sup> liters. The cell capacitance of excitable membranes is assumed to be 1.0×10<sup>-6</sup> F/cm<sup>2</sup>, with the calculated surface area the estimated total cell capacitance is C<sub>m</sub> = 16 pF.</p>
<p>Because the total cell volume is roughly 2×10<sup>-12</sup> liters, it is assumed that 50% of the total cell volume is occupied by organelles. There are three main compartments in vascular myocytes important to the regulation of membrane potential and calcium signaling; the cytosol, sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), and specialized junctional domains formed by the SR and the plasma membrane. The cytosol occupies approximately 50% of total cell volume (V<sub>cyt</sub> = 1.0×10<sup>-</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> L). The sarcoplasmic reticulum occupies approximately 5% of cell cytosolic volume (V<sub>SR</sub> = 5.0×10<sup>-</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> L), and the junctional domain volume is approximately 1% of the cytosol volume (V<sub>Jun</sub> = 0.5×10<sup>-</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> L)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>In this study, we developed a computational model of the electrical activity of an isolated vascular smooth muscle cell (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>). A key goal was to optimize and validate the model with experimental data and then use the model to predict the effects of measured sex-dependent differences in the electrophysiology of smooth muscle myocytes.</p>
<p>In constructing the model, we first set out to measure the kinetics of the voltage-gated L-type Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 currents (I<sub>Ca</sub>) in male and female myocytes using Ca<sup>2+</sup> as the charge carrier as shown in <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref></bold>. These data provide information on the kinetics of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activation and inactivation of I<sub>Ca</sub>. I<sub>Ca</sub> is critical in determining cytosolic concentration [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in vascular mesenteric smooth muscle cells and is the predominant pathway for Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Experiments using whole-cell patch-clamp were undertaken to measure the time constants of activation and deactivation (<bold>panel 2A</bold>) and inactivation (<bold>panel 2B)</bold> in male and female mesenteric artery smooth muscle cells shown as red and black symbols, respectively. While the data from male (n = 10) and female (n = 11) myocytes showed comparable activation time constants, there was an observable trend of faster inactivation in the female cells in the lower voltage range, but the differences were not statistically significant. Steady-state activation and inactivation were also measured as shown in <bold>panel 2C</bold>, with male data in black symbols and female as red symbols. No differences in the gating characteristics of the male and female I<sub>Ca</sub> were measured. Finally, the current-voltage relationship is shown from measurements in female (red) and male (black) in <bold>panel 2D.</bold> Measurements at the peak current indicate that female cells exhibit significantly larger I<sub>Ca</sub> (P&lt;0.05).

<p>We next set out to determine sex differences in voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> currents (I<sub>K</sub>) in male and female mesenteric smooth muscle cells. I<sub>K</sub> is produced by the combined activation of K<sub>V</sub> and BK<sub>Ca</sub> channels. Following the approach previously published by O’Dwyer <italic>et al.,</italic><sup>20</sup>we quantified the contribution of K<sub>V</sub> (I<sub>KV</sub>) and BK<sub>Ca</sub> (I<sub>BKCa</sub>) current to I<sub>K</sub>. K<sup>+</sup> currents were recorded before and after the application of the channel blocker iberiotoxin (IBTX; 100nm). Once identified the contribution I<sub>BKCa</sub> current, we isolated the voltage-gated potassium currents (I<sub>KV</sub>) whose contributors include the voltage-gated potassium channels K<sub>V</sub>1.5 and K<sub>V</sub>2.1. The presumed function of K<sub>V</sub>1.5 and K<sub>V</sub>2.1 channels on membrane potential is to produce delayed rectifier currents to counterbalance the effect of the inward currents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Having isolated I<sub>KV</sub>, K<sub>V</sub>2.1 currents were identified using the application of the K<sub>V</sub>2.1 blocker ScTx1 (100 nM). As a result, the remaining ScTx1-insensitive component of the I<sub>KV</sub> current was attributed to K<sub>V</sub>1.5 channels. The results are shown in <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref></bold>. Experiments using whole-cell patch-clamp were undertaken to measure the steady-state activation G/G<sub>max</sub> of the K<sub>V</sub>2.1current (I<sub>Kv2.1</sub>) as shown in <bold>panel 3A</bold> in female (red) and male (black) myocytes and no significant differences were observed.

<p>To understand the contribution of each K<sup>+</sup> current to the total voltage-gated current (I<sub>KVTOT</sub>) in mesenteric vascular smooth muscle cells we built and optimized a Hodgkin-Huxley model to the data described above. First, we developed a model to describe the K<sub>V</sub>2.1 current. The optimized model to K<sub>V</sub>2.1 experimental data contains only a voltage-dependent activation gating variable (X<sub>2.1act</sub>).

The model was also optimized to the I<sub>Kv1.5</sub> current-voltage (I-V) relationships shown as solid lines in <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref></bold>. From experiments, we optimized the model to reproduce the overall time traces of K<sub>V</sub> currents.

<p>Notably, the main specific sex-specific differences observed in the total voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> current (I<sub>KvTOT</sub>) is attributable to the sex-specific differences in the current produced by K<sub>V</sub>2.1 channels.</p>
<p>We next analyzed the contribution of large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK<sub>Ca</sub>) channels to vascular smooth muscle cell electrophysiology. BK<sub>Ca</sub> channels are activated by membrane depolarization or increased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and are expressed in the membrane of vascular smooth muscle cells with α and β1 subunits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. In smooth muscle cells, Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks are the physiological activators of BK<sub>Ca</sub> channels. We relied on the assumption by Tong <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> that BK<sub>Ca</sub> currents (I<sub>BKCa</sub>) are produced by two current subtypes, one consisting of α subunits (I<sub>BKα</sub>) and the other consisting of α and β1 subunits (I<sub>BKαβ1</sub>). Experimental evidence indicates that BK<sub>Ca</sub> channels with αβ1 subunits form clusters in the plasma membrane in specialized junctional domains formed by the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the sarcolemma. BK<sub>Ca</sub> channels with αβ1 subunits colocalize with ryanodine receptors (RyRs) to in the junctional domains. During a Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> elevations ranging from 10 to 100 μM activate BK<sub>Ca</sub> channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. In our model, Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks are the physiological activators of BK<sub>Ca</sub> channels.</p>

<p>In vascular smooth muscle cells, the membrane potential over the physiological range of intravascular pressures is less negative than the equilibrium potential of potassium (E<sub>K</sub> = -84 mV), suggesting active participation of inward currents regulated by sodium conductance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>.

<p>We next set out to connect the ionic models and models of Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling to make predictions in the whole cell. In <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref></bold>, experimental data indicate that the electrical activity of isolated mesenteric smooth muscle cells in male and female myocytes recorded in current-clamp mode, is characterized by an oscillating membrane potential under physiological conditions. The membrane potential is marked by repetitive spontaneous transient hyperpolarization (TH), a ubiquitous feature of vascular smooth muscle cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup> as shown in <bold>panel 5A.</bold> Both male (black trace) and female (red trace) myocytes exhibited membrane hyperpolarizing transients in the potential range of -50 to -20 mV.

<p>We assessed the predictive capacity of our <italic>in silico</italic> model by comparing it to experimental data. We first compared the morphology of the membrane potential in experiments <bold>panel 5A</bold> versus simulations <bold>panel 5B</bold> in male and female myocytes. Over the physiological range in which smooth muscle cells operate (−50 to -20 mV), ionic currents are small and produced by the activation of a small number of ion channels. Local fluctuations in the function of ion channels lead to noisy macroscopic signals that are important to the variability of vascular smooth muscle cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. In addition, smooth muscle cells are subject to high input resistance where small perturbations can lead to large changes in the membrane potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. To approximate the physiological realities, we applied two sources of noise to our deterministic <italic>in silico</italic> model to simulate the stochastic fluctuations. The first source of the noise was introduced by adding a fluctuating current term to the differential equations describing changes in membrane potential (dV/dt) which represents the combined effect of the stochastic activity of ion channels in the plasma membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Second, we introduced noise into the [Ca]<sub>SR</sub> to replicate the physiological responses consistent with those observed in experimental studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Simulated whole-cell membrane potential with physiological noise is shown in <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref></bold> in male (black trace) and female (red trace) myocytes.</p>
<p>We conducted a sensitivity analysis to determine which model parameters could underlie the sex-specific differences observed in the experimental data. It is important to note that we have experimental data indicating the amplitude and kinetics for a variety of currents in male and female myocytes. For this reason, those model components were fit to the data, fixed, and were not subject to sensitivity analysis. Our analysis, which focused solely on variations in maximal conductance and maximal ion transport rates of the transmembrane currents, indicated that the non-selective cation currents (I<sub>NSC</sub>) and delayed rectifier currents (I<sub>KvTOT</sub> = I<sub>Kv2.1</sub> + I<sub>Kv1.5</sub>) interact to regulate the baseline membrane potential in both male and female vascular smooth muscle myocytes (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref></bold>). Given that I<sub>KvTOT</sub> responds to depolarization, the primary stimulus that triggers depolarization was determined to be attributable solely to the non-selective cation currents (I<sub>NSC</sub>). Indeed, when we adjusted the conductance of the non-selective cation currents and implemented an increase in the conductance of I<sub>NSC</sub> in the female model, we readily reproduced the sex-specific baseline membrane potential observed experimentally (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Next, using the whole-cell vascular smooth muscle myocyte computational model, we investigated the sex-specific differences in the contribution to total voltage-gated current (I<sub>KVTOT</sub>) in mesenteric vascular smooth muscle cells. An interesting prediction from the <italic>in silico</italic> simulations is that at different depolarizing states (−45, -40, and -35 mV) induced by changing the conductance of nonselective cationic leak currents (I<sub>NSC</sub>), the contribution of I<sub>Kv2.1</sub> and I<sub>Kv1.5</sub> to I<sub>KvTOT</sub> is different based on sex. In male vascular myocytes, the contribution to total voltage-gated current (I<sub>KVTOT</sub>) is largely attributable to the current produced by K<sub>V</sub>1.5 channels as shown in the lower panel in <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref></bold>. Our results are consistent with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup> in animal rodent male models showing the characteristic behavior of I<sub>Kv1.5</sub> to control membrane potential. However, the model predicts that in female myocytes, the contribution to total voltage-gated current (I<sub>KVTOT</sub>) is largely provided by the current produced by K<sub>V</sub>2.1 channels as shown in the upper panel in <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref></bold>. To illustrate this point quantitatively, at a membrane potential of -40 mV, the contribution of I<sub>KVTOT</sub> from I<sub>Kv1.5</sub> and I<sub>Kv2.1</sub>is 86% and 14%, respectively, in male myocytes compared to female myocytes in which the contribution from I<sub>Kv1.5</sub> and I<sub>Kv2.1</sub> is 23% and 77%, respectively. Regardless of the depolarization state at -45, -40, or -35 mV, the profiles for male and female myocytes remain essentially the same as shown in <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6C</xref>, 6D, and 6E</bold>. The <italic>in silico</italic> simulations suggest a distinctive sex-based function of K<sub>V</sub>1.5 and K<sub>V</sub>2.1 channels that produce the delayed rectifier currents to counterbalance the effect of inward currents causing graded membrane potential depolarizations.</p>

<p>Having explored the regulation of graded membrane potential by the activation of I<sub>KVTOT</sub> to counterbalance the nonselective cations currents (I<sub>NSC</sub>), we next explored the effects of steady membrane depolarization in the <italic>in silico</italic> vascular smooth muscle cell myocyte model on I<sub>Ca</sub> in male and female myocytes. We predicted I<sub>Ca</sub> in our male and female simulations at steady-state membrane depolarization after simulation for 500 seconds. We observed that as the membrane depolarizes from -55 to -35 mV, I<sub>Ca</sub> in male myocytes increased from 0 to 1.0 pA while in female myocytes I<sub>Ca</sub> increased from 0 to 1.5 pA as shown in <bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref></bold>, suggesting that I<sub>Ca</sub> is larger in female compared to those of male myocytes. We recorded the predicted [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and observed that I<sub>Ca</sub> led to a higher calcium influx in female compared to male simulations as shown in <bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref></bold>. To illustrate in detail, we show in <bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C-D</xref></bold>, time traces of <italic>in silico</italic> predictions of membrane voltage at -40 mV (<italic>top panel</italic>), I<sub>Ca</sub> (<italic>middle panel</italic>), and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (<italic>lower panel</italic>) corresponding to the male and female data points indicated by black and red arrows respectively shown in <bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A-B</xref></bold>. In the male case (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref></bold>), at a steady membrane potential of -40 mV, L-type calcium Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels produced a current of 0.5 pA. However, in female simulations (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref></bold>), we observed that at a steady membrane potential of -40 mV, L-type calcium Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels produced a current of 0.65 pA. We calculated that at -40 mV, two Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels are needed sustained 0.5 pA of current in male myocytes while three Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels are needed sustained 0.65 pA of current in female myocytes.</p>

<p>Although the sex-specific differences in male and female simulations at -40 mV are small, a 15 nM difference in the overall response of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> can have a profound effect on the constriction state of the myocytes. The predictions from the Hernandez-Hernandez model provide a comprehensive picture of physiological conditions and support the idea that a small number of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels supply the steady Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx needed to support a maintained constricted state in small arteries and arterioles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. The differences between males and females are notable in the context of observations indicating varied sex-based responses to antihypertensive agents that target the Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling system in vascular smooth muscle cells.</p>
<p>Next, we simulated the effects of calcium channel blocker nifedipine on I<sub>Ca</sub> at a steady membrane potential of -40 mV in male and female simulations. In <bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C-D</xref></bold>, we show the predicted male (blue) and female (green) time course of membrane voltage at -40 mV (<italic>top panel</italic>), I<sub>Ca</sub> (<italic>middle panel</italic>), and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (<italic>lower panel</italic>). First, we observed that in both male and females 0.1 μM nifedipine modifies the frequency of oscillation in the membrane potential, by causing a reduction in oscillation frequency. Second, both male and female simulations (middle panels) show that 0.1 μM nifedipine caused a reduction of I<sub>Ca</sub> to levels that are very similar in male and female myocytes following treatment. Consequently, the reduction of I<sub>Ca</sub> causes both male and female simulations to reach a very similar baseline [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> of about 85 nM (lower panels). As a result, simulations provide evidence supporting the idea that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels are the predominant regulators of intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] entry in the physiological range from -40 mV to -20 mV. Importantly, these predictions also suggest that clinically relevant concentrations of nifedipine cause larger overall reductions in Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in female than in male arterial myocytes.</p>
<p>Thus far, we have shown the development and application of models of vascular smooth muscle myocytes incorporating measured sex-specific differences in currents from male and female isolated cells. Given that hypertension is essentially a consequence of the spatial organization and function of smooth muscle cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>, we next expanded our study to include a one-dimensional (1D) tissue representation of electrotonically coupled tissue by connecting arterial myocytes in series.</p>
<p>A well-known phenomenon in excitable systems is that electrotonic coupling between cells results in the minimization of individual cellular differences, thereby producing a smoothing effect across the tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. We simulated 400 female or 400 male vascular smooth muscle myocytes and set the gap junctional resistance to zero. As expected, the uncoupled cells in both male and female cases demonstrated the characteristic behavior of arterial myocytes, exhibiting spontaneous hyperpolarization. Of the 400 cells, we show the simulated representative traces of Cell 1, Cell 50, and Cell 100 for female (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref></bold>) and male (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>Next, we modeled 400 cells but with electrotonic coupling by setting the simulated gap junctional resistance to 71.4 Ωcm<sup>2</sup> <sup>51</sup>. In this case, we observed that the spontaneous hyperpolarizations, previously observed in the uncoupled cells, diminished when cells were coupled. The overall smoothing effect observed in <bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref></bold> is attributed to the electrotonic coupling and consequential influence of neighboring cells. The electrical response is consistent across the spatial domain for both male (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref></bold>; <italic>black trace</italic>) and female (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref></bold>-<italic>red trace</italic>) one-dimensional tissue representations. Notably, the model predicts a more depolarized female membrane potential in the one-dimensional tissue representations consistent with experimental measurements as shown in <bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref></bold>.</p>
<p>Having developed an idealized model of a vessel, we set out to validate the model predictions of variable [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> between males and females by comparing the computed calcium signaling in vascular smooth muscle with experimental recordings O’Dwyer <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Given that membrane potential predominantly governs calcium influx in vascular smooth muscle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, we varied the conductance of the nonselective cation currents (I<sub>NSCC</sub>) in our simulations. The adjustment of I<sub>NSCC</sub> was intended to replicate the effects of pressure-induced membrane depolarization, which consequently activates the voltage-gated L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and increases [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>.</p>
<p>Our simulations (lines) are well validated by experimental recordings (symbols) in <bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref></bold>. A distinctive feature from the model prediction, which was validated by experimental recordings is the observation that female (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref></bold>, red trace and symbols) vessels accommodate more [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> compared to male (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref></bold>, black trace and symbols) vessels.

<p>Finally, in our simulations, we computed the effects of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> after the application of clinically relevant calcium channel blocker nifedipine. We observed a substantial reduction of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in both male (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref></bold>, <italic>dashed black line</italic>) and female (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref></bold>, <italic>dashed red line</italic>). In the summary data (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B</xref></bold>), we quantified the relative change of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in male (<italic>black</italic>) and female (<italic>red</italic>) after the application of 0.1 mM L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blocker nifedipine at 80 mmHg and 120 mmHg. Our results show that nifedipine, when applied to male vessels, decreases [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> by 22% and 25% at 80 mmHg and 120 mmHg, respectively. However, the same dose of nifedipine when applied to female vessels decreases [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> by 38% and 45% at 80 mmHg and 120 mmHg. The results suggest that female arterial smooth muscle is more sensitive to clinically used Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blockers than male smooth muscle.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we describe the development, validation, and application of an <italic>in silico</italic> model to simulate and understand the mechanisms of electrical activity and Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in a single mesenteric vascular smooth muscle cell. The Hernandez-Hernandez model is the first model to incorporate sex-specific differences in voltage-gated K<sub>V</sub>2.1 and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels and predicts sex-specific differences in membrane potential and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling regulation in the smooth muscle of both sexes from systemic arteries. In the pursuit of stratifying sex-specific responses to antihypertensive drugs, we expanded our exploration to encompass a one-dimensional (1D) tissue representation. Such an approach allowed us to simulate and predict the impact of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blockers within a mesenteric vessel. Notably, the computational framework can be expanded to forecast the impact of antihypertensives and other perturbations from single-cell to tissue-level simulations.</p>
<p>To specifically investigate the impact of sex-specific differences measured from ion channel experiments and their impact on membrane potential and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, we focused on the isolated myocyte in the absence of complex signaling pathways. We first explored the effects of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 and K<sub>V</sub>2.1 channels on membrane potential as experimental data suggest key sex-specific differences in channel expression and kinetics. Notably, the peak of the current-voltage (I-V) relationship of L-type Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 current is 40% smaller in male compared to female myocytes (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Similarly, the peak current-voltage (I-V) relationship of the voltage-gated K<sub>V</sub>2.1 current (I<sub>Kv2.1</sub>) is 70% smaller in male compared to female myocytes at +40 mV (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>). O’Dwyer and coauthors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> showed sex-dependent expression of K<sub>V</sub>2.1 in the plasma membrane, where male arterial myocytes have a total of about 75,000 channels compared to 183,000 channels in female myocytes. Notably, less than 0.01% of channels are conducting in male and female myocytes. In the computational model, we found that to reproduce the experimentally measured amplitude of the K<sub>V</sub>2.1 I-V curve (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>), a maximum of ∼44 male K<sub>V</sub>2.1 channels was sufficient to reproduce the peak current (68.8 pA at 40 mV). In contrast, ∼143 channels were predicted to be needed in female myocytes to reproduce the experimentally measured peak current (226.42 pA at +40 mV) of the K<sub>V</sub>2.1 I-V relationship. Modeling and simulation led to the prediction that in male arterial myocytes, I<sub>KvTOT</sub> is largely dictated by K<sub>V</sub>1.5 channels. In contrast, in female arterial myocytes, K<sub>V</sub>2.1 channels dominate I<sub>KvTOT</sub> <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>)</bold>.</p>
<p>An important aspect of the Hernandez-Hernandez model is that it includes Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated signaling between RyRs in the junctional SR and BK<sub>Ca</sub> channel clusters in the nearby sarcolemma membrane. This section of the model is similar to the one included in the Karlin model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> with some modifications. The Karlin model described how subcellular junctional spaces influence membrane potential and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in response to intravascular pressure, vasoconstrictors, and vasodilators. In this study, we reduced the complexity of the model representation of subcellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling spaces to include just three compartments: the cytosol, SR, and the SR-sarcolemma junction. Our model represents on average, the behavior of a single junctional SR unit that is functional in a cell at a time. The model uses a deterministic approach but mimics the process of production of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks that activate BK<sub>Ca</sub> channel clusters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. We represented the activity of the RyRs in the junctional domain deterministically in the model so that Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark-BK<sub>Ca</sub> currents occur at a frequency of about 1 Hz at -40 mV in a space equivalent to 1% of the total cell surface area of the plasma membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Based on experimental observations, the Hernandez-Hernandez computational model employs three key assumptions: First, Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks in the junctional domain are initiated by activation of RyRs, where RyR gating opening probability is correlated with SR load. Second, Ca<sup>2+</sup>sparks lead to a [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Jun</sub> increase between 10-20 mM to match the amplitude measured in experiments (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Third, activation of BK<sub>Ca</sub> channels and the resultant current amplitude derives from the experimentally observed spontaneous outward currents (STOCs) in both amplitude and morphology.</p>
<p>Notably, model simulations revealed important mechanisms that may underlie experimental observations in measurements of membrane potential (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold>). The model predicts that the mechanism of intrinsic oscillatory behavior in the vascular myocytes results from a delicate balance of currents. Activation of non-selective cation currents (I<sub>NSC</sub>) likely causes membrane depolarization, but the delayed rectifier currents (I<sub>KvTOT</sub>) oppose them, resulting in membrane potential baseline in the physiological range of -45 to -20 mV. Interestingly, the voltage-gated L-type Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 currents activation threshold sits within this range at ∼-45 mV. Therefore, small increases in I<sub>NSC</sub> can overwhelm I<sub>KvTOT</sub> below -20 mV and result in sufficient depolarization to bring the membrane potential to the threshold for activation of I<sub>Ca</sub>. It is important to note that I<sub>KvTOT</sub> increases sharply upon depolarization from -45 to -20 mV, resulting in tight control of membrane potential and prevention of large transient depolarization resulting from I<sub>NSC</sub>. Activation of L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels upon depolarization and subsequent Ca<sup>2+</sup> release within the small volume junction then activates the BK<sub>Ca</sub> channels, which results in hyperpolarization. Hyperpolarization reignites the oscillatory cascade as an intrinsic resetting mechanism. Since vascular myocytes are subject to substantial noise from the stochastic opening of ion channels in the plasma membrane, and fluctuations in the local junctional domain components, such as the SR load, RyR opening, and BK<sub>Ca</sub> channel activity, we included noise in the simulation. To simulate the physiological noise in the vascular smooth muscle cell (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref></bold>), we added Gaussian noise to the dV/dt equations and [Ca]<sub>SR</sub>.</p>
<p>Female mesenteric artery myocytes are more depolarized than male myocytes at physiological intravascular pressures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Our model suggests that female myocytes are more depolarized than male myocytes due to larger non-selective cation currents in female compared to male myocytes, most likely due to the activation of Na<sup>+</sup>-permeable TRP channels. To our knowledge, the only TRP channels found to regulate the membrane potential of mesenteric artery smooth muscle are TRPP1 and TRPP2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Future work will have to determine if TRPC6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> and TRPM4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, which have been shown to mediate the myogenic response of cerebral artery smooth muscle, and/or other non-selective cation channels also depolarize mesenteric artery smooth muscle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The Hernandez-Hernandez model predicts that very few channels (based on total current amplitude) are likely to control the baseline fluctuations in membrane potential in the physiological range of -60 to -20 mV. The intrinsic oscillatory properties of the vascular myocyte operating in the low voltage regime under conditions of high resistance membrane are similar to other types of oscillatory electrical cells including cardiac pacemaker cells.</p>
<p>As shown in (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref></bold>), the model predicts that, at -40 mV, the amplitude of steady-state K<sub>V</sub>2.1 currents is about 0.8 pA in male and 3.3 pA in female arterial myocytes, indicating that the contribution of K<sub>V</sub>2.1 and K<sub>V</sub>1.5 channels to membrane potential is different in males and females. At -30 mV, it is 2.34 pA and 9.2 pA in male and female myocytes respectively. Assuming a single channel current at -40 and -30 mV of 0.7 pA, we calculated that, on average, in male myocytes a single channel is open at -40 mV and 3 channels are open at any particular time at -30 mV. In female myocytes, 6 channels are predicted to be open at -40 mV, while 13 are predicted to be active at -30 mV.</p>
<p>The Hernandez-Hernandez model also allowed us to calculate the number of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels needed to sustain the steady-state concentration of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in the physiological range from -60 to -20 mV (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref></bold>). The model predicts that at -40 mV in mouse male myocytes, 2 channels were required to generate 0.5 pA of steady-state Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 current. On the other hand, we found that in female myocytes, 3 channels were sufficient to generate 0.65 pA of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 current. These data are consistent with the work of Rubart et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>, which suggested that steady-state Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents at -40 mV were likely produced by the opening of 2 Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels in rat cerebral artery smooth muscle cells.</p>
<p>The observation that a very small number of the conducting K<sub>V</sub>2.1 and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels are involved in the regulation of membrane potential and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in male and female arterial myocytes at physiological membrane potentials is important for several reasons. <italic>First</italic>, the analysis suggests that small differences in the number of K<sub>V</sub>2.1 and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels can translate into large, functionally important differences in membrane potential and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and hence affect and control myogenic tone under physiological and pathological conditions. <italic>Second</italic>, the small number of K<sub>V</sub>2.1 and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels gating between -40 and -30 mV likely makes smooth muscle cells more susceptible to stochastic fluctuations in the number and open probabilities of these channels than in cells where a large number of channels regulate membrane excitability and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (e.g., adult ventricular myocyte<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>). This, at least in part, likely contributes to Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling heterogeneity in vascular smooth muscle.</p>
<p>Hypertension fundamentally manifests through the spatial organization of cellular components, particularly evident in the context of the tunica media, the middle layer of vessels is predominantly constituted of smooth muscle cells which play a pivotal role in vessel contraction and relaxation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>. Such intricate biological machinery is imperative in orchestrating the regulation of blood flow and blood pressure. Our approach began with a process of distillation, aiming to shed light on cellular mechanisms within isolated vascular myocytes from small systemic vessels and arterioles, which control blood pressure, of both male and female mice.</p>
<p>Earlier research has confirmed that in mesenteric arteries, the pathogenesis leading to hypertension is largely determined by the downregulation of K<sub>V</sub>2.1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> and/or K<sub>V</sub>1.5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup> and a concurrent increase in the activity of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup> channels. Building upon this knowledge, we broadened our study to encompass a one-dimensional (1D) tissue model of electrotonically linked tissue, achieved by connecting arterial myocytes in series. Such an approach allows us to develop a framework aimed at bridging the gap between understanding the combined effects of membrane potential and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in isolated cells and in the wider context of small vessels.</p>
<p>Crucially, this step is essential to deciphering and comprehending the behavior of both cells and vessels. These entities operate at different time scales, yet understanding their interactions is essential for creating a comprehensive model that explains how ion channels contribute to the composite electrical activity. This, in turn, provides a foundation for a more detailed understanding of vascular function and dysfunction.</p>
<p>For instance, previous studies have proposed that gap junctions enable vessels to function in a way that is analogous to a large capacitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>. The gap junctions actively filter and transform single-cell electrical activity into sustained responses across the tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>. Recent studies add to this understanding by demonstrating that Connexin 37 (Cx37), a component of these gap junctions, seems to be expressed in the mesenteric arteries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup>. In our simulations, we showed (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A-B</xref></bold>) that indeed uncoupled cells exhibit a spontaneous oscillatory behavior which studies have confirmed is not an artifact due to isolation from the vessel but rather an intrinsic behavior required to sustain electrical signals. When the cells are connected (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref></bold>) the spontaneous hyperpolarization previously observed in the uncoupled cells diminished, the effect is attributed to the electrotonic coupling and consequential influence of neighboring cells. In addition, in our simulations, we found that it is required to have stochastic fluctuations to allow the system to average the membrane potential behavior that dictates the amount of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in the vessels.</p>
<p>Regarding, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels, simulations forecast the clinically relevant concentrations (0.1 μM) at which common Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blockers (e.g., nifedipine) effectively block Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels in both male and female smooth muscle (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref></bold>). The Hernandez-Hernandez model provides a computational framework and the first step toward the development of a virtual drug-screaming system that can model drug-channel interactions in vascular myocytes.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The model presented here describes the necessary and sufficient ion channels, pumps, and transporters to describe the electrical activity and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling of an isolated mesenteric smooth muscle cell in the absence of complex signaling pathways. Such an approach enabled us to perform a component dissection to analyze the sex-specific differences observed in the electrophysiology of male and female myocytes. However, it is well known that vascular smooth muscle cells are subject to a plethora of stimuli from endothelial cells, neurotransmitters, endocrine, and paracrine signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. The next phase of the project includes an expansion of the model to incorporate receptor mediated signaling pathways that are essential for blood pressure control.</p>
<p>Excitation-contraction coupling refers to an electrical stimulus that drives the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and results in the physical translocation of fibers that underlies muscle contraction. In the present model, we did not explicitly consider the mechanical description of muscle contraction. Nevertheless, we can imply its effects by tracking membrane potential and the elevation of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> as a proxy.</p>
<p>To conclude, we developed and present the Hernandez-Hernandez model of male and female isolated mesenteric vascular myocytes. The model was informed and validated with experimental data from male and female vascular myocytes. We then used the model, to reveal sex-specific mechanisms of K<sub>V</sub>2.1 and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels in controlling membrane potential and Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics. In doing so, we predicted that very few channels are needed to contribute to and sustain the oscillatory behavior of the membrane potential and calcium signaling. We expanded our computational framework to include a one-dimensional (1D) tissue representation, providing a basis for simulating the effect of drugs’ effects within a vessel. The model predictions suggested differences in the response of male and female myocytes to drugs and the underlying mechanisms for those differences. These predictions may constitute the first step towards better hypertensive therapy for males and females.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors developed computational models that capture the electrical and Ca2+ signaling behavior in mesenteric arterial cells from male and female mice. A baseline model was first formulated with eleven transmembrane currents and three calcium compartments. Sex-specific differences in the L-type calcium channel and two voltage-gated potassium channels were then tuned based on experimental measurements. To incorporate the stochastic ion channel openings seen in smooth muscle cells under physiological conditions, noise was added to the membrane potential and the sarcoplasmic Ca2+ concentration equations. Finally, the models were assembled into 1D vessel representations and used to investigate the tissue-level electrical response to an L-type calcium channel blocker.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
A major strength of the paper is that the modeling studies were performed on three different scales: individual ionic currents, whole-cell, and 1D tissue. This comprehensive computational framework can help provide mechanistic insight into arterial myocyte function that might be difficult to achieve through traditional experimental methods.</p>
<p>The authors aimed to develop sex-specific computational models of mesenteric arterial myocytes and demonstrate their use in drug-testing applications. Throughout the paper, model behavior was both validated by experimental recordings and supported by previously published data. The main findings from the models suggested that sex-specific differences in membrane potential and Ca2+ handling are attributable to variability in the gating of a small number of voltage-gated potassium channels and L-type calcium channels. This variability contributes to a higher Ca2+ channel blocker sensitivity in female arterial vessels. Overall, the study successfully met the aims of the paper.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
A main weakness of the paper, as addressed by the authors, is the simplicity of the 1D vessel model; it does not take into account various signaling pathways or interactions with other cell types which could impact smooth muscle electrophysiology. Another potential shortcoming is the use of mouse data for optimizing the model, as there could be discrepancies in signaling behavior that limit the translatability to human myocyte predictions.</p>

<p>In this study, Hernandez-Hernandez et al developed a gender-dependent mathematical model of arterial myocytes based on a previous model and new experimental data. The ionic currents of the model and its sex difference were formulated based on patch-clamp experimental data, and the model properties were compared with single-cell and tissue scale experimental results. This is a study that is of importance for the modeling field as well as for experimental physiology.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This hybrid experimental/computational study by Hernandez-Hernandez sheds new light on sex-specific differences between male and female arterial myocytes from resistance arteries. The authors conduct careful experiments in isolated myocytes from male and female mice to obtain the data needed to parameterize sex-specific models of two important ionic currents (i.e., those mediated by CaV1.2 and KV2.1). Available experimental data suggest that KV1.5 channel currents from male and female myocytes are similar, but simulations conducted in the novel Hernandez-Hernandez sex-specific models provide a more nuanced view. This gives rise to the first of the authors' three key scientific claims: (1) In males, KV1.5 is the dominant current regulating membrane potential; whereas, in females, KV2.1 plays a primary role in voltage regulation. They further show that this (2) the latter distinction drives drive sex-specific differences in intracellular Ca2+ and cellular excitability. Finally, working with one-dimensional models comprising several copies of the male/female myocyte models linked by resistive junctions, they use simulations to (3) predict that the sensitivity of arterial smooth muscle to Ca2+ channel-blocking drugs commonly used to treat hypertension is heightened in female compared to male cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
• The Methodology is described in exquisite detail in straightforward language that will be easy to understand for most if not all peer groups working in computational physiology. The authors have deployed standard protocols (e.g., parameter fitting as described by Kernik et al., sensitivity analysis as described by Sobie et al.) and appropriate brief explanations of these techniques are provided. The manoeuvre used to represent stochastic effects on voltage dynamics is particularly clever and something I have not personally encountered before. Collectively, these strengthen the credibility of the model and greatly enrich the manuscript.</p>
<p>• Broadly speaking, the Results section describes findings that robustly support the three key scientific claims outlined in my summary. While there is certainly room for further discussion of some nuanced points as outlined below, it is evident these experiments were carefully designed and carried out with care and intentionality. In the present version of the manuscript, there are a few figures in which experimental data is shown side-by-side with outputs from the corresponding models. These are an excellent illustration of the power of the authors' novel sex-specific computational simulation platform. I think these figures will benefit from some modest additional quantitative analysis to substantiate the similarities between experimental and computational data, but there is already clear evidence of a good match.</p>
<p>Areas for Improvement:</p>
<p>
• The authors used experimental data from a prior publication to calibrate their model of the BKCa current. As indicated in the manuscript, these data are for channel activity measured in a heterologous expression system (Xenopus oocytes). A similar principle applies to other major ion channels/pumps/etc. Is it possible there might be relevant sex-specific differences in these players as well? In the context of the present work, this feels like an important potential caveat to highlight, in case male/female differences in the activity of BKCa or other currents might influence model-predicted differences (e.g., the relative importance of KV1.5 and KV2.1). This should be discussed, and, if possible, related to the elegant sensitivity analysis presented in Fig. 5C (which shows, for example, that the models are relatively insensitive to variation in GBK).</p>
<p>• The authors state that their model can be expanded to 2D/3D applications, &quot;transitioning seamlessly from single-cell to tissue-level simulations&quot;. I would like to see more discussion of this. For example, given the modest complexity of the cell-scale model, how considerable would the computational burden be to implement a large network model of a subset of the human female or male arterial system? Are there sex-specific differences in vessel and/or network macro-structure that would need to be considered? How would this influence feasibility? Rather than a 1D cable as implemented here, I imagine a multi-scale implementation would involve the representation of myocytes wrapped around vessels. How would the behaviour of such a system differ from the authors' presented work using a 1D representation of 100 myocytes coupled end-to-end? Could these differences partially explain why the traces in Fig. 8D are smoother than those in Fig. 8C? From my standpoint, discussing these points would enrich the paper.</p>
<p>• The nifedipine data presented in Fig. 9 are quite compelling, and a nice demonstration of the potential power of the new models. How does this relate to what is known about the clinical male/female responses to nifedipine? Are there sex differences in drug efficacy?</p>
