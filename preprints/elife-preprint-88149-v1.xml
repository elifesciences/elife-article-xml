<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Apart from ancestry, personal or environmental covariates may contribute to differences in polygenic score (PGS) performance. We analyzed effects of covariate stratification and interaction on body mass index (BMI) PGS (PGS<sub>BMI</sub>) across four cohorts of European (N=491,111) and African (N=21,612) ancestry. Stratifying on binary covariates and quintiles for continuous covariates, 18/62 covariates had significant and replicable R<sup>2</sup> differences among strata. Covariates with the largest differences included age, sex, blood lipids, physical activity, and alcohol consumption, with R<sup>2</sup> being nearly double between best and worst performing quintiles for certain covariates. 28 covariates had significant PGS<sub>BMI</sub>-covariate interaction effects, modifying PGS<sub>BMI</sub> effects by nearly 20% per standard deviation change. We observed overlap with covariates that had significant R<sup>2</sup> differences between strata and interaction effects – across all covariates, their main effects on BMI were correlated with maximum R<sup>2</sup> differences and interaction effects (0.56 and 0.58, respectively), suggesting high-PGS-score individuals have highest R<sup>2</sup> and PGS effect increases. Given significant and replicable evidence for context-specific PGS<sub>BMI</sub> performance and effects, we investigated ways to increase model performance taking into account non-linear effects. Machine learning models (neural networks) increased relative model R<sup>2</sup> (mean 23%) across datasets. Finally, creating PGS<sub>BMI</sub> directly from GxAge GWAS effects increased relative R<sup>2</sup> by 7.8%. These results demonstrate that certain covariates, especially those most associated with BMI, significantly affect both PGS<sub>BMI</sub> performance and effects across diverse cohorts and ancestries, and we provide avenues to improve model performance that consider these effects.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Polygenic scores (PGS) provide individualized genetic predictors of a phenotype by aggregating genetic effects across hundreds or thousands of loci, typically from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). In recent years it has become increasingly apparent that the transferability of PGS performance across different cohorts is poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Most analyses to date have focused on ancestry differences as the main driver of this lack of transferability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). However, a growing body of evidence has demonstrated that PGS performance and effect estimates are influenced by differences in certain environmental (classically termed “gene-environment” effects or interactions) or personal-level covariates – different phenotypes seem to be differently affected by these covariates, with most evidence being for adiposity traits such as body mass index (BMI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>).</p>
<p>There are several gaps in current knowledge about these covariate-specific effects. Many analyses have assessed only a handful of these covariates due to the myriad of choices possible in typical large-scale biobanks. Little investigation has been done to systematically understand why certain covariates affect PGS performance, with such knowledge being useful to reduce the potential search for variables that impart context-specific effects. Furthermore, most studies investigating PGS-covariate interactions have been in European ancestry individuals; unfortunately, comparing differences in PGS performance and prediction while controlling for differences in ancestry versus differences in context has not been assessed in previous studies. Moreover, covariate-specific effects are notorious for having poor replicability in human genetics studies, and previous PGS-covariate interaction studies have been predominantly performed in the UK Biobank (UKBB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), where the majority of individuals are aged 40-69 (i.e., excluding young adults), are overall healthier than those from other e.g., hospital-based cohorts, and are predominantly European ancestry. Additionally, PGS performance is often assessed using linear models and in isolation of clinical covariates, which in practice would often be available. Machine learning models can have increased performance over linear models and are capable of modeling complex relationships and interactions between variables, which may serve to increase predictive performance, especially given evidence for PGS-covariate specific effects. Finally, given evidence for context-specific effects, it should be possible to directly incorporate SNP-covariate interaction effects from a GWAS directly to improve prediction performance, instead of relying on post-hoc interactions from a typical PGS calculated from main GWAS effects.</p>
<p>In this study we aimed to address the previously mentioned concerns. Using genetic data with linked-phenotypic information from electronic health records, we estimated the effects of covariate stratification and interaction on performance and effect estimates of PGS for BMI (PGS<sub>BMI</sub>) – <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> is a flowchart of the project. These analyses were done across four datasets: UK Biobank (UKBB), Penn Medicine BioBank (PMBB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), and Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging (GERA). These datasets include participants from two ancestry groups (N=491,111 European ancestry (EUR), N=21,612 African ancestry (AFR)), and 62 covariates (25 present in multiple datasets) representing laboratory, survey, and biometric data types typically associated with cardiometabolic health and adiposity (including blood lipids, socioeconomic status, blood pressure, diet, physical activity, alcohol intake, smoking, and lung function, among others). We calculated the difference in PGS<sub>BMI</sub> R<sup>2</sup> among individuals stratified by different quintiles of these variables (different groups for binary variables) and assessed whether a variable’s association with BMI could explain its effect on PGS<sub>BMI</sub> performance across groups. We also assessed the significance of PGS<sub>BMI</sub>-covariate interaction terms, and their increases to model R<sup>2</sup> over models only using main effects, as well as correlation of main effect, interaction effect, and R<sup>2</sup> differences. Replication and comparisons across all datasets and ancestries were conducted. We then used machine learning models and evaluated their increase in performance over linear models, even those that included regularization and interaction terms. Finally, we conducted BMI GWAS using GxAge interaction terms, created PGS<sub>BMI</sub> directly using these effects, and assessed performance gains over using typical main effect GWAS. This study addresses a plethora of open issues considering performance and effects of PGS on individuals from diverse backgrounds.</p>

<title>Effect of covariate stratification on PGS<sub>BMI</sub> performance</title>
<p>We assessed 62 covariates for R<sup>2</sup> differences (25 present, or suitable proxies, in multiple datasets) after stratifying on binary covariates and quintiles for continuous covariates. With UKBB EUR as discovery (N=376,729), 18 covariates had significant differences (Bonferroni p&lt;.05/62) in R<sup>2</sup> among groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>), including age, sex, alcohol consumption, different physical activity measurements, Townsend deprivation index, different dietary measurements, lipids, blood pressure, and A1c, with 40 covariates having suggestive (p&lt;.05) evidence of R<sup>2</sup> differences. From an original PGS<sub>BMI</sub> R<sup>2</sup> of .076, R<sup>2</sup> increased to .094, .093, and .088 for those in the bottom physical activity, alcohol intake, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol quintiles, and decreased to .067, .57, and .049 for those in the top quintile (71%, 61%, and 56% relative R<sup>2</sup>), respectively, comparable to differences due to ancestry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). We note that the differences in R<sup>2</sup> due to alcohol intake and HDL were larger than those of any physical activity phenotype, despite physical activity having one of the oldest and most replicable evidence of interaction with genetic effects of BMI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Despite considerable published evidence suggesting covariate-specific genetic effects between BMI and smoking behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>), we were only able to find suggestive evidence for R<sup>2</sup> differences when stratifying individuals across several smoking phenotypes (minimum p=0.016, for smoking pack years). R<sup>2</sup> differences due to educational attainment were also only suggestive (p=0.015), of which published evidence is conflicting (35– 37).</p>

</fig>
<p>We replicated these analyses in three additional large-scale cohorts of European and African ancestry individuals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>, Supplemental Table 3), as well as in African ancestry UKBB individuals. For covariates with significant performance differences in the discovery analysis, we were able to replicate significant (p&lt;.05) R<sup>2</sup> differences for age, HDL cholesterol, alcohol intake frequency, physical activity, and HbA1c, despite much smaller sample sizes. We again observed largely insignificant differences across cohorts and ancestries when stratifying due to different smoking phenotypes and educational attainment. Combining across cohorts, for each covariate and ancestry we regressed R<sup>2</sup> values across groupings on covariate values in a weighted linear regression, weighting by sample size. Slope of a weighted linear regression across cohorts was directionally inconsistent between ancestries for the same covariate (triglyceride levels, HbA1c, diastolic blood pressure, and sex), although larger sample sizes may be needed to confirm these differences.</p>
<p>We noted several observations related to age-specific effects on PGS<sub>BMI</sub>. First, in the weighted linear regression of all R<sup>2</sup> across ancestries, expected R<sup>2</sup> for African ancestry individuals overcomes that of European ancestry individuals among individuals within bottom and top age quintiles observed in these data. For instance, the predicted R<sup>2</sup> of .048 for 80 year-old European ancestry individuals would be lower than that of African ancestry individuals aged 24.7 and lower, indicating that certain differences in covariates can overcome differences in PGS<sub>BMI</sub> performance due to ancestry (with age being one of the most common variables used for assessing and determining health). Second, we obtained these results despite the average age of GWAS individuals being 57.8, which should increase PGS<sub>BMI</sub> R<sup>2</sup> of individuals closest to this age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). This result suggests that in the case of these analyses, PGS performance due to decreased heritability with age cannot be reconciled by having GWAS individuals of similar age being used to create the PGS<sub>BMI</sub>. Finally, we observed that PGS<sub>BMI</sub> R<sup>2</sup> increases as age decreases, consistent with published evidence suggesting that the heritability of BMI decreases with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>PGS-covariate interaction effects</title>
<p>Next, we estimated difference in PGS effects due to interactions with covariates, by modeling interaction terms between PGS<sub>BMI</sub> for each covariate (Methods). We implemented a correction for shared heritability between covariates of interest and outcome (which can inflate test statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>)) to better measure the environmental component of each covariate, and show that this correction successfully reduces significance of interaction estimates (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>). Again, using UKBB EUR as discovery, we observed 28 covariates with significant (Bonferroni p&lt;.05/62) PGS-covariate interactions (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), with 38 having suggestive (p&lt;.05) evidence (Supplemental Table 4). We observed the largest effect of PGS-covariate interaction with alcohol drinking frequency (20.0% decrease in PGS effect per 1 standard deviation (SD) increase, p=2.62×10<sup>−55</sup>), with large effects for different physical activity measures (9.4%-12.5% decrease/SD, minimum p=3.11×10<sup>−66</sup>), HDL cholesterol (15.3% decrease/SD, p=1.71×10<sup>−96</sup>) and total cholesterol (12.7% decrease/SD, p=1.64×10<sup>−71</sup>). We observed significant interactions with diastolic blood pressure (10.8% increase/SD, p=6.06×10<sup>−60</sup>), but interactions with systolic blood pressure were much smaller (1.17% increase/SD, p=4.41×10<sup>−3</sup>). Significant interactions with HbA1c (4.63% increase/SD, p=5.37×10<sup>−14</sup>) and type 2 diabetes (27.2% PGS effect increase in cases, p=1.83×10<sup>−7</sup>) were also observed. Other significant PGS-covariate interactions included lung function, age, sex, and LDL cholesterol – various dietary measurements also had significant interactions, albeit with smaller effects than other significant covariates. We were able to find significant interaction effects for smoking pack years (4.78% increase/SD, p=3.68×10<sup>−7</sup>), but other smoking phenotypes had insignificant interactions after multiple testing correction (minimum p=2.7×10<sup>−3</sup>) – interactions with educational attainment were also insignificant (p= 4.54×10<sup>−2</sup>).</p>

We observed poor replication for LDL cholesterol, HbA1c, and smoking pack years, with insignificant and directionally inconsistent interaction effects across cohorts.

<p>However, despite significance of interaction terms, increases in model R<sup>2</sup> when including PGS-covariate interaction terms were small. For instance, the maximum increase among all covariates in UKBB EUR was only .0024 from a base R<sup>2</sup> of .1049 (2.1% relative increase), for alcohol drink frequency per week. Across all cohorts and ancestries, the maximum increase in R<sup>2</sup> was only .0058 from a base R<sup>2</sup> of 0.09454 (6.1% relative increase), when adding a PGS-age interaction term for eMERGE EUR (p=5.40×10<sup>−46</sup>) – this was also the largest relative increase among models with significant interaction terms. This result suggests that, while interaction effects can significantly modify the effect of PGS<sub>BMI</sub>, their overall impact on model performance is relatively small, despite the observation that stratifying by covariates produces large differences in R<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<title>Correlations between R<sup>2</sup> differences, interaction effects, and main effects</title>
<p>We next investigated the relationship between interaction effects, maximum R<sup>2</sup> differences across quintiles, and main effects of covariates on BMI. We first estimated main effects of each covariate on BMI (Methods, Supplemental Table 5), and then calculated the correlation weighted by sample size between main effects, maximum PGS<sub>BMI</sub> R<sup>2</sup> across quintiles, and PGS-covariate interaction effects (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) across all cohorts and ancestries – GERA data were excluded from these analyses due to slightly different phenotype definition (Supplemental Table 6), as were binary variables. Interaction effects and maximum R<sup>2</sup> differences had a .80 correlation (p=2.1×10<sup>−27</sup>), indicating that variables with the largest interaction effects also had the largest effect on PGS<sub>BMI</sub> performance across quintiles, and that covariates that increase PGS<sub>BMI</sub> effect also have the largest effect on PGS<sub>BMI</sub> performance i.e., individuals most at risk for obesity will have both disproportionately larger PGS<sub>BMI</sub> effect and R<sup>2</sup>. Main effects and maximum R<sup>2</sup> differences had a .56 correlation (p=1.3×10<sup>−11</sup>), while main effects and interaction effects had a .58 correlation (7.6×10<sup>−12</sup>) again suggesting that PGS<sub>BMI</sub> are more predictive in individuals with higher values of BMI-associated covariates, although predictive to a lower degree than estimating the interaction effects themselves directly. However, this result demonstrates that covariates that influence both PGS<sub>BMI</sub> effect and performance can be predicted just using main effects of covariates, which are often known for certain phenotypes and easier to calculate, as genetic data and PGS construction would not be required.</p>

<title>Effects of machine learning approaches on predictive performance</title>
<p>Given evidence of PGS-covariate dependence, we aimed to assess increases in R<sup>2</sup> when using machine learning models (neural networks), which can inherently model interactions and other nonlinearities, over linear models even with interaction terms. We first included age and sex as the only covariates (along with genotype PCs and PGS<sub>BMI</sub>), as age and sex were present in all datasets and had significant and replicable evidence for PGS-dependence across our analyses. Three models were assessed – L1-regularized (i.e., LASSO) linear regression without any interaction terms, LASSO including a PGS-age and PGS-sex interaction term, and neural networks (without interaction terms). When comparing neural networks to LASSO with interaction terms, the relative 10-fold cross-validated R<sup>2</sup> increased up to 67% (mean 23%) across cohorts and ancestries (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, Supplemental Table 7). The inclusion of interaction terms increased cross-validated R<sup>2</sup> up to 12% (mean 3.9%) when comparing LASSO including interaction terms to LASSO with main effects only.</p>

<p>We then modeled all available covariates for each cohort and did similar comparisons. Cross-validated R<sup>2</sup> increased up to 17.6% (mean 9.5%) when using neural networks versus LASSO with interaction terms, and up to 7.0% (mean 2.0%) when comparing LASSO with interaction terms to LASSO with main effects only. Increases in model performance using neural networks were smaller in UKBB, perhaps due to the age range being smaller than other cohorts (all participants aged 39-73). This result suggests that additional variance explained through non-linear effects with age and sex are explained by other variables present in the remainder of the datasets. Our findings suggest that machine learning methods can improve model R<sup>2</sup> that include PGS<sub>BMI</sub> as variables beyond including interaction terms in linear models, even when variable selection is performed using LASSO.</p>

<title>Calculating PGS directly from GxAge GWAS effects</title>
<p>Previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>) have created PGS using GWAS stratified by different personal-level covariates, but for practical purposes this leads to a large loss of power as the full size of the GWAS is not utilized for each strata and continuous variables are forced into bins. We developed a novel strategy where PGS are instead created from a full-size GWAS that includes SNP-covariate interaction terms (Methods). We focused on age interactions, given their large and replicable effects based on our results – similar to a previous study, we conducted these analyses in the European UKBB. We used a 60% random split of study individuals to conduct three sets of PGS using GWAS of the following designs: main effects only, main effects also with a SNP-age interaction term, and main effects but stratified into quartiles by age. 20% of the remaining data were used for training and the final 20% were held-out as a test set. The best performing PGS created from SNP-age interaction terms (PGS<sub>GxAge</sub>) increased test R<sup>2</sup> to 0.0771 from 0.0715 (7.8% relative increase) compared to the best performing main effect PGS (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, Supplemental Table 9) – age-stratified PGS had much lower performance than both other strategies (unsurprising given reasons previously mentioned). Including a PGS<sub>GxAge</sub>-age interaction term only marginally increased R<sup>2</sup> (.0001 increase), with similar increases for the other two sets of PGS, further demonstrating that post-hoc modeling of interactions cannot reconcile performance gained through directly incorporating interaction effects from the original GWAS. The strategy of creating PGS directly from full-sized SNP-covariate interactions is potentially quite useful as it increases PGS performance without the need for additional data – there are almost certainly a variety of points of improvement (Discussion), but we consider their investigation outside the scope of this study.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Across four large-scale cohorts of diverse ancestry, we uncover replicable effects of covariates on both performance and effects of PGS<sub>BMI</sub>. When stratifying by quintiles of different covariates, we find certain covariates that have significant and replicable evidence for differences in PGS<sub>BMI</sub> R<sup>2</sup>, with R<sup>2</sup> being nearly double between top and bottom performing quintiles for covariates with the largest differences. When testing covariates for PGS-covariate interaction effects, we also find covariates with significant interaction effects, where, for the largest effect covariates, each standard deviation change affects PGS<sub>BMI</sub> effect by nearly 20%. Across analyses, we find age and sex had the most replicable interaction effects, with levels of serum cholesterol, physical activity, and alcohol consumption having the largest effects across cohorts. We also observed that interaction effects and R<sup>2</sup> differences were strongly correlated, with main effects also being correlated with interaction effects and R<sup>2</sup> differences, suggesting that covariates with the largest interaction effects also contribute to the largest R<sup>2</sup> differences, with simple main effects also being predictive of expected differences in R<sup>2</sup> and interaction effects. While in this study we stratified by quintile, similar trends of performance differences would be apparent in smaller percentiles. This observation is relevant to current research and clinical use of PGS, as individuals above a percentile cutoff are designated high risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). These analyses imply that individuals most at-risk for obesity should have both disproportionately higher predicted BMI and increased BMI prediction performance compared to the general population – more work is required to understand why, and if similar trends can be observed in other traits relevant to human health. We also employ machine learning methods for prediction of BMI with models that include PGS<sub>BMI</sub> and demonstrate that these methods outperform regularized linear regression models that include interaction effects. Finally, we employ a novel strategy that directly incorporates SNP interaction effects into PGS construction, and demonstrate that this strategy improves PGS performance when modeling SNP-age interactions compared to PGS created only from main effects.</p>
<p>Future work may include replicating these analyses across additional traits, and further exploring machine learning and deep learning methods on other phenotypes to determine if this trend of inclusion of PGS along with covariate interaction effects outperforms linear models for risk prediction. Additionally, the method of including a PGS for the covariate to better measure its environmental effect is potentially worth exploring further, which should improve in the future as PGS performance continues to increase. A slight limitation of this method in our study is that for the UKBB analyses the GWAS used for PGS construction were also from UKBB thus not out-of-sample, although many of the covariates only have GWAS available through UKBB individuals. Furthermore, a variety of improvements are likely possible when creating PGS directly from SNP-covariate interaction terms. First, we used the same SNPs that were selected by pruning and thresholding based on their main effect p-values, but selection of SNPs based on their interaction p-values should also be possible and would likely improve performance. Additionally, performance of pruning and thresholding-based strategies have largely been overtaken by methods that first adjust all SNP effects for LD and don’t require exclusion of SNPs, and a method that could do a similar adjustment for interaction effects would likely outperform most current methods for traits with significant context-specific effects. Finally, incorporation of additional SNP-covariate interactions (e.g., SNP-gender) would also likely further improve prediction performance, although any SNP selection/adjustment procedures may further complicated by additional interaction terms.</p>
<p>We propose several ideas on why BMI-associated covariates have larger interaction effects and impact on R<sup>2</sup> for PGS<sub>BMI</sub>. Age may be a proxy for accumulated gene-environment interactions as younger individuals have less exposure to environmental influences on weight compared to older individuals; therefore, one may expect that in younger individuals their phenotype could be better explained by genetics compared to environment. Secondly, PGS may more readily explain more extreme phenotypes because they incorporate large effect variants associated with very high weight or height (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). For BMI, the distribution is skewed toward the right i.e., effects in trait-increasing variants may have a larger potential to affect trait variation compared to trait-reducing variants. This explanation would likely be better suited to traits with left-tailed distributions and is not fully satisfactory as first log-transforming or rank-normal transforming the phenotype, as was done in this study, may invalidate this explanation.</p>
<p>PGS is a promising technique to stratify individuals for their risk of common, complex disease. In order to achieve accurate predictions as well as promote equity, further research is required regarding PGS methods and assessments. This research provides firm evidence on the context-specific nature of PGS and the incorporation of covariate interaction effects for predicting BMI and, apart from promoting equitable use of PGS across ancestries and cohorts, demonstrates ways to improve PGS performance incorporating context-specific effects.</p>

<title>UKBB</title>
<p>Individual-level quality-control and filtering have been described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>) for European ancestry individuals. Briefly, individuals were split by ancestry according to both genetically inferred ancestry and self-reported ethnicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Individuals with low genotyping quality and sex mismatch were removed, only unrelated individuals (pi-hat &lt; .250) were retained, and variants were filtered at INFO &gt; .30 and minor allele frequency (MAF) &gt; .01. For African ancestry, individuals were first selected based on self-reported ethnicity “Black or Black British”, “Caribbean”, “African”, or “Any other Black background”. Individuals that were low quality i.e., “Outliers for heterozygosity or missing rate”, and that were Caucasian from “Genetic ethnic grouping” were removed. Of these individuals, those that were +/-6 standard deviations from the mean of the first 5 genetic principal components provided by UKBB were excluded. Finally, only unrelated individuals were retained up to the second degree using plink2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>) “-king-cutoff .125”. After QC and consideration of phenotype, a total of 7,046 individuals in the UKBB AFR data who also had BMI available were used for downstream analyses.

<title>Choice of covariates</title>
<p>A total of 62 covariates were included in the analyses, 25 of which were present (or similar proxies) in multiple datasets. These covariates were selected based on relevance to cardiometabolic health and obesity, and previous evidence of context-specific effects with BMI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>).

<sec id="s4c">
<title>PGS construction</title>
<p>PGS for BMI (PGS<sub>BMI</sub>) were constructed using PRS-CSx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>), using GWAS summary statistics for individuals of European (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>), African (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), and East Asian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>) ancestry that were out-of-sample of study participants. A set of 1.29 million HapMap3 SNPs provided by PRS-CSx was used for PGS calculation, which are generally well-imputed and variable frequency across global populations. Default settings for PRS-CSx (downloaded November 22, 2021) were used, which have been demonstrated to perform well for highly polygenic traits such as BMI (list of parameters in Supplemental Table 8). The final PGS<sub>BMI</sub> per ancestry and cohort was calculated by regressing log(BMI) on the PGS<sub>BMI</sub> per ancestry without covariates – the combined, predicted value was used as a single PGS<sub>BMI</sub> in downstream analyses.</p>
<p>For GERA, BMI was not transformed, as it was already binned into a categorical variable with 5 levels (18≤, 19-25, 26-29, 30-39, &gt;40). Additionally, for GERA the uncombined ancestry-specific PGS<sub>BMI</sub> were used in the final models, as it had higher R<sup>2</sup> than using the combined PGS<sub>BMI</sub> (data not shown).</p>

<sec id="s4d">
<title>PGS<sub>BMI</sub> performance after covariate stratification</title>
<p>Analyses were performed separately for each cohort and ancestry. For each covariate, individuals were binned by binary covariates or quintiles for continuous covariates. Incremental PGS<sub>BMI</sub> R<sup>2</sup> was calculated by taking the difference in R<sup>2</sup> between:

We performed 5,000 bootstrap replications to obtain a bootstrapped distribution of R<sup>2</sup>. P-values for differences in R<sup>2</sup> were calculated between groups by calculating the proportion of overlap between two normal distributions of the R<sup>2</sup> value using the standard deviations of the bootstrap distributions. Again for GERA, BMI was not transformed.</p>

<sec id="s4e">
<title>PGS<sub>BMI</sub> interaction modelling</title>
<p>Evidence for interaction with each covariate with the PGS<sub>BMI</sub> was evaluated using linear regression. It has been reported that the inclusion of covariates that share heritability with the outcome can inflate test statistic estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). To assuage these concerns, we introduced a novel correction, where we first calculated a PGS for the covariate (PGS<sub>Covariate</sub>) and included it in the model, as well as an interaction term between PGS<sub>BMI</sub> and PGS<sub>Covariate</sub>. The PGS<sub>Covariate</sub> terms were calculated using the European ancestry Neale Lab summary statistics (URLs) and PRS-CS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). To standardize effect sizes across analyses, PGS<sub>BMI</sub> and Covariate were first converted to mean zero and standard deviation of 1 (binary covariates were not standardized). We demonstrate inclusion of PGS<sub>Covariate</sub> terms successfully reduced significance of the PGS<sub>BMI</sub>*Covariate term (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>). The final model used to evaluate PGS<sub>BMI</sub> and Covariate interactions was:

<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="23289777v1_ueqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
Note that we ran new models with main effects only, instead of using the main effect from the interaction models (as the main effects in the interaction models depend on the interaction terms, and main effects used to create interaction terms are sensitive to centering of variables despite the scale invariance of linear regression itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>)). We then estimated the correlation between main effects, interaction effects, and maximum R<sup>2</sup> differences across all cohorts and ancestries weighting by sample size, analyzing quantitative and binary variables separately.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4g">
<title>Machine learning models</title>
<p>UKBB EUR and GERA EUR models were restricted to 30,000 random individuals, for computational reasons – BMI distributions did not differ from the full-sized datasets (Kolmogorov-Smirnov p-value of 0.29 and 0.57, respectively). PGS<sub>BMI</sub> and top five genetic principal components were included as features in all models. Two sets of models were evaluated for each cohort and ancestry: including age and sex as features, and including all available covariates in each cohort as features. ‘Ever Smoker’ status was used in favor of ‘Never’ vs ‘Current smoking’ status (if present), as individuals with ‘Never’ vs ‘Current’ status are a subset of those with ‘Ever Smoker’ status. UKBB AFR with all covariates was excluded due to small sample size (N=53).</p>
<p>Neural networks were used as the model of choice, given their inherent ability model interactions and other nonlinear dependencies. Prior to modeling, all features were scaled to be between 0 and 1. We used average 10-fold cross validation R<sup>2</sup> to evaluate model performance. Separate models were trained using untransformed and log(BMI). L1-regularized linear regression was used with 18 values of lambda (1.0, 5.0×10<sup>−1</sup>, 2.0×10<sup>−1</sup>, 1.0×10<sup>−1</sup>, 5.0×10<sup>−2</sup>, 2.0×10<sup>−2</sup>, …, 1.0×10<sup>−5</sup>, 5.0×10<sup>−6</sup>, 2.0×10<sup>−6</sup>). Models were trained without inclusion of interaction terms (which neural networks can implicitly model), using 1,000 iterations of random search with the following hyperparameter ranges: size of hidden layers [10, 200], learning rate [.01, .0001], type of learning rate [constant, inverse scaling], power t [.4, .6], momentum [.80, 1.0], batch size [32, 256], and number of hidden layers [1, 2].</p>

<p>Analyses were conducted in the European UKBB (N=376,629), as was done in a study on a similar topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Three sets of analyses were performed, using GWAS conducted in a 60% random split of individuals using the following models (BMI was rank-normal transformed before GWAS):</p>

For 2), GxAge PGS<sub>BMI</sub> were calculated using SNPs clumped by their main effect p-values from 1), and additionally incorporating the GxAge interaction effects per SNP.

<p>This study presents a <bold>valuable</bold> analysis of the effects of covariates, such as age, sex, socio-economic status, or biomarker levels, on the predictive accuracy of polygenic scores for body mass index; it also presents approaches for improving prediction accuracy by accounting for such covariates. While the analyses are <bold>solid</bold>, the study falls short of providing a cogent interpretation of key findings, which could be of great interest and utility. The work will be of interest to people using and developing methods for phenotypic prediction based on polygenic scores.</p>

<p>In this paper, Hui and colleagues investigate how the predictive accuracy of a polygenic score (PGS) for body mass index (BMI) changes when individuals are stratified by 62 different covariates. After showing that the PGS has different predictive power across strata for 18 out of 62 covariates, they turn to understanding why these differences and seeing if predictive performance could be improved. First, they investigated which types of covariates result in the largest differences in PGS predictive power, finding that covariates with larger &quot;main effects&quot; on the trait and covariates with larger interaction effects (interacting with the PGS to affect the trait) tend to better stratify individuals by PGS performance. The authors then see if including interactions between the PGS and covariates improves predictive accuracy, finding that linear models only result in modest increases in performance but nonlinear models result in more substantial performance gains.</p>
<p>Overall, the results are interesting and well-supported. The results will be broadly interesting to people using and developing PGS methods. Below I list some strengths and minor weaknesses.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A major impediment to the clinical use of PGS is the interaction between the PGS and various other routinely measured covariates, and this work provides a very interesting empirical study along these lines. The problem is interesting, and the work presented here is a convincing empirical study of the problem.</p>
<p>The result that PGS accuracy differs across covariates, but in a way that is not well-captured by linear models with interactions is important for PGS method development.</p>
<p>Weakness:</p>
<p>While arguably outside the scope of this paper, one shortcoming is the lack of a conceptual model explaining the results. It is interesting and empirically useful that PGS prediction accuracy differs across many covariates, but some of the results are hard to reconcile simultaneously. For example, it is interesting that triglyceride levels are associated with PGS performance across cohorts, but it seems like the effect on performance is discordant across datasets (Figure 2). Similarly, many of these effects have discordant (linear) interactions across cohorts (Figure 3). Overall it is surprising that the same covariates would be important but for presumably different reasons in different cohorts. Similarly, it would be good to discuss how the present results relate to the conceptual models in Mostafavi et al. (eLife 2020) and Zhu et al. (Cell Genomics 2023).</p>

<p>This work follows in the footsteps of earlier work showing that BMI prediction accuracy can vary dramatically by context, even within a relatively ancestrally homogenous sample. This is an important observation that is worth the extension to different context variables and samples.</p>
<p>Much of the follow-up analyses are commendably trying to take us a step further-towards explaining the underlying observed trends of variable prediction accuracy for BMI. Some of these analyses, however, are somewhat confounded and hard to interpret.</p>
<p>For example, many of the covariates which the authors use to stratify the sample by may drive range restriction effects. Further, the covariates considered could be causally affected by genotype and causally affect BMI, with reverse causality effects; other covariates may be partially causally affected by both genotype and BMI, resulting in collider bias. Finally, population structure differences between quintiles of a covariate may drive variable levels of stratification. These can bias estimation and confounds interpretations, at least one of which intuitively seems like a concern for each of the context variables (e.g., the covariates SES, LDL, diet, age, smoking, and alcohol drinking).</p>
<p>The increased prediction accuracy observed with some of the age-dependent prediction models is notable. Despite the clear utility of this investigation, I am not aware of much existing work that shows such improvements for context-aware prediction models (compared to additive/main effect models). I would be curious to see if the predictive utility extends to held-out data from a data set distinct from the UKB, where the model was trained, or whether it replicates when predicting variation within families. Such analyses could strengthen the evidence for these models capturing direct causal effects, rather than other reasons for the associations existing in the UKB sample.</p>

<p>Polygenic scores (PGS), constructed based on genetic effect sizes estimated in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and used to predict phenotypes in humans have attracted considerable recent interest in human and evolutionary genetics, and in the social sciences. Recent work, however, has shown that PGSs have limited portability across ancestry groups, and that even within an ancestry group, their predictive accuracy varies markedly depending on characteristics such as the socio-economic status, age, and sex of the individuals in the samples used to construct them and to which they are applied. This study takes further steps in investigating and addressing the later problem, focusing on body mass index, a phenotype of substantial biomedical interest. Specifically, it quantifies the effects of a large number of co-variates and of interactions between these covariates and the PGS on prediction accuracy; it also examines the utility of including such covariates and interaction in the construction of predictors using both standard methods and artificial neural networks. This study would be of interest to investigators that develop and apply PGSs.</p>
<p>I should add that I have not worked on PGSs and am not a statistician, and apologize in advance if this has led to some misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- The paper presents a much more comprehensive assessment of the effects of covariates than previous studies. It finds many covariates to have a substantial effect, which further highlights the importance of this problem to the development and application of PGSs for BMI and more generally.</p>
<p>
- The findings re the relationships between the effects of covariates and interactions between covariates and PGSs are, to the best of my knowledge, novel and interesting.</p>
<p>
- The development of predictors that account for multiple covariates and their interaction with the PGS are, to the best of my knowledge, novel and may prove useful in future efforts to produce reliable PGSs.</p>
<p>
- The improvement offered by the predictors that account for PGS and covariates using neural networks highlights the importance of non-linear interactions that are not addressed by standard methods, which is both interesting and likely to be of future utility.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- The paper would benefit substantially from extensive editing. It also uses terminology that is specific to recent literature on PGSs, thus limiting accessibility to a broader readership.</p>
<p>
- The potential meaning of most of the results is not explored. Some examples are provided below:</p>
<p>
• the paper emphasizes that 18/62 covariates examined show significant effects, but this result clearly depends on the covariates included. It would be helpful to provide more detail on how these covariates were chosen. Moreover, many of these covariates are likely to be correlated, making this result more difficult to interpret. Could these questions at least be partially addressed using the predictors constructed using all covariates and their interactions jointly (i.e., with LASSO)? In that regard, it would be helpful to know how many of the covariates and interactions were used in this predictor (I apologize if I missed that).</p>
<p>
• While the relationship between covariate effects and covariate-PGS interaction effects is intriguing, it is difficult to interpret without articulating what one would expect, i.e., what would be an appropriate null.</p>
<p>
• The finding that using artificial neural networks substantially improves prediction over more standard methods is especially intriguing, and highlights the potential importance of non-linear relationships between PGSs and covariates. These relationships remain hidden in a black box, however. Even fairly straightforward analyses, based on using different combinations of the PGS and/or covariates may shed some light on these relationships. For example, analyzing which covariates have a substantial effect on the prediction or varying one covariate at a time for different values of the PGS, etc.</p>
<p>
- The relationship to previous work should be discussed in greater detail.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In this paper, Hui and colleagues investigate how the predictive accuracy of a polygenic score (PGS) for body mass index (BMI) changes when individuals are stratified by 62 different covariates. After showing that the PGS has different predictive power across strata for 18 out of 62 covariates, they turn to understanding why these differences and seeing if predictive performance could be improved. First, they investigated which types of covariates result in the largest differences in PGS predictive power, finding that covariates with larger &quot;main effects&quot; on the trait and covariates with larger interaction effects (interacting with the PGS to affect the trait) tend to better stratify individuals by PGS performance. The authors then see if including interactions between the PGS and covariates improves predictive accuracy, finding that linear models only result in modest increases in performance but nonlinear models result in more substantial performance gains.</p>
<p>Overall, the results are interesting and well-supported. The results will be broadly interesting to people using and developing PGS methods. Below I list some strengths and minor weaknesses.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A major impediment to the clinical use of PGS is the interaction between the PGS and various other routinely measured covariates, and this work provides a very interesting empirical study along these lines. The problem is interesting, and the work presented here is a convincing empirical study of the problem.</p>
<p>The result that PGS accuracy differs across covariates, but in a way that is not well-captured by linear models with interactions is important for PGS method development.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for all of the positive comments.</p>

<p>Weakness:</p>
<p>While arguably outside the scope of this paper, one shortcoming is the lack of a conceptual model explaining the results. It is interesting and empirically useful that PGS prediction accuracy differs across many covariates, but some of the results are hard to reconcile simultaneously. For example, it is interesting that triglyceride levels are associated with PGS performance across cohorts, but it seems like the effect on performance is discordant across datasets (Figure 2). Similarly, many of these effects have discordant (linear) interactions across cohorts (Figure 3). Overall it is surprising that the same covariates would be important but for presumably different reasons in different cohorts. Similarly, it would be good to discuss how the present results relate to the conceptual models in Mostafavi et al. (eLife 2020) and Zhu et al. (Cell Genomics 2023).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the comments. We agree that more generalizable explanations would be useful, which may be worth exploring in future work. Specifically, if there is heteroskedasticity in the relationship between PGS and BMI (e.g., phenotypic variance increases for higher values of BMI while PGS variance does not, or at least by a different amount), then that may partially explain the performance differences when stratifying by covariates that have main effects on BMI – somewhat similarly to what is presented in Figure 2 of Mostafavi et al. Such results may imply that similar performance differences could occur when stratifying by the phenotype itself, although this still may not explain differences in PGS effects, and differences in performance when using nonlinear methods (such as in this work and in Figure 4 of Zhu et al.). While we observe discordant effects for certain covariates across datasets, the findings from the correlation analyses use all cohorts and ancestries, and we expect that these difference in effects across datasets may be due to differences in their relationship with BMI across datasets (triglyceride levels may be especially noisy due to their sensitivity to fasting which may have been controlled for differently across datasets).</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>This work follows in the footsteps of earlier work showing that BMI prediction accuracy can vary dramatically by context, even within a relatively ancestrally homogenous sample. This is an important observation that is worth the extension to different context variables and samples.</p>
<p>Much of the follow-up analyses are commendably trying to take us a step further-towards explaining the underlying observed trends of variable prediction accuracy for BMI. Some of these analyses, however, are somewhat confounded and hard to interpret.</p>
<p>For example, many of the covariates which the authors use to stratify the sample by may drive range restriction effects. Further, the covariates considered could be causally affected by genotype and causally affect BMI, with reverse causality effects; other covariates may be partially causally affected by both genotype and BMI, resulting in collider bias. Finally, population structure differences between quintiles of a covariate may drive variable levels of stratification. These can bias estimation and confounds interpretations, at least one of which intuitively seems like a concern for each of the context variables (e.g., the covariates SES, LDL, diet, age, smoking, and alcohol drinking).</p>
<p>The increased prediction accuracy observed with some of the age-dependent prediction models is notable. Despite the clear utility of this investigation, I am not aware of much existing work that shows such improvements for context-aware prediction models (compared to additive/main effect models). I would be curious to see if the predictive utility extends to held-out data from a data set distinct from the UKB, where the model was trained, or whether it replicates when predicting variation within families. Such analyses could strengthen the evidence for these models capturing direct causal effects, rather than other reasons for the associations existing in the UKB sample.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the comments. We agree there are certain biases that may be introduced in these analyses. For population structure between quintiles, the analyses are already stratified by ancestry and have the top 5 genetic principal components included, which may help with this issue. In the interaction models we included separate terms for the PGS of the covariate as well which was meant to better capture the environmental component of the covariates, which may partially ameliorate issues of collider bias as SNPs that are causally affecting both BMI and the covariate would be partially adjusted for. While range restriction effects could introduce bias, in the correlation analyses the relationship between main effects and interaction effects (which were estimated without range restriction) have strong and reproducible correlations with PGS R2 differences across datasets.</p>
<p>We agree the increased prediction performance using PGS created directly from GxAge GWAS effects is notable, as it is essentially “free” performance increase that doesn’t require any new data, and it likely generalizable to additional covariates. It would be useful to validate its performance in other datasets, especially ones that are outside of the 40-69 age of UKBB.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Polygenic scores (PGS), constructed based on genetic effect sizes estimated in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and used to predict phenotypes in humans have attracted considerable recent interest in human and evolutionary genetics, and in the social sciences. Recent work, however, has shown that PGSs have limited portability across ancestry groups, and that even within an ancestry group, their predictive accuracy varies markedly depending on characteristics such as the socio-economic status, age, and sex of the individuals in the samples used to construct them and to which they are applied. This study takes further steps in investigating and addressing the later problem, focusing on body mass index, a phenotype of substantial biomedical interest. Specifically, it quantifies the effects of a large number of co-variates and of interactions between these covariates and the PGS on prediction accuracy; it also examines the utility of including such covariates and interaction in the construction of predictors using both standard methods and artificial neural networks. This study would be of interest to investigators that develop and apply PGSs.</p>
<p>I should add that I have not worked on PGSs and am not a statistician, and apologize in advance if this has led to some misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The paper presents a much more comprehensive assessment of the effects of covariates than previous studies. It finds many covariates to have a substantial effect, which further highlights the importance of this problem to the development and application of PGSs for BMI and more generally.</p>
</list-item><list-item><p>The findings re the relationships between the effects of covariates and interactions between covariates and PGSs are, to the best of my knowledge, novel and interesting.</p>
</list-item><list-item><p>The development of predictors that account for multiple covariates and their interaction with the PGS are, to the best of my knowledge, novel and may prove useful in future efforts to produce reliable PGSs.</p>
</list-item><list-item><p>The improvement offered by the predictors that account for PGS and covariates using neural networks highlights the importance of non-linear interactions that are not addressed by standard methods, which is both interesting and likely to be of future utility.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The paper would benefit substantially from extensive editing. It also uses terminology that is specific to recent literature on PGSs, thus limiting accessibility to a broader readership.</p>
</list-item><list-item><p>The potential meaning of most of the results is not explored. Some examples are provided below:
• The paper emphasizes that 18/62 covariates examined show significant effects, but this result clearly depends on the covariates included. It would be helpful to provide more detail on how these covariates were chosen. Moreover, many of these covariates are likely to be correlated, making this result more difficult to interpret. Could these questions at least be partially addressed using the predictors constructed using all covariates and their interactions jointly (i.e., with LASSO)? In that regard, it would be helpful to know how many of the covariates and interactions were used in this predictor (I apologize if I missed that).
• While the relationship between covariate effects and covariate-PGS interaction effects is intriguing, it is difficult to interpret without articulating what one would expect, i.e., what would be an appropriate null.
• The finding that using artificial neural networks substantially improves prediction over more standard methods is especially intriguing, and highlights the potential importance of non-linear relationships between PGSs and covariates. These relationships remain hidden in a black box, however. Even fairly straightforward analyses, based on using different combinations of the PGS and/or covariates may shed some light on these relationships. For example, analyzing which covariates have a substantial effect on the prediction or varying one covariate at a time for different values of the PGS, etc.</p>

<p>Thank you for the comments. Regarding running LASSO with all covariates along with each of their interactions with PGS in one model, upon reading those sections of the text again it is a little unclear we agree; but we actually did something very similar already (related sections have been edited for clarity in our revised manuscript) with these results being presented later on in the neural network section (second paragraph, S Table 7 – those results specifically aren’t in Figure 5). We just looked at changes in prediction performance, and did not try to interpret the model coefficients. We agree that many of the covariates are probably correlated, but based on the correlation results (Figure 4) it doesn’t seem like any covariate is especially important separately from its effect on BMI itself i.e., whatever covariates were chosen by LASSO may still not be especially important. This explanation is related to the interpretation of the neural network results, where neural networks improved performance even over linear models with just age and sex and their interactions with PGS as additional covariates, which may suggest that increased performance is coming from nonlinearities apart from multiplicative interaction effects with the PGS. So observing the coefficients from LASSO but still with a linear model may still not substantially aid in explaining the relationships that increase prediction performance using neural networks (additionally, this analysis may be difficult to replicate since many of the covariates are not present in multiple datasets). But this replication would be nice to see in future studies if such datasets exist. In terms of the null relationship between covariate main and interaction effects, if they are from the same model they will inherently be correlated, but the main effects from Figure 4 are from a main effects model only. Regarding the other points, the text will be edited for clarity and elaboration on specific topics.</p>
