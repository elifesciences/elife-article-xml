<title>Abstract</title><p>Here we identify the subunit e of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub>-ATP synthase (ATP5I) as a target of medicinal biguanides. ATP5I maintains the stability of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub>-ATP synthase dimers which is crucial for shaping cristae morphology. Although its roles have been mainly studied in yeast models, its function in cellular energy metabolism within the context of cancer remains poorly characterized. In this study, we demonstrate that ATP5I interacts with a biguanide analogue <italic>in vitro</italic> and disabling its expression by CRISPR-Cas9 in pancreatic cancer cells leads to the same phenotype as biguanide treated cells including a decrease in the levels of some respiratory complex subunits, mitochondrial morphology alterations, inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and a compensatory increase in glycolysis. Moreover, ATP5I knockout (KO) cells exhibit resistance to the antiproliferative effects of biguanides, but reintroduction of ATP5I rescues the metabolic and anti-proliferative effects of metformin and phenformin. These findings highlight ATP5I as a significant antineoplastic mitochondrial target of medicinal biguanides, opening new opportunities for the development of mitochondrial-targeted therapies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Discovering safe and effective therapeutic targets for cancer treatment remains a major challenge in biomedical research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Recently, targeted therapies against complex I of the respiratory chain have garnered considerable attention in pharmacology, offering a promising strategy for cancer treatment due to their potential to disrupt the energy metabolism of tumor cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. However, despite initial promises, clinical trials with potent complex I inhibitors, such as IACS-0107596, have been compromised by severe toxicities, raising concerns about their clinical viability. Given the critical role of mitochondria in cancer cells, there is an urgent need for more effective and safer alternatives to target them<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. In this context, medicinal biguanides such as metformin and the more lipophilic phenformin are emerging as attractive alternatives. These biguanides are considered moderate respiratory chain inhibitors and offer a potential avenue for targeting mitochondrial metabolism in cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Metformin has been used since the 1950s for its anti-hyperglycemic properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. As such, it has a well-established safety profile and is commonly used for the treatment of type II diabetes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Several epidemiological studies showed that prolonged use of metformin in diabetic patients reduced the incidence of several cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, particularly pancreatic cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. However, its clinical use has proven ineffective in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, suggesting that its antitumoral mechanism is more preventive than therapeutic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. The more potent phenformin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, which was withdrawn from the market in the 1970s for its anti-hyperglycemic applications due to deaths attributed partly to lactic acidosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, is currently undergoing clinical trials for oncology purposes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Unlike other inhibitors of the respiratory chain, the mechanism of action of medicinal biguanides remains elusive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. However, compelling evidence indicates that energy metabolism plays a pivotal role in their effectiveness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. At supra-pharmacological doses (1-10 mM), typically 100-1000 times higher doses than those used for anti-hyperglycaemic effects, metformin moderately inhibits the activity of complex I of the respiratory chain in several cellular models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. This inhibition subsequently decreases OXPHOS activity, leading to reduced cellular respiration and energy production. In response, cells adapt by shifting metabolism to glycolysis and decreasing their anabolic activity through the activation of the energy sensor AMPK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, to observe a decrease in isolated complex I activity in <italic>in vitro</italic> models, metformin doses of up to 50 mM are required<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. A recent cryo-electron microscopy study revealed that a metformin analogue binds to complex I in a specific conformation with a binding site unique to this analogue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. However, further work using <italic>in vivo</italic> models is necessary to validate the biological meaning of this interaction as a critical site of action of metformin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Additional targets such as glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, complex IV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, PEN2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> and F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub>- ATP synthase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> have also been suggested for metformin. Metformin may interact with various targets in a nonspecific manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> because of its structural similarity with guanidine, a potent chaotropic agent. These various targets potentially exert pleiotropic effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> that could act synergistically.</p>
<p>It has been shown that atrazine, a molecule derived from biguanides, binds and inhibits F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub>-ATP synthase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Additionally, a study from our group revealed that medicinal biguanides likely disrupt cristae organization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, a crucial process mediated by the oligomerization of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub>-ATP synthase and resulting in the formation of ʿʿonion-liked structuresʾʾ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. It is proposed that complex I and F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub>-ATP synthase of the respiratory chain may be particularly sensitive to biguanide inhibition due to the conformational mobility of their catalytic interfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Disrupting the folding of the mitochondrial inner membrane could alter the organization and functions of other respiratory chain complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. It remains an open question whether biguanides act through multiple targets or a single primary target.</p>
<p>Here, we identify another potential target of biguanides: the e subunit of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub>-ATP synthase (ATP5I), a transmembrane protein involved in the dimerization of this supramolecular complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Although medicinal biguanides are known to accumulate in mitochondria and disrupt the respiratory chain by inhibiting complex I, no direct evidence of their interaction with a subunit of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub>-ATP synthase has been reported until now. CRISPR-Cas9 mediated KO of ATP5I recapitulates many of the effects of metformin in pancreatic cancer cells and reduces metformin sensitivity. In addition, the genetic signature of a cells treated with metformin is more similar to that of cells treated with an F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub>-ATP synthase inhibitor than to a complex I inhibitor. Taken together this work adds the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub>-ATP synthase and its subunit ATP5I as a bona fide target of biguanides</p>

<title>Identification of ATP synthase subunit e (ATP5I) as a mitochondrial biguanide binding protein</title>
<p>To identify proteins that bind biguanides, we synthetized a Biotin Functionalized Biguanide or BFB (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1A-B</xref>) to perform an affinity-based pull-down assay with streptavidin beads<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. We first assessed the biological activity of BFB comparing it to metformin in the ability to activate AMPK and inhibit cell proliferation in KP-4 pancreatic cancer cells. Similarly to metformin, BFB activated AMPK and its downstream target ACC as indicated by their increased phosphorylation states (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) and inhibited KP-4 cell growth with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 1.0 ± 0.2 mM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Additionally, immunofluorescence experiments with fluorophore-conjugated Streptavidin confirmed that BFB accumulates in mitochondria, as shown by colocalization with the mitochondrial protein TOMM20 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1D</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>).</p>

<p>After confirming that BFB exhibited activity comparable to that of metformin, we performed pull-down assays using streptavidin immobilized on sepharose beads on mitochondrial-enriched cell extracts to analyse interacting proteins by mass-spectrometry. Given the significant issue of nonspecific binding associated with this technique, we performed multiple parallel pull-down experiments. These included a control biotin-conjugated amine derivative (BFA) possessing the same linker as BFB (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1C</xref>). Mass spectrometry analysis results identified a total of 69 proteins. Among these, 31 proteins showed specific interaction with BFB under the elution condition with metformin (see Materials and methods). Many of these proteins were cytoskeletal, with several keratin isoforms potentially involved in nonspecific interactions with streptavidin beads. However, several proteins stood out, including glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, arginase isoform 2 and ATP synthase subunit e (ATP5I). Glycerol-3 phosphate dehydrogenase is a known target of metformin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, validating our pulldown experiment. Additionally, arginase binds arginine which has a guanidinium group structurally related to metformin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Biguanide pharmacophore interacts specifically with ATP5I</title>
<p>As ATP5I was not previously shown to bind biguanides, we first confirmed this interaction through immunoblot analysis in independent pull-downs experiments. The results indicate that BFB allows specific interaction of ATP5I in streptavidin pull-down while BFA failed to do so. Of note, we observed a nonspecific band (≃11 kDA) in all pull-down conditions with streptavidin beads, possibly associated with the denatured streptavidin monomer in heated SDS buffer (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). We then used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to characterize the binding of BFB and purified recombinant ATP5I. Our purification steps yielded a highly pure recombinant protein, mainly organized in dimeric form (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1– figure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>). Although SPR is sensitive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>, the size difference between BFB and recombinant ATP5I prompted us to immobilize the small molecule BFB on the gold surface. Adding increasing concentrations of recombinant ATP5I allowed us to estimate an affinity constant (KD ≃ 11.10 μM; Rmax ≃ 39.40 RU) significantly lower than typical metformin concentrations that affect complex I in mM range (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1G</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1H</xref>)</p>

<title>ATP5I knockout in pancreatic cancer cells alters the organization of mitochondrial networks</title>
<p>In yeast, inhibition of the subunit e’s equivalent impaired mitochondrial inner membrane folding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. This structural deficiency in yeast correlates with decreased dimerization of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub>-ATP synthase, highlighting the essential role of ATP5I in dimer stability. However, yeast’s subunit e is not essential for the catalytic activity of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub>-ATP synthase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. In human cells, ATP5I is also crucial for dimer stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> but lacks thorough characterization regarding its roles in cellular energy metabolism. To elucidate its function in cancer and its relevance to cells treated with medicinal biguanides, we developed CRISPR-based reagents to inhibit ATP5I expression in KP-4 pancreatic cancer cells.</p>
<p>Initially, two clones each of the two guide (sgATP5I #1 and sgATP5I #2) were isolated, and their mitochondrial phenotype characterized. First, we measured levels of several proteins from the respiratory complexes. The results show that all ATP5I knockout clones did not express ATP5I and exhibited decreased expression of complex I NDUFB8 protein and complex IV COX II protein compared to control clones expressing a guide against GFP (sgGFP) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). A moderate to no reduction in mRNA levels encoding these proteins were observed (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – figure supplement 1A</xref>) cannot account for the downregulations at the protein level. Additionally, the mitochondrial/nuclear DNA ratio (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – figure supplement 1B</xref>) indicates no reduction in mitochondrial number, suggesting ATP5I may play a role in maintaining the stability of certain subunits of complexes I and IV. Consistent with this finding, the absence of subunit e in yeast also controls the stability of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub>-ATPase proteins subunit g and subunit k<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Given the uncertain role of ATP5I in the cellular energy metabolism but considering the changes in global mitochondrial physiology (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>), we investigated the effects of ATP5I knockout (KO) on mitochondrial bioenergetics in KP-4 cells.

<p>Moreover, the inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain observed in ATP5I KO cells also induces an energy imbalance, resulting in AMPK activation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), similarly to control cells treated with metformin (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – figure supplement 1G</xref>). However, the increased phosphorylation state of AMPK in ATP5I KO cells treated with metformin at these concentrations suggests that metformin can still activate AMPK via interactions with other targets such as PEN2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Energy stress resulting from ATP5I KO in KP-4 cells leads to a noticeable slowdown in cell growth (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>), although this effect can be reversed by supplementing the cell culture medium with pyruvate and uridine (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – figure supplement 1H</xref>). These findings suggest that while ATP5I is not essential for growth in KP-4 cells, its deletion subtly affects energy metabolism, akin to the effects seen in KP-4 cells treated with medicinal biguanides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Seahorse kinetic monitoring of control and ATP5I KO cells treated with 5 mM metformin reveals, as expected, that metformin causes a decrease in oxygen consumption (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>) and an increase in glycolysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>) over time. However, these effects are more pronounced in control cells than what is observed in ATP5I cells, particularly in terms of glycolysis activation. The OCR/ECAR ratio also decreases more in control cells upon metformin treatment than in ATP5I KO cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>), suggesting reduced sensitivity to metformin in the KO cells. This resistance is also evident in the relative growth of cells under increasing doses of metformin. Indeed, ATP5I KO cells exhibit EC<sub>50</sub> values up to 9 times higher than those of control cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). Overall, these results suggest that metformin is normally acting partially through ATP5I as indicated by the reduced sensitivity of the KO cells.</p>
<p>Similar trends where obtained, when using 100 μM phenformin in seahorse kinetic with more pronounced changes in both respiratory activity decline (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>) and glycolysis activation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>). These differences appear earlier but over a shorter time compared to metformin, possibly due to phenformin’s pharmacokinetic profile<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Again, phenformin affects both control and ATP5I KO cells but it does so less efficiently in ATP5I KO cells. The difference in OCR/ECAR ratio between control cells and the two ATP5I KO cell lines at 3 hours is significantly less impacted (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>), indicating lesser sensitivity of ATP5I KO cells to phenformin. Resistance to phenformin is also evident in cell growth, with ATP5I KO cells showing EC<sub>50</sub> up to 4 times higher than those of control cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3L</xref>). These results suggest that ATP5I mediates the metabolic and antiproliferative effects of biguanides in KP-4 cells.</p>

<p>To validate our previous hypotheses regarding the mechanism of action of ATP5I, we reintroduced wild-type ATP5I in ATP5I KO KP-4 clones. Immunoblot analysis results confirmed that exogenous ATP5I could be re-expressed in ATP5I KO cells, albeit at slightly reduced levels compared to control cells. Reintroducing ATP5I also restored the protein levels of NDUFB8 and COX II in KP-4 ATP5I KO cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Furthermore, exogenous ATP5I colocalized with TOMM20, indicating its successful mitochondrial localization and led to a reorganization of the mitochondrial networks (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – figure supplement 1</xref>). Indeed, quantitative analysis showed that about 60% of ATP5I KO cells with exoATP5I exhibited an intermediate fragmented phenotype between punctate and filamentous forms, while around 34% showed a filamentous phenotype and only few displayed a punctate phenotype (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>

<title>Chemogenomic screening of metformin reveals an imprint on F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub>-ATP synthase</title>
<p>To obtain an unbiased observation of biological processes affected by metformin, we performed a genome-wide pooled CRISPR/Cas9 KO screen in NALM-6 cells cultured in the presence of metformin at a concentration affecting growth (16 mM). Over the 8-day period of screening, cells had 1.47 population doublings whereas untreated controls had 7.5. Based on the sgRNA frequency changes observed afterward between treated vs untreated samples, we generated enrichment/depletion scores for each genes using the CRANKS algorithm. Many gene KO were then predicted together to potentiate (sgRNA depletion, KO creates sensitivity, negative CRANKS scores) or to suppress (sgRNA enrichment, KO creates resistance, positive CRANKS scores) metformin-induced growth inhibition (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Inactivation of the amino acid transporter SLC7A6 that plays a role in arginine export<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> enhanced metformin activity, likely because this protein may also export metformin. Indeed, the end of the R group is very similar chemically to metformin. In addition, disabling the transcription factors SOX4, TCF4, SPI1 and the histone H3K79 methyltransferase DOT1L also enhanced metformin activity perhaps because they promote gene expression programs that compensate the mitochondrial dysfunction associated to metformin action. For example, SOX4 and SPI1 can increase glycolysis by promoting HK2 expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup> while TCF4 increases glycolysis by inducing the expression of the glucose transporter GLUT3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Moreover, metformin can increase DOT1L mediated H3K79 methylation promoting the expression of SIRT3, a mitochondrial deacetylase that stimulates mitochondrial health and biogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. On the other hand, many genes were found to be required for metformin-mediated growth inhibition. Of note, DDX3X, an RNA helicase required for the translation of interferon response genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>, suggests a role for the interferon pathway in the antiproliferative activity of metformin. The actions of metformin were also suppressed by inactivation of the OMA1-DELE1-HRI pathway. OMA1, is a protease localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane activated by mitochondrial stress. DELE1 is a target of OMA1 that interacts with and activates EIF2AKI (also known as heme-regulated inhibitor of HRI). HRI catalyzes eIF2a phosphorylation which in turns activates the translation of ATF4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> which is also stimulated by DDX3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. ATF4 together with ATF3 regulates the expression of prop-apoptotic genes in response to both ER and mitochondrial stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Finally, inactivation of VDAC2, BAK1, HCCS (which makes Cytochrome C), Cytochrome C (CYCS) and APAF1 also conferred resistance to metformin, suggesting that metformin induces the classical mitochondria-related intrinsic apoptosis in treated cells. We compared the pattern of genetic interactions of metformin with that of rotenone, a complex I inhibitor (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>) and oligomycin A, a complex V inhibitor (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Interestingly, there were more similarities between oligomycin A and metformin (16 genes in common) than between rotenone and metformin (4 genes in common). Notably, inactivation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway through OMA1-DELE1-HRI as well as glycolytic pathway through SOX4 and TCF4 significantly affected both oligomycin A and metformin but not rotenone. On the other hand, DDX3X was required for the actions of all three drugs. Taken together, this genetic experiment shows that the OMA1-DEL1-HRI pathway mediates the antiproliferative activity of both biguanides and the F1ATPase inhibitor oligomycin (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>) while a compensatory glycolysis protects the cells.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Using a biologically active biotin functionalized biguanide (BFB), we identified and characterized subunit e of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub>-ATP synthase (ATP5I) as a potential antineoplastic mitochondrial target of medicinal biguanides. Knockdown of ATP5I in KP-4 human pancreatic cancer cells specifically altered the expression of NDUFB8 (complex I) and COX II (complex IV) proteins of the mitochondrial electron transport chain without affecting their mRNA levels, suggesting ATP5I as a role in maintaining OXPHOS protein stability. Thus, metformin binding to ATP5I can directly alter complex V activity and indirectly affect other respiratory complexes.</p>
<p>Interestingly, NDUFB8, a protein we found poorly expressed in ATP5I KO cells, is a target of the mitochondrial protease ClpP, whose activation can inhibit pancreatic adenocarcinoma growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. Our work shows that another protease, OMA1, is required for the action of metformin, suggesting that mitochondrial proteases can have potent antitumor activities. Other studies, using mass spectrometry, revealed interactions between ATP5I and essential components of mitochondrial protein import, such as TIMMDC1, involved in complex I’s import and assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. These findings suggest that ATP5I is integral to respirasome assembly and mitochondrial proteome stability. Moreover, recent evidence implicates transmembrane proteins TMEM70 and TMEM242 in complex I and F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub>-ATP synthase assembly or subunit expression regulation, linking the ATP synthase complex to complex I<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. Therefore, biguanides may inhibit complex I activity by binding to and disrupting either complex I or the ATP synthase complex.</p>
<p>Similar to medicinal biguanides effects on KP-4 cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, ATP5I depletion leads to mitochondrial structural changes such as mitochondrial fragmentation. Additionally, ATP5I deletion disrupts energy metabolism, decreasing complex I mediated NADH reoxidation and respiration, promoting glycolysis and AMPK activation, and impairing cell growth. Furthermore, ATP5I KO cells exhibit resistance to metformin and phenformin growth effects, indicating its pivotal role in mediating their metabolic and antiproliferative effects. Reintroducing wild-type ATP5I in ATP5I KO cells partially restored their sensitivity to biguanides, consistent with the proposed role of ATP5I being a biguanide target. Of note, the phenotypes observed in the absence of subunit g (ATP5L)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>, the direct partner of ATP5I, and subunit f (ATP5K)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup> in HeLa cells are similar to those of ATP5I mutants and metformin treated cells. Further work is needed to determine how metformin affects the interactions between ATP5I, ATP5L and ATP5K. Together these three proteins are located at the base of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub>-ATP synthase peripheral stalk which interact with OSCP (oligomycin sensitivity conferring protein) located in the F1 portion of the enzyme <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. ATP5I’s movement within F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub>-ATP synthase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup> may regulate and transfer information between the F1 and the F0 rotating complex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. These structural connections could underpin the results reported here that metformin and oligomycin share a common genetic signature in a CRISPR screening in NALM-6 cells. Our findings, combined with recent published results, strengthen the correlation between mitochondrial ultrastructure and respiratory activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>, suggesting that medicinal biguanides partially affect mitochondrial respiratory chain activity by indirectly inhibiting complex I of OXPHOS through ATP5I binding, although the exact complete molecular mechanism remains unclear.</p>
<p>The upregulation of ATP5I observed in hypoxia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>, DNA damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>, liver cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>, and low-fat diet responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup> underscores a regulatory role still poorly understood. In another study, RNA-seq data form A549 cells also suggest ATP5I levels influence metformin sensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>, highlighting its potential clinical relevance. Identifying ATP5I as a potential antineoplastic target for medicinal biguanides provides insights into the mechanisms underlying their anticancer effects and opens new avenues for targeting mitochondrial metabolism. These findings also underscore the need for further exploration of ATP5I’s functions within F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub>-ATP synthase and its connections with other OXPHOS complexes, potentially leading to novel therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment.</p>

<p>For immunoblotting, proteins extracts were obtained from 6-well cell culture dishes at 80-90 % confluence. Cells were treated with the corresponding drugs or vehicle 16 hours after seeding. As previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS), then the residual PBS was removed by aspiration. Cells were lysed in 250 μL of 2x Laemmli buffer (4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 120 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8), recovered using a cell scraper and transferred into Eppendorf tubes for a mild sonication of 20s followed by heating for 5 min at 95 °C. Protein extracts were cooled to room temperature (rt) and quantified by measuring absorbance at 280 nm using Nanodrop microvolume spectrophotometer (2000c, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Samples were then diluted to a final concentration (2 mg/mL) using a modified Laemmli Buffer (10% β-mercapthoethanol, 0.1% bromophenol, 2x Laemmli) and were kept at - 20 °C until use. A quantity of 25 to 40 μg of protein extracts were loaded into SDS-PAGE (12-15% for resolving gels, 4% for stacking gels) and run in Tris-Glycine SDS buffer (192 mM glycine, 0.1% SDS, 25 mM Tris-Base) at 90 V. SDS-PAGE were then transferred on a nitrocellulose membrane (0.45 µm, Bio-Rad, Mississauga, On, Canada) in Tris-Glycine buffer (96 mM glycine, 10 mM Tris-Base) for 1h30 at 120 V. Membranes were blocked in a modified Tris-buffered saline + 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST) solution with 5% skim milk for 1h at rt, washed with TBST 3x 5 min at rt and were then incubated with an appropriate diluted solution of primary antibody (in 0.1% BSA, 0.02% sodium azide, PBS pH 7.4) overnight (o/n) at 4°C. After primary antibody incubation, membranes were washed with TBST 3x 5 min and incubate with a diluted (1:3000 in 1% skim milk/TBST) secondary antibody coupled HRP for 1 hour at rt. After secondary antibody incubation, membranes were washed with TBST 3x 5 min.

At this moment coverslips were sometime stored in PBS + 0.2 % Sodium Azide at 4°C until use. If stored, 3x 10 min washing steps with PBS were performed to remove the azide. Cells were then permeabilized with PBS + 0.2 % Triton X-100 and 3% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) for 5 min at rt. Then, cells were washed in a blocking solution (3 % BSA in PBS pH 7.4) 3x 10 min at rt with agitation and were then incubated with an appropriate diluted solution of primary antibody (in 3% BSA, PBS pH 7.4) o/n at 4°C in a humidified chamber. After primary antibody incubation, cells were washed in blocking solution 3x 10 min and were incubated with an appropriate diluted solution (3% BSA, PBS pH 7.4) of secondary AlexaFluor antibody for 1h at rt in the dark. Cells were then washed with PBS 3x 10 min and coverslips were mounted on glass coverslip in Vectashield mounting media containing DAPI (H-1200-10, Vector Laboratories, Newark, CA, USA) and were sealed off with nail polish and kept for a minimum of 24 hours at 4°C.

<title>Pull-down assay</title>
<p>For pull-down assay, 1 mg of mitochondrial proteins were incubated with either 1 mM of biotin functionalized biguanide (BFB) or biotin functionalized amine (BFA) in Eppendorf tubes for 3h at rt with mild agitation. In parallel, Dynabeads MyOne streptavidin C1 (65001, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were washed and resuspended at least three times in lauryl maltoside (LM) buffer [1% lauryl maltoside, cOmplete-EDTA free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche), PhosSTOP (Roche), PBS pH 7.8]. After incubation with biotinylated molecules, beads (0.5 mg ∼ 50 μL) were added to mitochondrial lysates and incubated for 30 min at 4°C with agitation. Beads were respectively recovered with a magnet, washed in LM buffer 3x 30 min at 4°C. Elution of bound proteins from beads in BFB condition was performed by adding 30 μL of 50 mM metformin in LM buffer. After an incubation time of 30 min at rt, beads were vortexed, pelleted with a magnet and the supernatant was collected in a new tube. Proteins were then denatured by adding 30 μL of 6x SDS-loading buffer (30% glycerol, 10% SDS, 1% bromophenol blue, 15% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 M Tris-HCl pH 6.8) to the mixture and boiled 3x 5 min at 95°C. Elution of bound proteins for BFA condition and remaining proteins on beads for BFB condition were achieved by boiling and vortexing the corresponding beads in 60 μL of 6x SDS loading buffer 3x 5 min at 95°C. After denaturation of proteins, all samples were loaded into SDS–PAGE. The resulting gel was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 (#33445225GM, Thermo Fisher Scientific) then washed with a destaining solution (40% water, 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid). Gel segments were then excised, digested with trypsin and dried overnight in a cold trap (Labconco, Kansas City, MO, USA). Three samples for each elution condition were prepared in two technical replicates and were then analyzed by the Mass spectrometry platform at IRIC (Institute for Research on Immunology and Cancer).

For each solution, a volume of 300 μL was injected in the flow cells comprising a multifluidic channel cell and a reference cell. After having stabilized the baseline (∼30 min) with running buffer (125 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, PBS pH 7.4), biotin functionalized biguanide chloride salt was immobilized on SA sensor chip at 125 μM (concentration experimentally determined to saturate streptavidin sites). Then, the chip was washed with running buffer until stabilising the baseline. After that, several concentrations of purified recombinant ATP5I were injected until saturation of the signal. Of note, between each concentration added, washing steps were performed with running buffer to remove non-specifically bound molecules. Finally, the surface was regenerated with urea (2M) prepared in milli-Q-water. It’s worth nothing that due to the low dissociation constant of biotin/streptavidin interaction, biotinylated ligands are almost irreversibly bound that make it difficult to regenerate the chip. The sensorgrams were analysed with P4SPR Control v2.022 software and final figures were exported to Prism (10.2.2, GraphPad) using a pseudo-first order association kinetics equation for each concentration.

Two days following transfection, the viral soup from one 10 cm dish was filtered through a 0.45μm filter, supplemented with 4 μg.ml<sup>−1</sup> polybrene (#H-9268, Sigma Aldrich) and 1/10 (v/v) of fresh media and then used to infect one 10 cm dish of target cells. After at least 12 h post infection, infected cells were seeded into a new dish for passage. After at least 4 hours of adherence, infected cells were selected using 50 μg/mL hygromycin (#400-141-UG, Wisent). Of note, the selection was maintained for the length of the experiments.</p>

<title>Quantitative PCR (qPCR)</title>
<p>RNA isolation and qPCR quantifications were performed exactly as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup> using the following primers (see below, BioCorp, Pierrefonds, Qc, Canada). Mitochondrial to nuclear DNA ratio were performed similarly by qPCR but with primer targeting DNA and on 30 ng of genomic DNA purified from cultures KP-4 cells. For the isolation, one 6 cm plate of sub confluent KP-4 cells were rinsed twice in PBS, collected by scraping in 500μL of SNET lysis buffer (5 mM EDTA, 400 mM NaCl, 1% SDS, 400 ug/mL Proteinase K, 20mM Tris-HCL pH8.0 [Sigma Aldrich]) and incubated at 55°C overnight. Equal volume of phenol:chloroform (Sigma Aldrich) was added and left to agitate for 30 min at rt. After a 5-minute centrifugation (16,000g), the aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube and precipitated by an equal volume of isopropanol, mixed well and DNA was collected by centrifugation at maximum speed (16,000g) for 15 minutes at 4°C. Pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, air dried and resuspended in TE.</p>

<title>NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH quantification</title>
<p>For NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH quantifications, 5×10<sup>5</sup> cells were seeded in 10 cm cell culture dishes for technical duplicates and incubated for 48h. NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio were quantified using a fluorometric kit assay (#MAK460-1KT, Sigma Aldrich) following manufacturer’s instructions. For sample preparation, 9×10<sup>5</sup> cells were pelleted and homogenized with corresponding extraction buffers to be in the linear range of the kit.

<title>Seahorse experiments</title>
<p>Seahorse XFe96 cell culture microplates (Agilent) were coated with 50 µg/mL of Poly-D-Lysine (#A3890401, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in D-PBS (#311-425-CL, Wisent) for 1 hour at room temperature and extensively washed with sterile water. Seahorse XFe96 sensor cartridges (Agilent) were calibrated according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Assay media was prepared as follows: 828 g DMEM without L-Glutamine, phenol red, sodium pyruvate, and sodium bicarbonate (#219-060-XK, Wisent), 29.2 mg L-glutamine (#AC386032500, Fisher Chemical), 450.4 mg D-glucose (#D-16-500, Fisher Chemical), 100 µL HEPES 1M (#330-050, Wisent), completed at 100 mL with Milli-Q water and adjusted pH at 7.2. Cells were plated in Poly-D-Lysine-coated microplates at a density of 40,000 cells/well in 100 µL of assay media. Following a 30-minute incubation at room temperature, 75 µL of assay media was added to each well, and the plate was transferred to an XFe96 analyzer. Typical runs were composed of the following steps: 1) baseline measurements for 18 minutes (3 cycles, each of 3-minute mixing and 3-minute measurement), 2) single drug injection (5 mM metformin, 100 µM phenformin, or sterile water as vehicle control), and 3) measurements over a period of 10.5 hours (63 cycles, each of 6-minute mixing, 1-minute pause, and 3-minute measurement). Oxygen consumption rates (OCR) and extracellular acidification rates (ECAR) were extracted from the Wave software (Agilent) and all time points were normalized to the first measurement. Data were then exported to Prism (10.2.2, GraphPad) software to generate final figures.</p>

<title>Crystal violet cell number assay</title>
<p>The crystal violet staining retention assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup> was used to estimate cell growth and viability by measuring absorbance at 590 nm in a microplate reader (SpectraMax 190 microplates, Molecular Devices).</p>
<p>For the growth assay 5,000 cells were seeded in 4 different 6-well cell culture dishes in technical triplicates and incubated for 4 different time points up to 6 days. Of note, media was replaced every 48 hours. At indicated times, cells were washed twice in PBS and fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde solution (PBS) for 10 min at rt. After fixation, cells were washed twice in PBS. Once all time point were collected, plates were stained in a 0.05 % crystal violet solution (PBS) for 30 min with agitation. After staining, plates were washed five times in water and were dried for 24 hours. The next day, crystal violet retained in cells were solubilized in 10 % acetic acid solution for 15 min with agitation and transferred into a 96 well plates for absorbance measurement. Data were then exported to Prism (10.2.2, GraphPad) software to generate final figures.</p>
<p>For the cell viability assay, 1,000 cells were seeded in 96 well plates in technical triplicates. After 24 hours, cells were treated at different concentrations with the corresponding drugs and were grown for 72 hours. Crystal violet staining was performed as described for the growth assay. The half minimal effective concentrations were obtained using a fit a curve with non-linear regression log(inhibitor) vs. response -variable slope (four parameters) from the corresponding dose response curves with Prism (10.2.2, GraphPad) software. Importantly, because growth rate was affected in ATP5I KO cells generating variabilities, cell viability assays comparing ATP5I KO with control cells were done in media supplemented with pyruvate and uridine (see generation of stable ATP5I KO cells section). Of note, drugs were dissolved in the corresponding media.</p>

<title>Chemogenomic CRISPR/Cas9 KO screen in NALM-6 cells</title>
<p>The Genome-wide pooled CRISPR/Cas9 KO screens made in the presence of chemicals inhibiting growth were performed by the ChemoGenix platform (IRIC, Université de Montréal; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://chemogenix.iric.ca/">https://chemogenix.iric.ca/</ext-link>) as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup>. Briefly, a NALM-6 clone bearing an integrated doxycycline-inducible Cas9 expression cassette generated by lentiviruses made from pCW-Cas9 (Addgene #50661) was transduced with the genome-wide KO EKO sgRNA library<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup> (278,754 different sgRNAs). After thawing the library from liquid N<sub>2</sub> and letting it recover in 10% FBS RPMI for 1 day, KOs were induced for 7 days of culture with 2 ug/mL doxycycline. The pooled library was then split in different T-75 flasks (28×10<sup>6</sup> cells per flask; a representation of 100 cells/sgRNA) in 70 mL at 4×10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL. Cells were treated with 16 mM Metformin (using 1M stock solution prepared in media) or 70 nM rotenone (Sigma, R8875) or 2µM oligomycin A (Tocris Bioscience, 4110) (both from 1000X stock solutions prepared in DMSO) for 8 days with monitoring of growth every 2 days, diluting back to 4×10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL and adding more compounds to maintain same final concentration whenever cells reached 8×10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL. Over that period, treated cells had respectively 1.47, 2.93 &amp; 4.14 population doublings whereas no solvent or DMSO controls had about 7.5. Cells were collected, genomic DNA extracted using the Gentra Puregene kit according to manufacturer’s instructions (QIAGEN), and sgRNA sequences PCR-amplified as described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup>. SgRNA frequencies were obtained by next-generation sequencing (Illumina NextSeq 500). Reads were aligned using Bowtie2.2.5 in the forward direction only (norc option) with otherwise default parameters and total read counts per sgRNA tabulated. Context-dependent chemogenomic interaction scores were calculated from comparing sgRNA frequency changes against negative controls from using a modified version of the RANKS algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup> which uses guides targeting similarly essential genes as controls to distinguish condition-specific chemogenomic interactions from non-specific fitness/essentiality phenotypes. Raw read counts are available upon request directly from the ChemoGenix platform.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> manuscript describes ATP5I, a subunit of F1Fo-ATP synthase, as a key target of medicinal biguanides, however, it provides <bold>incomplete</bold> evidence of a direct interaction between ATP5I and metformin. The knockout of ATP5I in pancreatic cancer cells mimics biguanide treatment, inducing a metabolic switch from OXPHOS to glycolysis due to a compromised expression of the Complex I protein NDUFB8. This results in a markedly decreased NAD/NADH ratio and decreased cell proliferation. These findings point out ATP5I as a promising mitochondrial target for cancer therapies and contribute to our understanding of metformin's mechanism of action since many of its molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the manuscript entitled 'The Role of ATP Synthase Subunit e (ATP5I) in 1 Mediating the Metabolic and Antiproliferative 2 Effects of Biguanides', Lefrancois G et al. identifies ATP5I, a subunit of F1Fo-ATP synthase, as a key target of medicinal biguanides. ATP5I stabilizes F1Fo-ATP synthase dimers, essential for cristae morphology, but its role in cancer metabolism is understudied. The research shows ATP5I interacts with a biguanide analogue, and its knockout in pancreatic cancer cells mimics biguanide treatment effects, including altered mitochondria, reduced OXPHOS, and increased glycolysis. ATP5I knockout cells resist biguanide-induced antiproliferative effects, but reintroducing ATP5I restores the effects of metformin and phenformin. These findings highlight ATP5I as a promising mitochondrial target for cancer therapies. The manuscript is well written.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Demonstrated the experiments in systematic and well-accepted methods.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The significance of the target molecule and mechanisms may help in understanding the molecular mechanisms of metformin.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The mechanism(s) by which the therapeutic drug metformin lowers blood glucose in type 2 diabetes and inhibits cell proliferation at higher concentrations remain contentious. Inhibition of complex 1 of the mitochondrial respiratory chain with consequent changes in cellular metabolites which favour allosteric activation of phosphofructokinase-1, allosteric inhibition of fructose bisphosphatase-1 and cAMP signalling and activation of AMPK which phosphorylates transcription factors are candidate mechanisms. The current manuscript proposes the e-subunit of ATP-synthase as a putative binding protein of biguanides and demonstrates that it regulates the expressivity of the Complex 1 protein NDUFB8.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The metformin conjugate and metformin show comparable efficacy on inhibition of cell proliferation in the millimolar range.</p>
<p>(2) Demonstration of compromised expression of the Complex I protein NDUFB8 by the ATP5I knockout and its reversal by ATP5I expression is an important strength of the study. This shows that the decreased &quot;sensitivity&quot; to metformin in the ATP5I knock-out cells could be due to various proteins.</p>
<p>(3) Demonstration of converse effects of ATP5I KO and re-expression ATP5I on the NAD/NADH ratio.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The interpretation of the cellular co-localization of the biotin-biguanide conjugate with TOMM20 (Figure 1-D) as mitochondrial &quot;accumulation&quot; of the conjugate is overstated because it cannot exclude binding of the conjugate to the mitochondrial membrane. It would have been more convincing if additional incubations with the biotin-biguanide conjugate in combination with metformin had shown that metformin is competitive with the biotin-conjugate.</p>
<p>(2) The manuscript reports the identification of 69 proteins by mass spectrometry of the pull-down assay of which 31 proteins were eluted by metformin. However, no Mass Spectrometry data is presented of the peptides identified. The methodology does not state the minimum number of peptides (1, 2?) that were used for the identification of the 31/69 proteins.</p>
<p>(3) The validation of ATP5I was based on the use of recombinant protein (which was 90% pure) for the SPR and the use of a single antibody to ATP5I. The validity of the immunoblotting rests on the assumption that there is no &quot;non-specific&quot; immunoactivity in the relevant mol wt range. Information on the validation of the antibody would be helpful.</p>
<p>(4) Knock-out of ATP5I markedly compromised the NAD/NADH ratio (Fig.3A) and cell proliferation (Figure 3D). These effects may be associated with decreased mitochondrial membrane potential which could explain the low efficacy of metformin (and most of the data in Figures 3-5). This possibility should be discussed. Effects of [metformin] on the NAD/NADH ratio in control cells and ATP5I-KO would have been helpful because the metformin data on cell growth is normalized as fold change relative to control, whereas the NAD/NADH ratio would represent a direct absolute measurement enabling comparison of the absolute effect in control cells with ATP5I KO.</p>
<p>(5) Figure-6 CRISPR/Cas9 KO at 16mM metformin in comparison with 70nM rotenone and 2 micromolar oligomycin (in serum-containing medium). The rationale for the use of such a high concentration of metformin has not been explained. In liver cells metformin concentrations above 1mM cause severe ATP depletion, whereas therapeutic (micromolar) concentrations have minimal effects on cellular ATP status. The 16mM concentration is ~2 orders of magnitude higher than therapeutic concentrations and likely linked to compromised energy status. The stronger inhibition of cell proliferation by 16mM metformin compared with rotenone or oligomycin raises the issue of whether the changes in gene expression may be linked to the greater inhibition of mitochondrial metabolism. Validation of the cellular ATP status and NAD/NADH with metformin as compared with the two inhibitors could help the interpretation of this data.</p>

<p>Most of the data are based on measurements of the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) measured by the Seahorse analyser in control and ATP5l KO cells. However, these measurements are conducted by a single injection of a biguanide, followed over time and presented as fold change. By doing so, the individual information on the effect of metformin and derivate on control and KO cells are lost. In addition, the usual measurement of OCR is coupled with certain inhibitors and uncouplers, such as oligomycin, FCCP, and Antimycin A/rotenone, to understand the contribution of individual complexes to respiration. Since biguanides and ATP5l KO affect protein levels of components of complex I and IV, it would be informative to measure their individual contributions/effects in the Seahorse. To further strengthen the data, it would be helpful to obtain measurements of actual ATP levels in these cells, as this would explain the activation of AMPK.</p>
<p>The authors report on alterations in mitochondrial morphology upon ATP5l KO, which is measured by subjective quantifications of filamentous versus puncta structures. Fiji offers great tools to quantify the mitochondrial network unbiasedly and with more accuracy using deconvolution and skeletonization of the mitochondria, providing the opportunity to measure length, shape, and number quantitatively. This will help to understand better, whether mitochondria are really fragmented upon ATP5l KO and rescued by its re-introduction.</p>
<p>Finally, the authors report in the last part of the paper a genetic CRISPR/Cas9 KO screen in NALM-6 cells cultured with high amounts of metformin to identify potential new mediators of metformin action. It is difficult to connect that to the rest of the paper because a) different concentrations of metformin are used and b) the metabolic effects on energy consumption are not defined. They argue about the molecular function of the obtained hits based on literature and on a comparison of the pattern of genetic alterations based on treatments with known inhibitors such as oligomycin and rotenone. However, a direct connection is not provided, thus the interpretation at the end of the results that &quot;the OMA1-DEL1-HRI pathway mediates the antiproliferative activity of both biguanides and the F1ATPase inhibitor oligomycin&quot; while increasing glycolysis, needs to be toned down. This is an interesting observation, but no causality is provided. In general, this part stands alone and needs to be better connected to the rest of the paper.</p>

<p>The significance of the target molecule and mechanisms may help in understanding the molecular mechanisms of metformin.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comment regarding the significance of the target molecule and its mechanisms in understanding the molecular actions of metformin. ATP5I is responsible for the dimerization of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>0</sub>-ATPase(1-3). Hence, we propose conducting BN-PAGE followed by a western blot using the β-subunit of the F1 domain of F1F0-ATP synthase to investigate whether metformin affects its dimerization. This will provide a more direct evidence of the on target action of metformin on ATP5I. Due to the high abundance of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>0</sub>-ATP synthase in cells and the slow ability of metformin to enter mitochondria, we plan to perform long-term treatments (3 and 6 days) with high concentrations of metformin (10 mM) to enhance the likelihood of detecting subtle yet biologically relevant shifts in the monomer and dimer populations. Prolonged exposure is expected to reveal the cumulative effects of metformin on F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>0</sub>-ATP synthase dimers/monomers ratio. We do not expect that metformin will totally mimic the cumulative effect of the dimerization as in ATP5I KO cells but we think it will be important to report to what extent this ratio is affected.</p>

It would have been more convincing if additional incubations with the biotin-biguanide conjugate in combination with metformin had shown that metformin is competitive with the biotin-conjugate.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comment and agree that the resolution provided by fluorescence microscopy makes it challenging to pinpoint the specific mitochondrial compartment where the biotin-biguanide conjugate localizes, even with additional markers such as TOMM20 antibodies for the inner mitochondrial membrane. While it remains a possibility that the conjugate binds to the mitochondrial surface, another plausible explanation is that the biotin moiety may facilitate entry into mitochondria through a biotin-specific transporter, adding further mechanistic intricacies. Furthermore, while a competition assay with metformin might help investigate interactions with mitochondrial targets and transporters (OCT family), it would not compete for biotin-mediated transport. Thus, while we acknowledge the reviewer’s suggestion, we believe such an experiment may not provide conclusive evidence regarding the conjugate’s mitochondrial localization or mechanism of entry. Instead, we will revise the manuscript to more accurately describe the findings as &quot;mitochondrial association&quot; rather than &quot;mitochondrial accumulation,&quot; ensuring that our interpretation remains consistent with the resolution and limitations of the data presented.</p>

<p>Regarding the recombinant protein used for SPR, its purity was evaluated using a Coomassie-stained gel. For the antibody used in immunoblotting, its specificity was validated through knockout cell lines, ensuring minimal concerns about non-specific immunoactivity within the relevant molecular weight range. Unfortunately, the KO data comes in the paper after the first immunoblots are presented. In the revised manuscript, we will clearly outline these validation steps in the methods section and additional manufacturer documentation for the antibody we used.</p>

<p>(4) Knock-out of ATP5I markedly compromised the NAD/NADH ratio (Fig.3A) and cell proliferation (Figure 3D). These effects may be associated with decreased mitochondrial membrane potential which could explain the low efficacy of metformin (and most of the data in Figures 3-5). This possibility should be discussed. Effects of [metformin] on the NAD/NADH ratio in control cells and ATP5I-KO would have been helpful because the metformin data on cell growth is normalized as fold change relative to control, whereas the NAD/NADH ratio would represent a direct absolute measurement enabling comparison of the absolute effect in control cells with ATP5I KO.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The mitochondrial membrane potential depends on a functional electron transport chain which drives proton pumping from the matrix to the intermembrane space. Metformin can decrease the mitochondrial membrane potential and this usually explained as a consequence of complex I inhibition(4). It has been published the metformin requires this membrane potential to accumulate in mitochondria so the actions of metformin are self-limiting due to this requirement. The reviewer is right that ATP5I KO cells could be resistant to metformin because they may have a lower membrane potential. We do not believe this to be the case because the response to phenformin, another biguanide that can enter mitochondria through the membrane without the need of the OCT transporters(5), is also affected in ATP5IKO cells. Of note, compensatory mechanisms such as enhanced glycolysis, as observed in ATP5I-KO cells (elevated ECAR and increased sensitivity to 2-D-deoxyglucose), and the ATPase activity of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>0</sub>-ATP synthase could potentially help maintain membrane potential suggesting that this might not be an issue in the ATP5I KO cells. We will discuss these possibilities in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, to experimentally address this point, we propose measuring mitochondrial membrane potential using tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRE) and ATP levels using luciferase-based assays (CellTiter-Glo) in ATP5I-KO cells.</p>
<p>Regarding the NAD+/NADH in both control and KO cells may not be very helpful because this ratio can be corrected by LDH which is induced as part of the glycolytic adaptation that occurs after inhibition of respiration. Since our KO cells have been propagated already for several passages, the extent of this adaptation is likely different from metformin-treated cells. As we mentioned in answering Reviewer 1, we will provide a more direct measurement of metformin acting on ATP5I: the levels of F1F0-ATPase dimers and monomers.</p>

<p>(5) Figure-6 CRISPR/Cas9 KO at 16mM metformin in comparison with 70nM rotenone and 2 micromolar oligomycin (in serum-containing medium). The rationale for the use of such a high concentration of metformin has not been explained. In liver cells metformin concentrations above 1mM cause severe ATP depletion, whereas therapeutic (micromolar) concentrations have minimal effects on cellular ATP status. The 16mM concentration is ~2 orders of magnitude higher than therapeutic concentrations and likely linked to compromised energy status. The stronger inhibition of cell proliferation by 16mM metformin compared with rotenone or oligomycin raises the issue of whether the changes in gene expression may be linked to the greater inhibition of mitochondrial metabolism. Validation of the cellular ATP status and NAD/NADH with metformin as compared with the two inhibitors could help the interpretation of this data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To address the reviewer’s final comment, we would like to clarify the rationale behind our experimental approach. NALM-6 cells are very glycolytic, have low respiration rates, and weak dependence on ATP5I (DepMap score: -0.47)(6). The concentration of 16 mM metformin was chosen based on the IC50 for this cell line. This approach aligns with our focus on the anticancer mechanism of action rather than the antidiabetic effects of metformin. Both ATP status and NAD+/NADH ratios will depend on the extent of the compensatory glycolysis. On the other hand, our genetic screening evaluates cell proliferation as an integration of all metabolic activities required for the process. This unbiased screening revealed a common pathway affected by metformin and oligomycin different that the pathway affected by rotenone, which is consistent with the finding that metformin acts of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>0</sub>ATPase.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s observations regarding the Seahorse measurements and acknowledge the potential limitations of presenting the data as fold change. Due to experimental challenges in maintaining KP-4 and ATP5I-KO cells with sufficient nutrients, caused by their rapid glucose uptake and subsequent lactate production, it was more practical to present the Seahorse results in this format. Using inhibitors at each time point during the Seahorse experiment was not feasible, as the delay between inhibitor injections and the corresponding changes in oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) would introduce variability and complicate the interpretation of dynamic responses. Nevertheless, we recognize the importance of understanding the contributions of specific respiratory complexes to OCR and ECAR. To address this, we will include a representative figure showcasing a typical Seahorse analysis, highlighting ATP turnover and proton leak after oligomycin addition, maximal respiration with FCCP, and disruption with rotenone and antimycin A. While these experiments are inherently complex due to the metabolic demands of ATP5I-KO cells, this approach will provide a clearer breakdown of mitochondrial activity. Furthermore, as mentioned in our response to Reviewer 2, we will measure ATP levels using a luciferase-based assay (CellTiter-Glo) in both control and ATP5I-KO cells to better explain AMPK activation. This will provide additional context to strengthen the interpretation of mitochondrial function and metabolic compensation mechanisms in these cells.</p>

<p>NALM-6 are very glycolytic, have low respiration rates, and weak dependence on ATP5I(6), forcing us to use higher concentrations of metformin to inhibit their growth. Recent results show that metformin targets PEN2 in the cytosol to increase AMPK activity, controlling both the glucose lowering and the life span extension abilities of metformin 7. This work raises the question whether the antiproliferative and anticancer effects of metformin are due to a mitochondrial activity or are controlled by this new pathway of AMPK activation. Hence, the genetic screening was performed to unbiasedly find how metformin works. The results provide compelling evidence for mitochondria and in particular the ATP synthase as potential targets of metformin and a foundation for future studies. We will revise the text and abstract to better reflect the exploratory nature of this finding and ensure clarity.</p>
