<abstract>
<p>Despite the recognized importance of glycans in biological phenomena, their complex roles in spermatogenesis and sperm function remain unclear. SLC35G3, a 10-transmembrane protein specifically found in early round spermatids, belongs to the sugar-nucleotide transporter family, indicating its involvement in glycan formation. In this study, we found that <italic>Slc35g3</italic> knockout male mice were sterile due to impaired sperm functions in uterotubal junction passage, zona pellucida binding, and oocyte fusion. Mouse SLC35G3 has UDP-GlcNAc transporter activity, and its ablation caused abnormal processing of the sperm plasma membrane and acrosome membrane proteins. Reported human <italic>SLC35G3</italic> mutations (F267L and T179HfsTer27) diminished the UDP-GlcNAc transporter activity of SLC35G3, implying infertility risks in males carrying these mutations. Our findings unveil the vital roles of SLC35G3 in the glycan formation of sperm membrane proteins critical for sperm fertilizing ability.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Glycosylation is a post-translational modification that ensures target protein synthesis, secretion, stability, characterization, and/or function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the oligosaccharyltransferase complex (OSTC) co-translationally transfers core glycans assembled on dolichol phosphate to asparagine residues of nascent proteins. Subsequently, these proteins undergo a quality control process in which the core glycan structure is processed by glucosidases, resulting in a monoglucosylated form that binds to ER lectin chaperones, calnexin (CANX) and calreticulin (CALR). Once disulfide bonds are correctly formed by protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and the protein is properly folded, the protein is transported to the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Notably, there are testis-specific proteins that are required for these processes and the regulation of sperm fertilizing ability. Recent studies suggest that FREY tightly interacts with proteins involved in N-glycosylation, and its disruption destabilizes OSTC and causes subsequent ablation of the acrosomal membrane proteins essential for sperm-egg fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). In addition to the CANX/CALR/PDI complex in somatic cells, their testis-specific paralogs, CLGN/CALR3/PDILT, are required for ADAM3 sperm membrane glycoprotein maturation to equip sperm with fertilization competence, including the ability to pass through the uterotubal junction (UTJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>).</p>
<p>In the ER to Golgi secretory pathway, more than 200 glycosyltransferases, such as mannosyl (alpha-1,3-)-glycoprotein beta-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (MGAT) and N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (GALNT), add further diversity by conferring various properties, such as solubility and adhesiveness to the proteins. Once glycoproteins reach the cell surface, some are secreted to form the extracellular matrix, while others remain and contribute to cell adhesion and interactions with substrates or other cells. Among these glycosyltransferase-like proteins, DPY19L2 (a probable C-mannosyltransferase), MGAT4D, MGAT4E, MGAT4F, and GALNTL5 show testis-specific expression by <italic>in silico</italic> analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). <italic>Dpy19l2</italic> knockout mice are infertile due to globozoospermia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), and a mutation in <italic>Galntl5</italic> resulted in asthenozoospermia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Of note, GALNTL5 does not exhibit transferase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). While <italic>Mgat4d</italic> knockout mice are fertile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>), <italic>Mgat4e</italic> and <italic>Mgat4f</italic> orthologs do not exist in humans, and their knockout mice need to be generated to reveal if they have indispensable or redundant functions in mice. Collectively, these findings suggest that the spermatogenic cells have a unique system for the production and quality control of glycoproteins, and some of them are critical for spermatogenesis, sperm functions, and male fertility.</p>
<p>In the present study, we focused on the solute carrier (SLC) 35 family of nucleotide sugar transporters, which are responsible for importing sugars that serve as substrates for glycosyltransferases. Sugars are conjugated to nucleotides and transported by specific SLC35 family antiporters into the ER and Golgi apparatus, where glycosyltransferases utilize them to modify target proteins. Glycan structures are synthesized from sugars including D-glucose (Glc), D-galactose (Gal), N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc), N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNAc), L-fucose (Fuc), D-glucuronic acid (GlcA), D-mannose (Man), N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu), and D-xylose (Xyl). Among the SLC35 paralogs, SLC35A1 transports CMP-Sialic Acid, SLC35A2 transports UDP-Gal, SLC35B4 transports UDP-GlcNAc, and SLC35C1 transports GDP-Fuc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Of the 27 SLC35 family members, most show ubiquitous expressions, including in spermatogenic cells. Notably, in silico analysis revealed that <italic>Slc35g3</italic> is the only SLC35 family member specifically expressed in the testis. <italic>Slc35g3</italic> emerged in amphibians and is conserved in primates. We elucidated the biochemical properties of SLC35G3 <italic>in vitro</italic> and generated <italic>Slc35g3</italic> knockout mice to study its physiological functions <italic>in vivo</italic>. We discovered that SLC35G3 is a spermatogenic cell-specific UDP-GlcNAc transporter, and <italic>Slc35g3</italic> ablation results in abnormal processing of sperm plasma membrane and acrosome membrane glycoproteins required for sperm fertilizing ability and male fertility.</p>

<title>SLC35G3 is expressed during late spermatogenesis and localized in the Golgi apparatus</title>
<p>In mice, <italic>Slc35g3</italic> comprises two coding exons and is located on chromosome 11, whereas it is located on chromosome 17 in humans. The TreeFam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) data confirmed the evolutionary conservation of <italic>Slc35g3</italic> among vertebrates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). RT-PCR analysis indicates that it is prominently expressed in the testis, beginning 21 days postpartum (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), suggesting that its expression begins in round spermatids in mice. The Mammalian Reproductive Genetics Database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>) revealed that <italic>Slc35g3</italic> is the only mouse SLC35 family that shows a testis-specific transcription pattern (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S1</xref>). A previous scRNA-seq analysis suggested that transcription of <italic>Slc35g3</italic> initiates in round spermatids (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>; Mouse Cell Atlas; 17). Both AlphaFold2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>) and TOPCONS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>) analyses supported that SLC35G3 has 10 transmembrane domains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), likely forming a homodimer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S2</xref>). Immunostaining colocalizes SLC35G3 with Golgi marker (GM) 130 (Golgin A2), indicating SLC35G3 localization in the Golgi of mouse testicular germ cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>).</p>

<p>Given the subtle morphological changes observed in <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>-derived sperm (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), we employed elliptic Fourier descriptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>) to characterize the entire sperm head shape and conducted a principal component (PC) analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B, 3C, 3D</xref>).

<p>To further analyze the cause of infertility in <italic>Slc35g3</italic> null male mice, we performed an in vitro fertilization (IVF) assay.

By removing cumulus cells followed by insemination (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>), we found a decline in the number of <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>-/-</sup>-derived spermatozoa bound to the ZP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C, 4D</xref>), no oocytes fertilized as well (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; <bold><italic>P</italic></bold> = 0.0079).

Lastly, IVF performed using cumulus-intact oocytes with 10 times more sperm insemination (2 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> sperm/mL) resulted in a reduced fertilization rate (45.7%, 21/46), but we succeeded in obtaining 10 live pups from these fertilized eggs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S9</xref>).

<p>As spermatozoa lacking ZP binding frequently cannot pass through the uterotubal junction (UTJ) and reach the oviduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>), we observed sperm UTJ passage after mating.

<p>To understand the molecular mechanisms behind the disrupted sperm functions of <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, we analyzed glycoproteins related to each process. First, we examined proteins involved in acrosome formation. Immunoblot analysis of <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> testis lysates showed a reduction in the amount of ZP binding protein 1 (ZPBP1; 24), whereas Golgi-associated PDZ and coiled-coil motif containing (GOPC; 25) levels remained unchanged (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Interestingly, SPACA1 (Sperm Acrosome Associated 1; 26) exhibited a subtle difference in banding pattern in the <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> testis lysate. SPACA1 is N-glycosylated, and treatment of testis and caudal sperm lysates with peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>) resulted in comparable SPACA1 band patterns between <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> testes but not in sperm lysates.

<p>Next, we examined proteins involved in ZP binding. Levels of a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) 1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>) were comparable between <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup><italic>-</italic>/-</sup> in the testis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>) and sperm (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). Levels of CKLF-like MARVEL transmembrane domain containing (CMTM) 2A and CMTM2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>) were reduced in <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup><italic>-</italic>/-</sup> testis lysates but not in sperm. The expression pattern of ADAM3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>) was comparable between <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> testis, yet the amount of a smaller isoform was elevated in <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>-/-</sup>-derived sperm lysates, indicating aberrant processing. After PNGaseF treatment of proteins, the ADAM3 band pattern was comparable between <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S10</xref>). Given the aberrant ADAM3 band pattern was also observed in testis expressed gene 101 (TEX101) knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>) epididymal caput sperm, we examined TEX101 levels through western blot analysis; however, the amount of TEX101 was comparable between <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> testis lysates (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). Given that the testicular <italic>Ace</italic><sup>-/-</sup> (t-ACE; 32, 33, 34) caused aberrant localization of ADAM3, we examined t-ACE levels through western blot analysis and found that the amount of t-ACE was comparable between <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> in both testis and sperm lysates (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D, 6E</xref>). In the previous studies, lymphocyte antigen 6 family member K (<italic>Ly6k</italic>)<sup>-/-</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>), <italic>Spaca4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>), and LY6/PLAUR Domain Containing 4 (<italic>Lypd4</italic>) <sup>-/-</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>) sperm showed impaired ZP binding; however, the amount of ADAM3 remained normal. The amount of LY6K was reduced in <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> testis lysates (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>), and the amount of SPACA4 was comparable between <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> in both testis and sperm lysates (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D, 6E</xref>). However, the amount of LYPD4 in <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> testis lysates decreased, and the lower molecular weight band disappeared in <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>-/-</sup>-derived sperm lysates (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>), indicating the occurrence of a protein processing error or another non-N-linked oligosaccharide post-translational defect.</p>
<p>Finally, we focused on the inner acrosomal membrane proteins involved in oolemma fusion. IZUMO1 is an N-glycosylated acrosome membrane protein, and the first to be identified as essential for sperm-oolemma fusion using knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). The levels of IZUMO1 decreased in both the testis and sperm of <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Although the amount of IZUMO1 in sperm was less, we did not see any other bands in the western blot analysis. IZUMO1 could relocate to the equatorial segment where fusion occurs after the acrosome reaction in <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> derived spermatozoa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S11</xref>). Equatorin (EQTN) is an O-linked glycosylated protein on the inner acrosomal membrane, not essential for oolemma fusion but rather functions in oolemma binding. The EQTN signal showed no difference between <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> testes, but it disappeared in <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>-/-</sup>-derived sperm. Intriguingly, mass spectrometry analysis of sperm lysates showed comparable quantitative values of EQTN between <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Table S1</xref>). With the fact that the anti-EQTN antibody MN9 recognizes both peptide and glycan structures and that the glycan structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>), our data suggests that EQTN glycosylation is aberrant in <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>-/-</sup>-derived sperm. SPACA6 is known to be lost from all the sperm-oolemma fusion defective sperm (i.e., <italic>Dcst1/2, Fimp, Izumo1, Sof1, Spaca6</italic>, and <italic>Tmem95</italic> knockout models) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>); however, we did not see any difference in the intensity and band pattern using western blot analysis.</p>

<p>To analyze the protein glycosylation status during spermatogenesis, we performed lectin blot analyses using testis lysates (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7A</xref>). The band patterns of concanavalin A (ConA; detecting mannose), <italic>Aleuria aurantia</italic> lectin (AAL; detecting fucose), and <italic>Maackia amurensis</italic> II (MAL-II; detecting sialic acid + core1 structure) were comparable between <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> samples. Notably, with PNA, which detects galactose Î²1-3 acetyl galactosamine (core 1 structure), the intensity of a band around 60 kDa increased in <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> testis. As PNA binding is known to be inhibited by any galactose modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>), the core 1 modifications might be disrupted in the target protein. With <italic>Laetiporus sulphureus</italic> lectin N-terminal domain (LSL-N; detecting LacNAc: galactose-GlcNAc), signal intensities for small proteins decreased. Intriguingly, the difference became evident when we performed lectin blot analysis using mature spermatozoa.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we identified SLC35G3 as a testis-specific UDP-GlcNAc transporter to underpin proper sperm glycoprotein synthesis and functions. Although <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> male mice are viable, healthy, and produce motile sperm, they are completely infertile, revealing a critical and unique role of SLC35G3 for producing functional spermatozoa and male fertility. In vitro studies further implicated latent male infertility due to <italic>SLC35G3</italic> mutations.</p>
<p>During spermatogenesis, <italic>Slc35b4</italic> is expressed in earlier stages, but it decreases and is replaced by <italic>Slc35g3</italic> in later stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S1</xref>). The reason for the stage-dependent usage of two transporters is unknown, but it may be related to the formation of acrosomes, which are rich in glycosylated proteins, in the later stages of spermatogenesis. Although our in vitro data showed no clear differences (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7C</xref>), SLC35B4 and SLC35G3 may have different activities and/or functions. Alternatively, SLC35G3 may have a lower optimal temperature because spermatogenesis progresses at a lower temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). Considering the transcript level of <italic>Slc35g3</italic> in later spermatogenesis stages (highest TPM=320 at round spermatid) is higher than that of <italic>Slc35b4</italic> in the earlier stage (highest TPM=21 at spermatogonia), spermatids may simply require more UDP-GlcNAc transporter activity. Further in vitro and in vivo studies will be needed to answer these questions, including transgenic mice expressing <italic>Slc35b4</italic> under the <italic>Slc35g3</italic> promoter and vice versa. The answer will also help us to understand why and how spermatogenic cells require a certain number of paralogous genes to be expressed specifically.</p>
<p>Lectin blot analyses revealed no differences in ConA signals targeting terminal mannose (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>), indicating the normal formation of high-mannose-type oligosaccharides for N-glycan biosynthesis in the ER of <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> spermatogenic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). For O-glycans, there was an increase in PNA signals (core 1, Gal-GalNAc) and a reduction in LSL-N signals (LacNAc: Gal-GlcNAc), while no changes were observed for MAL-II (sialic acid) and AAL (fucose). These findings suggest that SLC35G3 plays a more important role in glycan elongation rather than core structure, and the impaired elongated glycan structure affected the properties of glycoproteins and following sperm morphology and functions in <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice.</p>
<p>While spermatogenesis looked grossly normal in <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D, 2E</xref>, and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S6</xref>), their spermatozoa displayed multiple phenotypic abnormalities in head morphology (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), UTJ migration (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), and fertilization (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Regarding sperm head malformation, while globozoospermia results in male infertility (e.g., <italic>Zpbp1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>), <italic>Gopc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>), and <italic>Spaca1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>) knockout mice), most of the knockout mice with only subtle head malformation can produce offspring, although at lower levels (e.g., <italic>Zpbp2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>), <italic>Fam71f2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>), and <italic>Garin2-Garin5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>) knockout mice). We found a subtle sperm head malformation in <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, but it should not be underestimated. For example, it has been shown that mutations in multiple genes synergistically worsen head morphology, even in the heterozygous state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Although we are still far from unraveling these molecular interactions, we have revealed the importance of SLC35G3-mediated UDP-GlcNAc transport for ZPBP1 stabilization and SPACA1 processing. While these proteins are also found in humans, it is still too early to infer the importance of SLC35G3 in the morphogenesis of human sperm heads. Observing sperm samples from individuals with SLC35G3 mutations would be the most direct approach to address this, and we consider it an important objective for future studies.</p>
<p><italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>-/-</sup>-derived spermatozoa exhibited defective UTJ passage (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) and ZP binding (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). These defects are commonly linked and observed in many infertile knockout mice, and ADAM3 is absent from most of these knockout spermatozoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). However, ADAM3 is present in the <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>-/-</sup>-derived spermatozoa as in four other knockout mouse lines that show the same phenotype (i.e., <italic>Ly6k, Pgap1, Spaca4</italic>, and <italic>Lypd4</italic> knockout lines). These results suggest that ADAM3 may be dysfunctional in these mutant sperm, or that there may be an unknown factor responsible for UTJ passage and ZP binding. Because LY6K and PGAP1 only function in the testis and disappear from mature spermatozoa, we analyzed the presence of LYPD4 and SPACA4 in mature spermatozoa and found that there was abnormal processing of LYPD4 in <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>-/-</sup>-derived spermatozoa (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>) compared to WT sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Since ADAM3 is no longer active in humans, more attention needs to be paid to LYPD4 to understand the sperm fertilizing ability.</p>
<p>We next focused on the inner acrosomal membrane proteins because <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> derived spermatozoa were defective in fusing with oocytes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D, 6E</xref>). While we did not see any differences in SPACA6 western blot analysis, we found a decrease in IZUMO1 in <italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>-/-</sup>-derived spermatozoa, which is consistent with our previous study showing the lack of glycosylation accompanied by a decrease in IZUMO1 levels and a reduction in the number of pups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Intriguingly, while EQTN was detected by MS analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Table S1</xref>), signals disappeared in our western blot analysis using an antibody recognizing EQTN O-glycans (37; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>), suggesting the presence of EQTN protein without O-glycans. As <italic>Eqtn</italic> knockout spermatozoa decreased their oolemma binding ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>), EQTN glycans may directly contribute to oolemma binding. These results suggest that SLC35G3 regulates sperm-oolemma fusion through O-linked glycosylation of inner acrosomal membrane proteins.</p>
<p>Finally, we examined mutations in human <italic>SLC35G3</italic> for their potential risk of male infertility. An in vitro study revealed that the T179HfsTer27 (17-35193772-GT-G) mutation lost sugar-nucleotide transporter activity. According to gnomAD, its frequency is 1.88 Ã 10<sup>-3,</sup> and 54 individuals have been identified as homozygous. In addition, the observed/expected ratio of single-nucleotide variants causing loss of function was 0.53, suggesting the presence of selective pressure due to mutations. Assessment of their sperm fertilizing ability would be beneficial to understanding glycosylated protein synthesis and functions in human spermatozoa. Even if the mutation caused male infertility, as we obtained healthy offspring by IVF with higher concentration sperm insemination, intracytoplasmic sperm injection might not be necessary for their treatment.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our research suggests that SLC35G3 functions as a testis-specific UDP-GlcNAc transporter during late spermatogenesis. We reaffirmed that glycosylation-related genes specific to the testis play a crucial role in the synthesis, quality control, and function of glycoproteins on sperm, which are essential for male fertility through their interactions with eggs and the female reproductive system. Furthermore, we demonstrated that human SLC35G3 also exhibits transporter activity, and proposed a loss-of-function mutation that may cause male infertility. Further research on this gene and sperm glycoprotein synthesis has the potential to contribute to understanding the causes of male infertility, developing treatments, and advancing contraceptive methods.</p>

<title>Experimental design</title>
<p>In this study, we developed an integrated approach, combining <italic>in silico</italic> analysis with experimental techniques, to elucidate the functions of SLC35G3. To generate <italic>Slc35g3</italic> knockout (<italic>Slc35g3</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) male mice, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system and conducted <italic>in silico</italic> analysis for off-target/cleavage activity. Male fertility assessment encompasses mating with females, alongside IVF assays. Based on the preliminary literature on the SLC35 family, SLC35G3 is hypothesized to be a nucleotide sugar transporter. Therefore, we performed lectin blot analysis using tissue lysate/HEK293T cell lysate.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study reports the physiological function of a putative transmembrane UDP-N-acetylglucosamine transporter called SLC35G3 in spermatogenesis. The conclusion that SLC35G3 is a new and essential factor for male fertility in mice and probably in humans is supported by <bold>convincing</bold> data. This study will be of interest to reproductive biologists and physicians working on male infertility.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study characterized the function of SLC35G3, a putative transmembrane UDP-N-acetylglucosamine transporter, in spermatogenesis. They showed that SLC35G3 is testis-specific and expressed in round spermatids. Slc35g3-null males were sterile but females were fertile. Slc35g3-null males produced normal sperm count but sperm showed subtle head morphology. Sperm from Slc35g3-null males have defects in uterotubal junction passage, ZP binding, and oocyte fusion. Loss of SLC35G3 causes abnormal processing and glycosylation of a number sperm proteins in testis and sperm. They demonstrated that SLC35G3 functions as a UDP-GlcNAc transporter in cell lines. Two human SLC35G3 variants impaired its transporter activity, implicating these variants in human infertility.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study is thorough. The mutant phenotype is strong and interesting. The major conclusions are supported by the data. This study demonstrated SLC35G3 as a new and essential factor for male fertility in mice, which is likely conserved in humans.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Some data interpretations needed to be revised. These have been adequately addressed in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the present manuscript, Mashiko and colleagues describe a novel phenotype associated with deficient SLC35G3, a testis-specific sugar transporter that is important in glycosylation of key proteins in sperm function. The study characterizes a knockout mouse for this gene and the multifaceted male infertility that ensues. The manuscript is well-written and describes novel physiology through a broad set of appropriate assays.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Robust analysis with detailed functional and molecular assays</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The abstract references reported mutations in human SLC35G3, but this is not discussed or correlated to the murine findings to a sufficient degree in the manuscript. The HEK293T experiments are reasonable and add value, but a more detailed discussion of the clinical phenotype of the known mutations in this gene and whether they are recapitulated in this study (or not) would be beneficial.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Since no patients have been identified, our experiment was conducted to investigate the activity of the mutation found in humans.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Can the authors expand on how this mutation causes such a wide array of phenotypic defects? I am surprised there is a morphological defect, a fertilization defect, and a transit defect. Do the authors believe all of these are present in humans as well?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. There are many glycoprotein-coding genes that influence sperm head morphology, fertilization defect, and transit defect have been identified in knockout mouse studies, and most of these are conserved in humans. Therefore, we believe that glycan modification by SLC35G3 is also involved in the regulation of human sperm.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Some data interpretations need to be revised.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for comments. We revised interpretations.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The introduction could be structured more efficiently. Much of what is discussed in the first paragraph appears to be redundant to the second paragraph (or perhaps unrelated to the present manuscript).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the Introduction, we described the process of glycoprotein formation, 1) quality control or nascent glycoproteins in the ER and its relations importance in sperm fertilizing ability, 2) glycan maturation in the Golgi apparatus and its importance in sperm fertilizing ability, and 3) the supply of nucleotide sugars as the basis of these processes.</p>
<p>We would like to retain this structure in the revised manuscript and appreciate your understanding.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Given the significant difference in morphology between murine and human sperm, can the authors comment on whether these findings are directly translatable to humans?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. There are significant differences in sperm morphology between mice and humans, but many glycoprotein-coding genes that influence sperm head morphology have been identified in knockout mouse studies, and most of these are conserved in humans. Therefore, we believe that glycan modification by SLC35G3 is also involved in the regulation of human sperm head morphology. Observing sperm samples from individuals with SLC35G3 mutations is the most direct approach to verify this point and is considered an important goal for future research. The following text has been added to clarify the point:</p>
<p>New Line 338; While these proteins are also found in humans, it is still too early to infer the importance of SLC35G3 in the morphogenesis of human sperm heads. Observing sperm samples from individuals with SLC35G3 mutations would be the most direct approach to address this, and we consider it an important objective for future studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Line 194 - while the inability to pass the UTJ may indeed be a component of this infertility phenotype, I would argue that a complete lack of ability to fertilize (even with IVF but not ICSI) suggests that the primary defect is elsewhere. This statement should be removed, and the topic of these two separate mechanisms should be compared/contrasted in the discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that this is an overstatement, so we changed it;</p>
<p>New line 187; Thus, the defective UTJ migration is one of the primary causes of Slc35g3-/- male infertility.</p>
<p>We believe the current statement in the discussion can stay as it is.</p>
<p>Line 379; We reaffirmed that glycosylation-related genes specific to the testis play a crucial role in the synthesis, quality control, and function of glycoproteins on sperm, which are essential for male fertility through their interactions with eggs and the female reproductive system.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Did the authors consider performing TEM to assess the sperm ultrastructure and the acrosome?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Since morphological abnormalities were evident even at the macro level, TEM was not performed in this study. In the future, we plan to use immune-TEM against affected/non-affected glycoproteins when the antibodies become available.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) I would argue that Figure 3 should not be labeled as &quot;essential&quot;, given the abnormal sperm head morphology compared to humans, the relatively modest difference between the groups on PCA, and more broadly speaking, the relatively poor correlation with morphology and human male infertility. While globozoospermia is clearly an exception, the data in this figure may not translate to human sperm and/or may not be clinically relevant even if it does.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, other KO spermatozoa with similar morphological features are known to cause a reduction in litter size but do not result in complete infertility. As discussed in line 1, this head shape is not essential for fertilization. Reviewer 2 also pointed out that the phrase &quot;Slc35g3 is essential for sperm head formation&quot; is too strong; therefore, we would like to revise Fig3 title to &quot;Slc35g3 is involved in the regulation of sperm head morphology.&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Have the authors generated slc35b4 KO mice?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>No, we did not. Since Slc35b4 is expressed throughout the body, a straight knockout may affect other organs or developmental processes. To investigate its role specifically in the testis, it will be necessary to generate a conditional knockout (cKO) model. As this requires considerable cost, time, and labor, we would like to leave it for future investigation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Lines 122-123: &quot;it is prominently expressed in the testis, beginning 21 days postpartum (Figure 1B), suggesting expression from the secondary spermatocyte stage to the round spermatid stage in mice.&quot; Day 21 indicates the first appearance of round spermatids, but not secondary spermatocytes. Please change to the following: ...suggesting that its expression begins in round spermatids in mice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>I agree with your comment and have revised the text accordingly (New line 114).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Figure 1E: What germ cells are they? The type of germ cells needs to be labelled on the image. Double staining with a germ cell marker would be helpful to distinguish germ cells from testicular somatic cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. We replaced the Figure 1E as follows.</p>
<p>To distinguish germ cells from testicular somatic cells, we used the germ cell marker TRA98 antibody. Furthermore, based on the nuclear and GM130 staining pattern, we consider that the Golgi apparatus of round spermatids is labeled.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Figure 2C: The most abundant WB band is between 20 and 25 kD and is non-specific. Does the arrow point to the expected SLC35G3 band? There are two minor bands above the main non-specific band. Are both bands specific to SLC35G3? Given the strong non-specific band on WB, how specific is the immunofluorescence signal produced by this antibody? These need to be explained and discussed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The arrow pointed to the expected size (35kDa).</p>
<p>We thought that these non-specific bands could be due to blood contamination, so we retried with testicular germ cells. We confirmed that non-specific bands disappeared in the subsequent Western blot analysis. The specificity of the immunofluorescence signal is supported by its complete absence in the KO, as shown in the Supplementary Figures. We have decided to include this improved dataset. Thank you for your comment, which helped us improve the data.</p>

<p>(4) Line 184: &quot;Slc35g3-/--derived sperm have defects in ZP binding and oolemma fusion ability, but genomic integrity is intact.&quot; Producing viable offspring does not necessarily mean that genomic integrity is intact. Suggestion: Slc35g3-/--derived sperm have defects in ZP binding and oolemma fusion ability but produce viable offspring. Likewise, the Figure S9 caption also needs to be changed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your constructive comment. We have revised the text as you suggested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Figure 3. &quot;Slc35g3 is essential for sperm head formation&quot;. This statement is too strong. It is not essential for sperm head formation. The sperm head is still formed, but shows subtle deformation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. We changed as follows:</p>
<p>FIg.3; âSlc35g3 is involved in the regulation of sperm head morphology.â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Lines 204-205: Figure 6B: &quot;Interestingly, some bands of sperm acrosome-associated 1 (SPACA1; 26) disappeared in Slc35g3-/- testis lysates.&quot; I don't see the absence of SPACA1 bands in -/- testis. This needs to be clearly labeled with arrows. On the contrary, the bands are stronger in Slc35g3-/- testis lysates.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. After carefully considering your comments, we concluded that using &quot;disappeared&quot; is indeed inappropriate. We would like to revise the sentence as follows: New line 197; &quot;Interestingly, SPACA1 (Sperm Acrosome Associated 1; 26) exhibited a subtle difference in banding pattern in the Slc35g3-/- testis lysate.&quot;</p>
