<title>Abstract</title><p>In tumors with WT p53, alternate mechanisms of p53 inactivation are reported. Here, we have identified a long noncoding RNA, PITAR (<italic>p</italic>53 <italic>I</italic>nactivating <italic>T</italic>RIM28 <italic>a</italic>ssociated <italic>R</italic>NA), as an inhibitor of p53. PITAR is an oncogenic Cancer/testis lncRNA and is highly expressed in glioblastoma (GBM) and glioma stem-like cells (GSC). We establish that TRIM28 mRNA, which encodes a p53-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase, is a direct target of PITAR. PITAR interaction with TRIM28 RNA stabilized TRIM28 mRNA, which resulted in increased TRIM28 protein levels and reduced p53 steady-state levels due to enhanced p53 ubiquitination. DNA damage activated PITAR, in addition to p53, in a p53-independent manner, thus creating an incoherent feedforward loop to inhibit the DNA damage response by p53. While PITAR silencing inhibited the growth of WT p53 containing GSCs in vitro and reduced glioma tumor growth in vivo, its overexpression enhanced the tumor growth in a TRIM28-dependent manner and promoted resistance to Temozolomide. Thus, we establish an alternate way of p53 inactivation by PITAR, which maintains low p53 levels in normal cells and attenuates the DNA damage response by p53. Finally, we propose PITAR as a potential GBM therapeutic target.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>We have made several additions in the form of new experiments to address all concerns raised both reviewers and are described below:
1) Two siRNAs are used (Figure 2, 5 and supplementary Figure 2).
2) A better quality p53 ubiquitination western blot is provided (Figure 5F).
3) We show that PITAR overexpression is unable to inhibit p53 in TRIM28 silenced conditions (Figure 5K, L, M, N and supplementary Figure 5F and G)
4) The impact of PITAR silencing and overexpression on p53 is shown in two cell lines (supplementary Figure 5)
5) We show that the tumor growth-promoting functions of overexpressed PITAR is compromised in TRIM28 silenced cells(Figure 7H, I and supplementary Figure 9C).
6) We established a firm connection between DNA damage induced PITAR (in a p53 independent manner) and DNA damage response of p53. Essentially, we show that DNA-damage response of p53 is enhanced in PITAR silenced conditionsdue to the fact the TRIM28 mediated degradation of p53 will be absent (supplementary Figure 8E, F, G and H).

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Much of the human genome once considered as âjunk DNAâ is now shown to be pervasively transcribed into thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Accumulated evidence over the last two decades implicated lncRNA in fundamental biological processes that play an essential role in several pathological conditions like cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Djebali <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Slack and Chinnaiyan, 2019a</xref>). LncRNA constitutes a major subset among ncRNAs and is arbitrarily defined as transcripts of longer than 500 bps, which are spliced, 5â capped, and poorly conserved across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cabili <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Derrien <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Iyer <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mattick <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). LncRNAs function through multiple mechanisms, such as their specific interactions with DNA, RNA, and proteins, that can modulate chromatin structure, regulate the assembly and function of membrane-less bodies, alter the stability and translation of mRNAs and interfere with their signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Statello <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>The tumor suppressor protein p53 plays an important role in preserving genome integrity and inhibiting malignant transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Levine, 1997</xref>). p53, which gets activated in response to stress like DNA damage, activates the transcription of many protein coding genes that control several cellular processes like cell cycle, programmed cell death, and senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Riley <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Beckerman and Prives, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bieging and Attardi, 2012</xref>). p53 is mutated in more than 50% of human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Vogelstein, Lane and Levine, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Vousden and Lane, 2007</xref>). In cancers that do not carry mutations in p53, the inactivation occurs through other genetic or epigenetic alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Olivier <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Vousden and Lu, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mitra <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>LncRNAs have been shown to play an important role in the p53 network. While several lncRNAs such as LincRNA-p21, DINO, PANDA, LINC-PANT, GUARDIN, NEAT1, NBAT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mitra <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>), and PVT1 are shown to function as downstream effectors of p53, other lncRNA like MEG3, MALAT1, H19, Linc-ROR, and PSTAR act as upstream regulators of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jain, 2020</xref>). Our study identified a lncRNA called <italic>p</italic>53 <italic>I</italic>nactivating <italic>T</italic>RIM28 <italic>a</italic>ssociated <italic>R</italic>NA (PITAR) as a p53 inactivator with a protumorigenic function. PITAR is highly expressed in glioblastoma (GBM) and glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) and interacts with TRIM28 mRNA, which encodes a p53-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase. TRIM28 inhibits p53 through HDAC1-mediated deacetylation and direct ubiquitination in an MDM2-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2005a</xref>). PITAR-TRIM28 interaction stabilized TRIM28 mRNA resulting in higher levels of TRIM28 protein that promoted ubiquitin-mediated degradation of p53. We also found that PITAR is essential for glioma tumor growth, and PITAR is induced by DNA damage in a p53-independent manner. Thus, our study discovered PITAR as an inhibitor of p53 via a unique mechanism of interaction with TRIM28 mRNA and a potential target for developing novel therapy.</p>

<title>Identification of FAM95B1/PITAR, a conserved cancer/testis lncRNA that promotes cell proliferation in GBM</title>
<p>In a recent study involving our groupâs transcriptional profiling of mRNAs and lncRNAs, we identified several GBM-specific clinically relevant lncRNA regulatory networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Paul <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). To identify GBM-associated lncRNAs with functional relevance to glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) biology, we integrated the differentially regulated RNAs (DEGs) from GBM vs control brain samples (TCGA) (Supplementary Table 1) with DEGs from GSC vs differentiated glioma cells (DGCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">SuvÃ  <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The GBM and GSC integrated analysis revealed three interesting lncRNA PVT1, H19, and FAM95B1, showing significant upregulation in both GBM and GSCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Of the three GBM and GSC-specific regulated lncRNAs, PVT1 and H19 have been extensively investigated for their role in cancer development and progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Xue <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Azab and Azzam, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lv <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>), whereas FAM95B1 (ENSG00000223839.7, NONHSAG052279.2, Lnc-ANKRD20A3-51) has not been explored for its role in cancer. We have named the FAM95B1 lncRNA as PITAR (<bold><italic>p</italic></bold>53 <bold><italic>i</italic></bold>nactivating <bold><italic>T</italic></bold>RIM28-<bold><italic>a</italic></bold>ssociated lnc<bold><italic>R</italic></bold>NA) as we found it has a strong functional association with the well-known tumor suppressor gene p53.</p>

<p>PITAR is significantly upregulated in multiple GBM cohorts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-E</xref>) and patient-derived GSCs, (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F and G</xref>). The PITAR transcript also showed a one-to-one significant negative correlation between GSCs, and DGCs (Supplementary figure 1A). PITAR promoter harbored active histone marks (H3k27Ac) in GSCs but not in DGCs (Supplementary figure 1B); thus, H3K27ac levels at the PITAR promoter in GSCs correlate with its expression status. Additional independent validation confirmed its higher expression in multiple glioma cell lines compared to immortalized astrocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>) and in multiple patient-derived GSC lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). Pan cancer data analysis revealed specific upregulation of PITAR in GBM and low-grade glioma (LGG) except in neuroendocrine tumor Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma (PCPG) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>). Further, the interrogation of the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) of normal tissues revealed a highly tissue-restricted expression of PITAR in the testis, thus resembling the expression properties of a cancer-testis antigen (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1K</xref>).</p>
<p>PITAR, located in human chromosome 9, has a 4236-nucleotide-long transcript (Transcript: ENST00000455995.5) with four exons (Supplementary Figure 2A). The noncoding nature of PITAR was confirmed by the Coding Potential Assessing Tool (CPAT) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/orffinder/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/orffinder/</ext-link>; data not shown). The subcellular localization by fractionation followed by RT-qPCR identified that PITAR is primarily located in the nucleus (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Similarly, the RNA In situ hybridization using RNAScope technology revealed that PITAR is located 80% in the nucleus (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). PITAR silencing by two different siRNAs, # 1 and # 2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), reduced cell proliferation, viable cell count, colony formation, arrested cells in G0/G1 phase, and induced apoptosis in U87 glioma cell line (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D, E, F, G, and H</xref>). PITAR silencing in U343 glioma cells also showed similar results (Supplementary Figure 2B, C, D, E, and F). Further, PITAR silencing showed more sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, Adriamycin, and Temozolomide (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). Interestingly, PITAR silencing did not affect the viable cell count in immortalized astrocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>). Overall, PITAR is a cancer-testis lncRNA that displays GBM and GSC-specific higher expression. We also demonstrate that PITAR promotes the growth of glioma cells and confers resistance to DNA-damaging agents.</p>

<title>TRIM28 (Tripartite Motif Containing 28) mRNA is the direct target of PITAR</title>
<p>To identify PITAR interacting RNAs, we carried out an integrated analysis of RNA-Seq data from Chromatin Isolation by RNA Purification (ChIRP), performed using biotinylated PITAR-specific antisense probes and RNA-Seq data of PITAR silenced glioma cells. ChIRP was carried out using an odd (n=7) and even (n=7) set of biotinylated PITAR-specific antisense probes (Supplementary Figure 2A). RNA-Seq data of ChIRP RNA and further independent validation of ChIRP RNA with RT-qPCR showed an efficient pulldown of PITAR by both odd and even probes compared to LacZ (Control) probes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A and B</xref>). The ChIRP data demonstrated that 827 mRNAs were enriched in the pulldowns using even and odd antisense probes compared to LacZ probes (Supplementary Table 2). To choose the physiologically relevant target(s) for further studies, we intersected the ChIRP RNAs with i) GBM-associated differentially expressed transcripts that show a significant positive correlation (p &lt;0.05 and r &gt; 0.25) with PITAR transcript (Supplementary Table 3), ii) GBM upregulated transcripts (Supplementary Table 4), and iii) GSC upregulated transcripts (Supplementary Table 5). This analysis identified 15 transcripts as potential targets of PITAR (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C, D</xref>). Parallelly, RNA-Seq data of PITAR silenced U87 cells identified 946 differentially regulated genes (526 upregulated and 420 downregulated) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>; Supplementary Table 6). Gene ontology analysis of DEGs showed significant enrichment of biological processes such as âcell cycle,â âapoptosis,â and âp53â (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Furthermore, the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showed significant enrichment of p53-regulated gene networks (Supplementary Table 7; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>), indicating that PITAR executes its functions by interfering with p53 functions.</p>

<p>To explore the functional role of PITAR in p53-dependent gene expression, we chose TRIM28 among the ChIRP targets considering its role as p53-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2005b</xref>). TRIM28, also known as KAP1 (KrÃ¼ppel-Associated Box (KRAB)-Associated Protein 1), is a multidomain protein involved in various biological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">CzerwiÅska, Mazurek and Wiznerowicz, 2017</xref>). TRIM28 inhibits p53 through HDAC1-mediated deacetylation and direct ubiquitination in an MDM2-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2005a</xref>). RNA-Seq data of the ChIRP assay showed a specific pulldown of TRIM28 mRNA by PITAR-specific odd and even antisense probes compared to LacZ probes (Supplementary Figure 3A). TRIM28 is significantly upregulated in multiple GBM cohorts (Supplementary Figure 4A, B, C, D, and E). Consistent with the ChIRP data, TRIM28 and PITAR transcripts showed a significant positive correlation in all GBM cohorts (Supplementary Figure 4F, G, H, I, and J). Like PITAR, the TRIM28 transcript is also expressed at higher levels in GSCs (Supplementary Figure 4K), with a significant positive correlation between their expression in GSCs (Supplementary Figure 4L). Further, TRIM28 protein showed higher levels in GBM as measured by quantitative proteomics data from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) and immunohistochemistry from the Protein atlas (Supplementary Figure 4M and N).</p>
<p>Next, we investigated the specificity and impact of the interaction between PITAR and TRIM28 transcripts. Independent validation of ChIRP RNA with RT-qPCR showed an efficient pulldown of PITAR by PITAR-specific probes compared to LacZ (Control) probes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Noncoding RNAs interact with target mRNAs through direct or indirect RNA-RNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Faghihi <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gong and Maquat, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kretz <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Engreitz <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mahale <italic>et al</italic>., 2022a</xref>). Enrichment of TRIM28 mRNA in the PITAR ChIRP pull-down indicates the presence of potential TRIM28 mRNA: PITAR lncRNA interactions. Hence, we checked for the possible direct interaction between PITAR and TIRM28 by performing an RNA-RNA interaction analysis using the IntaRNA tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/IntaRNA/Input.jsp">http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/IntaRNA/Input.jsp</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mann, Wright and Backofen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gawronski <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). This analysis identified the most energetically favorable 80 bp interacting region between the 3â UTR of the TRIM28 transcript and the first exon of PITAR (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>; Supplementary Table 8). Next, we performed multiplexed RNAScope in U87 cells to evaluate the interaction between PITAR and TRIM28 in the cellular environment. The co-staining of U87 cells for TRIM28 transcript with the PITAR or PDE2A and PITAR with PDE2A demonstrated a specific colocalization of PITAR and TRIM28 transcripts, mainly in the nucleus. The extent of colocalization was much greater than that expected from coincidental colocalization with a similar abundant transcript, such as PDE2A (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure. 4C</xref>; Supplementary Figure 3C).</p>

<p>To further confirm the interaction between PITAR and TRIM28, we cloned the first exon under the CMV promoter (PITAR OE) for exogenous overexpression and in vitro synthesis of biotin-labeled sense PITAR RNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). First, we checked the ability of biotin-labeled PITAR sense RNA (corresponding to the first exon made from the PITAR OE construct) to bring down the TRIM28 mRNA from total RNA. PITAR-specific sense, but not antisense, biotinylated RNA brought down TRIM28 RNA efficiently (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>, compare bar four with three). PITAR sense RNA with a deletion of the 80 bp interacting region failed to bring down TRIM28 RNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>, compare bar five with four). The control biotin-labeled RNA (FLuc) and bead control did not bring down TRIM28 mRNA as expected. Further, we performed an antisense oligo-blocking experiment to validate the TRIM28 binding site on PITAR. Preincubation of fragmented total RNA with unlabelled PITAR antisense probe # 3, which is located close to the TRIM28 binding region on the exon 1 of PITAR, inhibited the ability of PITAR biotinylated antisense (odd) probe set to bring down TRIM28 (Supplementary Figure 3B). Next, we tested the ability of PITAR to regulate luciferase activity from the TRIM28-3âUTR-Luc construct (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). The exogenous overexpression of PITAR (PITAR OE), but not PITAR with a deletion of 1303-1381 nucleotides (ÎPITAR OE), significantly increased the luciferase activity from the TRIM28-3âUTR-Luc construct (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>, compare bars two and three with one). In contrast, PITAR silencing significantly decreased the luciferase activity from TRIM28-3âUTR-Luc but was rescued by the exogenous overexpression of PITAR (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>, compare bar two with one or four). In contrast, the ability of PITAR exogenous overexpression to increase the luciferase activity from the ÎTRIM28-3âUTR-Luc construct, which has a deletion of 80 bp region corresponding to the PITAR binding region, is significantly reduced (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>, compare bar four with two). Next, to study the impact of PITAR interaction on TRIM28 expression, we measured TRIM28 transcript and protein levels in PITAR-silenced conditions. PITAR silencing significantly reduced TRIM28 mRNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>, compare bar four with three) and protein levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>, compare lane two with one). In actinomycin-treated U87 glioma cells, PITAR silencing reduced the TRIM28 mRNA half-life significantly compared with control cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>, compare red line with blue line). From these results, we conclude that PITAR interaction stabilizes TRIM28 mRNA to promote TRIM28 expression.</p>

<title>PITAR inhibits p53 protein levels by its association with TRIM28 mRNA</title>
<p>TRIM28 inhibits p53 through HDAC1-mediated deacetylation and direct ubiquitination in an Mdm2-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2005a</xref>). We next investigated the impact of PITAR interaction with TRIM28 on p53. PITAR silencing in U87 glioma cells increased the luciferase activity from PG13-Luc, a p53-dependent reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">El-Deiry <italic>et al</italic>., 1993</xref>) (Supplementary Figure 5A), decreased PITAR and TRIM28 mRNA levels, and increased CDKN1A mRNA levels with no change in p53 mRNA levels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). At the protein level, PITAR silencing decreased TRIM28 levels but increased p53 and CDKN1A levels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, compare lanes two and three with one). PITAR silencing in U343 cells also showed similar results (Supplementary figure 5B and C). In contrast, exogenous PITAR overexpression increased PITAR and TRIM28 mRNA levels and reduced CDKN1A mRNA levels without changing p53 mRNA levels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Further, exogenous PITAR overexpression increased TRIM28 protein levels but decreased p53 and CDKN1A protein levels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>, compare lane two with one), thus indicating that PITAR reduces p53 protein levels by regulating TRIM28. PITAR overexpression in U343 cells also showed similar results (Supplementary Figure 5D, and E). In cycloheximide-treated U87 glioma cells, the half-life of p53 increased (1.20 hr) under PITAR silenced conditions compared to control cells (0.50 hr) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). In good correlation, PITAR overexpression increased the ubiquitinated p53 levels in MG132-treated U87 glioma cells compared to the control condition (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>, compare lane four with three).</p>

<p>To confirm that TRIM28 mediates PITAR regulation of p53, we checked the ability of exogenously overexpressed TRIM28 (using a 3âUTRless TRIM28 construct) to rescue the phenotype in PITAR-silenced cells. TRIM28 overexpression resulted in a several-fold increase in TRIM28 mRNA levels in U87/siNT cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>, compare bar three with one). While this increase was significantly affected by PITAR silencing, the TRIM28 transcript levels remained high in U87/siPITAR cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>, compare bar four with two). As expected, TRIM28 overexpression did not affect the PITAR mRNA levels in U87/siNT and U87/siPITAR cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>). In TRIM28 overexpressing cells, PITAR silencing failed to increase luciferase activity from PG13-Luc (Supplementary Figure 5F, compare bar four with three) and CDKN1A transcript levels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>, compare bar four with three). More importantly, PITAR silencing failed to increase p53 and CDKN1A protein levels in TRIM28 overexpressing U87 glioma cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref>, compare lane four with three). Next, we tested the ability of PITAR overexpression to inhibit p53 functions in TRIM28 silenced cells. Exogenous overexpression of PITAR failed to increase the TRIM28 in TRIM28 silenced condition (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5K and L</xref>). In addition, exogenous overexpression of PITAR failed to repress luciferase activity from PG13-Luc (Supplementary Figure 5G, compare bar four with three), repress CDKN1A transcript levels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5M</xref>, compare lane four with three), and protein levels of p53 and CDKN1A (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5N</xref>, compare lane four with three) in TIRM28 silenced cells. These results establish that PITAR inhibits p53 through its interaction with TRIM28 mRNA.</p>
<p>Next, we tested the requirement of WT p53 for the growth-promoting functions of PITAR as shown above (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). PITAR silencing inhibited colony formation efficiently in U87/shNT cells but not in U87/shp53#1 (Supplementary Figure 6A, B, and C). As shown before, PITAR silencing significantly increased CDKN1A and MDM2 transcript levels in U87/shNT cells but was compromised significantly in U87/shp53#1 (Supplementary Figure 6D). We also used glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) for this purpose. The ability of RG5, a patient-derived glioma stem cell line containing WT p53 (data not shown), to grow as a neurosphere was investigated in PITAR-silenced and overexpressed conditions. PITAR silencing inhibited the RG5 GSC growth in the neurosphere growth assay and limiting dilution assay (Supplementary Figure 7A, B, C, and D). PITAR silencing resulted in a decrease in PITAR and TRIM28 but an increase in CDKN1A transcript levels (Supplementary Figure 7E). As expected, there was no change in p53 transcript levels (Supplementary Figure 7E). The exogenous overexpression of PITAR promoted the neurosphere growth by RG5 (Supplementary Figure 7F, G, and H) and increased PITAR and TRIM28 transcript levels but decreased the CDKN1A transcript levels with no change in p53 transcript levels (Supplementary Figure 7I). In contrast, the growth of MGG8, a patient-derived glioma stem cell culture containing mutant p53 (data not shown), is not affected by PITAR silencing (Supplementary Figure 7J, K, L, M, and N). We conclude from these results that PITAR growth-promoting functions of glioma cells require wild-type p53.</p>

<title>PITAR is induced by DNA damage in a p53-independent manner, which in turn diminishes the DNA damage response by p53</title>
<p>As p53 is activated by DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Shieh <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>), we investigated the ability of PITAR to inhibit DNA damage-induced p53.

<p>To verify the possible existence of a negative feedback loop between PITAR and p53, we checked the ability of p53, expressed from a recombinant adenovirus, to induce PITAR transcript levels. We found that Ad-p53 induced p53 and CDKN1A mRNA and p53 protein levels compared to the control virus (Ad-GFP) but did not alter the PITAR and TRIM28 transcript levels (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E and F</xref>), thus confirming that neither PITAR nor TRIM28 is the direct target of p53. Interestingly, DNA damage by adriamycin treatment also induced PITAR, TRIM28 transcript, and TRIM28 protein levels besides CDKN1A transcript and protein levels of p53 and CDKN1A (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G and H</xref>). Our results also show that adriamycin treatment induced PITAR and TRIM28 transcript levels efficiently in p53 silenced cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I and J</xref>, compare bar four with three), indicating DNA damage-mediated PITAR induction is p53 independent. Further, PITAR and TRIM28 induction by DNA damage is dependent on ATM/ATR kinase as the pretreatment of glioma cells with CGK733, a small molecule inhibitor of ATM/ATR kinase, prevented the adriamycin-mediated induction of PITAR and TRIM28 transcript levels (Supplementary Figure 8B) and TRIM28 protein level (Supplementary Figure 8C) thus reiterating the importance of ATM/ATR kinases, as previously demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Tibbetts et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cheng and Chen, 2010</xref>), in DNA damage response pathway. Interestingly, the DNA damage-induced TRIM28 transcript upregulation is found to be dependent on PITAR upregulation, as adriamycin failed to induce TRIM28 in PITAR-silenced U87 cells (Figure 6K, compare bar eight with seven). This was further confirmed by the fact that adriamycin-induced luciferase activity from TRIM28 3â-UTR-Luc is inhibited by CGK733 treatment (Supplementary figure 8D, compare bar three with two), suggesting the requirement of PITAR for the TRIM28 transcript upregulation in DNA-damaged cells. These results establish that PITAR is DNA damage-inducible in a p53-independent manner, and it inactivates p53 through its association with TRIM28 mRNA.</p>
<p>The p53-Mdm2 autoregulatory negative feedback loop controls the extent and duration of p53 response upon DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wu <italic>et al</italic>., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Haupt <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kubbutat, Jones and Vousden, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). Since TRIM28 association with Mdm2 contributes to p53 inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">CzerwiÅska, Mazurek and Wiznerowicz, 2017</xref>), we hypothesized that PITAR, through its association with TRIM28 may also contribute to the control of DNA damage response by p53. We tested this possibility by measuring the p53 response in PITAR-silenced cells. U87/siNT and U87/siPITAR#1 cells were exposed to 7 Gy of ionizing radiation, and steady-state levels of p53, Mdm2, and p21 proteins were determined at hourly intervals. In U87/siNT cells, p53 protein peaked around 3 hrs of irradiation, while mdm2 protein peaked at 7 hrs of irradiation, as expected (Supplementary Figure 8E, F, and G; blue line). p21 protein largely followed similar kinetics to that of the Mdm2 protein (Supplementary Figure 8E and H; blue line). In U87/siPITAR#1 cells, while the overall kinetics of p53, Mdm2, and p21 protein were found to be similar in terms of duration, the extent of p53 activation was much stronger (Supplementary Figure 8E, F, G, and H; red line). The levels of mdm2 and p21 proteins followed a similarly strong response in PITAR-silenced cells (Supplementary Figure 8E, F, G, and H; red line). From these results and our above findings, we conclude that DNA damage-induced PITAR diminishes the p53 response to DNA damage.</p>

<title>PITAR promotes glioma tumor growth in a TRIM28-dependent manner and resistance to Temozolomide chemotherapy</title>
<p>To investigate the role of PITAR on tumor growth, we checked the ability of PITAR-silenced U87 glioma cells to form a tumor in an intracranial orthotopic tumor model using NIH nu/nu mice. We found that PITAR silencing (U87/siPITAR) significantly reduced tumor growth (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A, B, and C</xref>; compare blue line with red line) and enhanced mouse survival (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). U87/siPITAR tumors showed reduced TRIM28 staining (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). Next, we investigated the impact of PITAR overexpression on glioma tumor growth and Temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy. U87/PITAR OE cells-initiated tumors grew much faster than U87/VC cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F, and G</xref>; compare red line with blue line; Supplementary Figure 9A), thus confirming that PITAR overexpression promotes tumor growth. While the growth of the tumors formed by U87/VC glioma cells is inhibited substantially by TMZ chemotherapy, U87/PITAR OE tumors showed resistance to TMZ chemotherapy (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F and G</xref>; compare pink line with green line; Supplementary Figure 9A). U87/PITAR OE tumors showed higher TRIM28 and Ki67 (proliferation marker) staining but reduced p21 staining (Supplementary Figure 9B).</p>

<p>To check the importance of TRIM28 in the glioma tumor growth-promoting functions of PITAR, we tested the ability of exogenously expressed PITAR to promote tumor growth in TRIM28-silenced cells. U87/PITAR OE/shNT cells formed a larger tumor compared to U87/VC/shNT cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H and I</xref>; compare red line with blue line). However, U87/PITAR OE/shTRIM28 glioma cells formed significantly smaller tumors compared to U87/PITAR OE/shNT cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H and I</xref>; compare pink line with red line). As expected, small tumors formed by U87/PITAR OE/shTRIM28 glioma cells showed reduced TRIM28 and enhanced p21 staining compared to large tumors formed by U87/PITAR OE/shNT glioma cells (Supplementary Figure 9C). These results demonstrate that PITAR promotes glioma tumor growth in a TRIM28-dependent manner and confers resistance to TMZ chemotherapy.</p>
<p>To further explore the clinical relevance of our findings, we investigated the survival significance of PITAR using the GBM transcriptome datasets. While PITAR and TRIM28 transcripts showed a significant positive correlation in the GBM full cohort and p53 wild-type cohort, there was no significant correlation in the p53 mutant cohort (Supplementary Figure 9D). However, survival analysis by univariate Cox regression revealed that PITAR transcript level predicted survival only in the p53 wild-type GBM cohort but neither in the full nor p53 mutant cohort (Supplementary Figure 9E). The PITAR transcript level was dichotomized on further analysis to elucidate the cut-off in predicting the prognosis. We found that high PITAR transcript levels predicted poor prognosis significantly compared to low PITAR transcript levels in the p53 wild-type cohort (Supplementary Figure 9G). However, the PITAR transcript levels failed to predict survival in full or p53 mutant GBM cohorts (Supplementary Figure 9F and H). These results prove that PITAR promotes tumor growth and therapeutic resistance by inactivating p53 by its association with TRIM28.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Research into cancer for many decades focussed on protein-coding genes. However, recent evolution in RNA-Seq technologies and bioinformatic methods to analyze transcriptome and genome has changed our perception of noncoding RNA (ncRNA) from âjunk RNAsâ to functional regulatory molecules that control various biological processes, such as chromatin remodeling, gene regulation at transcription, post-transcription, and post-translation level, post-translational modifications of proteins, and signal transduction pathways. It appears lncRNAs can influence various macromolecules such as DNA, RNA, and protein to execute specific biological responses and cell fate. Concerning cancer, lncRNAs are critical regulators of cancer and have been shown to influence cancer origin and progression by acting as tumor drivers and/or suppressors in a cancer-specific fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Anastasiadou et al., 2018</xref>; Slack &amp; Chinnaiyan, 2019; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yan &amp; Bu, 2021</xref>). Besides, several lncRNAs are identified as novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Qian, Shi and Luo, 2020</xref>). p53 inactivation is an essential step in cancer development and is associated with therapy resistance. While genetic alteration forms the major mode of p53 inactivation, alternate ways of p53 inactivation, such as amplification of MDM2 and deletion of p19arf, have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Vogelstein, Lane and Levine, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Olivier <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Vousden and Lu, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Vousden and Lane, 2007</xref>). Deregulated lncRNAs that modulate p53 activity positively and negatively have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jain, 2020</xref>). In this study, we discovered that PITAR, an oncogenic lncRNA, inhibits p53 by promoting its ubiquitination through its association with the mRNA of TRIM28 that encodes p53-specific E3 ligase. PITAR is activated by DNA damage in a p53-independent manner suggesting an incoherent feedforward loop.</p>
<p>Several deregulated lncRNAs acting as oncogenes and tumor suppressors in glioma and glioma stem cells have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Paul <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wang and He, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yadav <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). In this study, we identify PITAR as a highly expressed lncRNA in GBM and GSCs and display oncogenic properties. PITAR is primarily located in the nucleus. Its downregulation by RNA interference inhibited glioma cell growth, and colony formation, arrested cells in the G1 phase, induced cell death, and sensitized cells to chemotherapy. An integrated analysis of PITAR-bound targets identified by ChIRP assay and differentially regulated genes in PITAR silenced cells identified PITAR as an inhibitor p53 through its association with the transcript encoding TRIM28.</p>
<p>TRIM28 (KAP1), an E3 ligase, is an MDM2 interacting protein, and it inhibits p53 through HDAC-mediated deacetylation and direct ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">CzerwiÅska et al., 2017</xref>; C. Wang et al., 2005). Our results show TRIM28 transcript is upregulated in GBM, as reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Czerwinska <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Su, Li and Gao, 2018</xref>), and GSCs in multiple datasets. TRIM28 protein was also found to be high in GBM tissue samples. In addition, we found a significant positive correlation between PITAR and TRIM28, suggesting that PITAR expression is likely to promote TRIM28 expression. Our results show that PITAR-dependent TRIM28 expression regulation occurs at the post-transcription level via RNA: RNA interactions, where PITAR interaction with TRIM28 mRNA increases its stability. This interaction between PITAR and TRIM28 was confirmed by colocalization using a multiplexed RNAscope. We further demonstrated that the first exon of PITAR interacts with 3â UTR of TRIM28. Thus, we have comprehensively established that high levels of PITAR in GBM promote TRIM28 expression by binding and stabilizing TRIM28 mRNA. TRIM28 inhibits p53 through its association with MDM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2005a</xref>). Since our results show that PITAR binding to TRIM28 transcript promotes TRIM28 expression, PITAR is expected to inhibit p53. Indeed, our results show that PITAR inhibits both endogenous and DNA damage-induced p53 at the protein level without altering its transcript levels. Increased TRIM28 protein in high PITAR cells increased p53 ubiquitination and reduced p53 acetylation. Thus, we establish PITAR as a bona fide inhibitor of p53 through its association with TRIM28 mRNA.</p>
<p>Several cellular stresses, including DNA damage, hypoxia, and nucleotide deprivation, activate p53. Several lncRNAs have been shown to regulate p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jain, 2020</xref>). LncRNAs such as LOCC572558, NBAT1, MT1JP, PSTAR, and MEG3 are shown to activate p53 using a variety of mechanisms (L. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zhu <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Uroda <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Qin <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mitra <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). In contrast, lncRNAs such as PURPL, MALAT1, H19, and RMRP inhibit p53 (C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). While PITAR is found to inhibit p53 through its interaction with TRIM28 mRNA, we also found that PITAR level is induced by DNA damage in a p53-independent manner. We show further that DNA damage induced PITAR inhibits the p53 response to DNA damage through its interaction with TRIM28 mRNA. Thus, based on our data, we propose a model wherein DNA damage not only activates p53, but it also activates PITAR, with oncogenic properties, to inhibit p53-dependent functions, thus creating an incoherent feedforward mechanism to attenuate the response of p53 to DNA damage and promote oncogenesis and therapy resistance in GBM (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>).</p>

<p>Several oncogenic lncRNAs have been demonstrated as potential therapeutic targets in many cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Anastasiadou, Jacob and Slack, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Slack and Chinnaiyan, 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yan and Bu, 2021</xref>). In GBM, glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) are the main culprits behind highly aggressive GBM progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Visvanathan <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). It has been shown that GSCs alone can initiate glioma tumors in mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">SuvÃ  <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). Cancer/testis (CT) antigens are a family of tumor-associated antigens expressed only in tumors but not in normal tissues except for the testis and placenta. Their tumor-specific expression and strong in vivo immunogenicity made them suitable for tumor-specific immunotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fratta <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gjerstorff, Andersen and Ditzel, 2015</xref>). Because of its high expression in GBM and testis normal tissue, PITAR is identified as CT lncRNA. PITAR silencing efficiently inhibited the growth of glioma cells and GSCs containing WT p53. Intracranial orthotopic mouse model experiments show that PITAR promotes glioma tumor growth and confers resistance to temozolomide chemotherapy. Our study establishes PITAR as an oncogenic CT lncRNA, which promotes oncogenesis by inactivating p53 by interacting with TRIM28 mRNA. Thus it can serve as a potential therapeutic target for GBM.</p>

These studies used the following antibodies: p53, p21, GAPDH, anti-Ub, and TRIM28. To measure the stability of the p53 protein, the cells were treated with Cycloheximide at a final concentration of 50Âµg/ml, and immunoblotting was performed from whole cell lysates.</p>
<p>The endogenous ubiquitination assay was described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fong <italic>et al</italic>., 2018b</xref>). Briefly, we transfect the HA-Ubiquitin in VC/PITAR OE stable U87 cells and performed co-immunoprecipitation with anti p53 antibody to detect the ubiquitination of the p53 protein; MG132 treated and untreated cells were lysed in IP lysis buffer (0.5% NP-40, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA, and 1.5 mM MgCl2 and 20mM Iodoacetamide (IAA)) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail for half an hour on ice. Cell lysates were incubated with protein G-Magnetic beads (Dynabeads Protein G beads) coated with the p53 antibodies overnight at 4Â°C, and then the IP products were washed three times with IP lysis buffer; after that, the proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer, and the eluted protein were run on SDSâPAGE followed by immunoblotting and probed with anti-ubiquitin antibody.</p>

<title>Luciferase reporter assay</title>
<p>Luciferase assays were performed using reporter lysis buffer (Catalog #E3971, Promega, U.S.A) and luciferase assay reagent according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Briefly, plasmids were transfected in the cells plated in 12 well plates. For determining the comparative luciferase activity of PITAR OE/ ÎPITAR OE plasmid was co-transfected with TRIM28 3âUTR luc plasmid/ ÎTRIM28 3âUTR luc plasmid. Cells were harvested after 48h of transfection, and lysates were made. The luciferase assays were performed using a luciferase assay substrate (Catalog #E151A, Promega, U.S.A), and luciferase readings were recorded using a luminometer (Berthold, Germany) using an equal quantity of protein measured by Bradford assay. Ã-Gal assays were performed to normalize the transfection differences of the PG13 Luc assay, and RFP fluorescence intensity was measured to normalize TRIM28 3âUTR Luc activity.</p>

<title>In vitro transcription</title>
<p>The plasmid DNA template is used for in vitro synthesis of biotinylated PITAR/ ÎPITAR sense, antisense, generated by PCR amplification. The forward primer contained the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence, allowing for subsequent in vitro transcription. PCR products were purified using the DNA Gel Extraction Kit (Thermo Fisher), and used as templates for synthesizing biotin-labeled probes. The reaction was carried out using RiboMAXâ¢ Large Scale RNA Production System (T7) (Catalog #P1300, Promega, U.S.A) and biotin-11-UTP (Catalog #AM8451, Invitrogen, U.S.A) as per manufacturerâs instructions. Briefly, 2.5 Âµg of linear template DNA was added, and the reaction was incubated at 37<sup>â¦</sup>C for 1.5 hours. After alcohol precipitation, the RNA was resuspended in 20 Âµl of nuclease-free water. Primers used for amplifying the region from PITAR OE construct with T7 promoter overhang are provided in Supplementary Table 9.</p>

<title>Biotinylated RNA pulldown assay</title>
<p>The in vitro transcribed RNA was treated with DNase (Ambion) and purified with an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Twenty pmol biotinylated RNA (PITAR-Antisense, PITAR-Sense, and ÎPITAR-Sense) was incubated with 1 mg whole lysate prepared from U87 cells in binding buffer [10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, Yeast transfer RNA (50ng/ml) and heparin (5 mg/ml) for 4 hr at 4Â°C. The biotinylated RNA-RNA complexes were pulled down by incubation with Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 4 hr at 4<sup>0</sup>C. After brief centrifugation, bound RNA in the pulldown material was separated by elution followed by the TRI method. Afterward, RNA was converted to cDNA and quantified by using qRT-PCR. In these assays, a nonspecific transcript derived from the T7 promoter-luciferase construct and bead alone was added with lysate as a control for nonspecific binding.</p>

<title>RNAScope</title>
<p>RNAScope in-situ hybridization (ISH) was performed using RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent Kit v2 (Cat. No. 323100) from Advanced Cell Diagnostics (ACD), which was described earlier (Mahale et al., 2022). RNA probes specific to PITAR and TRIM28 were designed by ACDâs made-to-order probes service. Manual RNAScope ISH protocol from Advanced Cell Diagnostics (ACD, 323100-USM) was followed to perform single or double RNA staining. RNAScope manual procedure involved sample fixation, sample pretreatment, subsequent probe hybridization, signal amplification, and ISH signal detection. RNA in-situ (RNAScope) and immunofluorescence imaging were performed on a Zeiss LSM 880 airy scan confocal microscope at the Centre for Cellular Imaging Facility. Most images were captured on 40X or 60X oil immersion objectives with the laser emitting 405, 488, 561, and 670 nM wavelengths, depending on the fluorophores used in the experiments. The 3D reconstruction was performed using Imaris microscopy image analysis software 9.8.2 version.</p>

<title>Fluorescent immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>The FFPE tissue sections (5 Î¼m thick) were de-waxed and rehydrated. Antigen retrieval was performed in a pressure cooker for 20 min in 10 mM Tris with 1 mM EDTA (pH 9). Nonspecific binding was blocked using blocking buffer (PBS (pH 7.4), 3% serum, 1% BSA, and 0.1% Tween) for 60 minutes at room temperature. Sections were then incubated with primary antibodies (Ki67, TRIM28, and p21) diluted in blocking buffer overnight at 4 Â°C. After washing twice with 0.1% PBSâTween, slides were incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa 488 (Thermo Fisher). After washing, sections were incubated with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich) as a counterstaining. The sections were mounted using prolonged antifade glass mounting media (Thermo Fisher). Two investigators examined the slides. The percentage of positive cells was estimated from 0% to 100%. The intensity of staining (intensity score) was judged on an arbitrary scale of 0â4: no staining (0), weakly positive staining (1), moderately positive staining (2), strongly positive staining (3), and very strong positive staining (4). An immunoreactive score was derived by multiplying the percentage of positive cells with staining intensity divided by 10.</p>

<p>The authors characterized a new non-coding RNA, which they named as PITAR. They first showed that the PITAR expression levels are higher in glioblastoma, and then demonstrated that knockdown of PITAR in glioblastoma cells decreased cell growth, induced G0/G1 arrest and apoptosis. They further identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM28 is the target of PITAR, and showed that PITAR bound to the TRIM28 mRNA and regulated the stability and expression of the latter. Since TRIM28 has been reported to be an E3 ubiquitin ligase for the tumor suppressor p53, the authors tried to link the PITAR function to p53 regulation. They showed that one PITAR siRNA increased the levels of p53 and p21, and the stability of p53, and these effects could be diminished by overexpression of TRIM28. They also showed that PITAR overexpression decreased the levels of adriamycin-induced p53/p21 expression and reversed DNA damage-induced G2/M arrest. Lastly, the authors showed that PITAR siRNA decreased the growth of glioblastoma, while PITAR overexpression increased glioblastoma growth and counteracted temozolomide for its anti-glioblastoma activity.</p>
<p>Overall, the manuscript has provided evidence supporting the important role of PITAR in the regulation of the growth of glioblastoma. The results supporting the regulation of PITAR on TRIM28 appear to be convincing. However, some weaknesses are also noted.</p>
<p>(1) More than one siRNA/shRNA should be used in critical experiments. For example, Fig 7A-E are important experiments demonstrating PITAR suppresses tumor growth. It is compelling that the siPITAR tumors disappeared at the end of the experiment. While this might be due to apoptosis, using another siRNA to confirm the results would be necessary. The authors may also need to use this model to test their hypothesis that PITAR regulates tumor growth through p53. They can check p53, p21, apoptosis levels in tumor sections.</p>
<p>(2) The data supporting that PITAR downregulates p53 stability and activity can be strengthened. The half-life of endogenous p53 protein is generally 20-30 min, and thus the cycloheximide chase experiments (Fig 5E) need to use shorter treatment time. The ubiquitinated p53 bands are not clear (Fig 5F), and the data suggesting that PITAR regulates p53 ubiquitination are not convincing. While the p53 protein level was largely altered by PITAR/TRIM28, the mRNA levels of its target genes, including p21 and MDM2 only marginally changed (Fig S6D). Other p53 targets, particularly proapoptotic genes, may need to be examined.</p>
<p>(3) The model depicting the role of PITAR in the cellular response to DNA-damaging agents is confusing. If DNA damaging agents like TMZ induce PITAR to inactivate p53, PITAR overexpression would confer TMZ resistance. However, Fig 7G did not support this. While the experimental design is quite problematic given that U87 cells already express a high level of PITAR, PITAR-overexpressing cells were still sensitive to TMZ treatment (this is apparent when checking the images in Fig 7F, although the large error bars shown in Fig 7G may lead to a &quot;not significant&quot; conclusion). The authors may need to test whether PITAR downregulation, which would increase p53 activity, has any effects on TMZ-insensitive tumors. Such results are more therapeutically relevant. It would also be helpful if the authors test whether PITAR is overexpressed in TMZ-resistant clinical samples.</p>

<p>This study established an alternate way of p53 inactivation and proposed PITAR as a potential therapeutic target, so the impact is high. In addition, this manuscript has apparent strengths, including a logically designed research strategy, in vitro and in vivo study, and well-designed control.</p>
<p>This manuscript identified a long noncoding RNA, PITAR (p53 Inactivating TRIM28 associated RNA), as an inhibitor of p53. PITAR is highly expressed in glioblastoma (GBM) and glioma stem-like cells (GSC). The authors found that TRIM28 mRNA, which encodes a p53-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase, is a direct target of PITAR. PITAR interaction with TRIM28 RNA stabilized TRIM28 mRNA, which resulted in increased TRIM28 protein levels, enhanced p53 ubiquitination, and attenuated DNA damage response. While PITAR silencing inhibited the growth of WT p53 containing GSCs in vitro and reduced glioma tumor growth in vivo, its overexpression enhanced the tumor growth and promoted resistance to Temozolomide. DNA damage also activated PITAR, in addition to p53, thus creating an incoherent feedforward loop. Together, this study established an alternate way of p53 inactivation and proposed PITAR as a potential therapeutic target.</p>
<p>P53 is a well-established tumor suppressor gene contributing to cancer progression in many human cancers. It plays a vital role in preserving genome integrity and inhibiting malignant transformation. p53 is mutated in more than 50% of human cancers. In cancers that do not carry mutations in p53, the inactivation occurs through other genetic or epigenetic alterations. Therefore, further study of the mechanism of regulation of wt-p53 remains vital in cancer research. This study identified a novel LncRNA PITAR, which is highly expressed in glioblastoma (GBM) and glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) and interacts with and stabilizes TRIM28 mRNA, which encodes a p53-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase. TRIM28 can inhibit p53 through HDAC1-mediated deacetylation and direct ubiquitination in an MDM2-dependent manner. Thus, the overall impact of this study is high because of the identification of a novel mechanism in regulating wt-p53.</p>
<p>The other significant strengths of this manuscript included an apparent research strategy design and a clearly outlined and logically organized research approach. They provided both the in vitro and in vivo studies to evaluate the effect of PITAR. They offered reasonable control of the study by validating the results in cells with mutant p53. They also performed a rescue experiment to confirm the PITAR and TRIM28 relationship regulating p53. The conclusions were all supported by solid results. The overall data presentation is clear and convincing.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Only one PITAR siRNA was tested in majority of the experiments, which compromises the validity of the results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We have now used two siRNAs to demonstrate PITAR functions in various assays. In the revised manuscript, we carried out additional experiments with two siRNAs, and the results are presented in Figures 2C, D, F, G, H, I, and J; Figures 5A, B, Supplementary Figure 2B, C, D, E, and F.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Some results are inconsistent. For example, Fig 2G indicates that PITAR siRNA caused G1 arrest. However, PITAR overexpression in the same cell line did not show any effect on cell cycle progression in Fig 5I.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reason for the fact that PITAR silencing showed a robust G1 arrest, unlike PITAR overexpression, is as follows. Since glioma cells overexpress PITAR (which keeps the p53 suppressed), silencing PITAR (which will elevate p53 levels) in glioma cells shows a robust phenotype in cell cycle profile (in the form of increased G1 arrest). In contrast, the overexpression of PITAR in glioma cells fails to show robust changes in the cell cycle profile because glioma cells already have high levels of PITAR.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The conclusion that PITAR inactivates p53 through regulating TRIM28, which is highlighted in the title of the manuscript, is not supported by convincing results. Although the authors showed that a PITAR siRNA increased while PITAR overexpression decreased p53 level, the siRNA only marginally increased the stability of p53 (Fig 5E). The p53 ubiquitination level was barely affected by PITAR overexpression in Fig 5F.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We disagree with the fact that PITAR silencing only marginally increased the stability of p53. In the cycloheximide experiment in Figure 5E, the half-life of p53 is increased by 60 % (50 mins to 120 mins), which is quite significant in altering the DNA damage response by p53. Further, we also want to point out that the other arm of p53 degradation by Mdm2 remains intact under these conditions. We also provide an improved p53 ubiquitination western blot in the revised version (Figure 5F).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) To convincingly demonstrate that PITAR regulates p53 through TRIM28, the authors need to show that this regulation is impaired/compromised in TRIM28-knockout conditions. The authors only showed that TRIM28 overexpression suppressed PITAR siRNA-induced increase of p53, which is not sufficient.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer. In the revised manuscript, we demonstrate that PITAR overexpression fails to inhibit p53 in TRIM28 silenced cells (Supplementary Figure 5G; Figure 5K, L, M, N).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Note that only one cell line was investigated in Fig 5.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In revised manuscript, the impact of PITAR silencing and PITAR overexpression on p53 functions are demontsrared for one more glioma cell line (Supplemenatry Figure 5B, C, D, and E).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Another major weakness of this manuscript is that the authors did not provide any evidence indicating that the glioblastoma-promoting activities of PITAR were mediated by its regulation of p53 or TRIM28 (Fig 6 and Fig 7). Thus, the regulation of glioblastoma growth and the regulation of TRIM28/p53 appear to be disconnected.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to respectfully disagree with the reviewer on this particular point.  We have indeed provided the following evidence in the first version of the manuscript: glioblastoma-promoting activities of PITAR were mediated by its regulation of p53 or TRIM28.</p>
<p>(1) To show the importance of p53:</p>
<p>We show that PITAR silencing failed to inhibit the colony growth of p53-silenced U87 glioma cells (U87/shp53#1). We also show that while PITAR silencing decreased TRIM28 RNA levels in U87/shNT and U87/shp53#1 glioma cells, it failed to increase CDKN1A and MDM2 (p53 targets) at the RNA level in U87/shp53#1 cells unlike in U87/siNT cells (Supplementary Figure 6 Panels A, B, C, and D).</p>
<p>(2) To show the importance of TRIM28 and p53:</p>
<p>The importance of p53 is also demonstrated in the context of patient-derived GSC lines. We demonstrate that PITAR silencing-induced reduction in the neurosphere growth (WT p53 containing patient-derived GSC line) is accompanied by a reduction in TRIM28 RNA and an increase in the CDKN1A RNA without a change in p53 RNA levels (Supplementary Figure 7 Panels A, B, C, D, and E). We also demonstrate that PITAR overexpression-induced neurosphere growth is accompanied by an increase in the TRIM28 RNA, and a decrease in CDKN1A RNA without a change in p53 RNA levels (Supplementary Figure 7 Panels F, G, H, and I). However, PITAR silencing failed to decrease neurosphere growth in mutant p53 containing GSC line (MGG8) (Supplementary Figure 7 Panels J, K, L, M, N, and F).</p>
<p>(3) We show that the TRIM28 protein level is drastically reduced in small tumors formed by U87/siPITAR cells (Supplementary Figure 7 Panel E).</p>
<p>(4) We show that glioma tumors formed by U87/PITAR OE cells express high levels of TRIM28 protein but reduced levels of p21 protein (Supplementary Figure 7 Panel B).</p>
<p>Further, we did additional experiments to prove the importance of TRIM28.</p>
<p>In the revised manuscript, we have carried out an additional experiment to prove the requirement of TRIM28 for tumor-promoting functions of PITAR overexpression. Earlier, we have shown that exogenous overexpression of PITAR promotes glioma tumor growth and imparts resistance to Temozolomide chemotherapy (Figure 7F and G; Supplementary Figure 9A and B). In the revised manuscript, we show that the tumor growth-promoting function of PITAR overexpression requires TRIM28. U87-Luc/PITAR OE cells formed a larger tumor compared to U87-Luc/VC cells (Figure 7H, and I; compare red line with blue line). U87-Luc/shTRIM28 cells formed very small-sized tumors (Figure 7H, and I; compare green line with blue line). Further, PITAR overexpression (U87-Luc/PITAR OE) was less efficient in promoting glioma tumor growth in TRIM28 silenced cells (Figure 7H, and I; compare pink line with red line). Thus, we prove that, as a whole, TRIM28 mediates the tumor growth-promoting functions of PITAR.</p>

<p>(7) It is not clear what kind of message the authors tried to deliver in Fig 7F/G. Based on the authors' hypothesis, DNA-damaging agents like TMZ would induce PITAR to inactivate p53, which would compromise TMZ's anti-cancer activity. However, the data show that TMZ was very effective in the inhibition of U87 growth. The authors may need to test whether PITAR downregulation, which would increase p53 activity, have any effects on TMZ-insensitive tumors. Such results are more therapeutically relevant.</p>

<p>Reviewer #1 rightly pointed out that TMZ induces PITAR expression, which should compromise TMZ's anti-cancer activity.</p>
<p>We demonstrate the same as below:</p>
<p>Figure 7F&amp;G demonstrates the following two facts:1. PITAR overexpression increases the glioma-tumor growth (Figure 7G, compare red line with the blue line), 2. PITAR overexpressing glioma tumors are resistant to TMZ chemotherapy (Figure 7G, compare the pink line with the green line).</p>
<p>In addition, Figure 7 F and G also demonstrate that TMZ treatment of tumors formed by U87/VC glioma cells inhibited the growth but not eliminated the tumor growth completely (compare pink line with blue line). We believe that the inability of TMZ to eliminate the tumor growth completely is because of the chemoresistance imparted by the DNA damage induced PITAR.</p>
<p>Further, in Figure 2I, we indeed show that PITAR-silenced cells are more sensitive to TMZ and Adriamycin chemotherapy.</p>

<p>(8) Lastly, the model presented in Fig 7H is confusing. It is not clear what the exact role of PITAR in the DNA damage response based on this model. If DNA damage would induce PITAR expression, this would lead to inactivation of p53 as revealed by this manuscript. However, DNA damage is known to activate p53. Do the authors want to imply that PITAR induction by DNA damage would help to bring down the p53 level at the end of DNA damage response? The presented data do not support this role unfortunately.</p>

<p>We respect the views and questions raised by the reviewer.</p>
<p>We would like explain as below the importance of our model.</p>
<p>Yes, it is true that DNA damage induces p53. We show here that DNA damage also induces PITAR in a p53-independent manner, which, in turn, inhibits p53. Here is our explanation. Even though DNA damage activates p53, there exists an autoregulatory negative feedback loop that controls the extent and duration of p53 response to DNA damage (Wu et al., 1993; Haupt et al., 1997; Kubbutat, Jones and Vousden, 1997; Zhang et al., 2009).  It is proposed that the p53-Mdm2 feedback loop generates a âdigital clockâ that releases well-timed quanta of p53 until the damage is repaired or the cell dies (Lahave et al., 2004). In addition, it has also been shown that TRIM28, through its association with Mdm2, also contributes to p53 inactivation (Wang et al., 2005b; CzerwiÅska, Mazurek, and Wiznerowicz, 2017).</p>
<p>Based on the above reports and our current work, we propose that DNA damage-induced PITAR, through its ability to increase the TRIM28 levels, contributes to the control of the DNA damage response of p53 along with Mdm-2. The difference is as follows: Since Mdm-2 is also a transcriptional target of p53, the p53-Mdm-2 axis is an autoregulatory negative feedback loop to control the DNA damage response by p53. In contrast, PITAR is not a transcriptional target of p53, and DNA damage-induced activation of PITAR is p53-independent. Hence, the PITAR-TRIM28 axis in controlling the DNA damage response of p53 creates an Incoherent feedforward regulatory network.  The experimental evidence provided in the revised manuscript is as follows: 1) We have already (the first version of the manuscript) shown that exogenous overexpression of PITAR significantly inhibits DNA damage-induced p53 (Figures 6A, B, C, and D). 2) In the revised manuscript, we show that the DNA damage response of p53 (duration and extent of p53 activation after a pulse of ionizing radiation) in PITAR-silenced cells follows similar kinetics in terms of duration, but the extent of p53 activation was much stronger (Supplementary figures 8H, I, J, and K).  This is because the TRIM28 component in TRIM28/Mdm-2 axis is compromised as PITAR silencing reduces the TRIM28 levels. 3) We also demonstrate that DNA damage-induced TRIM28 is dependent on PITAR (Figure 6K; Supplementary Figure 5G)</p>

<p>Reviewer #1(Recommendations For The Authors):</p>
<p>(1) Fig 7A, what is the explanation for the observation that tumors disappeared in most of the mice in the siPITAR group? Did the authors check if apoptosis was induced here?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree to the point that the lack of tumor growth in the siPITAR group is likely due to the induction of apoptosis. We would like to point out that in vitro experiments indeed demonstrate that PITAR silencing induces apoptosis in Figure 2H and Supplementary Figure 2F.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors need to explain why Fig 6 used a cell line different from other experiments. It would be better to check other cell lines.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The purpose of RG5 and MGG8 is as follows. 1) We wanted to establish the growth-promoting functions of PITAR in patient-derived GSC lines. 2) We also wanted to show the importance of WT p53 for the growth-promoting functions of PITAR.</p>
<p>However, in the revised manuscript we moved this portion under the subsection âPITAR inhibits p53 protein levels by its association with TRIM28 mRNAâ.</p>
<p>Further,the experiments related to DNA damage induced activation of PITAR in p53-independent manner and its impact on DNA damage response by p53 is moved to a new section entitled âPITAR is induced by DNA damage in a p53-independent manner, which in turn diminishes the DNA damage response by p53â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) It would be more convincing if the authors could test more p53 target genes in addition to p21.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and the specific suggestions for checking additional p53 targets. In the revised manuscript, we have checked the MDM2 transcript levels in Supplementary Figure 6D.</p>
