<title>Abstract</title><p>Germline CTLA-4 deficiency causes severe autoimmune diseases characterized by dysregulation of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs, hyper-activation of effector memory T cells, and variable forms autoimmune cytopenia including gradual loss of B cells. Cancer patients with severe immune-related adverse events (irAE) after receiving anti-CTLA-4/PD-1 combination immunotherapy also have markedly reduced peripheral B cells. The immunological basis for B cell loss remains unexplained. Here we probe the decline of B cells in human CTLA-4 knock-in mice by using anti-human CTLA-4 antibody Ipilimumab conjugated to a drug payload emtansine (Anti-CTLA-4 ADC). The anti-CTLA-4 ADC-treated mice have T cell hyper-proliferation and their differentiation into effector cells which results in B cell depletion. B cell depletion is mediated by both CD4 and CD8 T cells and at least partially rescued by anti-TNF-alpha antibody. These data revealed an unexpected antagonism between T and B cells and the importance of regulatory T cells in preserving B cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Foxp3 is a master regulator of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and its mutations result in fatal autoimmune disease in mice and human.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> Among many known functions, Foxp3 is a transcriptional factor for expression of CTLA-4, which is constitutively expressed in Tregs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> <italic>Ctla4</italic> deletion in mice phenocopies that of Foxp3. In humans, CTLA-4 deficiency caused by autosomal heterozygous mutation of the CTLA-4 gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> or mutations in recycling partner LPS-Responsive beige-like anchor (LRBA) protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> are associated with severe autoimmune diseases. Although CTLA-4 can be expressed at lower levels in other cell types and has been suggested as a negative regulator for naïve T cell activation, specific deficiency of CTLA-4 in Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs results in development of systemic lymphoproliferation, fatal autoimmune disease, and potent tumor immunity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> These data are consistent with the notion that the predominant function of CTLA-4 is Treg-intrinsic.</p>
<p>A largely overlooked area is the cross-regulation between B cells and regulatory T cells. CTLA-4 conditional null mice and those with depletion of Tregs showed increase in germinal center B cells and heightened antibody responses with some reports showing a decrease B cell percentage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> B cell loss is a common feature in genetic mutations of Foxp3, scurfy mice, Foxp3 knockout mice or Treg depletion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> Among cancer patients who received immunotherapy, early change of circulating B cells of patients who received combination immunotherapy anti-CTLA-4/PD-1 correlated to irAE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> The change in B cells included decline of circulating B cells, and increase in CD21 low B cells and plasmablasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>The correlation between B cell reduction and immune activation associated with defective Foxp3-CTLA-4 function remains unexplained. Since both CTLA-4 and Foxp3 are largely expressed outside of B cell compartment, and since this pathway is the master regulatory of Treg function, we hypothesized that B cell loss maybe associated with activation of T cells that are autodestructive of B cells. This hypothesis is noteworthy as no autodestructive T cells for B cells have been described. To test this hypothesis, we generated anti-CTLA-4 ADC and showed that the ADC caused selective depletion of Tregs in mice and a marked reduction of B cells. Remarkably, activation of CD4 and CD8 T cells is the underlying cause of B cell depletion. Our data explains the B cell loss associated with Foxp3 and CTLA-4 dysfunction and suggested an unexpected antagonism between T cells and B cells.</p>

<title>CTLA-4 antibody-drug conjugate depleted regulatory T cells and B cells</title>
<p>Anti-CTLA-4 antibody Ipilimumab (Ipi) or human IgGFc (hIgGFc) control were conjugated to a well-known drug payload DM1, emtansine, to furnish the corresponding ADCs: Ipilimumab-DM1 (Ipi-DM1) and hIgGFc-DM1 with corresponding size shifts in the SDS-gel (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The drug to antibody ratio (DAR) was calculated based on experimentally determined extinction coefficient A280 &amp; A252 for each antibody and reported values for DM1 (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>). The DAR from various conjugation is ∼3.2 for Ipi-DM1 and ∼ 1.7 for hIgGFc-DM1 control (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>), as expected based on the sizes of the proteins. The binding for Ipi-DM1 ADC was evaluated by ELISA binding to immobilized His-hCTLA-4 and by flow cytometry using hCTLA-4 expressing CHO cells (CHO-hCTLA-4). Ipi-DM1 binding was found comparable to the parent antibody Ipi (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B, 1C</xref>). Specific killing of CTLA-4-expressing cells by Ipi-DM1 was assessed in human CTLA-4 expressing CHO (CHO-hCTLA-4) and wild type CHO (CHO-WT) cells in vitro (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), which showed Ipi-DM1 reduced viability of CLTA-4 expressing CHO but not wild type cells. As expected, there was no change in viability for either CHO cell lines when treated with Ipi (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>

<p>In order to evaluate the in vivo effects of CTLA-4 ADC on Tregs, we treated human CTLA-4 knock-in (Ctla4<sup>h/h</sup>) mice with control hIgGFc or Ipi-DM1 ADC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Peripheral blood was stained for flow cytometry and gated on CD45 and T-cell subset, including CD8, CD4, CD4 Foxp3<sup>+</sup> and CD4 Foxp3<sup>-</sup> subsets (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). We found that Ipi-DM1 ADC significantly depleted Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs as indicated by the reduction in percentage and cell number of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells when compared to hIgGFc control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). In addition, total CTLA-4 levels and Ki67 staining in Tregs were decreased compared to control group (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1H, 1I</xref>). In contrast, Ipi-DM1 ADC did not alter either % of CD4 Foxp3<sup>-</sup> cells among CD45<sup>+</sup> leukocytes or CTLA-4 levels on the subset, but did slightly decrease the cell number of CD4 Foxp3<sup>-</sup> cells when compared hIgGFc control (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1</xref>). Unexpectedly, Ipi-DM1 ADC caused a dramatic decline of B cells as percentages of CD45 and cell number in the periphery (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>). B cells from mice treated with Ipi-DM1 exhibited higher proliferation than those from hIgGFc treated control mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1K</xref>).</p>
<p>Since a dramatic loss of B cells and a slight decrease in CD4-nonTregs in Ipi-DM1 treated mice were observed, we sought ensure that this phenomenon was not a result of downstream release of payload drug DM1. As shown in <xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2A</xref>, hIgGFc-DM1 ADC (payload control) did not alter Treg percentage and cell number. A slightly higher level of CTLA-4 was noted in CD4 subset, while Treg proliferation did not change significantly compared to control (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2B, 2C</xref>). No other effects on T cell subsets were noted (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2D, 2E</xref>). Importantly, B cell number and proliferation were unaffected by hIgGFc-DM1 ADC treatment (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2F, 2G</xref>). Additionally, to ensure B cell depletion was not directly caused by Ipi-DM1 ADC, we stained B220<sup>+</sup> B cells and Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs for human CTLA-4 in both human CTLA-4 knock-in (Ctla4<sup>h/h</sup>) and WT mice to evaluate expression of CTLA-4 in B cells. As expected, CTLA-4 was detected in Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs of Ctla4<sup>h/h</sup> but not B cells (<xref rid="fig1s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 3</xref>).</p>
<p>We then asked how Ipi-DM1 ADC induced Treg impairment impacted B cell lymphopoiesis. FACS analysis of bone marrow B cells revealed the loss of mature B cells but not immature transitional type1 or Pre-pro/Pro/Pre B cells from Ipi-DM1 treated mice, however the Pre-Pro/Pro/Pre B cell subtype percentage in B220 are enriched as a result of mature B cell loss (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1L-1P</xref>, <xref rid="fig1s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 4</xref>). Additionally, CD21/35 expression level in the remaining mature B cells in Ipi-DM1 treated mice was lower than those from hIgGFc treated control mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1Q</xref>). Taken together, data in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> showed that Ipi-DM1 can impair Treg function by depleting Tregs, preferentially the proliferating Tregs with higher CTLA-4 levels, and loss of B cells in the blood and bone marrow while B cell progenitors are not impacted.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>B-cell depletion correlates with Treg impairment by Ipi-DM1</title>
<p>To investigate the kinetic relationship between the decline of B cells and Treg impairment, human CTLA-4 knock-in (Ctla4<sup>h/h</sup>) mice were treated with control hIgGFc or Ipi-DM1 and bled according to schedule diagram in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>. We observed that peripheral blood samples from mice treated with Ipi-DM1 had a gradual decrease in total leukocytes compared hIgGFc control group followed by a full recovery by Day 25 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). The large decrease of CD45 cells in Ipi-DM1 group is predominantly attributed to the decline of B cells, which plateaus on days 9 and 13 and recovers by day 25 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2C, 2D</xref>) in correlation with the kinetics of Tregs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E, 2F</xref>). Similar to the bone marrow data in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, peripheral blood mature B cells decrease and transitional type1 B cells become enriched in Ipi-DM1 group compared hIgGFc control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G-2I</xref>).</p>

<title>Depletion of T-cells but not macrophage rescues B-cells from ablation by Ipi-DM1</title>
<p>We then evaluated how Ipi-DM1-mediated impairment of Treg function affects total CD4 and CD8 T cells. Mice treated with Ipi-DM1 ADC did not affect the total percentage of CD4 or CD8 T cells among CD45<sup>+</sup> leukocytes, but the cell number of both cell types decreased (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A, 3B</xref>). Staining of Ki67 in CD4 and CD8 revealed a greater percentage of T cells in hyper-proliferative state (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Alternatively, mice treated with hIgGFc-DM1 did not change CD4 or CD8 percentage of CD45, cell numbers and Ki67 staining compared to hIgGFc control (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1</xref>). We then analyzed the functional subsets of T cells in mice that received control hIgGFc or Ipi-DM1 at day 9. Using CD44 and CD62L markers, we observed an expansion of effector memory T cells (CD44<sup>hi</sup>CD62L<sup>low</sup>) in Ipi-DM1 group for both CD4 and CD8 T cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3D, 3E</xref>). Correspondingly, the frequency of naive T cells was reduced for Ipi-DM1 while central memory T cells were unchanged (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3D, 3E</xref>). These results show that CTLA-4 ADC can impair Treg function thereby resulting an increase in effector memory T cells and a hyper-proliferative state similar to animals that lack the expression of CTLA-4 or Foxp3.</p>

<p>Since B cells are devoid of CTLA-4, Ipi-DM1 must have induced other effector cells that are directly responsible for B cell depletion. To understand which cell types are responsible for the destruction of B cells, we depleted either T cells or macrophages using either anti-Thy1.2 mAb or chlondrosome. Ctla4<sup>h/h</sup> mice were treated with control hIgGFc, Ipi-DM1, Ipi-DM1 in combination with anti-Thy1.2, or Ipi-DM1 in combination with chlondrosome and bled on day 9 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). As shown in the <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, top panel, anti-Thy1.2 mAb efficiently depleted total T cells while macrophage depletion by chlondrosome had no effect (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B top</xref> panel, 4C, 4D). Additionally, combination of Ipi-DM1 with T cell depleting antibody resulted in a remarkable rescue of B cells as indicated by percentage B220 in CD45 and cell number while combination with macrophage depletion did not rescue the B cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4B</xref> bottom panel, 4E).</p>

<p>In order to understand which subsets of T cells played a critical role in the T cell mediated destruction of B cells, we treated Ctla4<sup>h/h</sup> mice with hIgGFc control, Ipi-DM1, Ipi-DM1 with CD4 depleting antibody, or Ipi-DM1 with CD8 depleting antibody (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Both CD4 and CD8 depleting antibodies provide efficient depletion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>, top panel) of their respective targeted T cell. Depletion of either CD4 or CD8 T cells results in B cell increase (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4F</xref> bottom panel, 4I). Interestingly, the cell number of CD4 and CD8 T cells increase reciprocally by depletion of the other subsets (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4G, 4H</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together our CTLA-4 antibody-drug conjugate Ipi-DM1 can impair Treg function, which results in a T cell mediated destruction of B cells. Whole T cell depletion with anti-Thy1.2, depletion of CD4 or CD8 T cells rescued B cells from abrogation by Ipi-DM1.</p>

<title>B-cell rescue by Belatacept suggest a role for B7-CD28 interaction in B-cell depletion</title>
<p>The process for T cell activation requires two signals. The first signal is the binding of T-cell receptor (TCR) to antigen-bound major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and the second signal is a costimulatory molecule CD28 binding with B7-1/2 (CD80/86) on the antigen-presenting cell. Having shown that the destruction of B cell can be prevented by total depletion of T cell, we sought to rescue the B cells by breaking the CD28-B7 signal with a soluble CTLA-4 that can bind to B7 but not Ipilimumab or Ipi-DM1 ADC. As shown in <xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1</xref>, Abatacept can neutralize Ipilimumab/ADC while Belatacept does not. Therefore, Belatacept can be used to test if activation of T cells is required for B cell depletion.</p>

<p>We treated mice with Ipi-DM1 to impair Treg function and used Belatacept to break CD28/B7 signal to block T cell activation. Briefly, <italic>Ctla4<sup>h/h</sup></italic> mice were treated with hIgGFc or Ipi-DM1 with/out Belatacept and bled on day 9 for flow analysis. Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs percentage in CD4 and cell number decreased similarly for Ipi-DM1 with/out Belatacept compared hIgGFc control (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5A, 5B</xref>). Additionally, Belatacept did not impact Ipi-DM1 to target CTLA-4 expressing Tregs, as Ipi-DM1 with/out Belactacept had similar total CTLA-4 level reduction compared to control group (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). However, Belatacept rescued B cells from Ipi-DM1-mediated depletion (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5D, 5E</xref>). Correspondingly, Belatacept reduced effector memory T cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5F, 5G</xref>) as well as granzyme B and IFN-γ expression in CD4 and CD8 T cells compared to Ipi-DM1 treated group (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5H-5K</xref>, <xref rid="fig5s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Collectively, the data presented here show that Ipi-DM1 can impair Treg function resulting in T cell activation as indicated by increase in effector memory T cell markers, GranzymB, and cytokine production thereby resulting in the loss of B cells. However, under Ipi-DM1 induced Treg impairment the addition of mutant soluble CTLA-4-Ig, Belatacept, can reduce T cell activation and thereby preserving B cells.</p>

<title>B-cell depletion is partially rescued by anti-TNF-alpha</title>
<p>Since T cells are the effector cells responsible for B cell abrogation, it is of great interest to evaluate the molecular mechanism by which B cells are eliminated by T cells. To address this issue, we tested if either FasL or TNF-alpha, which are produced by activated T cells are responsible. To answer this question, Ctla4<sup>h/h</sup> mice were treated with hIgGFc control or Ipi-DM1 with/out Adalimumab a human anti-TNF-alpha that also binds to mouse TNF-alpha (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A, 6B</xref>). Flow analysis showed Tregs were decreased similarly between Ipi-DM1 with/out Adalimumab compared hIgGFc control group (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6C top</xref> panel, 6D). Remarkably, the anti-TNF-alpha partially rescued B cells as shown by percentage difference of B cell marker B220 between Ipi-DM1 and in combination with Adalimumab as well as cell number (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6C</xref> bottom panel, 6E). Peripheral blood samples stimulated with Iononmycin/PMA increased intracellular cytokines TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma for T cells from Ipi-DM1 treated mice compared to hIgGFc control, while that with Ipi-DM1 in combination with Adalimumab had slight increase but the change was insignificant except for IFN-gamma in CD8 T cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F, 6G</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have reported that pH-insensitive anti-CTLA-4 antibodies trafficked to, and were degraded in the lysosomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> Since lysosomal degradation is needed to release DM1 from the antibody for cytotoxicity, the pH-insensitive Ipilimumab was chosen for preparation of antibody-drug conjugate to be used to impact Treg function. We found that in Ctla4<sup>h/h</sup> mice anti-CTLA-4 ADC, Ipi-DM1, can recapitulate the phenotype of loss of B cells associated clinical deficiency of CTLA-4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> /recycling partner LBRA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Our analysis revealed B cell loss in both bone marrow and peripheral blood, specifically mature B cells. Loss of mature peripheral B cells is consistent with clinical data for some patients with CTLA-4 haploinsufficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>B cell loss was previously reported in mice with either naturally occurred (in Scurfy mice) or targeted mutation of Foxp3 and Treg depletion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> The kinetics of B cell loss and Treg depletion in the Ipi-DM1 treated mice revealed that B cell loss was transient and correlated to Treg impairment (proliferation, CTLA-4 level, cell number). Our data further showed that B cell destruction under Treg impairment conditions is T cell-mediated and required T cell activation.</p>
<p>Scurfy mice have poor central and peripheral B lymphopoiesis, however neonatal WT Treg adoptive transfer in scurfy mice resulted in robust population of mature B cells in the spleen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> Genetic ablation of TCRα gene by crossing scurfy with TCRAα<sup>-/-</sup> mice efficiently support B cell lymphopoiesis and was sufficient to restore B cells in the bone marrow and peripheral compartments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> Additionally, reconstitution of bone marrow chimera from scurfy or wild type mixed with that from μMT mice that is deficient in B cells results in normal B cells after 8 weeks from reconstitution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> This is in line with our data that Treg impairment results in activated T-cells killing of B cells. Others have implied that under Treg depletion, activated T cells are targeting interleukin 7 (IL-7) secreting ICAM1+ perivascular stromal cells needed to progress B cell progenitors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> IL-7 is essential for B lymphopoiesis transition from Pro-B cell into Pre-B cell.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> However, our model system is distinct where only mature B cells are depleted, while B cell progenitor precursors, and specifically Pre-B cells are not impacted. This suggest that activated T cells are directly responsible for B cell destruction. T cell activation initiated by Treg impairment requires B7-CD28 interaction for activated T cells. As a mechanism, we found that anti-TNF-alpha can partially rescue B-cells from loss imposed by Treg impairment.</p>
<p>While in vitro studies by others showed B cell killing by activated CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4 Tregs, but not by CD25<sup>-</sup> CD4 T cells, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> this is not the case in vivo where B cell loss is associated with Foxp3 Treg loss or impairment. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> Furthermore, our current study shows that both CD4 and CD8 T cells contributed to B cell loss. The concept that B cells are actively eliminated by T cells in vivo expands our understanding of T-B cell interaction by showing antagonism rather than just “immunological help” from T cells to B cells.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The specific tests used to analyze each set of experiments are indicated in the figure legends. Data were analyzed using a two-tailed t-test to compare between two groups or by one-way ANOVA (analysis of variance) for multiple comparisons. In the graphs, y-axis error bars represent S.E.M. or S.D. as indicated. Statistical calculations were performed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California). *p &lt; 0.05, **p &lt; 0.01, ***p &lt; 0.001, ****p &lt; 0.0001. Reported CTLA-4 level and absolute cell numbers are normalized by the average value of hIgGFc control group.</p>

<p>This study presents <bold>valuable</bold> information that an anti-CTLA-4 antibody drug conjugate transiently depletes circulating B-lymphocytes in a mouse model. It shows how dysregulation of the T cell immune system can impact B cell homeostasis. The work will be of broad interest to immunologists and medical biologists, but the strength of evidence is <bold>incomplete</bold> at this time mainly because they only analyzed circulating B cells.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Muthana et al. describes the effect of injection of an antibody specific for human CTLA4 conjugated to a cytotoxic molecule (Ipi-DM1) in knock-in mice expressing human CTLA4. The authors show that Ipi-DM1 administration causes a partial decrease (about 50% in absolute number) of mature B cells in blood and bone marrow 9-14 days after the beginning of treatment. Ipi-DM1 also results in a partial decrease in Foxp3+ Tregs (about 40% in absolute number) and a slight increase in activation of conventional T cells (Tconvs) in the blood at D9. Tconv depletion, CTLA4-Ig or anti-TNF mAb partially prevents the effect of ipi-DM1 on B cells. This work is interesting but has the following major limitations:</p>
<p>1- This work could have been of more interest if the Ipi-DM1 molecule would be used in the clinic. As this is not the case, the intimate mechanism of the effect of this molecule in mice is of reduced interest.</p>
<p>
2- The fact that a partial deletion of Tregs is associated with activation of Tconvs and a decrease in B cells has been published several times and is therefore not new. According to the authors, their work would be the first to show that activation of Tconvs would lead to B cell depletion. However, this is shown in an indirect way and the mechanisms are not really elucidated. Indeed, this work shows a correlation between an increase in Tconv activation and a decrease in the number of B cells in the blood. The experiments to try to show a causal link are of 2 types: deletion of T cells (Fig 4) and blocking T cell activation with CTLA4-Ig (Fig 5) (neutralization of TNF addresses another question). Neither of these 2 experiments is totally convincing. Indeed, the absence of B cell depletion when T cells are deleted can be explained by other mechanisms than the preservation of B cell destruction by activated T cells. The phenomenon could be explained by B cell recirculation to lymphoid tissues or an effect of massive T cell death for example. The experiment shown in Fig. 5 with Belatacept is more convincing because this time the effect is targeted to activated T cells only. However, the prevention of B cell ablation is only partial. Again, since only blood is analyzed, other mechanisms could explain the B cell loss, such as their recirculation in lymphoid tissues.</p>
<p>
3- It is disappointing that only the blood (and sometimes the bone marrow) was studied in this work. The interest of doing experiments in mice is to have access to many tissues such as the spleen, lymph nodes, colon, lung, and liver. To conclude that there is B cell deletion without showing lymphoid organs (where the majority of B cells reside) is insufficient. As discussed above, the drop in B cells in the blood could be due to their recirculation in lymphoid organs. In addition, there is no measurement of functional B cells activity. Do mice treated with Ipi-DM1 have a decreased ability to develop an antibody response following immunization?</p>
<p>
4- Although it is difficult to study in vivo, there is not a single evidence of increased B cell death after injection of Ipi-DM1.</p>
<p>
5- In most of the experiments, B cells are quantified with the B220 marker alone, but this marker, in some cases, can be expressed by other cells. It would have been preferable to use a marker more specific to B cells such as CD19 for example.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the concept that T cell activation can lead to B cell deletion is interesting but this study shows it only in an indirect and incomplete way.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that CTLA-4 is a critical molecule for inhibiting the immune response, surprisingly individuals with heterozygous CTLA-4 mutations exhibit immunodeficiency, presenting with antibody deficiency secondary to B cell loss. Why the loss of a molecule that regulates T cell activation should lead to B cell loss has remained unclear. In this study, Muthana and colleagues use an anti-CTLA-4 antibody drug conjugate (aCTLA-4 ADC) to delete cells expressing high levels of CTLA-4, and show that this leads to a reduction in B cells. The aCTLA-4 ADC is found to delete a subset of Tregs, leading to hyperactivation of T cells that is associated with B cell depletion. Using blocking antibodies, the authors implicate TNFa in the observed B cell loss.</p>
<p>The reciprocal regulation of T and B cell homeostasis is an important research area. While it has been shown that Treg defects are associated with B cell loss, the mechanisms at play are incompletely understood. CTLA-4 is not normally expressed in B cells so an indirect mechanism of action is assumed. The authors show that the decrease in Treg following aCTLA-4 ADC treatment is associated with activation of T cells, and that B cell loss is blunted if T cells are depleted. A role for both CD4 and CD8 T cells is identified by selective CD4/CD8 depletion. T cells appear to require CD28 costimulation in order to mediate B cell loss, since the response is partially inhibited in the presence of the costimulation blockade drug belatacept (CTLA-4-Ig). Finally, experiments using the anti-TNFa antibody adalimumab suggest a potential role for TNFa in the depletion of B cells.</p>
<p>While the manuscript makes a useful contribution, a number of questions remain. Perhaps most important is the extent to which this model mimics the natural situation in individuals with CTLA-4 mutations (or following CTLA-4-based clinical interventions). aCTLA-4 ADC treatment permits acute deletion of Treg expressing high levels of CTLA-4, whereas in patients the Treg population remains but is specifically impaired in CTLA-4 function. Secondly, although the requirement for T cells to mediate B cell loss is convincingly demonstrated, the incomplete reversal by TNFa blockade suggests additional unidentified factors contribute to this effect. Finally, although the manuscript favours peripheral killing of mature B cells over alterations to B cell lymphopoiesis, one concern is that this may simply reflect the model employed: the short-term (6 day) treatment used here may be too acute to alter B cell development, but this may nevertheless be a feature of prolonged immune dysregulation in humans.</p>

<p>The co-suppressive molecule CTLA-4 has a critical role in the maintenance of peripheral tolerance, primarily by Treg mediated control of the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86. As stated by the authors, previous studies have found a variety of effects of anti-CTLA-4 antibody treatment or genetic loss of CTLA-4 on B-cells. These include increased B-cell activation and antibody production, autoantibody production, impairment of B-cell production in the bone marrow and loss of peripheral B-cells. In this article Muthana et al use a CTLA-4 humanized mouse model and examine the effects of drug conjugated CTLA-4 on the immune system. They observe a transient loss of B-cells in the blood of the treated mice. They then use a range of immune interventions such as T-cell depletion and blocking antibodies to demonstrate that this effect is dependent on T-cell activation.</p>
<p>Since anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy is in active clinical use exploration of its effects are welcome, this is helped by the use of a humanized CTLA-4 system which should be considered a strength of the paper. However, currently, the central premise of this paper, that B-cells are depleted, seems underexplored. Direct evidence of T-cell killing of B-cells is never presented, rather it is inferred from the reduced numbers of B-cells in the blood. The status of B-cells in sites that contain a large proportion of B-cells such as the spleen and lymph nodes is not examined. Additionally, no examination of B-cell antibody production is performed.</p>
