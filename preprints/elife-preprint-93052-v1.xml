<title>Abstract</title><p>Mammals have evolved sex-specific adaptations to reduce energy usage in times of food scarcity. These adaptations are well described for peripheral tissue, though much less is known about how the energy-expensive brain adapts to food restriction, and how such adaptations differ across the sexes. Here, we examined how food restriction impacts energy usage and function in the primary visual cortex (V1) of adult male and female mice. Molecular analysis and RNA sequencing in V1 revealed that in males, but not in females, food restriction significantly modulated canonical, energy-regulating pathways, including pathways associated with AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and oxidative phosphorylation. Moreover, we found that in contrast to males, food restriction in females did not significantly affect V1 ATP usage or visual coding precision (assessed by orientation selectivity). Decreased serum leptin is known to be necessary for triggering energy-saving changes in V1 during food restriction. Consistent with this, we found significantly decreased serum leptin in food-restricted males but no significant change in food-restricted females. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that cortical function and energy usage in female mice are more resilient to food restriction than in males. The neocortex, therefore, contributes to sex-specific, energy-saving adaptations in response to metabolic challenge.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mammals reduce their energy usage in times of food scarcity. These adaptations have been well documented for peripheral tissues and are sex-specific. For example, females, as compared to males, readily lose muscle and bone mass to reduce peripheral energy expenditure during food restriction, but lose less fat mass and overall bodyweight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Moreover, females are more likely to suppress energy-costly, reproductive functions during food restriction than males, evidenced by substantive reductions in uterine and ovarian mass, as well as a cessation of reproductive function and behaviour<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Such sex-specific differences are thought to reflect the differential importance of different organs to sex-specific survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In contrast to peripheral tissue, whether and how the brain adapts its function and energy use in a sex-specific manner during food scarcity remains largely unknown. The brain requires substantial amounts of energy to process and encode information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Indeed, the human brain, which comprises 2% of our body’s mass, consumes 20% of our caloric intake, over half of which is used by the cerebral cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Previously, we demonstrated that food restriction in male mice reduced energy usage in the primary visual cortex (V1) during visual processing, which was associated with a loss of orientation selectivity and visual coding precision<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. These changes required a decrease in levels of serum leptin, a hormone secreted by adipocytes in proportion to fat mass<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Thus, in males the cortex, like peripheral tissue, has the capacity to reduce its energy usage and function in times of food scarcity.</p>
<p>By contrast, it remains unclear to what extent the brain similarly contributes to energy-saving adaptations during food scarcity in mammalian females. Understanding how food restriction impacts cortical function in males and females is not only of fundamental importance for understanding the sex-specific impact of diet on brain function, but is also critical for studies of cortical function, in which food restriction is used to behaviourally motivate animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Here, we examined how food restriction leading to a 15% loss in body weight over 2-3 weeks impacts energy usage and visual coding in the primary visual cortex (V1) in adult male and female mice. We found that leptin levels, which regulate energy-saving changes in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, were maintained in females during food restriction, despite being decreased by approximately threefold in males. Consistent with these results, and using a range of experimental techniques, we failed to find significant energy-saving changes in V1 during food restriction in female mice, in contrast to male mice. Specifically, molecular analysis and RNA sequencing of V1 revealed that food-restriction significantly modified canonical energy-regulating cellular pathways in males, but not in females, including pathways associated with AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling, as well as oxidative phosphorylation. Moreover, using <italic>in vivo</italic> ATP and calcium imaging, we found that food restriction significantly reduced V1 ATP use and orientation selectivity in males, but not in females.</p>
<p>Collectively, our study demonstrates that in times of food restriction, visual cortical function and energy usage are largely maintained in female mice, while they are reduced in males. The neocortex, therefore, contributes to sex-specific, energy-saving adaptations in response to metabolic stress. Our research highlights the importance of taking into account sex differences when studying the impact of dietary manipulations on brain function.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We first examined sex-specific differences in how the neocortex adapts to food restriction in mice. Mice, 7-9 weeks of age, either had <italic>ad libwitum</italic> (CTR) access to food or were food restricted (FR) to 85% of their free feeding bodyweight, for 2-3 weeks (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Prior to any of our recordings, tissue collection, and analysis, all animals were given <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to food until sated. This enabled us to examine the long-term impact of caloric restriction on neocortical function, as opposed to the short-term impacts of hunger<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Sex-specific impact of food restriction on weight loss and fat mass-regulated hormone leptin</title>
<p>Prior to food restriction, we found that both males and females consumed the same <italic>ad libitum</italic> daily food intake, despite females weighing approximately 80% of age-matched males (weight: male vs. female; 29.42±0.20g vs 24.23±0.54g; t-test: p &lt; 0.001; n = 8 male mice and 7 female mice). Critically, we found that to achieve a similar magnitude (15%) and rate of weight loss in both sexes we had to impose a 40% greater restriction of daily food intake in females (average of 39% of <italic>ad libitum</italic> intake; n = 7 female mice) compared to males (27% of <italic>ad libitum</italic> intake; n = 8 male mice) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B,C</xref>). This is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that female mice are more resistant to weight loss than male<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Moreover, for similar bodyweight loss (15%) maintained over 2-3 weeks, serum leptin levels, which reflect fat mass, were markedly and significantly decreased (-72%) in males (t-test: p &lt; 0.001; n = 17 control male mice and n = 19 food-restricted male mice), but only modestly and non-significantly decreased (-28%) in females (t-test: p = 0.32; n = 23 control female mice and n = 11 food-restricted female mice) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). This is in keeping with previous findings that female mice are more resistant to fat loss than males<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> and that weight loss arises from other tissues including those associated with reproductive functions (ovarian and uterine mass)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Cellular energy-regulating pathways in cortex are significantly impacted by food restriction in males but not in females</title>
<p>Decreased leptin levels are necessary for triggering energy-saving changes in the mouse visual cortex during food restriction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. We therefore asked whether the absence of significant change in serum leptin in food-restricted females was associated with any change in V1 energy usage. We first assessed this at the molecular level by examining AMPK phosphorylation state. AMPK is a canonical cellular energy sensor activated by metabolic stress - such as food restriction, in part via decreased leptin signalling - through phosphorylation of threonine 172 (Thr<sup>172</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Its activation results in reduced ATP expenditure, for example, through the inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, and regulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. In V1, we found that AMPK Thr<sup>172</sup> phosphorylation was markedly and significantly elevated (2.9 fold) with food restriction in males (p &lt; 0.05; n = 11 control male mice and n = 15 food-restricted male mice), consistent with ATP savings, but only modestly increased (1.4 fold) in females; this increase was not statistically significant (p = 0.11; n = 11 control female mice and n = 6 food-restricted female mice) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). We also examined the activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), which is downstream of leptin signalling and is known to regulate fatty acid metabolism and energy homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. As with AMPK, we found that PPARα was significantly regulated by food restriction selectively in males, but not in females (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To further investigate how energy-regulating cellular pathways are impacted by food restriction, we performed RNA sequencing on tissue dissected from V1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>; n = 4 control male, n = 4 food-restricted male, n = 4 control female, and n = 4 food-restricted female mice). Differential gene expression analysis using DESeq2 revealed that food restriction significantly altered the expression of 657 and 585 targets in males and females, respectively (at a threshold of p-adj <underline>&lt;</underline> 0.1; only 125 of these were common to both sexes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). To assess the functional relevance of the transcriptomic changes induced by food restriction, we performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to identify pathways enriched in the differentially expressed populations. We found that food restriction resulted in a significant alteration of 34 and 14 gene sets (at p-adj <underline>&lt;</underline> 0.05) in males and females respectively; 13 of these were common to both sexes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>; Table 1; Table 2). In male mice, we specifically found that food restriction significantly regulated gene sets associated with canonical energy-regulating pathways (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), including those associated with oxidative phosphorylation and mTOR signalling (mTORC1 signalling and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling), as well as fatty acid metabolism; these pathways are known to regulated by leptin and AMPK signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Notably, these pathways were not significantly regulated by food-restriction in females. In addition to these findings, we found that gene sets associated to estrogen-regulating pathways were significantly regulated in food-restricted males and not in females (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). This is consistent with previous findings showing that estrogen, like leptin, suppresses food intake and promotes energy expenditure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Finally, consistent with past studies in cortex, we found that food restriction in males altered gene expression associated with inflammation and reactive oxidative species (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>ATP usage in V1 is significantly decreased under food restriction in males but not in females</title>
<p>We next examined energy usage in visual cortex during visual processing using two photon ATP imaging in V1 of awake, head-fixed Thy1-ATeam1.03<sup>YEMK</sup> mice, which express a FRET-based ATP sensor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>).

<title>Orientation selectivity in V1 is significantly reduced under food restriction in males but not in females</title>
<p>We next examined how food restriction impacts visual cortical function. In male mice, reductions in energy usage in V1 during food restriction are associated with a decreased visual coding precision as evidenced by a reduction of orientation selectivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Given the non-significant impact of food-restriction on energy usage in female mice, we reasoned that orientation selectivity would also be less impacted. We analysed two-photon calcium imaging data of V1 GCaMP6s-labeled layer 2/3 neurons in female mice viewing drifting gratings (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D-F</xref>; n = 7 control male, n = 8 food-restricted male, n = 7 control female, and n = 9 food-restricted female mice). Data obtained in females were compared to our previously published datasets obtained under similar conditions in male mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Consistent with our hypothesis, in contrast to males in which orientation selectivity was significantly reduced by 27% (p&lt;0.001), orientation selectivity was modestly and not significantly reduced by food-restriction in females (13%; p=0.08) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E-F</xref>).</p>

<title>Bayes factor analysis reveals statistically robust impact of metabolic stress on V1 energy use and visual coding in males, but not females</title>
<p>We used Bayes factor hypothesis testing to better assess the statistical impact of food restriction on visual cortical function and energy use in male and female mice (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>). Bayes factor analysis uses a Bayesian framework to quantify how much more likely the data is under the alternative hypothesis (<italic>i.e.</italic> there is an effect of food restriction) versus the null hypothesis (<italic>i.e.</italic> there is no effect of food restriction), quantified by the Bayes factor (BF<sub>10</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. A BF<sub>10</sub> &gt; 3, for example, means that the data is &gt;3 times more likely under the alternative hypothesis than the null hypothesis. Critically, the BF<sub>10</sub> allows for a more informative comparison of the effects of food restriction between sexes, as opposed to comparing p-values, which can be misleading<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Across the parameters of energy use and visual coding that we tested (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), BF<sub>10</sub> for males was consistently several-fold greater than that for females. Thus, visual cortical function and energy use was more robustly modulated by food restriction in males than in females.</p>
<p>Our findings however cannot rule out a potential, smaller impact of food restriction on cortical function and energy use in females, below the threshold for statistical detection in this study. The Bayes factor analysis helps to differentiate the absence of evidence from the evidence of absence. In particular, moderate evidence in support for the absence of an effect requires a BF<sub>10</sub> &lt; 0.33 (<italic>i.e.</italic> the data is 3 times more likely under the null hypothesis than the alternative hypothesis)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. For females, we found only 3 out of the 10 parameters had BF<sub>10</sub> &lt; 0.33 (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>), suggesting that food restriction may have a modest impact on V1 energy use or function, but below the limits of statistical detection in our study. Altogether, our results show that energy usage and coding precision in the visual cortex are largely maintained in female mice under food restriction while they are robustly reduced in males.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we find that in female mice, energy usage and visual coding in V1 is largely unchanged under food restriction. Using molecular analysis and RNA sequencing, we found that energy-regulating pathways were not significantly changed with food restriction in females, in contrast to males; these included pathways associated with AMPK, mTOR, and PPARα signalling, as well as oxidative phosphorylation. Consistent with this, we found that food restriction in females did not impact visual cortical ATP usage nor orientation selectivity, both of which were reduced by food restriction in males. Our findings suggest that the contribution of neocortex to energy-saving adaptations during food restriction is sex-selective and more pronounced in males; females may rely on other energy-saving strategies, such as reducing reproductive function, to cope with food restriction.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Limitations of the study</title>
<p>Our study focused on the effects of a moderate food restriction protocol over 2-3 weeks on neocortical function and energy use. This protocol is widely used in metabolic studies investigating the impact of caloric restriction on peripheral physiology, as well as in neuroscience studies to motivate rodents to perform specific behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. However, it remains unclear to what extent our findings generalize to other protocols of food restriction. Indeed, the duration, magnitude, and pattern of food restriction, as well as macronutrient composition are known to impact the physiological responses to dietary manipulations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Moreover, whilst we focussed our study on the adult visual cortex, it remains unclear if the brain shows similar sex-specific energy-saving adaptations in other cortical areas, and how such adaptations change with age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>A key strength of our study is that we consistently found, across a number of experimental methods, that changes in cortical function and energy use were significant in males, but not in females. However, a critical limitation of our study is that we did not have the statistical power to directly compare the effect size of food restriction between the sexes (e.g. ANOVA interaction effects); to do so would require a substantial increase in experimental group sizes by several fold. We addressed this limitation, in part, using Bayes factor analysis, which revealed that the impact of food restriction in males was indeed more robust than in females. This analysis also revealed that our study did not have sufficiently strong evidence to definitively rule out a smaller effect of food restriction in females, which may not have been statistically detectable.</p>

<title>Role of leptin and sex hormones in food restriction impact on cortical activity</title>
<p>Consistent with past studies, we found that food-restricted female mice resisted weight loss, and therefore required a greater restriction of food to achieve similar weight loss (relative to baseline) as males. In addition, for the same relative weight loss as males, females exhibited minimal reductions in serum leptin levels (secreted by adipocytes), consistent with past studies showing that females resist fat loss during food restriction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Similar effects have been observed across several mammalian species, including humans, and is thought to reflect the differential importance of fat stores for reproductive success in males and females<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Notably, we previously demonstrated that reductions in leptin levels during food restriction are necessary for driving energy-saving changes in visual cortical coding in male mice; leptin therefore acts as a critical signal linking the neocortex to fat stores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. That leptin levels are not significantly affected by food restriction in females may explain the minimal impact food restriction has on cortical energy usage and coding precision in female mice.</p>
<p>In addition to leptin, sex hormones likely contribute to sex-specific adaptations to food restriction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. As with leptin, estrogen suppresses food intake and promotes energy expenditure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, in part by augmenting leptin signalling by increasing leptin-induced phosphorylation of STAT3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Moreover, estrogen can enhance ATP production by sensitizing insulin signalling, enhancing glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, and along with progesterone, upregulating mitochondrial gene expression and function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Interestingly, in our study, RNA sequencing revealed that estrogen signalling pathways were significantly regulated in male visual cortex with food-restriction, and were unchanged in females. Estrogen may thus have overlapping effects with those induced by food restriction, thereby diminishing further responses to food restriction in females<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Notably, it was recently shown that sex differences in calorie-restriction’s metabolic effects that are observed in young adult mice, are largely absent in older mice, when females’ estrogen levels have declined<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Further studies will be needed to explore whether the resilience of cortical function found in this study in young cycling adult females is also observed in non-cycling mice with reduced oestrogen levels, such as in aged mice.</p>

<title>Sex-specific regulation of cellular energy-regulating pathways</title>
<p>AMPK and mTOR signalling pathways are canonical regulators of cellular energy usage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. We found these pathways, along with cortical ATP usage, to be significantly modulated by food-restriction in male, but not female mice. AMPK is activated during metabolic stress, and saves energy by regulating oxidative phosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, and inhibiting cellular pathways associated with energy usage, such as mTOR signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. mTOR signalling, by upregulating protein synthesis, increases ATP use by promoting neuronal excitability, neurite outgrowth, ion channel expression, and synaptic plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. mTOR signalling is therefore ideally situated to regulate how much ATP is used in neuronal function; its inhibition may underlie ATP savings and the associated loss of coding precision with food-restriction in male mice. Notably, previous studies have found sex- and tissue-dependent regulation of AMPK and mTOR signalling, including in response to food restriction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. For example, in skeletal muscle, mTOR signalling is enhanced by fasting selectively in male, but not female mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Moreover, metabolic challenge by endurance training induces greater AMPK activity in cardiac tissue in male, as opposed to female mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Our study extends the sex-specific regulation of these energy-regulating pathways to the neocortex.</p>

<title>Importance of biological sex on the impact of food restriction on cortical function</title>
<p>Food restriction protocols are widely used to motivate animals in behavioural studies examining cortical function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Our findings suggest that these protocols are likely to have greater impacts on basal neocortical function in males, as compared to females. Consistent with this, a recent study has found that food restriction in juvenile mice strongly impacts cognitive flexibility in learning and decision-making in adulthood, specifically for males but not females<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Such sex-specific impacts of food restriction on neocortical function are important to take into consideration in the design and interpretation of such studies.</p>
<p>Diet is known to have a considerable impact on neurological diseases, including epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Whilst calorie restricted diets have proven to be of benefit in this regard, the sex-dependency of such interventions have not been thoroughly investigated, though on the basis of our findings it is conceivable that males and females may respond differently to dietary interventions. The inclusion of both males and females in biomedical research, and the study of sex differences, is therefore of considerable importance for ensuring efficacious treatments are developed for both sexes.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we find that visual cortical coding and energy usage in females are resistant to food restriction, in contrast to males. Our findings establish that sex-specific adaptations in energy usage, previously described in peripheral tissue under metabolic challenge, extends to the neocortex.</p>

<title>AAV injection and cranial window</title>
<p>For calcium imaging experiments, C57BL6 were anesthetized using isoflurane, and given pre-operative analgesia (vetergesic: 0.1 mg/kg; carprieve: 5 mg/kg; rapidexon: 2 mg/kg) along with warm Ringer’s solution (25ml/kg) subcutaneously; vetergesic jelly was additionally given orally post-operatively 24 hours later. Opaque eye cream was applied to the eyes (Bepanthen, Bayer, Germany). A craniotomy (2×2 mm) was applied over left V1 (centre at 2.5 mm mediolateral and 0.5 mm anterior to lambda). Flexed GCaMP6S (AAV1.Syn.Flex.GCaMP6s.WPRE.SV40; Addgene; RRID:Addgene_105558-AAV1) diluted 1:10 in saline, along with CaMKII-dependent Cre-recombinase (AAV1.CamKII 0.4.Cre.SV40; Addgene; RRID:Addgene_105558-AAV1) diluted 1:100 saline was injected at the centre of the craniotomy via a sharp glass pipette. Injections were targeted to layer 2/3, with 100 nL of virus solution injected (2.5nL/30s) at each of 3 depths (150, 250 and 350 μm) via a sharp glass pipette using a Nanoject III (Drummond Scientific). A glass window was then used to seal the craniotomy, and superglued in place. The window was made of 1 or 2 glass coverslips (Menzel-Glaser # 0), in the latter case the 2 cover slips were glued together with optically-clear, UV-cured glue (Norland Optical Adhesive no. 60); the inner window was 2.0 mm x 2.0 mm, the outer window was 2.5 mm x 2.5 mm. A metal headplate was then fixed to the skull with super glue and dental cement (Paladur, Heraeus Kuzler). It took 3-6 weeks for viral expression prior to experimentation.</p>

One the day of experimentation, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane and given pre-operative analgesia (Carprieve: 5 mg/kg) and 25 mL/kg of warm Ringer’s solution subcutaneously. A headplate was first fixed to the skull with superglue and dental cement, after which a small craniotomy (∼0.5 x ∼0.5 mm) was made over left V1 (centre at 2.5 mm mediolateral and 0.5 mm anterior to lambda), which was covered with agarose (1-2%) and silicone. Following recovery from anaesthesia (30-60 minutes) the animal was head-fixed; the agarose and silicone were removed and replaced with HEPES-buffered ACSF (in mM: 124 NaCl, 20 Glucose, 10 HEPES, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>; pH 7.2-7.4).</p>

CFP and YFP fluorescence were recorded simultaneously using a 515nm long-pass dichroic mirror with the following emission filters: 485/70nm for CFP and 535/45nm for YFP (mirror and filter set: T515lpxr C156624; Scientifica). Imaging data was acquired during the presentation of visual stimuli, with at least 10 replicate trials for each visual stimulus.

<p>Grating responsive neurons were defined as those for which grating responses were better fit with a double Gaussian curve (direction responses) than with a flat line at zero (null model), which was determined using Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. The double Gaussian curve was defined as:</p>
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="561185v1_ueqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
<p>Where R (θ) is the response at a given direction angle θ, C is an offset, R<sub>p</sub> is the response to the preferred direction after subtracting the offset, θ<sub>pref</sub> is the angle of the preferred direction, R<sub>n</sub> is the response to the null direction after subtracting the offset, and <italic>ang<sub>air</sub></italic>(<italic>x</italic>) = min (<italic>x, x</italic> − 360, <italic>x</italic> + 360), which constrains angular differences to 0-180°, and σ is the standard deviation of the curve.</p>
<p>BIC was given by:</p>
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="561185v1_ueqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
<p>Where n is the number of responses, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="561185v1_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is the mean residual sum of squares of the model, and k is the number of free parameters used by the model, which was zero in the case of the null model. A neuron was considered significantly grating-responsive if the BIC<sub>null</sub> - BIC<sub>Gaussian</sub> <underline>&gt;</underline> 10, which provides strong evidence against the null model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Orientation selectivity</title>
<p>The orientation selective index (OSI) of grating-responsive neurons was calculated as 1 – circular variance based on the mean response of the neuron to each; values less than zero were set to zero. OSI was given by:</p>
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="561185v1_ueqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>

<title>ATP measurements</title>
<p>For ATeam1.03<sup>YEMK</sup> imaging, CFP and YFP fluorescence was averaged across ROIs drawn around visible soma in the field of view, after background subtraction. FRET was calculated as a ratio of YFP/CFP fluorescence, and decayed as a function of time with visual stimulation in the presence of ATP synthesis inhibitors. The FRET signal was bound between 0 and 1 by first subtracting the mean FRET signal during the last 3 imaging trials (the FRET signal plateaued at this point), and then dividing by the mean FRET signal at baseline. The FRET decay half time was defined as the time required for the FRET to decay to 50% of its baseline value.</p>

<p>RNA sequencing reads were mapped, using STAR 2.4.oi, to the <italic>Mus musculus</italic> primary assembly (Ensembl v80)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. FeatureCounts 1.4.6-p2 was used to count reads uniquely aligned to annotated genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>.

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>Statistical tests, p values, and the number and definition of independent units are stated in the figure legends. For all measures, the number of animals was taken as the statically independent unit. Sample size was determined by <italic>a priori</italic> based on calculations, with an aim of achieving 80% power on the basis of a 20% group difference and a significance threshold of p &lt; 0.05. Group means and variances were taken from pilot data or previously published data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Where applicable, ANOVA was used to assess significance, followed by <italic>post-hoc</italic> Fisher LSD tests to prevent loss of power. Statistical tests were carried out in Prism 6 (GraphPad Prism; RRID:SCR_002798). Averages denoted in figures represent means, with error bars representing the standard error of the means (S.E.M.). We complemented our statistical analyses using Bayes factor hypothesis testing (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>) as described in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> using JASP software to calculates Bayes factor, effect size, and confidence intervals (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://jasp-stats.org/">https://jasp-stats.org/</ext-link>). As recommended, we used a default, Cauchy distribution with a spread of 1/√2 as a prior distribution of effect size. A BF<sub>10 &lt;</sub> 0.33 is considered to be moderate evidence for the absence of an effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>This study provides <bold>important</bold> findings based on <bold>convincing</bold> evidence demonstrating that females and males have different strategies to regulate energy consumption in the brain in the context of low energy intake. While food deprivation reduces energy consumption and visual processing performance in the visual cortex of males, the female cortex is unaffected, likely at the expense of other functions. This study is relevant for scientists interested in body metabolism and neuroscience.</p>

<p>Padamsey et al. followed up on their previous study in which they found that male mice sacrifice visual cortex computation precision to save energy in periods of food restriction (Padamsey et al. 2021, Neuron). In the present study, the authors find that female mice show much lower levels of adaptation in response to food restriction on the level of metabolic signaling and visual cortex computation. This is an important finding for understanding sex differences in adaptation to food scarcity and also impacts the interpretation of studies employing food restriction in behavioral analyses and learning paradigms.</p>
<p>The manuscript is, in general, very clear and the conclusions are straightforward. The main limitation, that the number of experiments is insufficient to compare the effects of food restriction in males and females directly, is discussed by the authors: to address this point they use Bayes factor analysis to provide an estimate of the likelihood that females and males indeed differ in terms of energy metabolism and sensory processing adaptions during food restriction.</p>
<p>The following points are not entirely clear yet.</p>
<p>
1. For a number of experiments the authors use their new data set on females and compare that with the data set previously published on males. In how far are these data sets comparable? Have they been performed originally in parallel for example using siblings of different sexes or have the experiments been conducted several years apart from each other? What is the expected variability, if one repeated these experiments with the same sex considering the differences/similarities between experimental setups, housing conditions, interindividual differences, etc.?</p>
<p>2. Energy consumption and visual processing may differ between periods in which animals are in different behavioral states. Is there a possibility that male and female mice differed in behavioral state during measurements? Were animals running or resting during visual stimulation and during ATP measurements?</p>
<p>3. Related to the previous point: the authors show that ATP consumption was reduced in male mice during visual stimulation. What about visual cortex ATP consumption in the absence of visual stimulation? Do food-deprived males and/or females show lower ATP consumption in the visual cortex e.g. during sleep?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Padamsey et al build up on previous significant work from the same group which demonstrated robust changes in the visual cortex in male mice from long-term (2-3 weeks) food restriction. Here, the authors extend this finding and reveal striking sex-specific differences in the way the brain responds to food restriction. The measures included the whole-body measure of serum leptin levels, and V1-specific measures of activity of key molecular players (AMPK and PPARα), gene expression patterns, ATP usage in V1, and the sharpness of visual stimulus encoding (orientation tuning). All measures supported the conclusion that the female mouse brain (unlike in males) does not change its energy usage and cortical functional properties on comparable food restriction.</p>
<p>While the effect of food restriction on more peripheral tissue such as muscle and bones has been well studied, this result contributes to our understanding of how the brain responds to food restriction. This result is particularly significant given that the brain consumes a large fraction of the body's energy consumption (20%), with the cortex accounting for half of that amount. The sex-specific differences found here are also relevant for studies using food restriction to investigate cortical function.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The study uses a wide range of approaches mentioned above which converge on the same conclusion, strengthening the core claim of the study.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Since the absence of a significant effect does not prove the absence of any changes, the study cannot claim that the female mouse brain does not change in response to food restriction. However, the authors do not make this claim. Instead, they make the well-supported claim that there is a sex-specific difference in the response of V1 to food restriction.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors food-deprived male and female mice and observed a much stronger reduction of leptin levels, energy consumption in the visual cortex, and visual coding performance in males than females. This indicates a sex-specific strategy for the regulation of the energy budget in the face of low food availability.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This study extends a previous study demonstrating the effect of food deprivation on visual processing in males, by providing a set of clear experimental results, demonstrating the sex-specific difference. It also provides hypotheses about the strategy used by females to reduce energy budget based on the literature.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The authors do not provide evidence that females are not impacted by visually guided behaviors contrary to what was shown in males in the previous study.</p>
