<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Hippocampal place cells in freely moving rodents display both theta phase precession and procession, which is thought to play important roles in cognition, but the neural mechanism for producing theta phase shift remains largely unknown. Here we show that firing rate adaptation within a continuous attractor neural network causes the neural activity bump to oscillate around the external input, resembling theta sweeps of decoded position during locomotion. These forward and backward sweeps naturally account for theta phase precession and procession of individual neurons, respectively. By tuning the adaptation strength, our model explains the difference between “bimodal cells” showing interleaved phase precession and procession, and “unimodal cells” in which phase precession predominates. Our model also explains the constant cycling of theta sweeps along different arms in a T-maze environment, the speed modulation of place cells’ firing frequency, and the continued phase shift after transient silencing of the hippocampus. We hope that this study will aid an understanding of the neural mechanism supporting theta phase coding in the brain.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>One of the strongest candidates for temporal coding of a cognitive variable by neural firing is the ‘theta phase precession’ shown by hippocampal place cells. As an animal runs through the firing field of a place cell, the cell fires at progressively earlier phases in successive cycles of the ongoing LFP theta oscillation, so that firing phase correlates with distance traveled (<bold><italic><xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">O’Keefe and Recce, 1993</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Skaggs et al., 1996</xref></italic></bold>) (see also (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref></italic></bold>)) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a&amp;b</xref>). At the population level, phase precession of individual cells gives rise to forward theta sequences once starting phases are aligned across the population (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Feng et al., 2015</xref></italic></bold>), where neurons representing successive locations along the trajectory of the animal display predictable firing sequences within individual theta cycles (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Johnson and Redish, 2007</xref></italic></bold>). These prospective sequential experiences (looking into the future) are potentially useful for a range of cognitive faculties, e.g., planning, imagination, and decision-making (<bold><italic><xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">O’Keefe and Recce, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Skaggs et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hassabis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Wikenheiser and Redish, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kay et al., 2020</xref></italic></bold>).</p>

<p>Besides prospective representation, flexible behaviors also require retrospective representation of sequential experiences (looking into the past). For instance, in goal-directed behaviors, it is important to relate the reward information that might only occur at the end of a sequence of events to preceding events in the sequence (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Foster et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Foster and Wilson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Diba and Buzsáki, 2007</xref></italic></bold>). A recent experimental study (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wang et al., 2020</xref></italic></bold>) described retrospective sequences during online behaviors (also indicated by (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Skaggs et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Yamaguchi et al., 2002</xref></italic></bold>)), namely, reverse theta sequences, interleaved with forward theta sequences in individual theta cycles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Such retrospective sequences, together with the prospective sequences, may cooperate to establish higher-order associations in episodic memory (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Diba and Buzsáki, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Jaramillo and Kempter, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Pfeiffer, 2020</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>While a large number of computational models of phase precession and the associated forward theta sequences have been proposed, e.g., the single cell oscillatory models (<bold><italic><xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">O’Keefe and Recce, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kamondi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Harris et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lengyel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Losonczy et al., 2010</xref></italic></bold>) and recurrent activity spreading models (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tsodyks et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Romani and Tsodyks, 2015</xref></italic></bold>), the underlying neural mechanism for interleaved forward-and reverse-ordered sequences remains largely unclear. Do reverse theta sequences share the same underlying neural mechanism as forward sequences, or do they reflect different mechanisms? If they do, what kind of neural architecture can support the emergence of both kinds of theta phase shift? Furthermore, since forward theta sequences are commonly seen, but reverse theta sequences are only seen in some circumstances (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wang et al., 2020</xref></italic></bold>), are they commensurate with forward theta sequences? If not, to what degree are forward theta sequences more significant than the reverse ones?</p>
<p>To address these questions, we built a continuous attractor neural network (CANN) of the hippocampal place cell population (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Amari, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Tsodyks and Sejnowski, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Samsonovich and McNaughton, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Tsodyks, 1999</xref></italic></bold>). The CANN conveys a map of the environment in its recurrent connections that affords a single bump of activity on a topographically organized sheet of cells which can move smoothly so as to represent the location of the animal as it moves in the environment. Each neuron exhibits firing rate adaptation which destabilizes the bump attractor state. When the adaptation is strong enough, the network bump can travel spontaneously in the attractor space, which we term as the intrinsic mobility. Intriguingly, we show that, under competition between the intrinsic mobility and the extrinsic mobility caused by location-dependent sensory inputs, the network displays an oscillatory tracking state, in which the network bump sweeps back and forth around the external sensory input. This phenomenon naturally explains the theta sweeps found in the hippocampus (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Skaggs et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Burgess et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Foster and Wilson, 2007</xref></italic></bold>), where the decoded position sweeps around the animal’s physical position at theta frequency. More specifically, phase precession occurs when the bump propagates forward while phase procession occurs when the network bump propagates backward. Moreover, we find that neurons can exhibit either only predominant phase precession (unimodal cells) when adaptation is relatively strong, or interleaved phase precession and procession (bimodal cells) when adaptation is relatively weak.</p>
<p>In addition to theta phase shift, our model also successfully explains the constant cycling of theta sweeps along different upcoming arms in a T-maze environment (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kay et al., 2020</xref></italic></bold>), and other phenomena related to phase precession of place cells (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Geisler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Zugaro et al., 2005</xref></italic></bold>). We hope that this study facilitates our understanding of the neural mechanism underlying the rich dynamics of hippocampal neurons and lays the foundation for unveiling their computational functions.</p>

<title>A network model of hippocampal place cells</title>
<p>To study the phase shift of hippocampal place cells, we focus on a one-dimensional (1D) continuous attractor neural network (CANN) (mimicking the animal moving on a linear track, see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>), but generalization to the 2D case (mimicking the animal moving in a 2D arena) is straightforward (see Discussion for more details). Neurons in the 1D CANN can be viewed as place cells rearranged according to the locations of their firing fields on the linear track (measured during free exploration). The dynamics of the 1D CANN is written as

<p>Here <italic>U</italic> (<italic>x, t</italic>) represents the presynaptic input to the neuron located at position <italic>x</italic> on the linear track, and <italic>r</italic>(<italic>x, t</italic>) represents the corresponding firing rate constrained by global inhibition (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hao et al., 2009</xref></italic></bold>). <italic>τ</italic> is the time constant, <italic>ρ</italic> the neuron density, <italic>k</italic> the global inhibition strength, and <italic>g</italic> is the gain factor. The dynamics of <italic>U</italic> (<italic>x, t</italic>) is determined by the leaky term −<italic>U</italic>(<italic>x, t</italic>), the recurrent input from other neurons, the firing rate adaptation −<italic>V</italic> (<italic>x, t</italic>), and the external input <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>ext</italic></sub>(<italic>x, t</italic>). The recurrent connection strength <italic>J</italic> (<italic>x, x</italic>′) between two neurons decays with their distance. For simplicity, we set <italic>J</italic> (<italic>x, x</italic>′) to be the Gaussian form, i.e., <italic>J</italic> (<italic>x, x</italic>′) = <italic>J</italic><sub>0</sub>/(2<italic>πa</italic>) exp −(<italic>x</italic> − <italic>x</italic>′)<sup>2</sup>/(2<italic>a</italic><sup>2</sup>), with <italic>J</italic><sub>0</sub> controlling the connection strength and <italic>a</italic> the range of neuronal interaction. Such connectivity gives rise to a synaptic weight matrix with the property of translation invariance. Together with the global inhibition, the translation invariant weight matrix ensures that the network can hold a continuous family of stationary states (attractors) when no external input and adaptation exist (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Tsodyks and Sejnowski, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Samsonovich and McNaughton, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">McNaughton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Wu et al., 2008</xref></italic></bold>), where each attractor is a localized firing bump representing a single spatial location (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). These bump states are expressed as (see Methods. for the parameter settings and SI.2 for the detailed mathematical derivation):
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="516400v2_eqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) denotes the bump height and <italic>z</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) the bump center, i.e., the spatial location represented by the network. For convenience, we set the external input to be of the Gaussian form, which is written as <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>ext</italic></sub>(<italic>x, t</italic>) = <italic>α</italic> exp [−(<italic>x</italic> − <italic>ν</italic><sub><italic>ext</italic></sub><italic>t</italic>)<sup>2</sup>/(4<italic>a</italic><sup>2</sup>)], with <italic>ν</italic><sub><italic>ext</italic></sub> representing the moving speed and <italic>α</italic> controlling the external input strength. Such external moving input represents location-dependent sensory inputs (i.e., corresponding to the animal’s physical location) which might be conveyed via the entorhinal-hippocampal or subcortical pathways (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Van Strien et al., 2009</xref></italic></bold>). The term −<italic>V</italic> (<italic>x, t</italic>) represents the firing rate adaptation (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alonso and Klink, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Fuhrmann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Benda and Herz, 2003</xref></italic></bold>), whose dynamics is written as

where <italic>m</italic> controls the adaptation strength, and <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>ν</italic></sub> is the time constant. The condition <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>ν</italic></sub> ≫ <italic>τ</italic> holds, implying that the firing rate adaptation is a much slower process compared to neuronal firing. In effect, the firing rate adaptation increases with the neuronal activity and contributes to destabilizing the active bump state, which induce rich dynamics of the network (see below).</p>

<title>Oscillatory tracking of the network</title>
<p>Overall, the bump motion in the network is determined by two competing factors, i.e., the external input and the adaptation. The interplay between these two factors leads to the network exhibiting oscillatory tracking in an appropriate parameter regime. To elucidate the underlying mechanism clearly, we explore the effects of the external input and the adaptation on bump motion separately. First, when firing rate adaptation does not exist in the network (<italic>m</italic> = 0), the bump tracks the external moving input smoothly (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). We refer to this as the <bold>“smooth tracking state”</bold>, where the internal location represented in the hippocampus (the bump position) is continuously tracking the animal’s physical location (the external input location). This smooth tracking property of CANNs has been widely used to model spatial navigation in the hippocampus (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Tsodyks and Sejnowski, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Samsonovich and McNaughton, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">McNaughton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Battaglia and Treves, 1998</xref></italic></bold>). Second, when the external drive does not exist in the network (<italic>α</italic> = 0) and the adaptation strength <italic>m</italic> exceeds a threshold (<italic>m</italic> &gt; <italic>τ</italic>/<italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>ν</italic></sub>), the bump moves spontaneously with a speed calculated as <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="516400v2_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d&amp;e</xref> and Methods. for more details). We refer to this as the <bold>“travelling wave state”</bold>, where the internal representation of location in the hippocampus is sequentially reactivated without external drive, resembling replay-like dynamics during a quiescent state (see Discussion for more details). This intrinsic mobility of the bump dynamics can be intuitively understood as follows. Neurons around the bump center have the highest firing rates and hence receive the strongest adaptation. Such strong adaptation destabilizes the bump stability at the current location, and hence pushes the bump away. After moving to a new location, the bump will be continuously pushed away by the firing rate adaptation at the new location. As a result, the bump keeps moving on the linear track. Similar mechanisms have been applied to explain mental exploration (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hopfield, 2010</xref></italic></bold>), preplay during sharp wave-ripple events in the hippocampus (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Azizi et al., 2013</xref></italic></bold>), and the free memory recall phenomenon in the brain (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dong et al., 2021</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>When both the external input and adaptation are applied to the CANN, the interplay between the extrinsic mobility (caused by the external input) and the intrinsic mobility (caused by the adaptation) will induce three different dynamical behaviors of the network (see <bold>video 1</bold> for demonstration), i.e., 1) when <italic>m</italic> is small and <italic>α</italic> is large, the network displays the smooth tracking state; 2) when <italic>m</italic> is large and <italic>α</italic> is small, the network displays the travelling wave state; 3) when both <italic>m</italic> and <italic>α</italic> have moderate values, the network bump displays an interesting state, called the <bold>“oscillatory tracking state”</bold>, where the bump tracks the external moving input in an oscillatory fashion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f&amp;g</xref>). Intuitively, the mechanism for oscillatory tracking can be understood as follows. Due to the intrinsic mobility of the network, the bump tends to move at its own intrinsic speed (which is faster than the external moving input, see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>), i.e., the bump tries to escape from the external input. However, due to the strong locking effect of the external input, the bump can not run too far away from the location input, but instead, is attracted back to the location input. Once the bump returns, it will keep moving in the opposite direction of the external input until it is pulled back by the external input again. Over time, the bump will sweep back and forth around the external moving input, displaying the oscillatory tracking behavior.</p>
<p>Our study shows that during oscillatory tracking, the bump shape is roughly unchanged (see Sec. for the condition of shape variability), and the bump oscillation can be well represented as the bump center sweeping around the external input location. The dynamics of the bump center can be approximated as a propagating sinusoidal wave (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>), i.e.,

where <italic>z</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) is the bump center at time <italic>t</italic> (see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3">Eq. 3</xref>). <italic>s</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) denotes the displacement between the bump center and the external input, which oscillates at the frequency <italic>ω</italic> with the amplitude <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> &gt; 0 and a constant offset <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> &gt; 0 (see Methods. for the values of these parameters and SI.3 for the detailed derivation). When the firing rate adaptation is relatively small, the bump oscillation frequency can be analytically solved to be (see also Fig.S1):

<p>We see that the bump oscillation frequency <italic>ω</italic> increases sublinearly with the external input strength <italic>α</italic> and the adaptation strength <italic>m</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h&amp;i</xref>). By setting the parameters appropriately, the bump can oscillate in the theta band (6-10 Hz), thus approximating the experimentally observed theta sweeps (see below). Notably, LFP theta is not explicitly modelled in the network. However, since theta sweeps are bounded by individual LFP theta cycles in experiments, they share the same oscillation frequency as LFP theta. For convenience, we will frequently use LFP theta below and study firing phase shift in individual oscillation cycles.</p>

where <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) is the bump height, and <italic>h</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) is an oscillatory moving term denoting the displacement between the bump center and the location of the probe neuron.

It can be seen that the firing rate of the probe neuron is determined by two factors, <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) and <italic>h</italic>(<italic>t</italic>). To simplify the analysis below, we assume that the bump height <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) remains unchanged during bump oscillations (for the case of time-varying bump height, see Sec.). Thus, the firing rate only depends on <italic>h</italic>(<italic>t</italic>), which is further determined by two time-varying terms, the oscillation term <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> sin <italic>ωt</italic> and the location of the external input <italic>ν</italic><sub><italic>ext</italic></sub><italic>t</italic>. The first term contributes to firing rate oscillations of the probe neuron, and the second term contributes to the envelope of neuronal oscillations exhibiting a waxing-and-waning profile over time, as the external input traverses the firing field (the absolute value |<italic>ν</italic><sub><italic>ext</italic></sub><italic>t</italic>| first decreases and then increases; see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>, also <bold>video 2</bold>).

<p>In summary, oscillatory tracking of the CANN well explains the firing phase shift of place cells when the animal traverses their firing fields. Specifically, when the animal enters the place field, the firing phase of the neuron remains constant, i.e., no phase shift occurs, which agrees with experimental observations (<bold><italic><xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">O’Keefe and Recce, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Skaggs et al., 1996</xref></italic></bold>). As the animal approaches the centre of the place field, the firing phase of the neuron starts to shift in two streams, one to earlier phases during the forward sweeps and the other to later phases during the backward sweeps. Finally, when the animal leaves the place field, the firing phase of the neuron stops shifting and remains constant. Over the whole process, the firing phase of a place cell is shifted by 180 degrees, which agrees with experimental observations (<bold><italic><xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">O’Keefe and Recce, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Skaggs et al., 1996</xref></italic></bold>).</p>

<title>Different adaptation strengths account for bimodal and unimodal cells</title>
<p>The results above show that during oscillatory tracking, a place cell exhibits both significant phase precession and procession, which are associated with two firing peaks in a theta cycle. These neurons have been described as bimodal cells (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wang et al., 2020</xref></italic></bold>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Conversely, previous experiments have primarily focused on the phase precession of place cell firing, while tending to ignore phase procession, which is a relatively weaker phenomenon (<bold><italic><xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">O’Keefe and Recce, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Skaggs et al., 1996</xref></italic></bold>). Place cells with negligible phase procession have been described as unimodal cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). Here, we show that by adjusting a single parameter in the model, i.e., the adaptation strength <italic>m</italic>, neurons in the CANN can exhibit either interleaved phase precession and procession (bimodal cells) or predominant phase precession (unimodal cells). To understand this, we first recall that the firing rate adaptation is a much slower process compared to neural firing and its timescale is in the same order as the LFP theta (i.e., <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>ν</italic></sub> = 100 ms while <italic>τ</italic> = 5 ms). This implies that when the bump sweeps over a neuron, the delayed adaptation it generates will suppress the bump height as it sweeps back to the same location. Furthermore, since the oscillatory tracking always begins with a forward sweep (as the initial sweep is triggered by the external input moving in the same direction), the suppression effects are asymmetric, that is, forward sweeps always strongly suppress backward sweeps. On the contrary, the opposite effect is much smaller, since neuronal activities in backward sweeps have already been suppressed, and they can only generate weak adaptation. Because of this asymmetric suppression, the bump height in the forward sweep is always higher than that in the backward sweep (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref> and Fig.S2a). When the adaptation strength <italic>m</italic> is small, the suppression effect is not significant, and the attenuation of the bump height during the backward sweep is small (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). In such case, the firing behavior of a place cell is similar to the situation as the bump height remains unchanged as analyzed in Sec., i.e., the neuron can generate two firing peaks in a theta cycle at the phase shift stage, manifesting the property of a bimodal cell of having both significant phase precession and procession (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e&amp;g</xref> and <bold>video 2</bold>). When the adaptation strength <italic>m</italic> is large, the bump height in the backward sweep attenuates dramatically (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c&amp;d</xref> and the video demonstration). As a result, the firing peak of a place cell in the backward sweep becomes nearly invisible at the phase shift stage, and the neuron exhibits only predominant phase precession, manifesting the property of a unimodal cell (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f&amp;h</xref> and <bold>video 3</bold>).</p>

</fig>
<p>In summary, different adaptation strengths explain the emergence of bimodal and unimodal cells. In fact, there is no sharp separation between bimodal and unimodal cells. As the firing rate adaptation gets stronger, the network bump is more attenuated during the backwards sweep, and cells with the bimodal firing property will gradually behave more like those with the unimodal firing property (see Fig.S2b). Moreover, our model confirms that even though phase procession is weak, it still exist in unimodal cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4h</xref> lower panel), which has been reported in previous studies (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Yamaguchi et al., 2002</xref></italic></bold>). This implies that phase procession is not a characteristic feature of bimodal cells, but instead, is likely a common feature of hippocampal activity, with a strength controlled by adaptation. Furthermore, the experimental data (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fernández-Ruiz et al., 2017</xref></italic></bold>) has indicated that there is a laminar difference between unimodal cells and bimodal cells, with bimodal cells correlating more with the firing patterns of deep CA1 neurons and unimodal cells with the firing patterns of superficial CA1 neurons. Our model suggests that this difference may come from the different adaptation strengths in the two layers.</p>

<title>Constant cycling of multiple future scenarios in a T-maze environment</title>
<p>We have shown that our model can reproduce the forward and backward theta sweeps of decoded position when the animal runs on a linear track. It is noteworthy that there is only a single hypothetical future scenario in the linear track environment, i.e, ahead of the animal’s position, and hence place cells firing phase can only encode future positions in one direction. However, flexible behaviors requires the animal encoding multiple hypothetical future scenarios in a quick and constant manner, e.g., during decision-making and planning in complex environments (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Johnson and Redish, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Wikenheiser and Redish, 2015</xref></italic></bold>). One recent study (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kay et al., 2020</xref></italic></bold>) showed constant cycling of theta sweeps in a T-maze environment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>), that is, as the animal approaches the choice point, the decoded position from hippocampal activity propagates down one of the two arms alternatively in successive LFP theta cycles. To reproduce this phenomenon, we change the structure of the CANN from a linear track shape to a T-maze shape where the neurons are aligned according to the location of their firing fields in the T-maze environment. Neurons are connected with a strength proportional to the Euclidean distance between their firing fields on the T-maze and the parameters are set such that the network is in the oscillatory tracking state (see details in Methods.). Mimicking the experimental protocol, we let the external input (the artificial animal) move from the end of the center arm to the choice point. At the beginning, when the external input is far away from the choice point, the network bump sweeps back and forth along the center arm, similar to the situation on the linear track. As the external input approaches the choice point, the network bump starts to sweep onto left and right arms alternatively in successive theta cycles (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref> and <bold>video 4</bold>). The underlying mechanism is straightforward. Suppose that the bump first sweeps to the left arm from the current location, it will sweep back to the current location first due to the attraction of the external input. Then in the next round, the bump will sweep to the right arm, since the neurons on the left arm are suppressed due to adaptation. This cycling process repeats constantly between the two upcoming arms before the external input enters one of the two arms (i.e, before the decision is made). At the single cell level, this bump cycling phenomenon gives rise to the “cycle skipping” effect (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kay et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Deshmukh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brandon et al., 2013</xref></italic></bold>), where a neuron whose place field is on one of the two arms fires on every other LFP theta cycle before the decision is made (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref> left panel and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref> upper panel). For example, a pair of cells with firing fields on each of the two arms will fire in regular alternation on every other theta cycle (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref> right panel and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref> lower panel).

</fig>
<p>In summary, our model, extended to a T-maze structure, explains the constant cycling of two possible future scenarios in a T-maze environment. The underlying mechanism relies on delayed adaptation, which alternately causes neurons on one arm to be more suppressed than those on the other arm. Such high-speed cycling may contribute to the quick and continuous sampling among multiple future scenarios in real-world decision-making and planning (see Discussion for more details).</p>

<title>Robust phase coding of position with place cells</title>
<p>As the firing rate shows large variability when the animal runs through the firing field (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fenton and Muller, 1998</xref></italic></bold>), it has been suggested that the theta phase shift provides an additional mechanism to improve the localization of animals (<bold><italic><xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr">O’keefe and Burgess, 2005</xref></italic></bold>). Indeed, (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Jensen and Lisman, 2000</xref></italic></bold>) showed that taking phase into account leads to a significant improvement in the accuracy of localizing the animal. To demonstrate the robustness of phase coding, previous experiments showed two intriguing findings: a linear relationship between the firing frequency of place cells and the animal moving speed (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Geisler et al., 2007</xref></italic></bold>), and the continued phase shift after interruption of hippocampal activity (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Zugaro et al., 2005</xref></italic></bold>). We show that our model can also reproduce these two phenomena.</p>
<p>To investigate the relationship between the single cell’s oscillation frequency and the animal’s running speed, we consider a unimodal cell with predominant phase precession as studied in the experiment (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Geisler et al., 2007</xref></italic></bold>). Firstly, our model shows that the LFP theta frequency (the bump oscillation frequency <italic>ω</italic>) is largely independent of the running speed of the animal (the speed of the external input, see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn6">Eq. 6</xref>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>). The phase precession implies that the oscillation frequency of a place cell is higher than LFP theta frequency, since firing precesses to earlier phases over theta cycles (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a&amp;b</xref>). Secondly, we can analytically quantify how the single cell’s oscillation frequency is modulated by the external moving speed. As shown in Sec., the distance the animal travels during the phase shift stage is 2<italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub>, which gives the travelling time <italic>T</italic> = 2<italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub>/<italic>ν</italic><sub><italic>ext</italic></sub> and the number of theta cycles for phase precession <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>f</italic></sub> = <italic>T ω</italic>. Since the total amount of phase shift over the whole process is <italic>π</italic> (i.e, half of the theta cycle, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>), it means that <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>f</italic></sub> firing peaks are generated by a unimodal cell within <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>f</italic></sub> = (<italic>T ω</italic> − 0.5)/<italic>ω</italic> units of time. Thus, the firing frequency of the cell is calculated to be <italic>ω</italic><sub><italic>f</italic></sub> = <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>f</italic></sub> /<italic>T</italic><sub><italic>f</italic></sub> ≈ <italic>ω</italic> + 0.25<italic>ν</italic><sub><italic>ext</italic></sub>/<italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> (where the condition <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>f</italic></sub> ≫ 0.5 is used), which increases linearly with the animal speed <italic>ν</italic><sub><italic>ext</italic></sub> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c-e</xref>). This linear relationship ensures that the firing phase of a unimodal cell in each theta cycle is locked with the relative location of the animal in the firing field of that cell, which supports a robust phase-position code. Notably, in our model, the speed modulation of the place cells’ firing frequency is not the cause of theta phase shift, but rather a result of oscillatory tracking. This is different from the dual oscillator model (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lengyel et al., 2003</xref></italic></bold>), which assumes that phase precession is caused by a speed-dependent increase in the dendritic oscillation frequency (see Discussion for more details).</p>

</fig>
<p>In a different experiment, (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Zugaro et al., 2005</xref></italic></bold>) found that the firing phase of a place cell continues to precess even after hippocampal activity was transiently silenced for up to 250 ms (around 2 theta cycles). To reproduce this phenomenon, we also study a unimodal cell by manually turning off the network activity for a few hundred milliseconds (by setting <italic>r</italic>(<italic>x, t</italic>) = 0 for all neurons) and then letting the network dynamics evolves again with all parameters unchanged. Based on the theoretical analysis (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn8">Eq. 8</xref>), we see that the firing phase of a place cell is determined by the location of the external input (i.e., <italic>ν</italic><sub><italic>ext</italic></sub><italic>t</italic>), which means that as the external input moves forward on the linear track, the firing phase will precess accordingly in successive oscillatory cycles. Thus, once the network is recovered to the oscillatory tracking state and the external input conveys the new location of the animal to the network, phase precession is resumed from the new location. Therefore, the firing phase in the first bump oscillation cycle after the network perturbation is more advanced than the firing phase in the last bump oscillation cycle right before the perturbation, and the amount of precession is similar to that in the case without perturbation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6h&amp;i</xref>). This agrees well with the experimental observation, and indicates that the phase-position code is robust to the perturbation of the hippocampal dynamics.</p>
<p>Overall, our model reproduces these two experimental findings, and suggests that there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the firing phase of a place cell and the travelled distance in the neuron’s place field, which is independent of the animal’s running speed or the perturbation duration (Fig.S3). This agrees well with experimental observations (<bold><italic><xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">O’Keefe and Recce, 1993</xref></italic></bold>) that theta phase correlates better with the animal’s location than with time (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6f&amp;g</xref>). In addition to the results for unimodal cells as introduced above, our model predicts new results for bimodal cells. First, in contrast to a unimodal cell, a bimodal cell will have two peaks in its firing frequency, with one slightly higher than the LFP theta baseline (due to phase precession) and the other slightly lower than the LFP theta baseline (due to phase procession). The precession-associated frequency positively correlates with the running speed of the animal, while the procession-associated frequency negatively correlates with the running speed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>). Second, similar to the preserved phase shift in unimodal cells, both the phase precession and procession of a bimodal cell after transient intrahippocampal perturbation continue from the new location of the animal (see SI), no matter how long the silencing period lasts. The two predictions could be tested by experiments.</p>

<title>Model contributions</title>
<p>In this paper, we have proposed a CANN with firing rate adaptation to unveil the underlying mechanism of place cell phase shift during locomotion. We show that the interplay between intrinsic mobility (owing to firing rate adaptation) and extrinsic mobility (owing to the location-dependent sensory inputs) leads to an oscillatory tracking state, which naturally accounts for theta sweeps where the decoded position oscillates around the animal’s physical location at the theta rhythm. At the single neuron level, we show that the forward and backward bump sweeps account for, respectively, phase precession and phase procession. Furthermore, we show that the varied adaptation strength explains the emergence of bimodal and unimodal cells, that is, as the adaptation strength increases, forward sweeps of the bump gradually suppress backward sweeps, and as a result, neurons initially exhibiting both significant phase precession and procession (due to a low level adaptation) will gradually exhibit only predominant phase precession (due to a high level adaptation).</p>

<title>Computational models for theta phase shift and theta sweeps</title>
<p>As a subject of network dynamics, oscillatory tracking has been studied previously in an excitatoryinhibitory neural network (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Folias and Bressloff, 2004</xref></italic></bold>), where it was found that decreasing the external input strength can lead to periodic emission of traveling waves in the network (Hopf instability), which is analogous to the oscillatory tracking state in our model. However, their focus was on the mathematical analysis of such dynamical behavior, while our focus is on the biological implications of oscillatory tracking, i.e., how can it be linked to phase precession and procession of hippocampal place cells.</p>
<p>Due to their potential contributions to the temporal sequence learning involved in spatial navigation and episodic memory (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Mehta et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Yamaguchi, 2003</xref></italic></bold>), theta phase precession and forward theta sweeps have been modelled in the field for decades. These models can be divided into two main categories, with one relying on the mechanism of single cell oscillation (<bold><italic><xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">O’Keefe and Recce, 1993</xref></italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kamondi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lengyel et al., 2003</xref>; <italic><xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr">O’keefe and Burgess, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mehta et al., 2002</xref></italic></bold>), and the other relying on the mechanism of recurrent interactions between neurons (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tsodyks et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Romani and Tsodyks, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kang and DeWeese, 2019</xref></italic></bold>). A representative example of the former is the oscillatory interference model (<bold><italic><xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">O’Keefe and Recce, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lengyel et al., 2003</xref></italic></bold>), which produces phase precession via the superposition of two oscillatory signals, with one from the baseline somatic oscillation at the LFP theta frequency (reflecting the inputs from the medial septal pacemaker (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Stewart and Fox, 1990</xref></italic></bold>)), and the other from the dendritic oscillation whose frequency is slightly higher. While these models can explain a large variety of experimental phenomena, it remain unclear how oscillation of individual neurons has a frequency higher than the baseline theta frequency. Here, our model provides a network mechanism for how such higherfrequency oscillation emerges.</p>
<p>A representative model relying on neuronal recurrent interactions is the activation spreading model (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tsodyks et al., 1996</xref></italic></bold>). This model produces phase precession via the propagation of neural activity along the movement direction, which relies on asymmetric synaptic connections. A later version of this model considers short-term synaptic plasticity (short-term depression) to implicitly implement asymmetric connections between place cells (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Romani and Tsodyks, 2015</xref></italic></bold>), and reproduces many other interesting phenomena, such as phase precession in different environments. However, since the asymmetric connections always skew towards the moving direction (along which the connection strength is stronger than that in the opposite direction), the activity bump can only propagate along the moving direction. Therefore, these two models only reproduce theta phase precession. Rather than relying on neuronal asymmetric connections to induce activity spreading, our model considers firing rate adaptation at individual neurons, which allows the activity bump to propagate in both directions alternately, and hence generate interleaved phase precession and procession. Furthermore, to prevent the activity bump from spreading away, their model considers an external theta input to reset the bump location at the end of each theta cycle, whereas in our model, because of the oscillation of the bump, no external theta input is needed, and by choosing the model parameters properly, the bump can oscillate at the theta rhythm. Nevertheless, experimental studies have suggested that hippocampal neurons receive theta modulation from the medial septal pacemaker (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Stewart and Fox, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">King et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wang, 2002</xref></italic></bold>). In our model, if we include such an external theta input, the bump oscillation will be locked at the theta rhythm more robustly without the need of fine tuning model parameters. Such a theta input may also have the role of coordinating theta phase shifts across brain regions. We will investigate this issue in future work.</p>

<sec id="s3c">
<title>Beyond the linear track environment</title>
<p>Besides the linear track environment, the mechanism of generating theta sweeps proposed in our model can also be generalized to more complex environments. For instance, in a T-maze environment, our model explains the constant cycling of theta sweeps between left and right arms. Such cycling behavior may be important for high-speed actions such as predating and escaping which require animals to make decision among several future scenarios at the sub-second level. Similar alternative activity sweeps in the T-maze environment has been studied in a previous paper (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Romani and Tsodyks, 2015</xref></italic></bold>), which showed that the frequency of alternation correlates with overtly deliberative behaviors such as head scans (frequency at 1 Hz or less) (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Johnson and Redish, 2007</xref></italic></bold>). In contrast to our model, the network activity in their model propagates continuously from the current location on the center arm till the end of the outer arm, which takes a few theta cycles (i.e., 1 second or more). In our model, the network bump alternately sweeps to one of the two outer arms at a much higher frequency (∼ 8 Hz), which may be related to fast decision-making or planing in natural environments (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kay et al., 2020</xref></italic></bold>). Furthermore, our model can also be easily extended to the multiple-arms (&gt; 2) environment (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Gillespie et al., 2021</xref></italic></bold>) or the cascade-T environment (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Johnson and Redish, 2007</xref></italic></bold>) with the underlying mechanism of generating theta cycling remaining unchanged. In addition to the linear and T-maze environments, phase shift has also been reported when an animal navigates in an open field environment. However, due to the lack of recorded neurons, decoding theta sweeps in the 2D environment is not as straightforward as in the 1D case. While theta sweeps in the 1D case have been associated with goal-directed behaviors and spatial planning (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Wikenheiser and Redish, 2015</xref></italic></bold>), it remains unclear whether such conclusion is applicable to the 2D case. Our preliminary result shows that in the 2D CANN where neurons are arranged homogeneously according to their relative firing locations, the activity bump will sweep along the tangent direction of the movement trajectory, similar to the 1D case (see SI.4 and Fig.S4 for details). It will be interesting to explore theta sweeps in the open field environment in detail when more experimental data is available.</p>

<title>Model implications and future works</title>
<p>In the current study, we have modeled the place cell population in the hippocampus with a CANN and adopted firing rate adaptation to generate theta phase shift. In fact, this model can be easily extended to the grid cell population without changing the underlying mechanism. For instance, we can induce the torus-like connection profile (periodic boundary in the 2D space) (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Samsonovich and McNaughton, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">McNaughton et al., 2006</xref></italic></bold>) or the locally inhibitory connection profile (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Burak and Fiete, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Couey et al., 2013</xref></italic></bold>) in the CANN structure to construct a grid cell model, and by imposing firing rate adaptation, neurons in the grid cell network will also exhibit phase shift as the animal moves through the grid field, as reported in previous experimental studies (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hafting et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Van Der Meer and Redish, 2011</xref></italic></bold>). Notably, although for both grid cells and place cells, CANNs can generate theta phase shift, it does not mean that they are independent from each other. Instead, they might be coordinated by the same external input from the environment, as well as by the medial septum which is known to be a pacemaker that synchronises theta oscillations across different brain regions (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">King et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wang, 2002</xref></italic></bold>). We will investigate this issue in future work.</p>
<p>Our model suggests that the “online” theta sweep and the “offline” replay may share some common features in their underlying mechanisms (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Romani and Tsodyks, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hopfield, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kang and DeWeese, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jahnke et al., 2015</xref></italic></bold>). We have shown that the activity bump with strong adaptation can move spontaneously when the external input becomes weak enough (see Sec.). Such non-local spreading of neural activity has a speed much faster than the conventional speed of animals (the external input speed in our model, see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>), which resembles the fast spreading of the decoded position during sharp-wave ripple events (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Diba and Buzsáki, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Foster and Wilson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Karlsson and Frank, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2011</xref></italic></bold>). This indicates that these two phenomena may be generated by the same neural mechanism of firing rate adaptation, with theta sweeps originating from the interplay between the adaptation and the external input, while replay originating from only the adaptation, since the external input is relatively weak during the “offline” state. This hypothesis seems to be supported by the coordinated emergence of theta sequences and replays during the post-natal development period (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Muessig et al., 2019</xref></italic></bold>), as well as their simultaneous degradation when the animal travelled passively on a model train (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Drieu et al., 2018</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is important to note that the CANN we adopt in the current study is an idealized model for the place cell population, where many biological details are missed (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Amari, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Tsodyks and Sejnowski, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Samsonovich and McNaughton, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Tsodyks, 1999</xref></italic></bold>). For instance, we have assumed that neuronal synaptic connections are translation-invariant in the space. In practice, such a connection pattern may be learned by a synaptic plasticity rule at the behavioral time scale when the animal navigates actively in the environment (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bittner et al., 2017</xref></italic></bold>). In future work, we will explore the detailed implementation of this connection pattern, as well as other biological correspondences of our idealized model, to establish a comprehensive picture of how theta phase shift is generated in the brain.</p>

<title>Analysis of intrinsic mobility of the bump state</title>
<p>We derive the condition under which the bump of the CANN moves spontaneously in the attractor space without relying on external inputs. As the adaptation strength increases, the bump activity becomes unstable and has tendency to move away from its location spontaneously. Such intrinsic mobility of the CANN has been shown in previous studies (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bressloff, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Mi et al., 2014</xref></italic></bold>).

<title>Implementation details of the linear track environment</title>
<p>For the linear track environment, we simulate an 1D CANN with 512 place cells topographically organized on the one-dimensional neuronal track. Since we are interested in how the neuronal firing phase shifts as the animal moves through the firing field of a place cell, we investigate the place cell at location <italic>x</italic> = 0 and ignore the boundary effect, that is, we treat the linear track with the infinite length. The neural firing time constant is set to be 3 ms, while the time constant of spike frequency adaptation is much longer, which is set to be 144 ms. The density of place cells on the linear track is set to be 256/<italic>π</italic>. The excitatory interaction range of place cells is set to be 0.4<italic>m</italic>, while the maximum excitatory connection strength <italic>J</italic><sub>0</sub> is set to be 0.2.

The moving speed of the virtual animal <italic>ν</italic><sub><italic>ext</italic></sub> is set to be 1.5 m/s. For the simulation details, we use the first-order Euler method with the time step <italic>δt</italic> set to be 0.3 the duration of simulation <italic>T</italic> set to be 10 s. These parameters are commonly used in all plots related to the linear track environment (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table.1</xref> for a summary).</p>

<title>Details of generating the probability heatmap of theta phase shift</title>
<p>In <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g&amp;h</xref> we described the smoothed probability heatmaps of theta phase versus normalized position in the place field of both bimodal and unimodal cells. Generally, these two plots are similar to the traditional spike plot of phase and position traveled in the place field (<bold><italic><xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">O’Keefe and Recce, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Skaggs et al., 1996</xref></italic></bold>). However, in our rate-based model, the phase of neuronal spike is not directly modelled, rather we use the phase of firing rate peak to represent the phase shift in neuronal firing. Here we describe the implementation details of generating the heatmaps.</p>
<p>The x-axis denotes the normalized position in the place field, with −1 representing the position where the animal just enters the place field, and 1 representing the position where the animal just leaves the place field. In our simulation, the firing field of a place cell with preferred location at <italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub> is defined as <italic>x</italic> ∈ (<italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub> − 2.5 * <italic>a, x</italic><sub>0</sub> + 2.5<italic>a</italic>), with <italic>a</italic> roughly the half size of the firing field.

The y-axis represents the phase of neuronal activity, which is in the range of (0°, 720°).

<p>This work represents an <bold>important</bold> contribution to our understanding of how phenomena associated with the theta rhythm in the hippocampus could be generated even in the absence of theta. This <bold>convincing</bold> computational work provides a parsimonious continuous attractor network model of how hippocampal place cell networks can briefly sweep forward to represent future locations and then sweep back, even in animal species in which theta oscillations are only weakly (or not at all) present.</p>

<p>Continuous attractor networks endowed with some sort of adaptation in the dynamics, whether that be through synaptic depression or firing rate adaptation, are fast becoming the leading candidate models to explain many aspects of hippocampal place cell dynamics, from hippocampal replay during immobility to theta sequences during run. Here, the authors show that a continuous attractor network endowed with spike frequency adaptation and subject to feedforward external inputs is able to account for several previously unaccounted aspects of theta sequences, including (1) sequences that move both forwards and backwards, (2) sequences that alternate between two arms of a T-maze, (3) speed modulation of place cell firing frequency, and (4) the persistence of phase information across hippocampal inactivations.</p>
<p>I think the main result of the paper (findings (1) and (2)) are likely to be of interest to the hippocampal community, as well as to the wider community interested in mechanisms of neural sequences. In addition, the manuscript is generally well written and the analytics are impressive. However, several issues should be addressed, which I outline below.</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>In real data, population firing rate is strongly modulated by theta (i.e., cells collectively prefer a certain phase of theta - see review paper Buzsaki, 2002) and largely oscillates at theta frequency during run. With respect to this cyclical firing rate, theta sweeps resemble &quot;Nike&quot; check marks, with the sweep backwards preceding the sweep forwards within each cycle before the activity is quenched at the end of the cycle. I am concerned that (1) the summed population firing rate of the model does not oscillate at theta frequency, and (2) as the authors state, the oscillatory tracking state must begin with a forward sweep. With regards to (1), can the authors show theta phase spike preference plots for the population to see if they match data? With regards to (2), can the authors show what happens if the bump is made to sweep backwards first, as it appears to do within each cycle?</p>
<p>I could not find the width of the external input mentioned anywhere in the text or in the table of parameters. The implication is that it is unclear to me whether, during the oscillatory tracking state, the external input is large compared to the size of the bump, so that the bump lives within a window circumscribed by the external input and so bounces off the interior walls of the input during the oscillatory tracking phase, or whether the bump is continuously pulled back and forth by the external input, in which case it could be comparable to the size of the bump. My guess based on Fig 2c is that it is the latter. Please clarify and comment.</p>
<p>I would argue that the &quot;constant cycling&quot; of theta sweeps down the arms of a T-maze was roughly predicted by Romani &amp; Tsodyks, 2015, Figure 7. While their cycling spans several theta cycles, it nonetheless alternates by a similar mechanism, in that adaptation (in this case synaptic depression) prevents the subsequent sweep of activity from taking the same arm as the previous sweep. I believe the authors should cite this model in this context and consider the fact that both synaptic depression and spike frequency adaptation are both possible mechanisms for this phenomenon. But I certainly give the authors credit for showing how this constant cycling can occur across individual theta cycles.</p>
<p>The authors make an unsubstantiated claim in the paragraph beginning with line 413 that the Tsodyks and Romani (2015) model could not account for forwards and backwards sweeps. Both the firing rate adaptation and synaptic depression are symmetry breaking models that should in theory be able to push sweeps of activity in both directions, so it is far from obvious to me that both forward and backward sweeps are not possible in the Tsodyks and Romani model. The authors should either prove that this is the case (with theory or simulation) or excise this statement from the manuscript.</p>
<p>The section on the speed dependence of theta (starting with line 327) was very hard to understand. Can the authors show a more graphical explanation of the phenomenon? Perhaps a version of Fig 2f for slow and fast speeds, and point out that cells in the latter case fire with higher frequency than in the former?</p>
<p>I had a hard time understanding how the Zugaro et al., (2005) hippocampal inactivation experiment was accounted for by the model. My intuition is that while the bump position is determined partially by the location of the external input, it is also determined by the immediate history of the bump dynamics as computed via the local dynamics within the hippocampus (recurrent dynamics and spike rate adaptation). So that if the hippocampus is inactivated for an arbitrary length of time, there is nothing to keep track of where the bump should be when the activity comes back on line. Can the authors please explain more how the model accounts for this?</p>
<p>Can the authors comment on why the sweep lengths oscillate in the bottom panel of Fig 5b during starting at time 0.5 seconds before crossing the choice point of the T-maze? Is this oscillation in sweep length another prediction of the model? If so, it should definitely be remarked upon and included in the discussion section.</p>
<p>Perhaps I missed this, but I'm curious whether the authors have considered what factors might modulate the adaptation strength. In particular, might rat speed modulate adaptation strength? If so, would have interesting predictions for theta sequences at low vs high speeds.</p>
<p>I think the paper has a number of predictions that would be especially interesting to experimentalists but are sort of scattered throughout the manuscript. It would be beneficial to have them listed more prominently in a separate section in the discussion. This should include (1) a prediction that the bump height in the forward direction should be higher than in the backward direction, (2) predictions about bimodal and unimodal cells starting with line 366, (3) prediction of another possible kind of theta cycling, this time in the form of sweep length (see comment above), etc.</p>

<p>In this work, the authors elaborate on an analytically tractable, continuous-attractor model to study an idealized neural network with realistic spiking phase precession/procession. The key ingredient of this analysis is the inclusion of a mechanism for slow firing-rate adaptation in addition to the otherwise fast continuous-attractor dynamics. The latter which continuous-attractor dynamics classically arises from a combination of translation invariance and nonlinear rate normalization.</p>
<p>For strong adaptation/weak external input, the network naturally exhibits an internally generated, travelling-wave dynamics along the attractor with some characteristic speed. For small adaptation/strong external stimulus, the network recovers the classical externally driven continuous-attractor dynamics. Crucially, when both adaptation and external input are moderate, there is a competition with the internally generated and externally generated mechanism leading to oscillatory tracking regime. In this tracking regime, the population firing profile oscillates around the neural field tracking the position of the stimulus. The authors demonstrate by a combination of analytical and computational arguments that oscillatory tracking corresponds to realistic phase precession/procession. In particular the authors can account for the emergence of a unimodal and bimodal cells, as well as some other experimental observations with respect the dependence of phase precession/procession on the animal's locomotion.</p>
<p>The strengths of this work are at least three-fold: 1) Given its simplicity, the proposed model has a surprisingly large explanatory power of the various experimental observations. 2) The mechanism responsible for the emergence of precession/procession can be understood as a simple yet rather illuminating competition between internally driven and externally driven dynamical trends. 3) Amazingly, and under some adequate simplifying assumptions, a great deal of analysis can be treated exactly, which allows for a detailed understanding of all parametric dependencies. This exact treatment culminates with a full characterization of the phase space of the network dynamics, as well as the computation of various quantities of interest, including characteristic speeds and oscillating frequencies.</p>
<p>As mentioned by the authors themselves, the main limitation of this work is that it deals with a very idealized model and it remains to see how the proposed dynamical behaviors would persist in more realistic models. For example, the model is based on a continuous attractor model that assumes perfect translation-invariance of the network connectivity pattern. Would the oscillating tracking behavior persist in the presence of connection heterogeneities? Can the oscillating tracking behavior be observed in purely spiking models as opposed to rate models as considered in this work? Another important limitation is that the system needs to be tuned to exhibit oscillation within the theta range and that this tuning involves a priori variable parameters such as the external input strength. Is the oscillating-tracking behavior overtly sensitive to input strength variations? The author mentioned that an external pacemaker can serve to drive oscillation within the desired theta band but there is no evidence presented supporting this. A final and perhaps secondary limitation has to do with the choice of parameter, namely the time constant of neural firing which is chosen around 3ms. This seems rather short given that the fast time scale of rate models (excluding synaptic processes) is usually given by the membrane time constant, which is typically about 15ms. I suspect this latter point can easily be addressed.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, it is my opinion that the authors convincingly achieved their aims in this work.</p>

<p>With a soft-spoken, matter-of-fact attitude and almost unwittingly, this brilliant study chisels away one of the pillars of hippocampal neuroscience: the special role(s) ascribed to theta oscillations. These oscillations are salient during specific behaviors in rodents but are often taken to be part of the intimate endowment of the hippocampus across all mammalian species, and to be a fundamental ingredient of its computations. The gradual anticipation or precession of the spikes of a cell as it traverses its place field, relative to the theta phase, is seen as enabling the prediction of the future - the short-term future position of the animal at least, possibly the future in a wider cognitive sense as well, in particular with humans. The present study shows that, under suitable conditions, place cell population activity &quot;sweeps&quot; to encode future positions, and sometimes past ones as well, even in the absence of theta, as a result of the interplay between firing rate adaptation and precise place coding in the afferent inputs, which tracks the real position of the animal. The core strength of the paper is the clarity afforded by the simple, elegant model. It allows the derivation (in a certain limit) of an analytical formula for the frequency of the sweeps, as a function of the various model parameters, such as the time constants for neuronal integration and for firing rate adaptation. The sweep frequency turns out to be inversely proportional to their geometric average. The authors note that, if theta oscillations are added to the model, they can entrain the sweeps, which thus may superficially appear to have been generated by the oscillations.</p>
<p>The main weakness of the study is the other side of the simplicity coin. In its simple and neat formulation, the model envisages stereotyped single unit behavior regulated by a few parameters, like the two time constants above, or the &quot;adaptation strength&quot;, the &quot;width of the field&quot; or the &quot;input strength&quot;, which are all assumed to be constant across cells. In reality, not only assigning homogeneous values to those parameters seems implausible, but also describing e.g. adaptation with the simple equation included in the model may be an oversimplification. Therefore, it remains important to understand to what extent the mechanism envisaged in the model is robust to variability in the parameters or to eg less carefully tuned afferent inputs.</p>
<p>The weak adaptation regime, when firing rate adaptation effectively moves the position encoded by population activity slightly ahead of the animal, is not novel - I discussed it, among others, in trying to understand the significance of the CA3-CA1 differentiation (2004). What is novel here, as far as I know, is the strong adaptation regime, when the adaptation strength m is at least larger than the ratio of time constants. Then population activity literally runs away, ahead of the animal, and oscillations set in, independent of any oscillatory inputs. Can this really occur in physiological conditions? A careful comparison with available experimental measures would greatly strengthen the significance of this study.</p>
