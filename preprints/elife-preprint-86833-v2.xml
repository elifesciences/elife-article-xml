<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Many channelrhodopsins are permeable to protons. We found that in neurons, activation of a high-current channelrhodopsin, CheRiff, led to significant acidification, with faster acidification in the dendrites than in the soma. Experiments with patterned optogenetic stimulation in monolayers of HEK cells established that the acidification was due to proton transport through the opsin, rather than through other voltage-dependent channels. We identified and characterized two opsins which showed large photocurrents, but small proton permeability, PsCatCh2.0 and ChR2-3M. PsCatCh2.0 showed excellent response kinetics and was also spectrally compatible with simultaneous voltage imaging with QuasAr6a. Stimulation-evoked acidification is a possible source of disruptions to cell health in scientific and prospective therapeutic applications of optogenetics. Channelrhodopsins with low proton permeability are a promising strategy for avoiding these problems.</p></abstract>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Channelrhodopsins are light-gated ion channels that are widely used to modulate the activity of neurons and other excitable cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> In addition to research use, these tools are entering clinical practice as a treatment for forms blindness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> and are under consideration for treatments of other disorders of neural excitability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> Every ion channel carries current through one or more ions, and so the induced change in membrane voltage is always accompanied by a change in ionic concentrations. In both research and clinical applications, one must consider whether the ionic changes in the cell have effects beyond the purely electrical effects of the channel.</p>
<p>Ionic perturbations are largest when (a) the basal intracellular concentration of the relevant ion is low, (b) the surface-to-volume ratio is high and (c) the channel is activated chronically. Sodium, potassium, and chloride ion concentrations in cells are typically in the millimolar range, and thus the fractional changes in concentration of these ions due to channel opening are typically &lt; 1%. In contrast, protons and calcium ions have low free concentrations, typically <sup>∼</sup>100 nM or lower. In these cases, the ionic fluxes due to channel opening can substantially perturb the concentration.</p>
<p>The amount of charge flow required to change membrane voltage by a given amount is proportional to the capacitance, and hence the membrane surface area. This charge is diluted into the volume. For this reason, ionic concentrations in small structures with high surface-to-volume ratios are more labile to optogenetic perturbations than are concentrations in large structures. One must therefore consider whether optogenetic tools substantially perturb ionic concentrations in thin structures such as axons, dendrites, or dendritic spines. Finally, ionic concentrations equilibrate much more slowly than does membrane potential. Brief optogenetic stimuli may have negligible effects on concentrations, whereas chronic stimuli with high duty cycle may have cumulative effects. Concerns about long-term consequences of optogenetic stimulation are particularly relevant to prospective therapeutic applications, where the tools may be used over long times in patients.</p>
<p>Channelrhodopsins have been shown to acidify cells, while light-driven outward proton pumps, such as Archaerhodopsin 3, alkalize cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> Indeed, optogenetically triggered alkalization has been proposed as a tool to control cell death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> Intracellular acidification can suppress neuronal excitability and also suppress vesicle release,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> but has also been reported to enhance release of adenosine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> and dopamine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> Changes in intracellular pH can also affect cell differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> and metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> and survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> Nominally similar channelrhodopsins have been reported to evoke opposite behavioral effects in live mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. The cause of these differences is not known, but it is possible that these differences could be due, in part, to differences in ionic selectivity.</p>
<p>For these reasons, it is important to quantify and ultimately minimize perturbations to cellular pH from optogenetic tools. We combined channelrhodopsin stimulation with a red-shifted fluorescent pH sensor, pHoran4,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> for measurement of pH changes during optogenetic stimulation. We used patterned optogenetic stimulation in gap junction-coupled cellular monolayers to establish that the acidification was due to proton flux directly through the channelrhodopsin. We then tested two new opsins, ChR2-3M and PsCatCh2.0,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> with a low proton permeability and found minimal perturbations to cellular pH. We performed a detailed electrophysiological and photophysical characterization of these opsins and showed that they are compatible with simultaneous voltage imaging. The new opsins may be promising for clinical applications where acidification is undesirable.</p>

<title>CheRiff acidifies neurons</title>
<p>We developed lentiviral constructs and optical stimulus protocols for simultaneous optogenetic stimulation and pH measurements (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). For the actuator we used CheRiff-GFP, a non-selective cation channel with an activation peak at 460 nm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> For the pH measurement we used pHoran4,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> a red-shifted reporter with an excitation peak at 547 nm and a pK<sub>a</sub> of 7.5. We calibrated the pH response of pHoran4 in permeabilized HEK293T (HEK) cells and in cultured neurons (Methods; <xref rid="fig1_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1</xref>) and then used this calibration to convert changes in fluorescence to changes in pH. We assumed an initial pH of 7.3 for all the cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Since our measurements focused on relative pH changes as opposed to absolute pH, modest deviations from this assumption would not affect the interpretation of the following results.</p>

<p>We imaged pH changes in cultured neurons during CheRiff stimulation. We alternated epochs of optogenetic stimulation (488 nm, 400-800 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>, 0.5 s) and pH imaging (561 nm, 100-200 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>, 1 s) to avoid crosstalk of the blue light into the pH recordings (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). The pH dynamics were much slower than 1.5 s, so this process did not sacrifice information.</p>
<p>After 150 s of stimulation and imaging, the pH had decreased within the neurons that expressed CheRiff-GFP, from 7.3 to 6.76 ± 0.35 (mean ± S.D., <italic>n</italic> = 34 cells, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D, E</xref>), corresponding to an approximately 3-fold increase in concentration of free protons. We then measured the pH recovery for an additional 150 s without optogenetic stimulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Recovery was slow, returning to only pH 6.95 ± 0.33 (mean ± S.D.) after 150 s. Control experiments in neurons that expressed pHoran4 but not CheRiff showed a small fluorescence increase during the stimulation period (0.11 ΔF/F), much smaller in magnitude and opposite in sign compared to the change in cells expressing CheRiff and pHoran4 (-0.34 ΔF/F). We attribute the slight increase in fluorescence of the CheRiff-negative cells to a blue light-mediated photo-activation artifact, as has been seen in other fluorescent reporters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> The mean photo-artifact from CheRiff-negative cells was subtracted from all recordings of CheRiff-positive cells prior to analysis.</p>
<p>We observed that stimulation-induced pH changes and post-stimulation recovery were faster in the dendrites than in the soma (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). This effect is most likely due to the higher surface-to-volume ratio of thin processes. For a given proton current density across the membrane, the change in local proton concentration is greater in a thin tube than in the large soma.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Acidification is via proton transport through the opsin</title>
<p>We next sought to determine to what extent the acidification was due to proton transport through the opsin vs through depolarization-induced opening of endogenous proton-permeable channels or other activity-dependent acidification mechanisms (e.g. metabolic shifts). Working in HEK cells, we expressed CheRiff, pHoran4 and a doxycycline-inducible inward rectifying potassium channel, K<sub>ir</sub>2.1, (Methods, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The K<sub>ir</sub>2.1 channel polarized the HEK cells to a resting potential of approximately -70 mV,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> providing a driving force for proton entry. K<sub>ir</sub>2.1 has been reported not to carry a proton current itself.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> When the cells were grown into a confluent monolayer, they coupled electrically via endogenous gap junctions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup></p>

<p>We characterized these cultures using a wide-area “Firefly” microscope which provided spatially and temporally patterned illumination at 470 and 561 nm via a digital micromirror device (DMD).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref> shows the protocol for interleaved CheRiff stimulation and pH imaging. After 60 s of stimulation, cells expressing all three components were acidified to a pH of 6.96 ± 0.15 (mean ± S.D., <italic>n</italic> = 75 cells). Cells not expressing K<sub>ir</sub>2.1 had substantially less acidification (final pH 7.21 ± 0.05, mean ± S.D., <italic>n</italic> = 70 cells, <italic>p</italic> = 2e-24, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), confirming the importance of membrane voltage as a driving force for proton entry. Cells lacking both the CheRiff and the K<sub>ir</sub>2.1 did not show detectable acidification (final pH 7.31 ± 0.02, mean ± S.D., <italic>n</italic> = 13 cells, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D-F</xref>), consistent with our results in neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E, F</xref>).</p>
<p>These results established that acidification occurred in non-excitable cells but left open the possibility that the HEK cells might contain an endogenous proton conductance that opened upon membrane depolarization. To test this possibility, we took advantage of the gap junctional coupling between cells in a confluent monolayer. Due to the gap junctions, local CheRiff activation led to depolarization of neighboring regions, with an electrotonic length constant of <sup>∼</sup>300 µm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> While protons can also diffuse through gap junctions, this process is orders of magnitude slower than propagation of membrane voltage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> This difference in lateral electrical vs proton transport permitted us to indirectly depolarize cells via gap junction coupling, and to ask whether the acidification arose in all depolarized cells or only in cells with direct CheRiff activation.</p>
<p>We used the DMD to pattern the optogenetic stimulation into stripes, with a separation between the stripes of 95 µm, much smaller than the electrotonic length constant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). We used the far-red voltage sensitive dye BeRST1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> to map the voltage changes throughout a monolayer of HEK cells expressing pHoran4, CheRiff, and K<sub>ir</sub>2.1. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref> shows the stimulus pattern (reported via fluorescence of CheRiff-GFP), and the electrical depolarization pattern. As expected from the strong gap junctional coupling, the optogenetically induced depolarization in the interstitial “Blue Off” regions was almost as large as in the directly stimulated “Blue On” regions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I</xref>).</p>
<p>We then mapped the pH changes over the whole field of view, using the same striped stimulation pattern alternating with wide-field yellow illumination for pH imaging (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2J</xref>). We expected that proton currents through CheRiff would follow the illumination pattern precisely, whereas proton currents through voltage-gated channels would follow the much smoother voltage profile. We quantified acidification after only a short (13.5 s) period of CheRiff stimulation to avoid possible confounding effects of lateral proton diffusion between cells. In the directly stimulated “Blue On” regions we observed robust acidification after 13.5 s (pH = 7.27 ± 0.016, mean ± S.D., <italic>n</italic> = 26 cells), and in the indirectly depolarized “Blue Off” regions we observed no acidification (pH = 7.31 ± 0.003, mean ± S.D., <italic>n</italic> = 19 cells, <italic>p</italic> = 1.5e-8 Wilcoxon signed-rank test, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2K-M</xref>). These results establish that CheRiff directly acidifies polarized cells via proton transport through the opsin, and that electrical depolarization alone is insufficient to drive acidification.</p>

<p>The second opsin we tested is derived from the recently engineered ChR2-XXM (i.e. ChR2-D156H), which shows high photocurrent and high selectivity for Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> over H<sup>+</sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> Mutating H134 to Q at the intracellular gate further enhanced the Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> selectivity (<xref rid="fig3_S1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 – figure supplement 1</xref>) and photocurrent amplitude. Mutating E101 to N near the extracellular gate site also boosted the Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> selectivity (<xref rid="fig3_S1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 – figure supplement 1A</xref>) without affecting the photocurrent amplitude (<xref rid="fig3_S1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 – figure supplement 1B</xref>). To optimize expression and trafficking, we added the same trafficking, ER export, and signal peptides as in PsCatCh2.0. We designate this triple mutant of ChR2 as “ChR2-3M”.</p>
<p>Following the same procedure as in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, we tested the acidification due to opsin stimulation in electrically polarized HEK cells expressing pHoran4, K<sub>ir</sub>2.1, and either CheRiff, ChR2-3M, or PsCatCh2.0 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). After a 55 s stimulation and imaging protocol, CheRiff cells showed a decrease in pH as above (pH = 6.98 ± 0.15, mean ± S.D., n = 170 cells), while the new opsins did not show any significant changes in pH (ChR2-3M: pH = 7.31 ± 0.10, n = 63 cells; PsCatCh2.0: pH = 7.30 ± 0.03, n = 74 cells; p = 4e-31, p = 4e-35, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-D</xref>). These experiments confirmed the low proton permeability of ChR2-3M and PsCatCh2.0. In paired experiments, we used voltage imaging with BeRST1 to confirm that all three opsins induced depolarization in the HEK cell monolayers (<xref rid="fig3_S2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 – figure supplement 2</xref>).</p>

Both opsins were sensitive to blue (488 nm) light. ChR2-3M passed unusually large steady-state photocurrents (1378 ± 618 pA, mean ± S.D., n = 4 cells) and was highly sensitive to blue light (Effective Power Density for 50% activation, EPD50 = 11.6 ± 8.7 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>), but had slow opening (τ<sub>on</sub> = 57 ± 21 ms at saturating blue light) and very slow closing (τ<sub>off</sub> = 1950 ± 500 ms, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). PsCatCh2.0 had somewhat smaller photocurrents (847 ± 359 pA, <italic>n</italic> = 6 cells), higher EPD50 (116 ± 13 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>), but very fast opening (τ<sub>on</sub> = 4.2 ± 3.5 ms at saturating blue light) and closing (τ<sub>off</sub> = 17.6 ± 3.4 ms).</p>

<p>Both opsins had positive reversal potentials (ChR2-3M: 16.6 ± 3.6 mV, PsCatCh2.0: 12.3 ± 4.7 mV), consistent with preferential Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> selectivity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). A key attraction of PsCatCh2.0 for quantitative optogenetics experiments was its very flat-top response to a step in blue light. In contrast to CheRiff which shows substantial sag in photocurrent upon continuous illumination,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> PsCatCh2.0 showed almost no sag. This low extent of light induced inactivation appears to be, at least in part, a characteristic of this particular type of opsin from <italic>P. subcordiformis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>For applications in all-optical electrophysiology (i.e. simultaneous stimulation and voltage or calcium imaging), it is critical that the light used for imaging a red-shifted reporter does not interfere with the action of the opsin. At 50 mW cm<sup>-2</sup> excitation intensity, ChR2-3M retained substantial activation at 561 nm (20%) and 594 nm (4.8%), but undetectable activation at 640 nm (&lt; 0.3%, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>). PsCatCh2.0 was more promising for all-optical applications: at 561 nm the photocurrent was only 2% and at 594 and 640 nm the photocurrent was undetectable (&lt; 0.3%).</p>
<p>In some opsins, light at a red-shifted wavelength can reverse retinal isomerization, forcing the channel closed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> To mimic the conditions of a typical all-optical electrophysiology experiment, we thus tested the combination of blue (240 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>) and intense orange (594 nm, 1 W cm<sup>-2</sup>) or red (640 nm, 8 W cm<sup>-2</sup>) light (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I</xref>). The orange light had negligible activating or inactivating crosstalk into PsCatCh2.0 activation, but partially activated the ChR2-3M (<sup>∼</sup>20%). The red light slightly activated both constructs (<sup>∼</sup>10% for ChR2-3M and <sup>∼</sup>5% for PsCatCh2.0), and also substantially inactivated ChR2-3M, leading to a <sup>∼</sup>40% drop in photocurrent. Together, these results indicate that PsCatCh2.0 is a particularly promising channelrhodopsin for all-optical physiology experiments.</p>
<p>We then tested the new opsins in cultured rat hippocampal neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Under paired optogenetic stimulation and pH imaging (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A,B</xref>), we observed acidification in cells expressing CheRiff (pH = 6.87 ± 0.27, mean ± S.D., <italic>n</italic> = 24 cells), as before. We observed substantially less acidification in cells expressing either ChR2-3M (pH = 7.13 ± 0.19, mean ± S.D., <italic>n</italic> = 31 cells, <italic>p</italic> = 2.5e-4), or PsCatCh (pH = 7.14 ± 0.11, mean ± S.D., <italic>n</italic> = 25 cells, <italic>p</italic> = 4e-5, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C-E</xref>). We then produced cultures co-expressing each of the three channelrhodopsins and QuasAr6a for voltage imaging (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F,G</xref>). Under blue light stimulation, each opsin induced reliable spiking (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>). ChR2-3M also induced some firing in intervals after a blue light pulse, presumably due to the very slow closing of the channel (τ<sub>off</sub> = 1950 ± 500 ms, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>) leading to residual currents.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Most polarized cells have a strong inward-directed proton-motive force, and sodium-proton exchangers are required to maintain physiological intracellular pH.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> A sudden change in proton permeability of the membrane can disrupt this balance, leading to intracellular acidification. The proton flux was sufficient to overwhelm the buffering capacity of the cytoplasm. While we focused on the acidification due to CheRiff, we expect similar levels of acidification from other channelrhodopsins, unless they have been engineered specifically to be proton-impermeable.</p>
<p>The degree of acidification depends on the sub-cellular opsin distribution, the cell geometry, and the stimulus protocol. In general, the smaller the compartment, the larger the acidification. While we could not resolve individual dendritic spines, our results suggest that if channerhodopsins exist in spines, optogenetic acidification in spines could be substantial. In some all-optical physiology experiments, channelrhodopsins are restricted to the soma and proximal dendrites via trafficking sequences such as the K<sub>v</sub>2.1 trafficking motif.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> While this restriction has been primarily to facilitate targeted single-cell activation, a possible side effect is to decrease acidification in small distal compartments (dendrites, spines, axon).</p>
<p>Here we showed that the high-performance opsins ChR2-3M and PsCatCh2.0 have very low proton permeability, enabling repeated stimulation with minimal local acidification. We observed no activation-induced acidification in HEK cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3C,D</xref>), but we did observe a very slight acidification in neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4D,E</xref>). We speculate that the activity-induced neuronal acidification was due to cell autonomous mechanism <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> as opposed to proton transport through the opsins.</p>
<p>While the ChR2-3M construct is not optimal for all-optical physiology experiments due to crosstalk with longer wavelength light, several features make it promising for prospective therapeutic applications. It has a very high photocurrent and high sensitivity, meaning that substantial modulation can be achieved with light at intensities &lt; 10 mW/cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. The slow closing of this construct could enable tonic activation with pulsed light, further decreasing the optical dose into the tissue. The positive reversal potential (+16.6 mV) further contributes to the ability of this channelrhodopsin to depolarize cells, even when the cells are already partially depolarized. Together with its low proton permeability, these attributes make ChR2-3M a good candidate for therapeutic applications requiring slowly varying changes in optogenetic drive. However, the slow kinetics of ChR2-3M may limit its use for basic science applications such as circuit mapping. PsCatCh2.0 is more suitable for applications requiring precisely timed spikes.</p>

To equilibrate the pH of the cytosol with the buffer pH, we added the K<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger nigericin at 14 μM.

The buffer composition was (in mM): Good’s zwitterionic buffer 25, KCl 100, NaCl 38, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1.8, MgSO<sub>4</sub> 0.8, NaH<sub>2</sub> PO<sub>4</sub> 0.9. The Good buffer, chosen based on its pK<sub>a</sub> and effective buffering pH range, was MES for pH 6.4 and HEPES for pH 6.7–7.3. After perfusion of the buffers with different pH values, we waited 1 minute for the pH to equilibrate and recorded the steady state fluorescence for each cell. ΔF/F was calculated using the pH 7.3 as the baseline. The ΔF/F at each pH was then averaged across cells, and this average was fit with piecewise linear interpolation, which was used for converting ΔF/F to pH in subsequent data analysis.</p>

<p>Dendrites were selected and analyzed in the same manner as somas, and were then associated with the connected soma. Acidification half-times were calculated by finding the maximum acidification during the stimulation period, and then finding the time point where the ΔF/F first reached half of the maximum decrease. Recovery after stimulation was fit to a single exponential, and the fit function was used to calculate the half-recovery time. Statistical tests were done using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, &quot;Diminishing neuronal acidification by channelrhodopsins with low proton conduction&quot; by Hayward and colleagues, the authors report on the properties of novel optogenetic tools, PsCatCh2.0 and ChR2-3M, that minimize photo-induced acidification. The authors point out that acidification is an undesirable side-effect of many optogenetic approaches that could be minimized using the new tools. ChRs are known to acidify cells, while Arch are known to alkalize cells. This becomes particularly important when optical stimulation is prolonged and pH changes can become significant. pH is known to affect neuronal excitability, vesicular release, and more. To develop novel optogenetic tools with minimal proton conductances, the authors combined channelrhodopsin stimulation with a red-shifted pH sensor to measure pH during optogenetic stimulation. The authors report that optogenetic activation of CheRiff caused slow cellular acidification. 150 seconds of illumination caused a 3-fold increase in protons or approximately a 0.6 unit pH change that returned to baseline very slowly. They also found that pH changes occurred more rapidly, and recovered more rapidly, in dendrites. The authors go on to robustly characterize PsCatCh2.0 and ChR2-3M in terms of their proton conductances, photocurrent, kinetics, and more. They convincingly show that these constructs induced reduced acidification while maintaining robust photocurrents. In sum, this manuscript shows important findings that convincingly characterizes 2 optogenetic tools that have reduced pH artifacts that may be of broad interest to the field of neuroscience research and optogenetic therapies.</p>

<p>In this paper, the authors utilize optogenetic stimulation and imaging techniques with fluorescent reporters for pH and membrane voltage to examine the extent of intracellular acidification produced by different ion-conducting opsins. The commonly used opsin CheRiff is found to conduct enough protons to alter intracellular pH in soma and dendrites of targeted neurons and in monolayers of HEK293T cells, whereas opsins ChR2-3M and PsCatCh2.0 are shown to produce negligible changes in intracellular pH as their photocurrents are mostly carried by metal cations. The conclusion that ChR2-3M and PsCatCh2.0 are more suited than proton conducting opsins for optogenetic applications is well supported by the data.</p>

<p>Major comments:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>What was the nature of the 0.1 increase in pH caused by illumination in CheRiff-negative cells? Is this thought to be a temperature effect?</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>The increase in pHoran4 fluorescence in CheRiff-negative cells is most likely not from a pH change; rather, it most likely reflects blue light-mediated photoactivation of the mOrange-derived chromophore in pHoran4.  Similar photoartifacts have been reported in other fluorescent protein reporters (see e.g. Farhi, Samouil L., et al. &quot;Wide-area all-optical neurophysiology in acute brain slices.&quot; Journal of Neuroscience 39.25 (2019): 4889-4908.).</p>
<p>The baseline measurement in CheRiff-negative cells is to control for this type of artifact.  We subtract the mean signal from the CheRiff-negative cells to correct the signals from the CheRiff-positive cells, as described in the Main Text.</p>

<list-item><p>Does Kir2.1 have a proton conductance? Was the resting pH of HEK cells changed by Kir2.1 expression? Fig 2D suggest basal pH is equivalent +/- Kir2.1 but it would be good to show that data.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an interesting question which our data do not answer conclusively.  Since we used an intensiometric (as opposed to ratiometric) pH indicator, our measurements only provide relative pH changes.  We assumed a constant initial pH.  We have revised the text to make clear that this is an assumption.</p>
<p>Prior studies of pH-dependent Kir2.1 activity did not find evidence of a proton current (i.e. no change in current upon extracellular acidification), though the channel is closed by intracellular acidification.  See: Ye, Wenlei, et al. &quot;The K+ channel KIR2. 1 functions in tandem with proton influx to mediate sour taste transduction.&quot; Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 113.2 (2016): E229-E238.  We added this information to the text.</p>
<p>The pKa of pHoran4 is 7.5, so a decrease in initial pH would decrease the slope of F vs pH.  We observed higher (absolute value) F/F in the Kir2.1 expressing cells than in the non-expressing cells, confirming that the Kir2.1-expressing cells had larger CheRiff-mediated acidification than the Kir2.1-negative cells (Figure 2D).  Thus this conclusion remains true regardless of whether Kir2.1 has a proton conductance.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>What channels/transporter mediate proton flux in CheRiff + Kir2.1 experiments? Is the increased proton flux simply due to more H+ ions passing through CheRiff when cells are hyperpolarized or may other voltage-dependent processes effect pH?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Fig. 2G-M address this question, specifically.  We targeted the blue light in a “zebra” pattern to only activate CheRiff in a subset of cells.  We then used voltage imaging to show that the induced voltage spread over a much wider area than the blue-illuminated region, due to gap junction coupling between the cells.  If protons flowed through some voltage-dependent channel other than CheRiff, then we would expect the acidification to follow the voltage profile.  If protons primarily flowed through the CheRiff, then we would expect the acidification to follow the illumination profile.  Fig. 2K and the following quantification show clearly that the acidification followed the illumination profile, and hence the proton current was primarily through CheRiff.</p>

<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Is Kir2.1 included in the spatial illumination experiments (Fig. 2G-M)? If so, it would be helpful to note it. The color scheme suggest it is but it would be good to note it explicitly.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes.  Clarified in text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Why is the acidification caused by 10 second of illumination smaller in Fig 2L, as compared to the equivalent experiment in 2D? Is this due to the spatial nature of the illumination? It seems that the pH change at the site of illumination should be equivalent between these 2 experiments.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>The illumination protocol between the two experiments has different duty cycles (compare Fig. 2C and 2J), so the time-averaged intensity is different.  There can also be batch-to-batch variation in CheRiff expression which would alter the proton flux and thus pH change.  To control for this, comparisons were always made between batches of cells prepared together.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The authors used 150 second illumination to examine pH changes but only 13.5 seconds to differentiate between pH changes caused by the light-activated conductance and those secondary to depolarization. Would pH changes lose their spatial limitations if a similar 150 second illumination was used? This is important because the pH change seen in the &quot;Blue On&quot; region was quite small.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, protons can diffuse between cells via gap junctions, smoothing out the spatial structure of the pH over long times.  See e.g. Wu, Ling, et al. &quot;PARIS, an optogenetic method for functionally mapping gap junctions.&quot; Elife 8 (2019): e43366.</p>
<p>We used a short (13.5 s) protocol specifically to distinguish CheRiff-mediated acidification from acidification via other conductances in electrically coupled neighboring cells.  If we had waited for longer, lateral proton diffusion could have muddied the interpretation of these experiments.</p>

<list-item><p>How long do action potentials shown in between illuminations in Fig 4H (ChR2 3M) last following cessation of illumination?</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>The closing time, τoff, of the Channelrhodopsins are shown in Table 1. The ChR2-3M has an off-time of almost 2 seconds.  The duration of post-stimulus persistent firing is expected to depend on the expression level of the ChR2-3M, the strength of the optogenetic stimulus and the excitation threshold of the neurons, i.e. on how far above threshold the neuron is at the moment the blue light turns off.  Thus we expect the post-stimulus firing time to be highly variable between cells and also to depend on optogenetic stimulus strength.  In our experiments action potentials were observed throughout the 0.5 s dark interval between stimuli.</p>

<list-item><p>While ChR2-3M construct may have promise for therapeutic applications, those strengths limit its use or basic science applications like circuit mapping. This should be noted in the discussion.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>This is an interesting manuscript investigating a potential limitation of optogenetic manipulation of cell excitability and its solution. The work is conducted rigorously and explained clearly. I only have minor concerns:</p>
<p>I think the impact of the study could be broadened by examining additional proton permeable opsins for their effects on intracellular pH. A single assay could be used to compare different opsins to CheRiff and show that the problem of intracellular acidification is not limited to CheRiff.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, this is interesting.  There are so many opsins and illumination protocols in use that we could not do an exhaustive characterization; we encourage people to test their own opsin under their conditions if doing chronic simulation.  The plasmid constructs used for this work are available on Addgene.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I am not clear on what Figure S3A is showing because I cannot see a patterning like the one shown in Fig. 2H. Perhaps a higher magnification could solve the problem.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figure S3A does not have the zebra-striped pattern of Figure 2H.  In Fig S3A, we used just one column of illumination.  The point was to test the ability of each opsin to depolarize the HEK cells.  We added images of the illumination pattern and adjusted the caption to make this clear.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>When discussing the sustained photocurrent of PsCatCh2.0, a reference to Govorunova et al. J. Biol. Chem. 2013 should be added as the low extent of light induced inactivation appears to be, at least in part, a characteristic of the particular type of opsin from P. subcordiformis.</p>
