<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The extracellular matrix (ECM) supports blood vessel architecture and functionality and undergoes active remodelling during vascular repair and atherogenesis. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are essential for vessel repair and, via their secretome, are able to invade from the vessel media into the intima to mediate ECM remodelling. Accumulation of fibronectin (FN) is a hallmark of early vascular repair and atherosclerosis and here we show that FN stimulates VSMCs to secrete small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) by activating the β1 integrin/FAK/Src pathway as well as Arp2/3-dependent branching of the actin cytoskeleton. Spatially, sEV were secreted via filopodia-like cellular protrusions at the leading edge of migrating cells. We found that sEVs are trapped by the ECM <italic>in vitro</italic> and colocalise with FN in symptomatic atherosclerotic plaques <italic>in vivo</italic>. Functionally, ECM-trapped sEVs induced the formation of focal adhesions (FA) with enhanced pulling forces at the cellular periphery. Proteomic and GO pathway analysis revealed that VSMC-derived sEVs display a cell adhesion signature and are specifically enriched with collagen VI. <italic>In vitro</italic> assays identified collagen VI as playing the key role in cell adhesion and invasion. Taken together our data suggests that the accumulation of FN is a key early event in vessel repair acting to promote secretion of collage VI enriched sEVs by VSMCs. These sEVs stimulate migration and invasion by triggering peripheral focal adhesion formation and actomyosin contraction to exert sufficient traction forces to enable VSMC movement within the complex vascular ECM network.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The healthy arterial vasculature is dominated by a highly organised medial extracellular matrix (ECM) containing organised layers of contractile vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Vascular pathologies such as atherosclerosis are associated with dramatic remodelling of the ECM ultimately leading to plaque rupture and myocardial infarction or stroke<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Progenitor medial VSMCs are essential for vessel repair and must invade through the ECM to form the protective intimal fibrous cap in the plaque. This process of VSMC invasion actively contributes to ECM remodelling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. The accumulation of liver-derived fibronectin (FN) in the vasculature is an early biomarker of atherosclerotic plaque formation and conditional FN knockout in the liver blocked VSMC invasion and fibrous cap formation in the ApoE mouse model. This suggests that FN is an essential signal for VSMC recruitment and invasion during vascular repair, yet its exact role remains unknown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>FN has been shown to play key signalling roles by modulating cellular spreading, adhesion, invasion, differentiation and viability during both developmental and pathological processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Cell adhesion to FN is primarily mediated by α5β1 integrins and proteoglycans acting together to activate small GTP-binding proteins, Cdc42, Rac1, and Rho which in turn induce branched actin cytoskeletal rearrangements to form cellular membrane protrusions, filopodia and lamellipodia, which are attached to the ECM via transient peripheral focal complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. In turn, maturation of focal complexes into focal adhesions (FAs) anchors cytoplasmic actin stress fibers to the ECM and actin polymerisation and actomyosin-mediated contractility generate the traction forces required for cell body locomotion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Exosome-like small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) are novel, cell-matrix crosstalk entities that decorate the ECM and form “migration paths” for tumour cells by enhancing cell adhesion, motility and directionality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Mechanistically, sEVs are secreted at the cellular leading edge and promote FA formation by presenting fibronectin (FN)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. In addition, sEVs can stimulate motility of immune cells and <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> by presenting cytokines and/or generating chemoattractants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. We recently showed that FN is also enriched in VSMC-derived sEVs but the exact role of sEVs in VSMC migration and invasion within the ECM meshwork environment of the vasculature remains unexplored<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Here we report that FN in the ECM induces polarized sEV secretion via filopodia by upregulating β1 integrin/FAK/Src and Arp2/3-dependent branched actin pathways. In turn, sEVs promote VSMC migration in a 2D model and enhanced directed cell invasion in a 3D model. Mechanistically sEVs induced formation of focal adhesions (FA) with enhanced pulling forces at the cellular periphery thus switching the leading edge from protrusion activity into contractile mode to enable cell body propulsion. Importantly, we found that that the sEV cargo, collagen VI, is indispensable for triggering FA formation and directed cell invasion. We hypothesize that sEV-triggered peripheral FA formation anchors the cellular leading edge and activates cell contraction to exert sufficient force to allow VSMC invasion into the complex ECM fiber meshwork. This novel mechanism opens a unique therapeutic opportunity to target specifically VSMC invasion activity during vascular repair and restenosis.</p>

<label>1.</label><title>ECM components involved in vessel injury repair stimulate sEV release via b1 integrins</title>
<p>FN is detectable in the vasculature as early as the fatty streak stage and preceding major atherogenic alterations such as neointima formation and it is also a novel marker for symptomatic carotid plaques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Given its presence during early stages of vessel injury we hypothesized that FN may modulate sEV secretion to enable vessel repair. FN is secreted as a monomeric protein forming fibrils upon cellular binding so we compared the effects of monomeric FN with the effects of FN immobilised on tissue culture plates to mimic FN fibrils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Plating VSMCs on immobilised FN increased the release of CD63+/CD81+ sEVs 3.5±0.6 fold whilst addition of soluble FN had no effect on EV secretion as detected by CD63-bead capture assay (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Fibrillar collagen I but not a non-fibrillar laminin also stimulated secretion of CD63+/CD81+ sEVs by VSMCs to the same extent as FN (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>).</p>

<p>We next tested if the native VSMC-derived 3D matrix that contains FN and collagen could modulate sEV secretion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. VSMCs were induced to produce ECM, cells were removed and fresh VSMCs plated onto these 3D matrices. VSMCs acquired an elongated shape (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>) which is typical for mesenchymal cells in a 3D environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> and increased secretion of CD63+/CD81+ sEVs compared to VSMCs plated onto the non-coated plastic (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). We observed no changes in the size distribution of sEVs secreted by VSMCs plated either on plastic or FN matrix as detected using Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>). To further characterise the EV populations released western blotting confirmed that sEVs isolated in both conditions were loaded with similar levels of FN and the sEV-specific markers CD63 and Syntenin-1 and lacked the EV-specific marker, α-actinin-4 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. In addition, treatment of the cells plated onto the matrix with sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor (3-O-Methyl-Sphingomyelin, 3-OMS) revealed that CD63+/CD81+ sEV secretion in response to collagen and FN was regulated by sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 3 (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1B</xref>) which regulates sEV generation in multivesicular bodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Hence, FN triggers secretion of CD63+/CD81+ sEVs, most likely with a late endosomal origin.</p>
<p>Both collagen I and FN are ECM ligands that bind and transduce intracellular signalling via β1 integrin. Therefore, we explored the effect of β1 integrin activating (12G10) or inhibiting antibodies (4B4) on FN-stimulated secretion of CD63+/CD81+ sEVs. Activation of β1 integrin using 12G10 antibody in VSMCs enhanced the effect of FN on sEV secretion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G</xref>). Inhibition of β1 integrin using the 4B4 antibody blocked CD63+/CD81+ sEV secretion by VSMCs plated on FN (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). Next, we tested the role of the β1 integrin downstream signalling mediators, FAK and Src<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Blocking these pathways with small inhibitors (FAM14 and PP2, respectively) reduced sEV secretion by cells plated on FN but not on plastic (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1H</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1I</xref>). Taken together these data suggest that FN matrices stimulate secretion of CD63+/CD81+ sEVs via the β1 integrin signalling pathway.</p>

<label>2.</label><title>sEV secretion depends on the branched actin cytoskeleton and occurs via filopodia</title>
<p>As β1 integrin regulates the actin cytoskeleton we next tested whether the actin cytoskeleton contributes to FN-induced sEV secretion. Filopodia are finger-like extensions of the plasma membrane that contain a core of bundled actin filaments and these structures play key roles in ECM sensing and cellular invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. To examine the contribution of filopodia to sEV secretion we treated VSMCs with the formin inhibitor, SMIFH2 that blocks filopodia formation. Inhibition of filopodia formation reduced sEV secretion by VSMCs plated on FN but not plastic indicating this was a specific mechanism stimulated by FN (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). In addition to formins, regulators of branched actin filaments, Cortactin and Arp2/3, have been implicated in filopodia formation and sEV secretion by tumour cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Inhibition of Arp2/3 using the drug CK666 reduced sEV secretion both in VSMCs plated on plastic and FN matrix (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Branched actin is involved in sEV secretion by regulating the docking of multivesicular bodies to the plasma membrane in tumour cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. To understand the role of branched actin in sEV secretion in VSMCs we explored the spatial distribution of sEV secretion by VSMCs using CD63-pHluorin where fluorescence is only observed upon the fusion of MVBs with the plasma membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. We observed the typical “burst”-like appearance of sEV secretion at the cell-ECM interface (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2A</xref> and Supplementary Video S1). Notably, we also observed an intense CD63-pHluorin staining along filopodia-like structures indicating that sEV release can occur in filopodia (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2A</xref> and Supplemental Video S1). To test whether MVBs are delivered to filopodia, we stained VSMCs for the filopodia marker, Myosin-10 (Myo10)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> and observed the presence of endogenous CD63+ MVBs along the Myo10-positive filopodia (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, arrows). Filopodia have been implicated in sEV capture and delivery to endocytosis “hot-spots”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, so next we examined the directionality of CD63+ MVB movement in filopodia by overexpressing Myo10-GFP and CD63-RFP in live VSMCs. Importantly, we observed anterograde MVB transport toward the filopodia tip (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref> and Supplemental Video S2) indicative of MVB’s secretion.</p>

<p>To test the functional role of Arp2/3 in the sEV secretion pathway, we overexpressed the Arp2/3 subunit, ARPC2-GFP and the F-actin marker, F-tractin-RFP in live VSMCs. As expected, Arp2/3 and F-actin formed a distinct lamellipodia scaffold (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B</xref> and Supplementary Video S3). We also observed Arp2/3 and F-actin positive vesicle movement through the VSMC cytoplasm (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B</xref>, arrow, and Supplementary Video S3) suggesting that Arp2/3-driven actin comet tails are involved in intracellular trafficking. Indeed, intracellular parasites engage Arp2/3-driven actin comet tails for propulsion through the cell cytosol and to spread through the cellular filopodia to neighbouring cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Therefore, we tested if Arp2/3-driven actin comet tails propel MVBs through the cell. To do this we expressed CD63-GFP in live VSMCs to label MVBs and observed MVB propulsion by the F-actin tail (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref> and Supplementary Video S4).</p>
<p>Altogether these data show that activation of a β1 integrin-specific pathway by the FN matrix induces sEV secretion by VSMCs. Spatially, sEV secretion occurs at VSMC filopodia-like protrusion sites and is assisted by the branched actin network suggesting that sEVs may be tightly involved in the regulation of cell motility and invasion.</p>

<p>EV trapping in the ECM is a prominent feature of the vessel media and intima and EVs become more abundant in the ECM with ageing and disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Therefore, we next set out to determine if sEV can be trapped in the native matrix <italic>in vitro</italic>. VSMCs were plated on plastic or FN for 24hours and sEVs were visualised by CD63 immunofluorescence. We observed CD63 puncta in close proximity to filopodia-like cell projectiles (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). Interestingly, these CD63+ sEVs were observed both on the plastic and FN-coated plates suggesting that sEVs can bind to ECM secreted by VSMCs over the 24h incubation. We also visualised CD63+ sEV trapping in the native ECM produced by VSMCs over a 7 day period and their reduction/absence from the matrix when VSMCs were treated with SMPD3 siRNA (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig S3</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To understand how VSMCs interact with sEVs in the ECM we next isolated and fluorescently-labelled sEVs and added them to VSMCs to track sEV distribution. Super-resolution microscopy (iSIM) revealed that the addition of sEVs to the cell media resulted in fast uptake by VSMCs and their localization at the nuclear periphery (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig S3B</xref>). This was particularly obvious in 3D projections (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig S3B</xref>). Next, sEVs were added to FN-coated plates prior to the addition of VSMCs. This resulted in the sEVs remaining evenly deposited across the ECM and these immobilised EVs were not internalised by cells even after incubation for 24h (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig S3C</xref>). Notably, no perinuclear localisation of sEVs was observed.</p>
<p>To spatially map the accumulation of sEV markers in the atherosclerotic plaque <italic>in vivo</italic> we collected 12 carotid atherosclerotic plaques and adjacent intact vascular segments excised during carotid endarterectomy. Unbiased proteomics analysis confirmed considerable differences between these 2 sample groups, revealing 213 plaque-specific and 111 intact arterial-specific proteins (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>, Tables S1-S5). Differential expression analysis identified 46 proteins significantly overexpressed (fold change ≥ 2 and FDR-adjusted P value ≤ 0.05) in plaques and 13 proteins significantly upregulated in the intact arterial segments (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>, Table S3). Among the top proteins differentially expressed in plaques were catalytic lipid-associated bioscavenger paraoxonase 1, atherogenic apolipoprotein B-100, HDL-associated apolipoprotein D, iron-associated protein haptoglobin, and inflammation-related matrix metalloproteinase-9 (Table S3). These proteins have previously been implicated in lipid metabolism alterations as well as inflammation in the plaque hence indicating the advanced atherosclerotic plaque signature of the analysed samples. Comparison of the differentially expressed proteins also revealed an accumulation in atherosclerotic regions of fetuin-A (Alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein, P02765, 2.7 fold increase, p=0.003869659), an abundant sEV cargo protein which is recycled by VSMCs. Likewise, the level of another sEV cargo, Apolipoprotein B-100 (P04114) was also significantly elevated (2.8 fold increase, p= 0.000124446) in atherosclerotic plaque (Table S2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Notably, a negative regulator of sEV secretion, Coronin 1C (Q9ULV4) was downregulated in the plaque (0.6 fold decrease, p=0.000805372, Table S2) consistent with previous studies that suggest sEV secretion is upregulated during plaque progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>To test if FN associates with sEV markers in atherosclerosis, we investigated the spatial association of FN with sEV markers using the sEV-specific marker CD81. Interestingly, FN accumulated both in the neointima and the tunica media where it was significantly colocalised with CD81 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4G</xref>). Notably CD81 and FN colocalization was particularly prominent in cell-free, matrix-rich plaque regions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4F</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4G</xref>). Western blot analysis confirmed FN accumulation in the plaque region (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs 4G</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4A</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4B</xref>). To understand the origin of plaque FN we performed RT-PCR. FN expression could not be detected in plaques nor in intact vessels, although it was abundant in the liver (<italic>data not shown</italic>), suggesting that the circulation is a key source of FN in atherosclerotic plaques. To test whether circulating FN can be recycled in sEVs and subsequently deposited we treated primary human aortic VSMCs with FN and found that it was endocytosed and subsequently delivered to early and late endosomes together with fetuin A, another abundant sEV cargo elevated in plaques (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figs S4C</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4D</xref>). In addition, FN could be co-purified with sEVs from VSMC conditioned media (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig S4E</xref>) and detected on the surface of sEVs by flow cytometry confirming its loading in, and secretion via, sEVs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4H</xref>).</p>

<p>FN as a cargo in sEVs promotes FA formation in tumour cells and increases cell speed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. As we found that FN is loaded into VSMC-derived sEVs we hypothesized that ECM-entrapped sEVs can enhance cell migration by increasing cell adhesion and FA formation in the context of a FN-rich ECM. Therefore, we tested the effect of sEV deposition onto the FN matrix on VSMC migration in 2D and 3D models. We found that FN coating and the addition of sEVs promoted VSMC velocity and overall migration distance in a 2D single-cell migration model (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5A</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>) in agreement with previous studies using tumour cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>.

<p>To assess the effect of sEVs on cell directionality we exploited a 3D model developed by Sung et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> and examined VSMC invasion using a μ-Slide Chemotaxis assay where cells were embedded into FN-enriched 3D Matrigel matrices in the absence or presence of exogenously-added sEVs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). We developed a script to automatically measure cell invasion parameters (track length, cell speed, straightness, accumulated distance, lateral and vertical displacement and parallel forward motion index (FMI)). The addition of sEVs had no effect on cell speed, accumulated distance or straightness (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5D</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5F</xref>). However, VSMCs invading in the presence of embedded sEVs migrated more aligned to the FBS gradient compared to cells plated in the absence of sEVs. To test whether this was a feature of all EV populations we also performed the experiment in the presence of larger EVs pelleted at the 10,000x<italic>g</italic> centrifugation step and observed no effect suggesting this mechanism was specific to sEVs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5G</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5H</xref>).</p>
<p>We wondered whether it was the FN cargo in sEVs that was promoting VSMC migration by enhancing FA assembly and cellular adhesion to FN similar to sEV in cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Therefore, we measured VSMC adhesion to FN using an adhesion assay where sEVs were added to FN-coated plates and cells were plated onto these matrices for 1h and firmly attached cells counted. Surprisingly we observed a marked reduction of VSMC adhesion to FN in the presence of sEVs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>) suggesting that sEV can impair VSMC adhesion. Mesenchymal cell attachment to the matrix is mediated by transient focal complexes present in the cellular protrusion as well as centripetal FAs that link the cellular cytoskeleton to the matrix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Consistent with this we observed both focal complexes in the cellular protrusion as well as more centripetal FAs associated with mature actin stress fibres in VSMCs on FN matrix (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig S5A</xref>). Therefore, we used a live cell spreading assay to monitor cellular adhesion over time using ACEA’s xCELLigence. As expected, FN alone stimulated VSMC spreading and adhesion (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6B</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>). Addition of sEVs did not impact cellular adhesion over the first ∼15 min but then the adhesion was stalled in the presence of sEVs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>) suggesting some defect in further cellular spreading. Again, to test whether this was specific for the sEV subset, we also tested the effect of larger EVs pelleted at 10,000x <italic>g</italic> and found that these EVs had no effect on VSMC adhesion and spreading onto the FN matrix (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>). To interrogate the stalling event induced by sEVs in VSMCs we plated cells and counted the number of FAs, average size as well as distance from the cell periphery after 30 mins using TIRF microscopy. Once again plating VSMCs onto FN increased the cell size, number of FAs as well as the number of centripetal FAs as compared to cells spreading over non-coated plastic (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs 6E-I</xref>). Importantly, addition of sEVs to FN significantly reduced the number of FAs and the newly formed FAs were formed in close proximity to the cell periphery (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6E</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref>). Interestingly, the average FA size was similar between the various conditions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5I</xref>).</p>

To test if sEVs can influence FA turnover in migrating VSMCs we examined FA turnover in the presence of sEVs.

Interestingly, the FA turnover index remains the same in the presence of sEVs indicating that FA stability was not altered (6J). These data correlate well with no changes observed in FA average size across various conditions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6I</xref>) and indicate that sEVs are not influencing FA assembly or “life-cycle” directly.

We hypothesized that sEVs trigger the appearance of pre-mature, peripheral FAs by activating Rho-dependent cellular contractility. To test whether sEVs can modulate mature FA contractility we measured individual traction force which is generated by mature adhesion sites in the absence or presence of sEVs (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5C</xref>). VSMCs transfected with paxillin-RFP were plated on FN and sEV-covered PDMS pillars and pillar displacements were calculated as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Importantly, the traction force was increased in the presence of sEVs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6K</xref>). Altogether these data suggest that sEVs can trigger the formation of FAs with enhanced pulling force at the cell periphery.</p>

<p>To identify the components triggering peripheral FA formation we compared the proteomic composition of sEVs with the larger EV fraction, which had no effect on FA formation.

<p>Collagen VI was the most abundant protein in VSMC-derived sEVs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>, Table S7). Collagen VI was previously implicated in the interaction with the proteoglycan NG2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> and suppression of cell spreading on FN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. To test the role of collagen VI in sEV-induced changes in VSMC spreading we incubated FN-deposited sEVs with an anti-collagen VI antibody to block its interaction with the proteoglycan NG2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Addition of the anti-collagen VI antibody restored VSMC spreading on the FN matrix as compared to non-specific IgG treatment (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). Moreover, sEVs isolated from VSMCs after collagen VI knockdown using siRNA had no effect in the 3D invasion model on cell speed (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7E</xref>) or direction (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref>) but reduced cell alignment to the gradient as compared to VSMCs treated with a scrambled siRNA control (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7J</xref>). Finally, we compared the expression of collagen VI, EDIL3 and TGFBI between the plaque and control aorta tissues (Table S1). Importantly, collagen VI and TGFBI expression were significantly elevated in the plaque (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7I</xref>) consistent with increased deposition of sEVs during disease progression. Altogether these data indicate that sEVs induce a reduction in cell spreading and premature peripheral FA formation by presenting collagen VI thus acting to enhance cell locomotion (Graphical Abstract).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>VSMC migration and invasion to the site of vascular injury is crucial for vessel repair as well as the pathogenic development of atherosclerotic plaque, however the mechanisms of effective invasion through the complex vascular ECM meshwork have been poorly studied. Here we show that FN, a novel marker of unstable plaques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, enables VSMC migration and invasion by stimulating secretion of collagen VI-loaded sEVs which decorate the ECM and stimulate FA maturation. Notably, our data are consistent and extend previous reports showed that EV secretion by tumour cells enhances nascent adhesion formation hence facilitating tumor cell migration and invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. In particular, we found that sEVs induce formation of FAs with an enhanced pulling force at the cell periphery thus favouring actomyosin-mediated contractility which is essential for cell body propulsion and locomotion.</p>
<p>Mesenchymal cell migration begins with protrusive activity at the leading edge followed by the forward movement of the cell body<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Cell directionality is guided via the integrin β1 “probe” on the tip of cellular protrusions, filopodia and lamellipodia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Cellular protrusions are attached to the ECM via focal complexes and extended by the physical force generated by the branched network of actin filaments beneath the plasma membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Focal complexes either disassemble or mature into the elongated centripetally located focal adhesions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. These focal adhesions anchor the ECM to actin stress fibres and the traction force generated by actomyosin-mediated contractility pulls the FAs rearward and the cell body forward<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Here we report that β1 integrin activation triggers sEV release via the filopodia and sEVs stimulate VSMC migration and invasion in 2D and 3D assays, respectively. To gain insight into how sEVs can stimulate cell motility we explored VSMC protrusive activity using live cell spreading assays and TIRF imaging. FN stimulated VSMC spreading by increasing the number of FAs, which were formed centripetally from the cell plasma membrane. FN decoration with sEV dramatically ceased VSMC spreading by inducing pre-mature formation of FAs at the cellular periphery. Cellular spreading and adhesion are orchestrated by the Rho family of small GTPases, Cdc42, Rac1 and Rho with Cdc42 and Rac1 modulating filopodia and lamellipodia and focal complex formation and Rho controlling FA maturation and actomyosin-mediated contractility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Interestingly, in fibroblasts Rho is specifically degraded in cellular protrusions and cellular spreading on FN is accompanied by transient Rho suppression during the fast cell spreading phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. This phase is followed by Rho activation leading to formation of actin stress fibres, tension increase on the focal complexes and their maturation into elongated centripetally located FAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Excessive Rho activation leads to premature FA assembly and stress fiber formation resulting in reduced cellular protrusions, inhibition of cellular spreading and motility on the FN matrix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> Altogether these data indicate that Rho activity, in mesenchymal cells with extensive FA networks such as fibroblasts or VSMCs, can slow down cell migration by immobilising cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. However, we found that sEVs are not influencing mature FA stability. On the contrary, sEV-induced FAs were spatially restricted to the cell periphery near cellular protrusions and were characterised by an enhanced pulling force activity. Interestingly, fibroblast polarization is driven by Smurf1-dependent RhoA ubiquitinylation and localised degradation in cellular protrusions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. A recent study indicated that Rho-dependent contractility is essential for cell invasion in a 3D model and it is tempting to speculate that local Rho activity can enable VSMC invasion by stabilizing FAs at the leading edge and stimulating actomyosin-mediated contractility and cell body movement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. On the other hand Rho– ROCK activity is critical for the protease-independent rounded motility of tumour cells and cell types with few adhesion contacts (ameboid) when Rho-dependent contractile forces generate hydrostatic pressure forming multiple membrane blebs to invade the ECM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. In fact, we observed an extensive secretion of sEVs which ceased protrusion activity; also VSMCs acquired a rounded morphology when “hovering” over the FN matrix decorated with sEVs (data not shown). Hence, it will be interesting to study in the future if VSMCs can “high-jack” some elements of “amoeboid-like invasiveness” mode seen in tumors by secreting sEVs.</p>
<p>Collagen VI is a nonfibrillar collagen that assembles into beaded microfilaments upon secretion and it plays both structural and signalling roles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Interestingly, type VI collagen deposition by interstitial fibroblasts is increased in the infarcted myocardium and collagen VI knockout in mice improves cardiac function, structure and remodelling after myocardial infarction via unknown pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that in the healthy vasculature collagen VI is detected in the endothelial basement membrane in the intima and is also forms fibrillar structures between smooth muscle cells in the media. In the fibrous plaque collagen VI is diffusely distributed throughout both the fibrous cap and atheroma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Curiously, treatment of ApoE-/- mice with antibodies to collagen VI reduced atherosclerosis but its exact role has remained unknown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. We and others detected Collagen VI in sEVs but its functional significance remained unknown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. Here we showed that collagen VI is essential for early FA formation at the VSMC periphery as well as VSMC invasion in a 3D model. We propose that collagen VI modulates FA formation either by activating cellular signalling or acting as a structural component changing local ECM stiffness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Identified collagen VI receptors include α3β1 integrin, the cell surface proteoglycan chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan-4 (CSPG4; also known as NG2), and the anthrax toxin receptors 1 and 2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. Interestingly, a novel, recently identified Collagen VI signalling receptor (CMG2/ANTXR2) mediates localised Rho activation upon collagen VI binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>. NG2 also activates the Rho/ROCK pathway leading to effective amoeboid invasiveness of tumour cells which is characterised by excessive blebbing and enhanced actomyosin contractility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. Hence, biding of collagen VI to these receptors can potentially locally activate Rho and trigger FA formation and actomyosin contractility thus increasing VSMC motility and directional invasiveness. Of note, it was also reported that NG2 expression is elevated in VSMCs in the atherosclerotic plaque and NG2 knockout prevents plaque formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. Curiously, endotrophin, collagen VI α3 chain-derived profibrotic fragment has recently been associated with a higher risk of arterial stiffness and cardiovascular and all-cause death in patients with diabetes type 1 and atherosclerosis, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>. Hence, targeting this novel sEV-dependent mechanism of VSMC invasion may open-up new therapeutic opportunities to modulate atherosclerotic plaque development or even to prevent undesired VSMC motility in restenosis.</p>
<p>We also identified a positive feedback loop and showed that FN stimulates sEV secretion by VSMCs. sEV secretion is a tightly regulated process which is governed by activation of signalling pathways including activation of G-protein coupled receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> and alterations in cytosolic calcium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>, small GTPases Rab7, Rab27a, Rab27b and Rab35<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup>, vesicular trafficking scaffold proteins including syntenin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>, sortillin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup> and CD63<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup> or accumulation of ceramide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. We found that the fibrillar ECM proteins, FN and collagen I induce sEV secretion by activating the β1 integrin/FAK/Src and Arp2/3-dependent pathways. Our <italic>in vivo</italic> FN staining data are in good agreement with previous studies showing accumulation of FN in late-stage plaques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Moreover, we observed close co-distribution of FN and CD81 in the plaque suggesting that accumulating FN matrices can stimulate sEV secretion <italic>in vivo</italic>. Notably, expression of the major FN receptor, α5β1 integrin is re-activated upon VSMC de-differentiation following vascular injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup>. It is thought the α5β1 integrin mediates FN matrix assembly, whilst β3 integrins are important for cell-matrix interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup>. Our data sheds new light on the functional role of α5β1 as an ECM sensor inducing production of collagen VI-loaded sEVs which in turn enhance cell invasion in the complex ECM meshwork. Excessive collagen and elastin matrix breakdown in atheroma has been tightly linked to acute coronary events hence it will be interesting to study the possible link between sEV secretion and plaque stability as sEV-dependent invasion is also likely to influence the necessary ECM degradation induced by invading cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup>. In summary, cooperative activation of integrin signalling and F-actin cytoskeleton pathways results in strict spatiotemporal control of the secretion of sEVs controlling cell-ECM crosstalk. Further studies are needed to test these mechanisms across various cell types and ECM matrices.</p>

<p>Summary. In this investigation Kapustin et al. demonstrate that vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) exposed to the extracellular matrix fibronectin stimulates the release of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs). The authors provide experimental evidence that stimulation of the actin cytoskeleton boosts sEV secretion and posit that sEVs harbor both fibronectin and collagen IV protein themselves which also, in turn, alter cell migration parameters. It is well established that fibronectin is associated with increased cell migration and adherence; therefore, this association with VSMCs is not novel. The authors purport that sEV are largely born of filopodia origin; however, this data is not well executed and seems generally at odds with the presented data. Similarly, the effect of sEVs on parameters of cell migration has almost no magnitude of effect, making mechanism exploration somewhat nebulous. Lastly, the proposed mechanism of VSMCs responding to, and depositing, ECM proteins via sEVs was not rigorously executed; again, making the conclusions challenging for the reader to interpret.</p>
<p>Strengths. The authors provide a comprehensive battery of cytoskeletal experiments to test how fibronectin and sEVs impact both sEV release and vascular smooth muscle cell migratory activation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses. Unfortunately, this article suffers from many weaknesses. First, the rigor of the experimental approach is low, which calls into question the merit of the conclusions. In this vein, there is a lack of proper controls or inclusion of experiments addressing alternative explanations for the phenotype or lack thereof.</p>

<p>Extracellular vesicles have recently gained significant attention across a wide variety of fields, and they have therefore been implicated in numerous physiological and pathophysiological processes. When such a discovery and an explosion of interest occur in science, there is often much excitement and hope for answers to mechanisms that have remained elusive and poorly understood. Unfortunately, there is an equal amount of hype and overstatement that may also be put forth in the name of &quot;impact&quot;, but this temptation must be avoided so that scientists and the broader public are not misled by overreaching interpretations and statements that lack rigorous and fully convincing evidence.</p>
<p>The study presented by Kapustin et al. is certainly intriguing and timely, and it offers an interesting working hypothesis for the fields of extracellular vesicles and vascular biology to consider. The authors do a reasonable job at detecting these small extracellular vesicles, though some aspects of data presentation are missing such as full Western blots with accompanying size markers for the viewer to more fully appreciate that data and comparisons being made (see Figures 1 and 7).</p>
<p>Much of the imaging data from cell-based experiments is strong and conducted with many cutting-edge tools and approaches. That said, the static images and the dynamic imaging fall short of being fully convincing that the small extracellular vesicles found in the neighboring extracellular matrix are indeed being deposited there via the smooth muscle cell filopodia. Many of the lines of evidence presented suggest that this could occur, but alternative hypotheses also exist that were not fully ruled out, such as the ECM-deposited vesicles were secreted more from the soma and/or the lamellipodia that are also emitted and retracted from the cells. In particular, the authors show very nice dynamic imaging (Supplementary Figure S2A and Supplemental Video S1) that is interpreted as &quot;extracellular vesicles being released from the cell&quot; and these are seen as &quot;bursts&quot; of fluorescent signal; however, none of these appear to occur in filopodia as they appear within the cell proper (a &quot;burst&quot; of signal vs. a more intense &quot;streak&quot; of signal), which would be a stronger and more consistent observation predicted by the working model proposed by the authors.</p>
<p>Imaging of related human samples is certainly a strength of the paper, and the authors are commended for attempting to connect the findings from their cell culture experiments to an important clinical scenario. However, the marker selected for marking extracellular vesicles is CD81, which has been described as present on the endothelium of atherosclerotic plaques with a proposed role in the recruitment of monocytes into diseased arteries (Rohlena et al. Cardiovasc Res 2009). More data should address this potentially confounding interpretation of the signals presented in images within Figure 4.</p>
<p>On a conceptual level, the idea that the small extracellular vesicles contain Type VI Collagen, and this element of their cargo is modulating smooth muscle cell migration, is an intriguing aspect of the authors' working model. Nevertheless, the evidence supporting this potential mechanism does not quite fit together as presented. It is not entirely clear how the collagen VI within the vesicles is somehow accessed by the smooth muscle cell filopodia during migration. Are the vesicles lysed open once on the extracellular matrix? If so, what is the proposed mechanism for that to occur? If not, how are the adhesion molecules on the smooth muscle cell surface engaging the collagen VI fibers that are contained within the vesicles? This aspect of the model does not quite fit together with the proposed mechanism and may be an interesting speculative interpretation, warranting further investigation, but it should not be considered a strong conclusion with sufficient convincing data supporting this idea.</p>
<p>On a technical level, some of the statistical analysis is not readily understood from the data presented. It is very much appreciated that the authors show many of the graphs with technical and biological replicate values in addition to the means and standard deviations (though this is not clearly stated in all figure legends). However, in figures such as Figure 5, there are bars shown and indicated to be different by statistical comparison (see panel B in Figure 5). It is not clear how the values for Group 1 (no FN, no 3-OMS, no sEV) are statistically different (denoted by three asterisks but no p value provided in the legend) than Group 3 (no FN, 3-OMS added, no sEV), when their means and standard deviations appear almost identical. If this is an oversight, this needs to be corrected. If this is truly the outcome, further explanation is warranted. A higher level of transparency in such instances would certainly go a long way in helping address the current crisis of mistrust within the scientific community and at the interface with society at-large.</p>
