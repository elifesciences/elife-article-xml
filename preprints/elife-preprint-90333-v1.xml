<title>Abstract</title>
<p><italic>Retinoic acid-induced 1</italic> (<italic>RAI1</italic>) haploinsufficiency causes Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS), a genetic disorder with symptoms including hyperphagia, hyperlipidemia, severe obesity, and autism phenotypes. Rai1 is a transcriptional regulator with a pan-neural expression pattern and hundreds of downstream targets. The mechanisms linking neural <italic>Rai1</italic> to body weight regulation remain unclear. Here we find that hypothalamic brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf)-TrkB signalling is disrupted in SMS (<italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic>) mice. Selective Rai1 loss from all Bdnf-producing cells or from Bdnf-producing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) induced obesity in mice. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that <italic>Rai1</italic> ablation increased inhibitory synaptic transmission to PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neurons and decreased intrinsic neuronal excitability. Chronic treatment of SMS mice with a partial agonist of tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), the cognate Bdnf receptor, delayed obesity onset. This treatment also partially rescued disrupted lipid profiles, insulin intolerance, and stereotypical repetitive behaviour in SMS mice. These data argue that Rai1 regulates body weight and metabolic function through hypothalamic Bdnf-producing neurons and that targeting TrkB signalling might improve associated SMS phenotypes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Obesity is an increasing global concern: 20% of the world’s adult population is expected to become obese by 2025 if current trends persist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Collaboration, 2017</xref>). However, the complex environmental, behavioural, and genetic contributions to obesity make this a difficult condition to model and address. Monogenic obesity disorders provide a consistent system where the pathophysiology, genetic predisposition, and neurobiology underlying phenotypes can potentially provide insights that translate to polygenic obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Loos &amp; Yeo, 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>One such monogenic disorder is Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS; OMIM #182290) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Smith <italic>et al</italic>, 1986</xref>), a neurogenetic condition frequently associated with obesity. 80% of SMS cases are caused by interstitial deletions of the 17p11.2 chromosomal region containing a dosage-sensitive gene, <italic>retinoic acid-induced 1</italic> (<italic>RAI1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Slager <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). More than 90% of SMS patients are overweight (40% &gt; 95<sup>th</sup> percentile weight, 40% &gt; 85<sup>th</sup> percentile weight) and exhibit over-eating tendencies by adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alaimo <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Burns <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gandhi <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). 20% of SMS patients do not have 17p11.2 deletions but instead carry <italic>RAI1</italic> point mutations that are still frequently associated with obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Boot <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Edelman <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). These clinical data indicate that RAI is critical for energy homeostasis underlying body weight regulation.</p>
<p>The human RAI1 protein shares &gt;80% sequence identity with the mouse Rai1 protein, allowing us to study Rai1 function <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Huang <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Javed <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). We previously found that <italic>Rai1</italic> encodes a transcriptional regulator that binds to the promoter or enhancer regions of its target genes, most of which are involved in neurodevelopment and synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Huang <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). SMS (<italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic>) mice exhibit obesity associated with hyperphagia and increased adiposity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Burns <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Huang <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, Rai1 may have a sexually dimorphic function, as female SMS mice exhibit more pronounced obesity than males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Burns <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Huang <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Using a homozygous <italic>Rai1</italic> conditional knockout (<italic>Rai1</italic>-cKO) mice, we found that <italic>Rai1</italic> deletion in either subcortical excitatory neurons (vGlut2<sup>+</sup>) or single-minded homolog 1 (Sim1<sup>+</sup>) neurons induced obesity in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Huang <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). Sim1<sup>+</sup> neurons reside in several brain regions including the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract, the supraoptic nucleus, the medial amygdala, and the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH), a region that is critical for body weight regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Balthasar <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Sim1<sup>+</sup> neurons in the PVH are composed of several molecularly defined cell types including those that express oxytocin, vasopressin, corticotropin-releasing hormone, somatostatin, melanocortin-4-receptor (MC4R), growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), or brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">An <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). Deleting <italic>Bdnf</italic> from the PVH results in hyperphagic obesity and reduced locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">An <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). While PVH neuronal activity is reduced during feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Xu <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>), activation of PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neurons results in weight loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wu &amp; Xu, 2022</xref>). We recently found that Rai1 promotes <italic>Bdnf</italic> expression in hypothalamus throughout life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Javed <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). We hypothesized that Rai1 may be connected to Bdnf-producing neurons in PVH, explaining how a neural transcription factor regulates body weight homeostasis.</p>
<p>Bdnf regulates energy metabolism by binding to its cognate receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">An <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>) and may thus provide a potential therapeutic target for SMS. However, the link between <italic>Rai1,</italic> Bdnf, and SMS symptoms is currently unclear. Patients carrying monogenic mutations in either <italic>BDNF</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gray <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) or <italic>NTRK2</italic> (encoding TrkB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Yeo <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>) experience severe hyperphagic obesity. Moreover, obesity and associated metabolic dysfunction such as impaired glucose and insulin sensitivity are correlated with impaired PI3K-Akt pathway, a TrkB downstream target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Su <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). Given that (1) <italic>Bdnf</italic> overexpression during early embryonic development or (2) targeting <italic>Bdnf</italic> overexpression to the PVH of adolescent SMS (<italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic>) mice protected them from weight gain and metabolic defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Javed <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>), and that (3) a point mutation in <italic>RAI1</italic> disrupts its ability to transcriptionally enhance <italic>Bdnf</italic> expression <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abad <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>), pharmacological targeting of Bdnf signaling is an attractive and yet unexplored therapeutic avenue for SMS.</p>
<p>Building on our previous discoveries, here we examine the neurobiological functions of Rai1 in Bdnf-producing neurons, specifically those that reside in the PVH. Importantly, we evaluated the involvement of the Bdnf-TrkB pathways in SMS pathogenesis using a small molecule drug (LM22A-4) to enhance TrkB signalling. Our work indicates that PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neurons depend on Rai1 to maintain normal neuronal activity and regulate body weight homeostasis, and TrkB signalling dysfunction contributes to obesity associated with SMS mice.</p>

<title><italic>Rai1</italic> deficiency dysregulates specific downstream targets of neurotrophin in the mouse hypothalamus</title>
<p>Multiple lines of evidence indicated that SMS mice show decreased <italic>Bdnf</italic> mRNA expression in the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Burns <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Huang <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Javed <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). To determine if Bdnf protein levels were consequently altered in the hypothalamus, we performed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and found that Bdnf protein levels were significantly reduced in 7-week-old pre-symptomatic SMS mice relative to controls (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref></bold>). To quantify if molecular pathways associated with Bdnf-TrkB signalling were altered, we subjected hypothalamic tissue lysates from 7-week-old pre-obese SMS and control (Ctrl) mice to reverse phase protein array (RPPA) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref></bold>). We found that control and SMS samples clustered separately in principle component analysis (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>Hierarchical clustering analysis indicated that the majority of differentially expressed phosphorylated proteins (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref></bold>) and total proteins (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref></bold>) were downregulated in SMS mice. We mapped all proteins, as well as phospho-proteins, that were differentially expressed in Ctrl and SMS samples onto the interconnected biological network and identified a subset of connected nodes downregulated in SMS (FDR &lt; 10e-5) belong to the neurotrophin, PI3K-Akt, and mTOR signalling pathways (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref></bold>). These pathways are known to play a critical role in regulating body weight homeostasis and can be activated by Bdnf either directly (neurotrophin pathway) or indirectly (PI3K-Akt and mTOR pathways) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cota <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Schultze <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). The expression levels of PIK3CA, a common node in these pathways, were significantly reduced in the SMS mice compared to controls (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref></bold>). Moreover, the expression levels of phosphorylated NF-κB (nuclear factor-kappa B), a downstream target of the neurotrophin pathway, were significantly reduced in the SMS group (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G</xref></bold>). Together, these results suggest that <italic>Rai1</italic> loss impairs specific pathways, including neurotrophin signalling, and indicate that dysfunction of Bdnf-producing cells could contribute to SMS pathogenesis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Bdnf-producing cells depend on Rai1 to regulate body weight homeostasis</title>
<p>To target Bdnf-producing cells, we used a <italic>Bdnf<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic>mouse line that carries a viral 2A oligopeptide and Cre recombinase immediately upstream of Bdnf’s endogenous STOP codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Tan <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). We crossed the <italic>Bdnf<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> mice with tdTomato-Ai9 reporter mice and found that Ai9 signals faithfully reflected endogenous Bdnf protein expression in the PVH (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2_1">Figure 2— figure supplement 1A-E</xref></bold>). More than 50% of Bdnf-producing cells within the PVH were positive for phosphorylated TrkB (p-TrkB) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2_1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref></bold>). Moreover, 20% of p-TrkB<sup>+</sup> PVH cells express Bdnf, suggesting that Bdnf could have an autocrine mode of action in this cell type (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2_1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F-J</xref></bold>). We also found that Rai1 is expressed in PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> cells that are distinct from larger magnocellular cells such as the PVH oxytocin neurons (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2_2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A-I</xref></bold>). Specifically, 55% of PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neurons express Rai1, whereas only 2% of PVH<sup>Oxytocin</sup> neurons express Rai1 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2_2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2I</xref></bold>). These data suggest that Rai1 is enriched in Bdnf-producing neurons in the mouse PVH.</p>
<p>To determine if Bdnf-producing cells depend on Rai1 to regulate body weight, we deleted one or both copies of <italic>Rai1</italic> using the <italic>Bdnf<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> and the conditional <italic>Rai1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Huang <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2_3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref></bold>). Conditional knockout mice (cKO: <italic>Bdnf<sup>Cre/+</sup>; Rai1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>) showed a significant reduction in Rai1 expression in PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neurons compared to controls (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B-C</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2_3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>)</bold>. The total number of Bdnf-producing cells in the PVH remained similar in Ctrl and cKO mice (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2_3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref></bold>), indicating that Rai1 loss did not affect PVH neurogenesis or survival.</p>

Ing.) fat in cKO mice of both sexes and increased mass of epididymal adipose tissues (eWAT) in female cKOs (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2_4">Figure 2— figure supplement 4D</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>In contrast, the total mass of brown adipose tissue (BAT) remained unchanged between groups (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2_4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4D</xref></bold>). In both male and female cKO mice, we found hypertrophic eWAT adipocytes (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2G</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2_4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4E</xref></bold>) and elevated blood leptin levels (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2H</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2_4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4F</xref></bold>). However, there was no significant alteration in blood lipids such as triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) in either male or female cKO mice (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2_3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3E-G</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2_4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4G-I</xref>)</bold>. Altogether, these data suggest that obesity caused by ablating <italic>Rai1</italic> from Bdnf-producing cells is associated with increased fat mass, fat deposition, and leptin levels.</p>
<p>Obesity could result from increased food intake, reduced energy expenditure, or both. Similar to SMS mice, male and female cKO mice did not have defects in respiratory exchange rates when measured by indirect calorimetry (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2_3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3H</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2_4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4J</xref></bold>). Interestingly, cKO mice showed sex-specific differences in energy expenditure. During the dark phase, female cKO mice showed a reduction in energy expenditure (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2I</xref></bold>) and decrease in total locomotor activity (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2J</xref></bold>). In contrast, total food intake remained unchanged (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2K</xref></bold>). Male cKO mice became hyperphagic (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2_4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4K</xref></bold>), showed increased energy expenditure during the dark phase (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2_4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4L</xref></bold>), and exhibited normal locomotor activity when compared to controls (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2_4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4M</xref></bold>). These results suggest that obesity in male cKO mice is attributable to overeating despite an increase in energy expenditure.</p>
<p>To determine if Rai1 loss from Bdnf-producing cells impacts metabolic function, a glucose tolerance test (GTT) was performed. Interestingly, cKO mice of both sexes showed normal blood glucose levels right before the test but became hyperglycemic 20 minutes (female cKO) and 45 minutes (male cKO) after glucose administration (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2L</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2_4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4N</xref></bold>). This change was accompanied by a significantly higher area under the curve (AUC) for both groups (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2_3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2_4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4O</xref></bold>). While the male cKO mice remained hyperglycemic throughout the GTT (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2_4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4P</xref></bold>), the glucose levels in female cKO mice returned to normal towards the end (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2L</xref></bold>). We also found increased blood insulin levels during the GTT in both sexes (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2_3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2_4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4P</xref></bold>). In the insulin tolerance test (ITT), female cKO mice showed moderately elevated glucose levels 20 minutes into the test (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2_3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3K</xref></bold>). By contrast, male cKO mice showed considerably higher glucose levels than controls in the ITT (∼6.5 ng/ml for cKO and ∼2.0ng/ml for Ctrl) during the 60- to 120-minute intervals (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2_4">Figure 2— figure supplement 4Q</xref></bold>). Altogether, these experiments demonstrate that Bdnf-producing cells depend on Rai1 to regulate body weight, adiposity, glucose and insulin tolerance in mice.</p>

<title><italic>Rai1</italic> deletion reduces PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neuronal excitability</title>
<p>Bdnf-producing neurons are widely distributed in the hypothalamus, being found in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Unger <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), ventromedial hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Xu <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>), and PVH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">An <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). To understand how <italic>Rai1</italic> loss affects intrinsic neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission of PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neurons that underlie energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">An <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>), we fluorescently labelled them with Cre-dependent tdTomato (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref></bold>). We found that a hyperpolarized step followed by increasing the holding voltage at resting membrane potentials (Rm) was able to initiate rebound firing or rebound repetitive firing in most PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neurons (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3_1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref></bold>). Hyperpolarization-induced <italic>I<sub>H</sub></italic> currents and low depolarization events were observed in some PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neurons (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3_1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref></bold>). cKO PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neurons showed reduced action potential (AP) firing frequency at a holding voltage of -60mV compared to Ctrl PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neurons (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B-C</xref></bold>). The resting membrane potential (Rm) of cKO (-52mV) neurons showed a 10mV positive shift compared to Ctrl neurons (-62mV) (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref></bold>). We also found that fewer cKO PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neurons showed spontaneous firing at Rm (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref></bold>, Ctrl:10/13; cKO:5/12) and at holding voltage of -70mV (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F</xref></bold>, Ctrl:6/12; cKO:1/12) compared to Ctrl PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neurons. The threshold of the first AP initiated by a ramp current injection (1 nA/sec) from Rm was significantly increased in cKO neurons (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3G-H</xref></bold>). Because the higher the holding voltage is, the narrower the shoulder and the lower the amplitude of APs are (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3_1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref></bold>), we compared the AP waveforms at a holding voltage of -60mV, close to the Rm of both genotypes. The AP of the cKO group exhibited a lower peak amplitude (measuring from the threshold to peak) (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3I</xref></bold>), a normal threshold (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3J</xref></bold>), and half-width (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3_1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref></bold>). We found that both passive and AP properties of cKO PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neurons were altered. The Rm of cKO neurons shifted to a more positive voltage than the gating threshold of voltage-gated sodium channels (6/12 were more positive than -55mV), which was unfavourable for their transition from the inactivation state to the closed state. Combined with the higher AP threshold of cKO neurons, these changes contribute to a decreased excitability in cKO PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neurons.</p>

<p>PVN neurons receive glutamatergic and GABAergic inputs and are tonically inhibited by GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Colmers &amp; Bains, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gao <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). The rightward shift of the probability of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current (mIPSC) frequency indicated that cKO PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neurons received a higher frequency of inhibitory inputs, although the average frequency (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3K</xref></bold>) was not significantly different between groups. The probability of mIPSC amplitude also showed a right shift, suggesting an increased mIPSC postsynaptic response (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3_1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref></bold>). Furthermore, we observe an increased area under the curve (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3M</xref></bold>), indicating that <italic>Rai1</italic> loss induced a larger total outward current upon the inhibitory inputs. Interestingly, we found that cKO PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neurons had a smaller cellular diameter (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3_1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref></bold>), indicating that the increased inhibitory currents were unlikely due to changes in passive membrane properties associated with increased cell size. Overall, our data argue that <italic>Rai1</italic> deletion decreases the excitability of PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neurons and likely increases pre-synaptic inhibitory transmission and post-synaptic inhibitory responses, resulting in decreased AP firing.</p>

<title>Rai1 expression is necessary for PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neurons to regulate energy homeostasis</title>
<p>Reduced PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neuronal activity in cKO mice suggested that Rai1 loss in Bdnf-producing PVH neurons might be sufficient to induce defective energy homeostasis <italic>in vivo</italic>. To test this hypothesis by deleting Rai1 only in PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neurons but not other Bdnf-producing cells, we performed PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup>-specific <italic>Rai1</italic> deletion using a CRISPR/Cas9 system packaged into AAV9. Two viruses were delivered; one encoding a reporter molecule (GFP) and three single guide RNAs targeting the <italic>Rai1</italic> gene (sgRai1), and the other carrying Cre-dependent <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> CRISPR-associated protein 9 (saCas9) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref></bold>). Hereafter, our experiments focus on female SMS mice since they showed more consistent defects in fat distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Burns <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>) and body weight regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Huang <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>) than males. Bilateral administration of two AAVs into the PVH of female <italic>Bdnf<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic>mice (Exp group) resulted in a significant loss of Rai1 protein expression in PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neurons when compared to <italic>Bdnf<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> mice injected with an AAV encoding the sgRai1 and GFP (Ctrl group) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B-C</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4_1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref></bold>). Quantification of AAV-infected (GFP<sup>+</sup>) Bdnf neurons showed that while the total number of Bdnf<sup>+</sup> (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4_1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref></bold>) and Bdnf<sup>+</sup> GFP<sup>+</sup> (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4_1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref></bold>) cells was not different in the two groups, the percentage of AAV-infected Bdnf<sup>+</sup> cells that express Rai1 was significantly reduced in the Exp group (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4_1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D-E</xref></bold>). Deleting <italic>Rai1</italic> from the PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neurons resulted in a significant increase in body weight beginning at 17 weeks of age (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref></bold>). Similar to the cKO (<italic>Bdnf<sup>Cre/+</sup>; Rai1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>) mice, obesity in 26-week-old Exp mice was due to increased fat mass (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref></bold>) and more specifically, increased subcutaneous inguinal (S.C. ing) and epididymal white adipose tissues (eWAT) but not BAT (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4F</xref></bold>). We also found that eWAT adipocytes became hypertrophic (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4G</xref></bold>). Similar to the cKO mice, food intake did not differ between Exp and Ctrl groups (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4H</xref></bold>), likely due to the high level of satiety signals in the brain caused by increased blood leptin levels (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4I</xref></bold>). We also found that energy expenditure (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4J</xref></bold>), respiratory exchange rate (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4_1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref></bold>), and blood lipid parameters, including TG (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4_1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref></bold>), HDL (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4_1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H</xref></bold>), LDL and VLDL levels (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4_1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1I</xref></bold>), were similar in Exp and Ctrl groups, consistent with the cKO data (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4_1">Figure 4— figure supplement 14</xref></bold>).

<title>Pharmacologically enhancing TrkB signalling partially alleviates obesity in SMS mice</title>
<p>Our findings so far indicate that multiple pathways, including neurotrophin signalling, are dysregulated in SMS mice, and that Rai1 loss from Bdnf-producing cells, including PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neurons, impairs energy homeostasis <italic>in vivo</italic>. Next we sought to examine the contribution of Bdnf-TrkB dysfunction in SMS pathogenesis by pharmacologically activating downstream targets of the Bdnf-TrkB pathway.</p>
<p>We systematically treated mice with LM22A-4, a small molecule Bdnf loop domain mimetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Massa <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). To measure the bioavailability of LM22A-4 in the SMS brain, we simultaneously administered LM22A-4 intranasally (5 mg/kg body weight) and intraperitoneally (50 mg/kg body weight), using the highest doses used in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Canals <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chang <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gu <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kron <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ogier <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). We then harvested forebrain and hypothalamic tissues one- or three-hours after drug administration. Spectrometric analysis found a significantly higher LM22A-4 concentration in both brain regions one-hour post-treatment, while its concentration decreased three hours after treatment (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5_1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref></bold>). Consistent with the reduced neurotrophin signalling observed in our proteomic analysis, saline-treated SMS mice showed reduced phosphorylated-Akt (p-Akt; <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5_1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref></bold>) levels in the hypothalamus. LM22A-4 treatment significantly increased the levels of p-Akt in the SMS mice 1-hr post-treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5_1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref></bold>), indicating increased signalling downstream of the Bdnf-TrkB pathway.</p>
<p>We next examined if chronic LM22A-4 treatment was sufficient to reverse or modify the progression of the obesity phenotype in adult SMS mice. Specifically, we treated SMS mice daily from 8 to 14 weeks of age, during which SMS mice began to gain significantly more weight. Saline-treated SMS mice (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref></bold>) were significantly heavier than saline-treated control mice from 9 weeks of age onward. Interestingly, LM22A-4-treated SMS mice showed a similar body weight to saline-treated control littermates until 13 weeks of age but became obese by 14 weeks of age (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref></bold>). Consistent with a partial rescue, LM22A-4-treated SMS mice were significantly less obese than saline-treated SMS mice throughout the treatment period (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref></bold>). Control mice treated with LM22A-4 did not show a further reduction in body weight (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5_1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref></bold>), indicating that the therapeutic effects were specific to SMS pathogenesis.</p>

During an insulin tolerance test, we found that saline-treated SMS mice showed increased baseline insulin levels (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5J</xref></bold>) and blood glucose levels during the test (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5K</xref></bold>), both of which were partially rescued by LM22A-4 treatment.</p>
<p>In addition to a deficit in energy homeostasis, SMS mice showed two highly reproducible behavioral deficits: increased stereotypic rearing in the open field and decreased social dominance in the tube test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Huang <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Rao <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). Saline-treated SMS mice showed significantly more rearing behavior when compared to the saline-treated controls (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5L</xref></bold>). Interestingly, LM22A-4 treatment reduced the repetitive rearing behaviour in SMS mice <bold>(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5L</xref></bold>). LM22A-4 treatment did not change repetitive behaviors in control mice (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5_1">Figure 5— figure supplement 1F</xref></bold>), suggesting the effect is specific to <italic>Rai1</italic> haploinsufficiency. However, we did not observe a rescue of social dominance deficits in SMS mice (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5_2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A-E</xref></bold>). Together, these data indicate that LM22A-4 treatment delayed the onset of obesity and fully rescued repetitive behaviour in SMS mice, suggesting that Bdnf-TrkB signalling dysfunction contributes to changes in the mouse SMS brain linked to obesity and behavioral phenotypes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The hypothalamus, and Bdnf-TrkB signalling in this region, control body weight by regulating the intricate balance between energy intake and expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Xu &amp; Xie, 2016</xref>). The role of Bdnf-producing neurons in human obesity disorders and how the activity of these cells is regulated remained poorly studied. We found that Rai1 deficiency, linked to Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS), regulates Bdnf expression and maintains intrinsic excitability and inhibitory synaptic transmissions in PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neurons.</p>
<p>Consistent with this mechanism, we found that removing Rai1 from Bdnf-producing neurons or PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neurons results in imbalanced energy homeostasis and results in obesity. A small molecule drug LM22A-4 led to increased Akt phosphorylation and partially rescued locomotor activity, insulin intolerance, and HDL levels, while delaying the onset of obesity in SMS mice. These findings highlight a potential role for hypothalamic Bdnf-producing neurons, specifically PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neurons, in SMS pathogenesis and highlight Bdnf signalling as a potentially druggable pathway to improve energy homeostasis defects and repetitive behaviours commonly observed in SMS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Burns <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Moss <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The involvement of different PVH subtypes in human obesity is only beginning to be elucidated. Dysfunction of oxytocin PVH neurons is linked to the Prader-Willi syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lee <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>), another genetic disorder associated with obesity. Since Rai1 expression is enriched in PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neurons but not PVH<sup>Oxytocin</sup> neurons, our data suggest that distinct pathophysiological mechanisms underlie SMS and Prader-Willi syndrome.</p>
<p>Conditional knockout analysis allowed us to specifically map the cell-specific origin of neuropathological phenotypes, such as SMS-like symptoms in mice. Our previous work found that deleting <italic>Rai1</italic> from cortical excitatory neurons using an <italic>Emx1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gorski <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>), from the GABAergic neurons using a <italic>Gad2<sup>Cre</sup></italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Taniguchi <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>), or from astrocytes using a <italic>GFAP<sup>Cre</sup></italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Garcia <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>) did not induce SMS-like obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Huang <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). In contrast, obesity could be induced by ablating <italic>Rai1</italic> from Sim1-lineage neurons and, to a lesser extent, SF1-lineage neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Huang <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). This analysis suggests that Rai1 expression in PVH is more important than in ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH) for body weight regulation. Interestingly, embryonic deletion of <italic>Bdnf</italic> from SF1-lineage neurons including the VMH only resulted in modest weight gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Unger <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). By contrast, deleting <italic>Bdnf</italic> from Sim1-lineage neurons including the PVH resulted in a more severe obesity phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">An <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). This is consistent with the idea that Bdnf expression in PVH is critical for energy homeostasis. We found that Rai1 expression in Bdnf-producing cells regulates energy homeostasis in a sexually dimorphic manner. Specifically, female cKO mice showed normal food intake, decreased energy expenditure, and reduced locomotor activity. In contrast, male cKO mice showed increased food intake with no changes in locomotor activity. Intriguingly, energy expenditure was increased in male cKO mice, likely due to the higher demand to maintain normal activity levels in obese mice. In both sexes, cKO mice showed an increased fat mass and adiposity with no change in lean mass, highlighting an important role for Rai1 in regulating fat deposition. Our data also indicate that Bdnf-producing cells are only partially responsible for obesity in SMS: male and female cKO mice become overweight by 15 weeks, in contrast to SMS mice which become obese by 9 weeks of age, suggesting that non-Bdnf neurons contribute to SMS phenotypes.</p>
<p>We found the metabolic phenotypes induced by deleting <italic>Rai1</italic> from Bdnf-producing cells were specifically due to <italic>Rai1</italic> deletion in PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neurons. Therefore, our study focused on PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neurons. Electrophysiological experiments showed that most wild-type PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neurons display high frequency spontaneous AP firing (1-10 Hz) at the resting membrane potential. The majority of PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neurons fire sharp APs held at a hyperpolarized potential and show repetitive overshoot during the current ramp test. Loss of Rai1 significantly reduced intrinsic neuronal excitability and increased inhibitory synaptic transmissions onto PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neurons. Because GABAergic Rai1 loss did not induce obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Huang <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>) and most Bdnf-producing neurons are glutamatergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Canals <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>), the increased mIPSC amplitude was likely due to postsynaptic changes in GABA receptor functions caused by Rai1 loss. The ionic changes in PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neurons that precisely explain these excitability changes await future investigations. Different groups of PVH neurons show phasic bursting or slowly inactivating delayed rectifier potassium conductance, which are properties mediated by different potassium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lee <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). Given that our previous RNA-seq experiment found that hypothalamic Rai1 loss induces misexpression of potassium channel subunits <italic>Kcnc2</italic> and <italic>Kcnj11</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Huang <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>), Rai1-dependent potassium channels are likely involved in altered neuronal activity. Furthermore, we found fewer low threshold depolarization events in cKO PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neurons during the hyperpolarized voltage step, suggesting a potential involvement of HCN channels.</p>
<p>Our previous work found that Rai1 loss in the dentate gyrus resulted in neuronal hyperexcitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chang <italic>et al</italic>, 2022b</xref>). Here we demonstrated that Rai1 loss in the hypothalamus resulted in neuronal hypoactivity, suggesting that Rai1 regulates neuronal excitability in a cell type-specific manner. Reduced PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neuronal activity upon Rai1 loss could potentially explain obesity, consistent with a previous report that found chemogenetic activation of PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neurons promotes negative energy balance by decreasing feeding and increasing energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wu &amp; Xu, 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>In future work, it would be interesting to dissect the sex-specific role of Rai1 in regulating the functional development of PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neurons. In addition to a role for Rai1 in regulating neuronal activity, it is possible that Rai1 regulates other aspects of PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neuronal function, including projections to other brain regions to regulate energy homeostasis. In this regard, it would be interesting to dissect how Rai1 controls circuit connectivity of PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neurons and how Rai1 loss in PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neurons affects nearby PVH<sup>TrkB</sup> neurons that receive Bdnf signaling and are linked to body weight regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">An <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>At the molecular level, our RPPA data show that <italic>Rai1</italic> depletion disrupted multiple intracellular signalling pathways and resulted in the hypoactivation of specific phospho-signalling proteins. Multiple early studies support the notion that Rai1 directly promotes Bdnf expression. First, hypothalamic <italic>Bdnf</italic> mRNA levels were reduced in SMS mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Burns <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Javed <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>) or mice with <italic>Rai1</italic> conditional deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Huang <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). Second, Rai1 protein directly binds to a promoter region of <italic>Bdnf</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Huang <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). Finally, when Rai1 expression was induced using CRISPR activation, <italic>Bdnf</italic> mRNA levels were significantly elevated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chang <italic>et al</italic>, 2022a</xref>).</p>
<p>To lend further support, here we show that SMS mice have reduced hypothalamic Bdnf protein levels, as well as reduced activation of a TrkB downstream target Akt. Reduced Akt activity is frequently associated with insulin resistance and obesity in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Shao <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>) and children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Su <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). We also found that obesity, increased HDL levels, and insulin insensitivity in SMS mice could be partially ameliorated using a small molecule drug (LM22A-4) that promotes Akt phosphorylation. LM22A-4 penetrates the blood-brain barrier reasonably well and has been shown to ameliorate symptoms of other neurological disorders associated with Bdnf dysfunction including Rett syndrome, Huntington’s disease, Dravet syndrome, and refractory neonatal seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Canals <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chang <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gu <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kron <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ogier <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). The partial rescue of SMS phenotypes that we observed contrasts with our previous findings that found (1) AAV-mediated Bdnf overexpression in PVH at 3 weeks of age and (2) genetically overexpressing Bdnf from early development could fully prevent the development of obesity in SMS mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Javed <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). It is therefore possible that further increasing TrkB signalling activation and/or earlier intervention might improve therapeutic outcomes.</p>
<p>Alternatively, our RPPA data showed that in addition to disruption of neurotrophin signalling, multiple pathways including mTOR were downregulated in SMS. Increasing hypothalamic mTOR activity has been shown to decrease food intake and body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cota <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that enhancing both mTOR and TrkB signalling could achieve stronger rescue of obesity in SMS mice. Nevertheless, these data support the concept that drugging TrkB signalling may improve stereotypical repetitive behavior and partially alleviate metabolic functions in a mouse model of SMS. Delayed symptom onset could provide a window of opportunity for other interventions to further modify disease progression, an area requiring further investigation.</p>
<p>This study has several limitations. First, whether the PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neurons depend on Rai1 to regulate adaptive thermogenesis awaits future analysis. It is known that a subset of posterior PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neurons project to the spinal cord and regulate thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">An <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). However, we found the weights of brown adipocytes were similar in control and cKO mice. Moreover, SMS mice have normal respiratory exchange rate and there are currently no reports of defective adaptive thermogenesis in SMS patients. This suggests that adaptive thermogenesis is not impacted in SMS. Another limitation is that we did not test different doses, durations, and time points for LM22A-4 treatment. The precise mechanisms by which LM22A-4 improves body weight, metabolic function, and repetitive behaviours also remain unknown. Nevertheless, our work identifies Rai1 as a novel regulator of the neuronal excitability of PVH<sup>Bdnf</sup> neurons. This regulation is critical for regulating food intake and energy expenditure. Our evidence suggests that Bdnf-producing neurons are involved in SMS pathogenesis and that enhancing Bdnf-TrkB signalling should be explored as a future therapeutic avenue for obesity and metabolic conditions associated with reduced neurotrophin signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Xu &amp; Xie, 2016</xref>).</p>

<title>Metabolic profiling</title>
<p>Metabolic profiling was conducted in three different experimental conditions: male and female conditional knockout mice, female virus-injected <italic>Bdnf<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic>mice, and female drug- or saline-injected SMS and control mice. Metabolic profiling included body weight and body composition analysis, food intake measurement, indirect calorimetry for locomotion activity, energy expenditure (EE), respiratory exchange rate (RER), measurement of serum lipids and leptin levels, adipose tissue histology analysis, and glucose and insulin tolerance tests. All experiments were performed as previously conducted experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Javed <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). A brief description is detailed below.</p>
<sec id="s4b1">
<title>Body weight and body composition analysis</title>
<p>The body weight of animals was measured weekly from week 3 (weaning age) onward. Body composition, including total fat and lean mass, were assessed using a nuclear EchoMRI whole-body analyzer.

<title>Serum lipid level determination</title>
<p>A fluorescence-based assay kit (Abcam ab65390) was used to measure serum lipid levels. The manufacturer’s instructions were followed except that we used half-area black 96-well microplates. Fluorescence measurements at 535/587 nm (Ex/Em) were recorded with the Ensight instrument from PerkinElmer. A new standard curve ranging from 0 to 10 μg/ml was produced for each microplate to accurately determine lipid levels in serum samples. Standards and samples were loaded and analyzed twice.</p>

<title>Histology of adipose tissue</title>
<p>Ependymal white adipose tissues (WAT) were excised immediately after the animals were euthanized and fixed with 10% formalin in PBS. The fixed tissues were dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned. Two 5-micrometre thick sections were taken from each animal and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Images of sections were then captured using an Aperio ScanScope CS slide scanner at 20X optical magnification, and the resulting images were saved in jpeg format using the ImageScope software. The images were manually cleaned to remove non-adipose tissues such as lymph nodes. An automated method using the Adiposoft plugin version 1.16 was utilized to determine adipocyte size and number from the jpeg images in Fiji version 2.1.0/1.53c. The Adiposoft settings used excluded cells on edges and set a minimum and maximum cell diameter of 20 and 300 μm, respectively. An experimental value of 2.49 μm per pixel was determined using the Aperio scale bar and used for Adiposoft. To ensure accuracy, two images from each animal were analyzed blindly, examining more than 1600 cells per mouse and more than 9100 cells per condition. Adipocyte size frequencies were calculated using the frequency function in Excel.</p>

<title>Western blotting analysis</title>
<p>Mice were quickly decapitated, brains were rapidly removed, and hypothalamic tissues were collected, weighed, and snap-frozen with liquid nitrogen. Hypothalamic tissues were lysed using a tissue lysis buffer containing RIPA buffer (5M NaCl, 1M PH 8.0 Tris HCl, 1% NP.40, 10% C<sub>24</sub>H<sub>39</sub>NaO<sub>4</sub>, and 20% SDS) and the Halt™ Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo-Fisher). Lysates were first sonicated on ice for 15 seconds followed by centrifuging at 10000 RPM at 4°C for 10 minutes. The supernatant was collected in a separate Eppendorf tube, and a BCA assay was performed to quantify protein levels. Proteins were then separated using SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. To determine the phosphorylation levels of Akt, membranes were cut and blocked in 5% milk in tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 1 hour and then incubated overnight at 4°C with anti-p-Akt (Ser473) antibody (1:1000 dilution, RRID:AB_2315049, Cell Signaling Technology 4060T) and anti-H3 antibody (internal control: 1:1000 dilution, RRID:AB_302613, Abcam ab1791). The next day, membranes were washed with TBST three times for five minutes before incubating with a HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10000 dilution, Thermo Fisher 200-403-095S). Membranes were later stripped by incubating in 0.5M NaOH for 10 min and then re-probed for total Akt levels by incubating with anti-Akt (C67E7) antibody (1:1000 dilution, Cell Signaling Technology 4691T). The density of each immunoreactive phospho-protein band was expressed as a fraction of the band for the total Akt protein in the same lane.</p>

<title>Reverse-phase protein array (RPPA)</title>
<p>Reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) was used for precise high-throughput quantification of total and phospho-protein levels in different signalling pathways. Protein lysates from hypothalamic tissues were extracted and transferred to 384-well microarray plates to print individual slides. The slides were then labelled with validated antibodies that recognize total protein and specific phosphorylation sites. SYPRO Ruby staining was used to measure total protein levels. The data obtained from RPPA were normalized for individual samples. Each antibody’s raw signal intensity (SI) was determined by subtracting the background from the antibody-specific signals during image analysis. The normalized antibody SI was expressed using the formula N = A - C/T x M, where N is the normalized SI, A is the raw antibody SI, C is the negative control SI, T is the SI of total protein, and M is the median SI of total protein from a spot within the same sample group. Antibodies with SI less than 200 were filtered out, and quality control (QC) scores were established to discard poor-quality reactions. The coefficient of variation (CV) score was determined for each antibody and defined as the percentage of samples on a slide with a CV &lt; 20%. Antibodies with a median technical triplicate CV &gt;20% were also excluded from further analysis. T-tests were performed for each antibody to identify differentially expressed proteins in the SMS compared to control groups. PCA plots were generated for all samples, annotated with their experimental group, and hierarchical clustering was performed using a Python analysis tool. Enrichment analysis on the differentially expressed proteins was performed using an online data resource string: version 11.5.</p>

For miniature current recording, the internal solution contained (in mM) 130 gluconate acid, 8 CsCl, 1 NaCl, 2 EGTA, 0.8 CsOH, 10 HEPES, 2 MgATP and 0.3 Na3GTP (pH 7.2, with CsOH, 300–310 mOsm adjusted with sucrose). mEPSCs were recorded in the presence of 1 µM TTX at a holding potential of - 70 mV. mIPSCs were recorded at a holding potential of +10 mV. The mIPSCs were analyzed from events during a 2-minute continuous recording that contained &gt; 15 events/neuron. Additional calculations, statistical analysis, and plotting was performed in Microsoft Excel or Prism (GraphPad).</p>

<title>Spectrometric analysis of LM22A-4 levels in the brain</title>
<p>We assessed the efficacy of LM22A-4, a small molecule pharmacological agent, in 8-week-old SMS and control mice. LM22A-4, chemical name N1, N3, N5tris (2hydroxyethyl) 1, 3, 5 benzenetricarboxamide (Molecular formula: C<sub>15</sub>H<sub>21</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, Formula weight: 339.3), was manufactured by Cayman Chemical with purity specification &gt;98%. A stock solution was made by first dissolving LM22A-4 in DMSO (solubility =30mg/ml) and then diluting it with 0.9% isotonic sterilized saline solution (Sigma). To maximize brain concentrations, LM22A-4 was administered both intranasally (5mg/kg) and intraperitoneally (50mg/kg), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Simmons <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). The bioavailability of this drug in the hypothalamus using these doses and routes of administration was assessed with the reverse phase LC triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectroscopic detection (LC-MS/MS) by Absorption Systems. Mice were euthanized, and hypothalamic tissue was collected at either 1 h or 3 h post-injection (n= 4/timepoint). Known amounts of LM22A-4 were added to the blank sample to generate a standard curve to verify test accuracy.</p>

<title>LM22A-4 treatment</title>
<p>Mice were divided into four groups: Saline-injected control, Saline-injected SMS, LM22A-4-injected SMS, and LM22A-4-injected control mice. Mice were injected daily, intra-nasally (5mg/kg) and intraperitoneally (50mg/kg), for 7 weeks. Body weight was measured between 8 and 14 weeks of age. Food intake was measured from 14 to 15 weeks of age. After 15 weeks of age, mice were euthanized to collect brown adipose, visceral, subcutaneous (inguinal) and ependymal white adipose tissues and weighed using an analytical scale (Sartorius).</p>
<p>Hypothalamic brain tissues were collected for western blot analysis. Metabolic profiling was performed on a separate cohort of mice injected for two weeks prior to the start of experiments as well as at specific weeks during the experiment.</p>

<title>Vertical rearing</title>
<p>To measure vertical repetitive rearing, mice were taken into the testing room and allowed to habituate for 1 h prior to testing. During the test, mice were placed in the center of a 45 cm (W) × 45 cm (D) × 40 cm (H) square arena, and their movement was recorded for 10 minutes.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Sample sizes used were based on our previously studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Huang <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Javed <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). The data were subjected to statistical analysis for significance by using GraphPad Prism 0.9. Significance was defined as having a p-value &lt; 0.05. The significance levels were expressed as follows: * p&lt; 0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.0001, **** p&lt;0.0001. The statistical tests used for each analysis (e.g., Student’s t-test, Fisher’s exact test, analysis of variance [ANOVA]) are indicated in the text and legends.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study informs whether diminishing BDNF expression or alterations in the activity of BDNF-containing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus contributes to metabolic alterations in individuals with reduced RAI1 function, including those afflicted with Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS).

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Rai1 encodes the transcription factor retinoic acid-induced 1 (RAI1), which regulates expression of factors involved in neuronal development and synaptic transmission. Rai1 haploinsufficiency leads to the monogenic disorder Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS), which is associated with excessive feeding, obesity and intellectual disability. Consistent with findings in human subjects, Rai1+/- mice and mice with conditional deletion of Rai1 in Sim+ neurons, which are abundant in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), exhibit hyperphagia, obesity and increased adiposity. Furthermore, RAI1-deficient mice exhibit reduced expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a satiety factor essential for the central control of energy balance. Notably, overexpression of BDNF in PVN of RAI1-deficient mice mitigated their obesity, implicating this neurotrophin in the metabolic dysfunction these animals exhibit. In this follow up study, Javed et al. interrogated the necessity of RAI1 in BDNF+ neurons promoting metabolic health.</p>
<p>Consistent with previous reports, the authors observed reduced BDNF expression in the hypothalamus of Rai1+/- mice. Moreover, proteomics analysis indicated impairment in neurotrophin signaling in the mutants. Selective deletion of Rai1 in BDNF+ neurons in the brain during development resulted in increased body weight, fat mass and reduced locomotor activity and energy expenditure without changes in food intake. There was also a robust effect on glycemic control, with mutants exhibiting glucose intolerance. Selective depletion of RAI1 in BDNF+ neurons in PVN in adult mice also resulted in increased body weight, reduced locomotor activity, and glucose intolerance without affecting food intake. Blunting RAI1 activity also leads to increases and decreases in the inhibitory tone and intrinsic excitability, respectively, of BDNF+ neurons in the PVN.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Overall, the experiments are well designed and multidisciplinary approaches are employed to demonstrate that RAI1 deficits in BDNF+ neurons diminish hypothalamic BDNF signaling and produce metabolic dysfunction. The most significant advance relative to previous reports is the finding from electrophysiological studies showing that blunting RAI1 activity leads to increases and decreases the inhibitory tone and intrinsic excitability, respectively, of BDNF+ neurons in the PVN. Furthermore, that intact RAI1 function is required in BDNF+ neurons for the regulation of glucose homeostasis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Some of the data need to be reconciled with previous findings by others. For example, the authors report that more than 50% of BDNF+ neurons in PVN also express pTrkB whereas about 20% of pTrkB+ cells contain BDNF, raising the possibility that autocrine mechanisms might be at play. This is in conflict with a previous study by An et al, (2015) showing that these cell populations are largely non-overlapping in the PVN.</p>
<p>Another issue that deserves more in depth discussion is that diminished BDNF function appears to play a minor part driving deficits in energy balance regulation. Accordingly, both global central depletion of Rai1 in BDNF+ neurons during development and deletion of Rai1 in BDNF+ neurons in the adult PVN elicited modest effects on body weight (less than 18% increase) and did not affect food intake. This contrasts with mice with selective Bdnf deletion in the adult PVN, which are hyperphagic and dramatically obese (90% heavier than controls). Therefore, the results suggest that deficits in RAI1 in PVN or the whole brain only moderately affect BDNF actions influencing energy homeostasis and that other signaling cascades and neuronal populations play a more prominent role driving the phenotypes observed in Rai1+/- mice, which are hyperphagic and 95% heavier than controls. The results from the proteomic analysis of hypothalamic tissue of Rai1 mutant mice and controls could be useful in generating alternative hypotheses.</p>
<p>Depleting RAI1 in BDNF+ neurons had a robust effect compromising glycemic control. However, as the approach does not necessarily impact BDNF exclusively, there should be a larger discussion of alternative mechanisms.</p>

<p>Understanding disease conditions often yields valuable insights into the physiological regulation of biological functions, as well as potential therapeutic approaches. In previous investigations, the author's research group identified abnormal expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hypothalamus of a mouse model exhibiting Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS), which is caused by heterozygous mutations of the Rai1 gene. Human SMS is associated with distinct facial characteristics, sleep disturbances, behavioral issues, and intellectual disabilities, often accompanied by obesity. Conditional knockout (cKO) of the Bdnf gene from the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) in mice led to hyperphagic obesity, while overexpression of the Bdnf gene in the PVH of Rai1 heterozygous mice restored the SMS-like obese phenotype. Based on these preceding findings, the authors of the present study discovered that homozygous Rai1 cKO restricted to Bdnf-expressing cells, or Rai1 gene knockdown solely in Bdnf-positive neurons in the PVH, induced obesity along with intricate alterations in adipose tissue composition, energy expenditure, locomotion, feeding patterns, and glucose tolerance, some of which varied between sexes. Additionally, the authors demonstrated that a brain-penetrating drug capable of activating the TrkB pathway, a downstream signaling pathway of BDNF, partially alleviated the SMS-like obesity phenotype in female mice with Rai1 heterozygous mutations. Although the specific (neural) cell type responsible for this TrkB signaling remains an open question, the present study unequivocally highlights the importance of Rai1 gene function in PVH Bdnf neurons for the obesity phenotype, providing valuable insights into potential therapeutic strategies for managing obesity associated with SMS.</p>
<p>In the proteomic analysis (Fig. 1), the authors elucidated that multiple phospho-protein signaling pathways, including Akt and mTOR pathways, exhibited significant attenuation in the SMS model mice. Of significance, the manifestation of haploinsufficiency of the Rai1 gene exclusively within the BDNF+ cells demonstrated negligible impact on body weight (Fig. 2-supple 3D), despite observing a reduction in BDNF levels in the heterozygous Rai1 mutant (Fig. 1A). Conversely, the homozygous Rai1 cKO in the BDNF+ cells prominently displayed an obesity phenotype, suggesting substantial dissimilarities in the gene expression profiles between Rai1 heterozygous and homozygous conditions within the BDNF+ cell population. It would be advantageous to precisely identify the responsible differentially expressed genes, possibly including Bdnf itself, in the homozygous cKO model. The observed reduction in the excitability of PVH BDNF+ cells (Fig. 3) is presumably attributed to aberrant gene expression other than Bdnf itself, which may serve as a prospective target for gene expression analysis. Notably, the Rai1 homozygous cKO mice in BDNF+ cells exhibited some sexual dimorphisms in feeding and energy expenditures, as evidenced by Fig. 2 and related figures. Exploring the potential relevance of these sexual differences to human SMS cases and investigating the underlying cellular/molecular mechanisms in the future would provide valuable insights.</p>
<p>Although the CRISPR-mediated knockdown of the Rai1 gene (Fig. 4) appears to be highly effective, given the broad transduction of AAV serotype 9, it may be helpful to exclude the possibility of other brain regions adjacent to the PVH, such as the DMH or VMH, being affected by this viral procedure. If the PVH-specificity is established, the majority of Rai1 cKO effects in Bdnf+ cells are primarily attributed to PVH-Bdnf+ cells based on the similarity of phenotypes observed. With regards to the apparent rescue of the body weight phenotype in Rai1 heterozygous mutants using a selective TrkB activator, the specific biological processes, and neurons responsible for this effect remain unclear to this reviewer. Elucidating these aspects would be significant when considering potential applications to human SMS cases.</p>
<p>Overall, the present study represents a valuable addition to the authors' series of high-quality molecular genetic investigations into the in vivo functions of the Rai1 gene. This reviewer particularly commends their diligent efforts to enhance our comprehension of SMS and contribute to the future development of more effective therapies for this syndrome.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) is associated with obesity and is caused by deletion or mutations in one copy of the Rai1 gene which encodes a transcriptional regulator. Previous studies have shown that Bdnf gene expression is reduced in the hypothalamus of Rai1 heterozygous mice. This manuscript by Javed et al. further links SMS-associated obesity with reduced Bdnf gene expression in the PVH.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors show that deletion of the Rai1 gene in all BDNF-expressing cells or just in the PVH BDNF neurons postnatally caused obesity. Interestingly, mutant mice displayed sexual dimorphism in the cause for the obesity phenotype. Overall, the data are well presented and convincing except the data from LM22A-4.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
1. The most serious concern is about data from LM22A-4 administration experiments (Figure 5 and associated supplemental figures). A rigorous study has demonstrated that LM22A-4 does not activate TrkB (Boltaev et al., Science Signaling, 2017), which is consistent with unpublished results from many labs in the neurotrophin field. It is tricky to interpret body weight data from pharmacological studies because compounds always have some side effects, which can reduce body weight non-specifically.</p>
<p>2. The resolution of all figures are poor, and thus I could not judge the quality of the micrographs.</p>
<p>3. Citation of the literature is not precise. The study by An et al. (2015) shows that deletion of the Bdnf gene in the PVH leads to obesity due to increased food intake and reduced energy expenditure (not just hyperphagic obesity; Line 72). Furthermore, the study by Unger et al. (2017) carried out Bdnf deletion in the VMH and DMH using AAV-Cre and did not discuss SF1 neurons at all (Line 354). The two studies by Yang et al. (Mol Endocrinol, 2016) and Kamitakahara et al. (Mol Metab, 2015) did use SF1-Cre to delete the Bdnf gene and did not observe any obesity phenotype.</p>
<p>4. Animal number is not described in many figure legends.</p>

<p>We express our sincere gratitude to the editors and reviewers for their invaluable input. To further improve our manuscript, we have devised a plan to perform additional histological experiments of Bdnf and TrkB expression. Specifically, we will replace the phospho-TrkB antibody with an anti-TrkB antibody to quantify Bdnf/TrkB co-expression. Moreover, we acknowledge the concern raised by the reviewers regarding the clarity of some explanations and the potential influence of alternative mechanisms influencing the defects observed in Bdnf neurons. We aim to provide a clearer explanation and discussion. We also intend to provide a more comprehensive discussion of the limitations of our LM22A-4 drug treatment experiment. By addressing these points, we wish to ensure that our research is informative to the eLife readership.</p>
