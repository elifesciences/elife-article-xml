<abstract><p>Mouse female primordial germ cells (PGCs) undergo five synchronous, incomplete mitotic divisions, and send each resulting germline cyst into meiosis to fragment and produce 4-6 oocytes and 24-26 supportive nurse cells. However, no system of polarity has been found to specify mammalian oocytes, link them appropriately to nurse cells and enable them to acquire high quality organelles and cytoplasm. We report that mouse cysts develop an asymmetric Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and microtubule-associated “fusome”, similar to the oocyte-determining fusome in Drosophila cysts. The mouse fusome distributes asymmetrically among cyst cells and enriches in future oocytes with Pard3, and Golgi-endosomal UPR (unfolded protein response) proteins. Spindle remnants rich in stable acetylated microtubules, like those building the Drosophila and Xenopus fusomes, transiently link early mouse cyst cells for part of each cell cycle. A non-random gap in these microtubules predicts that initial cysts fragment into similar six-cell derivatives, providing a potential mechanism for producing uniform oocytes. Together with previous studies these results argue that a polarized fusome underlies the development of female gametes from the PGC to follicular oocyte stages in diverse animals including mammals.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Early female germ cell development occurs within interconnected cysts formed by consecutive incomplete divisions of a germline stem cell (GSC) or primordial germ cell (PGC) in diverse animals. These include basal species like hydra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Littlefield, 1994</xref>), nematodes like C. elegans, insects like Drosophila, and vertebrates including fish, frogs, mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gondos, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">King, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Lin et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Pepling and Spradling, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Kloc et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Marlow and Mullins, 2008</xref>; review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Spradling, 2024</xref>). As they develop, Drosophila and other insect cyst cells become interconnected by ring canals and acquire polarity associated with a microtubule-rich “fusome” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Giardina, 1901</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">King, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Lin et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Büning, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Huynh and St Johnston, 2004</xref>). In Drosophila, the fusome arises from mitotic spindle remnants generated during incomplete cytokinesis, contains ER cisternae and displays Par gene and microtubule-dependent polarity that is essential for oocyte production. Later, in meiotic prophase, the fusome mediates the movement of centrioles, mitochondria, and germ plasm regulators such as oskar mRNA into the oocyte where they form the Balbiani body (Bb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Mahowald and Strassheim, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cox and Spradling, 2003</xref>). Remarkably, mammalian oocytes undergo these same events (review: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Spradling et al. 2022</xref>), but a fusome has not been detected, raising the possibility that mammalian cyst polarity and oocyte specification use a different system.</p>
<p>Studies in Xenopus long provided suggestions that cyst polarization in at least some vertebrate species resemble the invertebrate process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Kloc et al. 2004</xref>; review: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Huynh and St Johnston, 2004</xref>). Recently a detailed study using modern methods characterized fusome-containing Xenopus cysts sharing many such similarities including production of relatively few oocytes and mostly nurse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Davidian and Spradling, 2025</xref>). Here, we report new studies on mouse cyst polarization. In the mouse, germ cells are induced around embryonic day 6.5 (E6.5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lawson et al. 1999</xref>) and begin migrating toward the gonad as PGCs. En route, PGCs start to reprogram their epigenetic state to pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Seki et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Saitou et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Loda et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Liu et al. 2025</xref>). After they enter the gonad at E10.5, PGCs take on germ cell character (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Nicholls et al. 2019</xref>), turn on DDX4 and initiate cyst formation while reprogramming is still ongoing. During E11.5 they induce Dazl, a major post-transcriptional mediator of early germ cell development, pluripotency re-establishment, and meiotic entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Ruggiu et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Haston et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gill et al. 2011</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fu et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Zagore et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Yang et al. 2020</xref>). Even before meiotic entry, Dazl is needed to form stable cysts in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bertho et al. 2021</xref>) and in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Rosario et al. 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>The formation of germline cysts in mice is more complicated than in most animals. Mouse germline cysts arise from five rounds of mitotic divisions beginning at E10.5, so that each PGC generates almost 32 cells. However, the cysts break variably into an average of 4.8 smaller cysts before these divisions are completed at E14.5 when cells enter meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Lei and Spradling, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Levy et al. 2024</xref>). During meiosis, each smaller cyst slowly loses component cells, as every 2 days about one cell on average becomes activated to act as a nurse cell. The nurse cell transfers most of its cytoplasm into the residual cyst, shrinks to a small remnant and undergoes programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lei et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Niu and Spradling, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Ikami et al 2023</xref>). In the pachytene substage of meiosis I, there is a substantial reorganization that brings mitochondria and ER sheets into close proximity by E18.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Ruby et al,. 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Nogawa et al. 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Pepling and Spradling, 2001</xref>). Cyst breakdown is complete by 5 days after birth (P5) with the formation of 4-6 primordial follicles, each containing a single oocyte in which organelles largely transferred from nurse cells are gathered into an aggregate known as the Balbiani body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Niu and Spradling, 2022</xref>). Cyst polarity guides cyst fragmentation and oocyte specification, polarization and organelle acquisition. Despite this, the only prior hint of a mouse fusome was a round structure that could be stained with certain antisera in PGCs and 2-cell cysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hahnel and Eddy, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Pepling and Spradling, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Germline cysts also support germ cell rejuvenation, the universal process that allows damage to be removed each generation so that species can persist without known limit. Germline rejuvenation takes place during meiosis in single celled eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Unal et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Suda et al. 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Xiao and Unal, 2025</xref>). Processes that rejuvenate organelles such as mitochondria, restore rDNA copy number, and reset epigenetic chromatin marks have also been documented in meiosis during animal gametogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cox and Spradling, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hill et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Reik and Surani, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bohnert and Kenyon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Lieber et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Pang et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Yamashita, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Xiao and Unal, 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Spradling et al. 2025</xref>). The Balbiani body in newly formed oocytes is associated with germ plasm formation and selection for mitochondrial function in many species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Heasman et al. 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Kloc et al. 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Marlow and Mullins, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Spradling et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Sekula et al. 2024</xref>). Currently, however, germline rejuvenation events are thought to skew toward late oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bohnert and Kenyon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Xiao and Unal, 2025</xref>).</p>
<p>Here we report that mouse PGCs and cyst cells elaborate a fusome-like structure that is rich in Golgi, endosomal vesicles and ER associations. The mouse fusome distributes asymmetrically with stable microtubules that persist for part of the cell cycle. By the 8-cell stage, cyst cells reorganize into a rosette configuration that brings cells with multiple bridges (potential oocytes) and associated fusome material closer together. Developing cysts at this stage usually fragment non-randomly at sites lacking microtubule connections into six-cell cysts, implying that mouse ovarian cyst structure is more highly controlled than previously realized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Lei and Spradling, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Levy et al. 2024</xref>). Beginning as PGCs and throughout cyst formation, endosome-Golgi associated degradation (EGAD)-mediated UPR pathway proteins including Xbp1 are expressed, suggesting that the oocyte proteome quality control begins very early and continues. After pachytene, centrosome/Golgi-rich elements move to the oocyte and mediate the acquisition of organelles by the Bb. These results imply that a polarized fusome whose properties have been significantly conserved in diverse animals including mammals underlies female gamete development from the PGC to follicular oocyte stages.</p>

<title>PGCs contain a Golgi-rich structure known as the EMA granule</title>
<p>Early observations of a germ cell “(e)mbryonic (m)ouse (a)ntigen (EMA)” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hahnel and Eddy, 1987</xref>) identified an “EMA granule” in mouse primordial germ cells that resembles the Drosophila spectrosome, a fusome precursor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Lin et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Pepling and Spradling, 1998</xref>). To investigate this relationship further, we determined that the EMA granule appears in PGCs as early as E9.5 and continues to be expressed in later cysts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S1A</xref>). We used lineage labeling to mark cysts (Video S1B) derived from single PGCs, and 3D surface rendering and volume quantification (Figure S1C), to demonstrate a significantly uneven distribution of the EMA granule within PGC daughter cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). This asymmetry and studies described below prompted us to name the EMA-rich structure the “mouse fusome”.</p>

<p>The EMA-rich material reorganized and clustered together in female cysts by E13.5 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Video S1D1-2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S1A</xref>), whereas in male cysts it remained separate and similar-sized in each cell (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C’ and graph</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S1E’</xref>) reminiscent of male differences in the Drosophila fusome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Diegmiller et al. 2023</xref>). In females, cyst regions with enriched fusome staining contained an average of 3 Tex14-positive bridges, whereas unenriched zones had an average of just 1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-D’ graph</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S1F</xref>). Thus, highly branched cells with more bridges, which are known to give rise to most oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Lei and Spradling, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lei and Spradling, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Ikami et al. 2023</xref>), contain more fusome. Similar clustering, known as rosette formation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>), and increased fusome accumulation in pro-oocytes, characteristically occur as germline cysts grow in Drosophila and other species (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hegner, 1914</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Büning, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Huynh and St Johnston, 2004</xref>). Rosette formation is thought to prepare for sharing between nurse cells and oocytes.</p>

<title>The mouse fusome is enriched in Golgi elements and vesicles</title>
<p>The fusome co-stained with the Golgi protein Gm130 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S1H</xref>) and the recycling endosomal protein Rab11a1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F’</xref>). Electron microscopy (EM) of mouse germ cells showed a prominent Golgi and endocytic vesicles in most E11.5 and E12.5 cyst germ cells in a subregion of similar shape to the EMA granule in light micrographs. (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E’</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S1K-L</xref>) consistent with a previous EM observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Jeon and Kennedy, 1973</xref>). We found evidence that EMA granules require ongoing Golgi activity to be maintained. In E11.5 mouse ovaries cultured in vitro, treatment with the Golgi-inhibitor Brefeldin A for 6 hours caused EMA granules to shrink, but many reformed within 18h of its removal (Videos S1I1-3). The fusome often partly overlaps with ER (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S1K-K’</xref>).

<title>The mouse fusome overlaps centrosomes and associates with microtubules</title>
<p>A cell’s microtubule cytoskeleton emanates from its centrosomes and from non-centrosomal microtubule organizing centers (ncMTOCs); it frequently controls trafficking of Golgi elements and positions them near centrosomes. To investigate whether the fusome associated with microtubules, we stained E11.5 gonads with anti-acetylated tubulin (AcTub) and EMA. The fusome overlapped the centrosomes in interphase germ cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), indicating it usually occupies a peri-centriolar domain. In germ cells undergoing mitosis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), the fusome associated with centrioles during interphase, but (typical for Golgi) dispersed as the mitotic spindle forms and for most of metaphase. In telophase, fusome vesicles gather at the spindle poles in both daughter cells and at the arrested cytokinesis furrow, which still retains the elongated spindle/midbody microtubules typical of cyst-forming cell cycles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Small EMA-positive vesicles often associated with these telophase spindles, providing evidence that fusome vesicles can move along microtubules (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S2E</xref>). 3D summary movies of germ cells at each mitotic stage stained for AcTub and EMA are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S2A</xref>.</p>

<p>The mouse fusome was rarely seen at just one pole of a mitotic spindle, like the Drosophila fusome at early stages of GSC and cystoblast division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">de Cuevas and Spradling, 1998</xref>). Some EMA-reactive material appears at the cytokinesis furrow before it is seen at the fusome (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S2C-D</xref>). Asymmetry in the mouse fusome distribution arose only in late telophase. Clusters of fusome and centrosomes approached the arrested furrow (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">S2C-D</xref>). At this point short microtubule arrays were visible (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S2C</xref>). Small fusome-containing vesicles are often observed in association with microtubules as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S2E</xref>. Soon after, the amount of fusome in the two daughter cells becomes asymmetric, suggesting that differential activity or persistence of fusome transport late in cytokinesis generates asymmetry. Ovaries cultured briefly in vitro support continued germ cell division and fusome asymmetry. Fusome formation is severely affected in such cultures if microtubules (MTs) are disrupted by cold or by Ciliobrevin D treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S2F graph</xref>).</p>

<title>Cyst fragmentation is non-random and correlates with microtubule gaps</title>
<p>Mouse cysts produce an average of 4-6 oocytes per PGC as a result of initial cyst breakage into multiple, independently developing subcysts that each produce one oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Lei and Spradling, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Niu and Spradling, 2022</xref>). Production of uniform-sized oocytes, as observed, would seem to require programmed breakage into uniform subcysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Spradling et al. 2022</xref>), but some random breakage also occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Lei and Spradling, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Ikami et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Levy et al. 2024</xref>). To assess a role of microtubules and the fusome in programming cyst fragmentation, we tracked AcTub and the fusome in lineage-labeled E12.5 cysts. In about 10% of interphase cysts, presumably those in very late telophase or early in the subsequent cell cycle, persistent microtubule arrays were observed that connected the cells in pairs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). When we examined a total of about 50 large cysts, 15 larger cysts of 7-10 cells were found where the MTs in all cells could be analyzed completely. Three examples are shown in which projections of 8-cell lineage-labeled cysts are outlined (dashed lines). In the left column, lineage, the fusome and MTs are shown (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E-E”</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S2H</xref>). Unexpectedly, the microtubule connections (middle column) showed a large discontinuity of 10μ or more between just two of the cystocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Likewise, microtubule bundles in E’ and E’’ are also absent between two cells (straight dashed line <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E’-E”</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S2H’</xref>). The absence of an MT connection predicts cyst breakage, as observed in one of the cysts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E’’</xref>), where separation into a 2-cell and 6-cell cyst has already occurred. We also examined how the fusome distributes in these cysts (Figure S2H’).</p>
<p>The patterns of cyst breakage predicted by MT absence were highly non-random (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). A 6-cell cyst is predicted based on the position of the microtubule gaps in 13/15 8-cell to 10-cell cysts analyzed: see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S2H</xref> (movies of an 8-cell (upper), or 10-cell cyst (lower), with cleavage diagram); and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S2H’</xref> (fusome separation in the 3 cysts from Fig. E-E’’). A binomial probability calculation showed that the chance of obtaining a 6-cell cyst product in 13 of 15 trials following random breakage of a single junction in an 8-cell cyst (where 2 of 7 broken linkages produce a 6-cell product) was at most 4.53E-06.</p>

<title>The mouse fusome associates with polarity and microtubule genes including Pard3</title>
<p>Microtubules play a critical role in ovarian cyst formation and polarity in multiple species. Some of the most important regulators of MTs and polarity are the Par proteins that function in epithelial cell polarity, embryonic development, asymmetric neuroblast division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Petronczki and Knoblich, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hapak et al. 2018</xref>) and oocyte formation in C. elegans, Drosophila and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kemphues et al. 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Huynh and St Johnston, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Moore and Zernicka-Goetz, 2005</xref>). Drosophila meiotic cysts express Par3/Baz and Par6, another apical Par complex protein, along with beta-catenin/Arm in a ring-like arrangement close to the ring canals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cox et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Huynh et al. 2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Huynh and St Johnston, 2004</xref>). This relatively small membrane zone likely represents the apical domain of cyst germ cells.</p>
<p>We investigated the expression of Pard3, the mouse ortholog of Par3/Baz to determine if a similar arrangement of the highly conserved Par proteins occurs in mouse germline cysts. Pard3 expression localized around the fusome but extended beyond it, a pattern reminiscent of the larger ring of Baz in Drosophila cyst cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S3A</xref>). At E13.5, cysts in rosette configuration show Pard3 and the fusome enriched around a central cell (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, dashed region from <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Video S3B1</xref>) but not in E13.5 male cysts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Video S3B2</xref>). This co-localization was validated in multiple lineage-labeled E13.5 cysts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S3D and S3E</xref>). Ring canals were concentrated in this zone (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S3C</xref>), hence mouse cysts have ring canals and an apical Par protein in the same small anterior location as in Drosophila, and that mouse fusome occupies the corresponding zone as the Drosophila fusome. These findings suggest that mammals form and polarize oocytes using a conserved system found in diverse animals based on Par genes, cyst formation and a fusome.</p>

<title>The mouse fusome associates with Golgi genes involved in UPR beginning at the onset of cyst formation</title>
<p>We performed single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA seq) of mouse gonads to gather additional fetal germ cell data (see Methods) and combined them with data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Niu and Spradling (2022)</xref> to make an integrated dataset of more than 3,000 germ cells spanning E10.5 to P5 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F-H</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S3F-I</xref>). Our gene expression studies showed that PGCs and early cysts actively express many genes that enhance proteome quality by monitoring, refolding or expelling misfolded or aggregated proteins for degradation. The Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) pathway associated largely with the ER in yeast is regulated by Hac1, the ortholog of Xbp1. We observed high levels of Xbp1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>) and many of its target genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I and I’</xref>) that increase quality secretory protein production. Membrane proteins and lipids are also promoted by this pathway.</p>
<p>In animals the UPR pathway has been expanded with several additional branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Mitra &amp; Ryoo, 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Sicari, 2019</xref>). We also observed expression Creb3l2 (ER/Golgi resident transcription factor), ATF4 (General UPR transcription factor activated by Golgi stress), Golph3 (Golgi phosphoprotein for membrane trafficking) and Arfgap(s) (involved in both Golgi to ER-and Golgi to endosome trafficking) during mouse cyst formation (Figure S3J). Xbp1 activates genes such as the chaperones (Hsp5a/Bip, Hsp90b1;DNAjc10; Lman2; Dnajb9), protein-disulfide isomerases (Erp44, Pdia3, Pdia4, Pdia6, Creld2), the Endoplasmic Reticulum Associated Degradation (ERAD) regulator Syvn1/Hrd1 and the ERAD components (Sec61b; Ubxn4, Psmc6, Ube2j2, Get4, Ufd1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Taniguchi and Yoshida, 2017</xref>). Thus, repair and expansion of ER, Golgi and secretory components begins immediately or even before migrating PGCs reach the gonad (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>).</p>
<p>Xbp1 also supports synthesis of ER membrane phospholipids via upregulation of targets such as Elovl1, Elovl5, and Elovl6, and Chka, Other highly expressed targets maintain ER and Golgi structure and are orthologs of Drosophila fusome proteins (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I’</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Lighthouse et al., 2008</xref>). Thus the adaptive UPR pathway and its branches are active during cyst formation, and later in prophase as well (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3I’</xref>).</p>
<p>UPR genes are active during cyst formation and depend on Dazl.</p>
<p>We investigated how cyst development and fusome formation depend on Dazl. First, we confirmed that Dazl<sup>-/-</sup> mice retard the PGC to germ cell transition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S4C-E</xref>). Dazl<sup>-/-</sup> E12.5 cysts showed higher levels of the DNA methylase Dnmt3a expression compared to controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S4B</xref>) suggesting that germ cell DNA demethylation has slowed. Ring canals highlighted by staining for Tex14 were only half the size of wild type canals at E13.5 or structurally abnormal showing that cyst formation was slowed and cytokinesis was sometimes abnormal (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>

<p>We also performed scRNA sequencing of Dazl female homozygous mutant gonads at E11.5 and E12.5 and re-clustered them with wild type germ cells at these stages for comparison (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). At E11.5 the merged germ cells cluster together suggesting that Dazl<sup>-/-</sup> has minimal effects on germ cells at E11.5, the stage it is first expressed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). However, E12.5 WT and Dazl<sup>-/-</sup> germ cells cluster separately (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Wild type and Dazl<sup>-/-</sup> expressed similar amounts of EGAD mediated UPR pathway genes at E11.5 germ cells (Figure S4F) whereas wild type germ cells expressed lower levels compared to Dazl<sup>-/-</sup> cells at E12.5 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C’</xref>). Thus, UPR genes in Dazl<sup>-/-</sup> cells act similarly to pluripotency genes, and retain higher expression levels at E12.5 than wild type.</p>
<p>The high expression of Xbp1 and many of its target genes in PGCs and early cyst cells argues that early germ cells are expanding ER and Golgi production and increasing membrane protein quality. To validate that XBP1 is active in germ cells, we employed an IRE1-XBP1 ratiometric assay which utilizes a genetically encoded dual-fluorescent reporter system (see Methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S4I</xref>). First, we performed magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) to purify SSEA1 labelled germ cells from the E11.5 gonad (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S4G-H</xref>). We delivered the IRE1-XBP1 sensor to SSEA1+ve germ cells and SSEA1-ve control somatic cells by transfection. Both types of cells fluoresce in proportion to IRE1-splicing activity which measures Xbp1activation activity. The construct also constitutively expresses a fluorescent marker such that the color ratio will represent a quantitative measure of relative IRE1-XBP1 activity between cells and under different conditions. Our observations showed that IRE1-Xbp1 activity in E11.5 germ cells was significantly higher than in somatic cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S4I</xref>). Dazl mutant cells showed persistent higher levels of Xbp1 activity at E12.5 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D’-4D’’’</xref>).</p>
<p>The adaptive UPR pathway destroys misfolded proteins using proteasome activity, particularly the 20S proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Vember and Brodsky, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>). We measured proteasome activity within E11.5 PGCs to investigate whether the UPR pathway was paired with increased proteasome activity indicating it served an adaptive cellular mechanism of cell rejuvenation in PGCs destined to produce oocytes. Using a fluorogenic substrate to measure 20S Proteasome activity, we compared MACS sorted germ cells to somatic cells and found that germ cells have significantly higher proteasome activity than somatic cells at E11.5 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>) and E12.5 (4E’ Left). Proteasome activity continued to stay even higher in E12.5 Dazl-/- germ cells suggesting stressful persistent activation of UPR keeping Dazl-/- germ cell in an arrested state (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E’ Right, 4E”</xref>).</p>
<p>We also studied the effects of Dazl mutation on the asymmetric enrichment of fusome in cells with multiple ring canals. Using both EMA and a Golgi marker, Gs28, we observed that germ cell Golgi begins to fragment in <italic>Dazl</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutant germ cells even by E12.5 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F, dotted circles, graph</xref>). High levels of Golgi stress documented by the increased IRE1-Xbp1 activity, and elevated proteolysis in these cells, may lead to such fragmentation. These problems were accompanied by a dramatic arrest in cyst polarity development. <italic>Dazl</italic><sup>-/-</sup> germ cells at E13.5 showed virtually no differential expression of Pard3 or enrichment of fusome within particular cyst cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F’</xref>). Finally, in <italic>Dazl</italic><sup>-/-</sup> P0 gonads, large cells destined by become oocytes do not appear (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Video S5E3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Video S5F3</xref>). The effects of Dazl-/- on germline cyst development and meiosis are summarized in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>. These observations collectively indicate an essential function of the mouse fusome in temporal regulation of the EGAD-UPR pathway within germ cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>). The observed loss of polarity caused by Dazl-/- mutation can explain the failure of oocyte production and the sterility of Dazl homozygotes.</p>

<title>The mouse fusome is associated with organelle rejuvenation during meiosis</title>
<p>In Drosophila, starting at pachytene the microtubule cytoskeleton changes its structure, and polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cox and Sprading, 2006</xref>). The new polarity, with microtubules running along the fusome such that minus ends cluster in the oocyte, prepares selected nurse cell organelles for transport into the oocyte and the Bb of a new primordial follicle. Mouse nurse cell centrosomes, mitochondria, Golgi, ER and possibly other organelles also move from nurse cells to the oocyte between P0 and P4 in a microtubule-dependent process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lei and Spradling, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Niu and Spradling, 2022</xref>). Prior to or during these events, Drosophila mitochondria are selected and rejuvenated by programmed mitophagy to enhance functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cox and Spradling, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Lieber et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Palozzi et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Monteiro et al. 2023</xref>). It is not currently known if selection and rejuvenation take place before movement to the oocyte, or if a significant amount also takes place en route.</p>
<p>Because the fusome is directly involved in organelle movement to the Drosophila Balbiani body we looked for changes in the fusome and in gene expression that might relate to organelle rejuvenation and movement to the oocyte. For the reasons explained previously (see text for <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>) we used WGA as fusome marker beyond stage E14.5. Fusome staining with WGA persists within meiotic germ cells at E17.5 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S5A-B</xref>). Fusome volume remained in proportion with germ cell ring canal number, as outer nurse cells (with one ring canal) transfer organelles and cytoplasm to cells with more ring canals located closer to oocytes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A, graph</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Video S5C</xref>). Pard3 content also showed such a proportion (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A’ graph</xref>). At E18.5, cyst development in the medulla toward wave 1 follicles, diverged from wave 2 follicles in the cortex that become quiescent primordial follicles (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Yin and Spradling, 2025</xref>). Wave 1 oocytes grow substantially in volume, fusome and Pard3 content due to cytoplasmic transfer from surrounding nurse cells which decrease in size (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B-B’, graph</xref>. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Video S5E1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Video S5F1</xref>).

<title>Mouse germline cysts contain a fusome</title>
<p>One of the earliest and most highly conserved steps in animal gamete development is the formation of polarized germline cysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Giardina, 1901</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Wilson, 1925</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Büning, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Matova and Cooley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Lu et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gerhold et al. 2022</xref>; Sprading et al. 2022). In the ovaries of most species, cysts become polarized during the synchronous mitotic cycles whose incomplete cytokinesis connects daughters via characteristic ring canals. In Drosophila, germline cyst divisions also produce and asymmetrically distribute a microtubule and vesicle-rich fusome whose polarity is essential to specify oocytes in addition to nurse cells. We found that mouse germline cysts also contain a similar organelle, the “mouse fusome.” As in Drosophila, the mouse fusome starts as a small, membrane-rich cytoplasmic region within migrating PGCs before they arrive at the gonad. The nascent organelle propagates asymmetrically during synchronous, incomplete cyst divisions, involving stabilized spindle microtubules rich in AcTub and a program of arrested cytokinesis that produces distinctive ring canals. Stainable fusome MTs persist for only part of each cell cycle, but polarity is maintained since over five successive mitotic cycles the cyst undergoes rosette formation, predicts cleavage into smaller cysts and concentrates fusome material in future oocytes. Finally, the mouse fusome associates in a distinctive manner with the apical Par complex located near the clustered ring canals, as originally described for the fusome in Drosophila cysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cox et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Huynh et al. 2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">2001b</xref>). Apical-basal patterning of Drosophila oocytes differs from many epithelial cells (review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Huynh and St Johnston, 2004</xref>), but our studies show that both mouse and Drosophila oocytes localize the fusome and ring canals in a similar relationship to the apical Par domain.</p>

<title>How conserved are fusomes in distant animal groups?</title>
<p>The recent detailed analyses of fusomes in Xenopus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Davidian and Spradling, 2025</xref>) and here in mice, provide an opportunity to compare fusomes over a wider range of animals than was possible when well characterized fusomes were limited to Holometabolous insects. Based on these examples, the most highly conserved aspects of polarized cyst production are the cell cycle changes that arrest telophase, stabilize the midbody and lead to incomplete cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gerhold et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Price et al. 2023</xref>). Somehow this process polarizes the microtubules that arise in the fusome segment within the nascent ring canal, and becomes a building block in growing cyst polarity. A longstanding mystery regarding fusome microtubule polarity is its exceptionally high sensitivity to microtubule inhibitors like colchicine, which appears to be much greater than cell division generally, or other developmental processes requiring microtubue-dependent vesicle transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Koch and Spitzer, 1983</xref>). The sensitivity continues later in meiosis, since treating E17.5 mouse ovary cultures with just 10 nM colchicine strongly reduced Balbiani body formation, but had no measurable effect on cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lei and Spradling, 2016</xref>). Interestingly, mouse cysts develop asymmetry during a later period in cytokinesis than Drosophila cysts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C-D</xref>). In Xenopus, another fusome-related property, cyst-wide divisional synchrony, showed more variation between sister cells than in tightly coordinated Drosophila cyst cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Davidian and Spradling, 2025</xref>).</p>
<p>Qualitative differences in fusome structure and behavior have evolved between major animal groups. Drosophila fusomes and those of related insects are stabilized by an essential, proteinaceous skeleton containing alpha-spectrin, tropomodulin and germline-specific isoforms of adducin-like proteins generated by differential splicing and cleavage of a polyprotein precursor produced by the Hts gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Petrella et al. 2007</xref>). This skeleton may have evolved to control access to the fusome and hence to the oocyte by intracellular parasites such as Wolbachia bacteria. An alpha-spectrin-containing skeleton was not detected in Xenopus fusomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Davidian and Spradling, 2025</xref>) or in these experiments in mouse. The Xenopus fusome has robust microtubules, that may independently control access. This structural difference may explain earlier failures to identify fusomes in vertebrates using orthologs to Drosophila fusome proteins like alpha-spectrin.</p>

<title>Association of the mouse fusome with Golgi</title>
<p>The major role apparently played by Golgi in the mouse compared to the Drosophila or Xenopus fusomes is potentially significant. In contrast, the Drosophila fusome contains abundant ER cisternae, whose presence may facilitate lipid biosynthesis needed to produce high levels of new plasma and organellar membranes. Not does rapid cyst formation demand high amounts of fresh membranes, but rejuvenation of new germ cells may require that their lipids and proteins be newly synthesized from simple building blocks (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Spradling et al. 2025</xref>). Mouse cysts grow more slowly, and may associate extensively with Golgi because of an early high demand for protein secretion. In mouse, the zona pellucida directly contacts the oocyte and begins to be produced and secreted by the oocyte in primary follicle oocytes have just begun to develop. In contrast, the analogous Drosophila egg coating, the vitelline membrane, is produced by somatic follicle cells, and only starting in more mature follicles. Even primordial follicles oocytes contain abundant Golgi and multivesicular bodies near the Balbiani body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Niu and Spradling, 2022</xref>). Thus, fusome’s apparently stronger association with the Golgi in mouse but with the ER in Drosophila probably just reflects differences the relative relative timing and speed of events in oogenesis that take place in both organisms. This highlights the need to study fusome behavior throughout oogenesis and in the context of ongoing developmental and rejuvenation activity.</p>

<title>Mouse cysts develop multiple uniform oocytes using a novel specific-cleavage mechanism</title>
<p>Mouse PGCs generate 4-6 oocytes using a multi-step mechanism involving synchronous incomplete cyst divisions, limited fragmentation into smaller cysts (involving &lt;10% of cell-cell junctions) and continuous, slow nurse cell turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Lei and Spradling, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lei and Spradling, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Niu and Spradling, 2022</xref>. Despite their complex pathway, mouse oocytes in newly formed primordial follicles appear quite uniform in size and are efficiently produced (Spradling, 2022), suggesting that a majority develop from final cysts of similar size and nurse cell content. However, lineage analyses showed many cyst cells move apart apart at least transiently. Live imaging studies revealed active movements likely responsible for cell displacement, as well as some cell detachment caused by random breakage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Levy et al. 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>Our studies of mouse fusome microtubules indicated that oocyte uniformity is promoted by programmed cyst breakage during mitotic divisions into cysts of uniform size (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). AcTub arrays in cysts of 7-10 cells frequently contained a single large gap lacking MTs between a group of 6-cells, and the other residual cells. Such gaps in a major cytoskeletal element of germ cells subjected to significant tissue movements would likely become breakage sites (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E’’</xref>). Previous experiments also supported a special role for 6-cell cysts. We conclude that germline cyst breakage is largely programmed and efficient 6-cell cyst production explains the high frequency of synchronous six-cell mitoses observed during E11.5-E13.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Pepling and Spradling, 1998</xref> and directly mapped 6-cell cysts in young cyst stages prior to E14.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Lei and Spradling, 2013</xref>). Efficient cell turnover and transfer of most nurse cell contents into the oocyte probably explains the 5.1-fold increase in Golgi, 4.9-fold increase in mitochondria and 5-fold increase in the number of accumulated centrosomes measured in P4 oocytes compared to E14.5 germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lei and Spradling, 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>How might growing cysts be programmed to acquire a gap in remnant spindle microtubule bundles affecting a specific junction? One possibility is the uneven distribution of the fusome in four cell cysts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B’’</xref>). If the fusome is involved in stabilizing and associating with spindle remnants, shortly after M phase, the cell with the lowest fusome amount might fail acquire a spindle remnant of the necessary size at the next division, leading to 6:2 breakage. Involvement of the microtubule cytoskeleton in asymmetric divisions has been observed in many other situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fichelson &amp; Huynh, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kaltschmidt &amp; Brand, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Sunchu &amp; Cabernard, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Meiring et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Planelles-Herrero et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Watson et al., 2023</xref>). Significantly, other sources of variation likely also occur at a lower level. Synchronously dividing 8-cell and 16-cell cysts are readily detected in low numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Pepling and Spradling, 1998</xref>). These large cysts may represent a specific alternative pathway, that may preferentially take place in cysts within one of the three follicle waves that occur in mouse (Niu and Spradling, 2025). The model in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>, also predicts production of 4 2-cell cysts which were commonly observe in prior to E14.5 and the onset of substantial nurse cell transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Lei and Spradling, 2013</xref>, Supplement).</p>

<title>Dazl regulates cyst formation, fusome polarization, and oocyte specification</title>
<p>Female gamete development in many organisms is extensively controlled at the post-trancriptional level by RNA binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Mercer et al 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Conti and Kunitomi, 2024</xref>). In vertebrates, the RNA-binding protein Dazl is widely conserved and controls multiple aspects of early germ cell development by regulating a large number of target transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Zagore et al. 2018</xref>). In mice, Dazl modulates the ongoing reprogramming of new arrived gonadal PGCs to pleuripotency beginning at E11.5 when it turns on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gill et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Nicholls et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Haston et al. 2009</xref>). Normally, Dazl continues to function at later stages of oocyte development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Conti and Kunitomi, 2024</xref>), but Dazl mutants fail to enter or progress in meiosis.</p>
<p>Our studies defined a series of new functions for Dazl during cyst formation. We confirmed that pluripotency reactivation is slowed in Dazl mutants since DNA demethylation was delayed, and pluripotency genes failed to start downregulating at E12.5. Homozygous Dazl mutant females failed to normally regulate UPR genes, leaving their mRNA levels elevated. This likely resulted from a failure to downregulate their Xbp1 activator, since both Xbp1 activity and 20S proteosome activity was also elevated in Dazl-/- germ cells. Overactivation of the UPR pathway appeared to cause Golgi fragmentation. These effects resembled the general slowing of normal developmental progression, as with pleuripotency downregulation. We also observed abnormal cyst formation with some small and defective ring canals as in zebrafish Dazl mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bertho et al. 2021</xref>), but cysts remained intact and continued to develop. This allowed us to document that Dazl is needed for cysts and their fusomes to become polarized. In Dazl mutants, cysts did not undergo rosette formation or concentrate the fusome or Pard3 in cells with multiple ring canals. Oocytes apparently could not be specified and did not form. These results show that Dazl acts as a regulator that is essential for the many important aspects of cyst formation and oocyte production.</p>

<title>Germ cell rejuvenation is highly active during cyst formation</title>
<p>Germ cells have long been known to propagate species without know limits over evolutionary time by rejuvenating gametes each generation in association with meiosis (Weissmann, 1892; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kirkwood, 1987</xref>). Recently, the detailed cellular and molecular genetic mechanisms that make this possible both in single-celled eukaryotes and in animals have generated increasing interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cox and Spradling, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Unal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bohnert and Kenyon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Lieber et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Palozzi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Spradling et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Yamashita, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Xiao and Unal, 2025</xref>). By studying the fusome, which is already present in migrating PGCs and E9.5, and by sequencing mouse germ cells from the earliest stages of ovarian development beginning at E10.5, we gained new insights into the timing and processes that likely contribute to germ cell rejuvenation during mouse oogenesis.</p>
<p>These studies made it clear that multiple rejuvenation mechanisms are highly active from the earliest times of germ cell development (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>). In animals the UPR pathway has been modified by the addition of several additional pathways besides the Ire1-Xba1 branch, all of which were expressed in early germ cells. Creb3l2 controls a transcription factor that increases production COPII vesicles that carry out ER to Golgi transport and maintain a balance between secretory supply and demand. Insufficient matching can lead to Golgi stress (Machemer, 2015), which can be managed by activating the ATF4 pathway branch.</p>
<p>Expression of Xbp1mRNA or even Xbp1 protein using a general antibody is not sufficient to show Xbp1 activity, since this is controlled by Ire1-mediated splicing to produce the active Xbp1s isoform. We were able to purify enough E11.5 and E12.5 germ cells to carry out biochemical assays and show that mouse female germ cells have substantial levels of Xbp1s activity at both times, higher than in somatic cells. The high expression of many known Xbp1 targets also documents the high activity of this pathway (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I,I’</xref>). Early germ cells also express genes suggesting that they are expanding membranes via lipid biosynthesis and secretory pathway activity. Consistent with active adaptive-UPR rejuvenation of their proteomes we documented substantial levels of active proteolysis in early germ cells at both E11.5 and E12.5 The observations reported here suggest that EGAD—an emerging proteostatic mechanism plays a previously unappreciated role. EGAD complements the well-established ERAD pathway by facilitating the clearance of misfolded proteins via Golgi-endosome trafficking and proteolysis, rather than removal from the ER and degradation in the proteosome as in ERAD. We observed substantial amounts of ERAD based on the expression of Xbp1 and its many targets, and its documented activity and its endpoint 20S proteosome activity. It is hard to quantitatively compare the amount of EGAD activity, but the prominent role Golgi throughout the stages of mouse oogenesis and its location at the core of the Balbiani body suggests that EGAD either fulfills a unique role in oocyte production. or else is uniquely capable of operating at the highest level of proteostatic activity demanded by the much greater challenge of germline rejuvenation compared to any other tissue without generating damaging and self-limiting side effects.</p>
<p>Rejuvenation genes were also highly expressed later in meiosis during zygotene and pachytene, in diplotene when mitochondria/ER contact is extremely high (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>), as well as in primordial follicles (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I,I’</xref> “Dc”). The early appearance of the fusome and its association with Golgi and ER-related processes that are central to adaptive-UPR, suggests that in animals, rejuvenation begins earlier in the generational cycle than it does in single celled eukaryotes. Animal germ cells return to a pleuripotent state by the end of cyst formation. Cyst formation precede meiosis and represents an opportunity to enhance the rejuvenation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Spradling et al. 2025</xref>). Our findings of early rejuvenation activity align with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Palozzi et al. (2022)</xref>, who showed that mitochondrial rejuvenation during oogenesis uses a special germline mitophagy and begins at the onset of meiosis. In yeast, mouse and C. elegans oocytes, damaged materials are destroyed by lysosome-like degradation in mature oocytes and at meiosis II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bohnert and Kenyon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Zaffagnini et al. 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Xiao and Unal, 2025</xref>), similar to the lysosome-like turnover of remnant nurse cells, and residual fusome contents near the onset of follicle formation in mouse and Drosophila. Thus, animal oocytes may engage in rejuvenation activities from before meiosis begins until meiosis II is completed.</p>
<p>In sum, our experiments argue that mouse germline cysts are produced by an ancient conserved process that modulates spindle microtubules to generate an asymmetric polarized fusome associated with apical Par proteins that enrich in oocytes. Proteins and processes involved in cellular rejuvenation are highly active throughout meiotic prophase and begin even in migrating PGCs. Germline cyst polarity ensures that organelles gathered from the nurse cells are delivered to the oocyte where they form a Balbiani body. In Drosophila, germline cysts, fusomes and Par-mediated polarity are all essential for oocyte production. The parallels shown here across 500 million years of evolution strengthen the case that germline cysts and polarized fusomes are likely to have been maintained in evolution because they contribute to the existential task of rejuvenating germ cells each generation,</p>

Tamoxifen was dissolved in corn oil (Sigma) and a single dose was injected intraperitoneally at 0.2 mg per 40 g body weight into pregnant female R26R-EYFP mice at E10.5. Fetal gonads/Pups were dissected as needed in between E11.5-E18.5/P0. To analyze the lineage-labeled germ cells, fixed and frozen whole gonads were subjected to whole mount staining for chicken-GFP, the number of lineage-labeled germ cells of each ovary was determined by examining optically sectioned Z-stack images generated by confocal imaging of the entire ovary.</p>

<p>Three-dimensional model images and movies were generated by Imaris software (Bitplane).For z-stack images, different visualization options in the Surpass mode of Imaris helped to gain visualization control of the objects. To perform surface rendering and volume quantification using Imaris software, we imported your 3D image dataset for EMA/WGA staining. We started with a “Volume” rendering for channels corresponding to EMA/WGA staining and then we adjusted the contrast, brightness and transparency in the “Display Adjustment” window. Next, we used the Surfaces module to create surface renderings by selecting the appropriate fluorescence channel, applied manual thresholding and adjusted smoothing parameters to define the structure accurately. Once the surface is rende, we navigated to the statistics tab to access volume measurements. Further visualization of the results was performed in 3D or orthogonal views to confirm accuracy, and adjusted rendering properties such as color or transparency as needed. To create spots for easy counting of labelled cells, we used the “Spots” icon-option in the “Creation” menu and started the spot creation wizard. We set the approximate spot size as per the requirement. Next, we selected the “Manual Creation” option to place spots individually. Each click placed a single spot at the corresponding position.</p>

<p>Whole ovaries were dissected in PBS and fixed in 4% Paraformaldehyde overnight. After three 3-min washes in cacodylate buffer, ovaries were postfixed in 1% OsO4, 0.5% K3Fe {CN)6, in cacodylate buffer for 1 hour and were rinsed twice for 5 min in cacodylate buffer and once for 5 min with 0.05 M maleate (pH 6.0). The ovaries were stained in 0.5% uranyl acetate overnight at 4 degrees rinsed in water and dehydrated through an ethanol series. Following two 10-rain washes with propylene oxide, the ovaries were infiltrated with resin. The resin-embedded specimen was polymerized by incubation at 45<sup>0</sup> C and 70<sup>0</sup> C for 12 hours each. Silver-gold sections were cut, stained with lead citrate, and observed in the electron microscope.</p>

<title>Single cell RNA sequencing of Wildtype E10.5, E11.5 and E15.5 gonad</title>
<p>Embryonic ovaries were dissected such that individual fetal gonad at E10.5 (18 gonads from 3 females), E11.5 (12 female gonad from 3 females) and E15.5 (10 gonad from 2 females) were collected. For E10.5 and E11.5: corresponding tail were labelled for identification and placed in 1× PBS on ice. We performed quick Quinacrine and DAPI staining (∼15 min) of corresponding E10.5 and E11.5 fetal tail samples to eliminate the male gonad samples -with positive Quinacrine staining of tail samples. We then pooled the dissected female gonad sample and dissociated it into single cells using 0.25% Trypsin at 37<sup>0</sup> C for 5-7 min with two pipet trituration in between. Fetal bovine serum (10 %) was then used to neutralize trypsin. Dissociated cells were passed through 100-μm strainer. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 300 g for 5 minutes and cell pellet was resuspended in freshly prepared and filter-sterilized 0.04% BSA. Viability of cells was assessed via trypan staining and &gt;90 percent viable samples were selected and loaded (∼10000 live cells for E11.5 and E15.5, ∼20000 cells for E10.5) onto the 10X Genomics Chromium Single Cell system using the for E11.5 and E15.5-v3 and for E10.5 v4 chemistry as per the manufacturer’s instruction. Single-cell RNA capture and library preparations were performed, and standard data was data processing was performed using Cell ranger pipeline (6.0.1 - for E11.5 and E15.5 and 8.0.1-for E10.5) and later data was visualized and analyzed by Seurat v5.1.0.</p>

<title>Single cell RNA sequencing of Dazl1L mutant gonad</title>
<p>Dazl+/- female and males were kept for mating and plugged females were marked as E0.5. The gonad from E11.5, E12.5 fetuses were dissected, fetuses were collected in and kept in cold PBS in 12-well plate such that each well with individual fetus is marked for identification. Fetal tails were collected, labelled and subjected to kapa express extract kit (Catalog #KR0383- v4.16) mediated fast DNA extraction according to manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, one step lysis and DNA extraction system was set up in 100 μl volume by adding 10 μl express extract buffer, 2 μl of express extract enzyme and 88 μl of PCR grade water in each tail sample followed by 75<sup>0</sup> C incubation in heating block for 15 minutes for lysis. The samples were then incubated at 95<sup>0</sup>C in heating block for 5 minutes for DNA extraction. The sample was then centrifuged briefly to pellet the debris, and supernatant was used directly for PCR as mentioned in methods section of RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis and PCR. The standard genotyping JAX protocol for strain 035880 is refer to identify homozygous / heterozygous and wild type fetuses. Simultanoeusly male/female sexing was also performed (primer details in Table S2). After correct identification, homozygous fetuses-from E11.5 (6 gonad from 3 females) and E12.5 (6 gonad from two females)- were trypsinized to prepare live single cells which were then subjected to 10X Genomics Chromium (v3 chemistry) and data was processed using cell ranger pipeline 6.0.1 and analyzed using seurat v5.1.0 in same manner as mentioned previously for E11.5 gonad.</p>

Count data generated by the Cell Ranger pipeline (6.0.1/8.0.1) were imported into R using the Read10X function and converted into a Seurat object with the CreateSeuratObject function. R packages were used to filter out the low-quality cells, and the following criteria were used to filter cells: <bold>for E10.5 WT gonad</bold>: nFeature_RNA &gt; 500 &amp; nFeature_RNA&lt;8500 &amp; nCount_RNA &gt; 500 &amp; percent.mt&lt;5 <bold>for E11.5 WT gonad</bold>: nFeature_RNA &gt; 100 &amp; nFeature_RNA&lt;11000 &amp; nCount_RNA &gt; 300 &amp; percent.mt&lt;10 <bold>for E15.5 WT ovary:</bold> nFeature_RNA &gt; 500 &amp; nFeature_RNA&lt;9000 &amp; nCount_RNA &gt; 500 &amp; percent.mt&lt;10. The filte count matrices were Log-normalized using the “NormalizeData” function and scaled with the “ScaleData” function to prepare for dimensionality uction. “Principal Component Analysis (PCA)” was then applied to uce dimensionality, followed by using top 15 dimensions and default resolution to cluster cells based on gene expression profiles using the “FindNeighbors” and “FindClusters” functions.

<title>Bioinformatic segregation of female germ cells</title>
<p>To segregate E10.5 and E11.5 XX-specific germ cells with complete surety we performed bioinformatic segregation of female germ cells to address the limitations of primitive Quinacrine staining. The expression of the X-linked gene Xist, Ddx3x, Utx etc., were used as a marker. Cells with significant Xist or other X-linked gene expression expression were labeled as “XXonly” using the “Idents” and “WhichCells” R functions. A new Seurat object containing only XX- specific cells was created using the subset function. Germ cells within this subset were identified by examining the expression of germ cell-specific marker genes, and a further subset of E10.5 and E11.5 female germ cells was created using the subset function to focus on germ cells specifically.</p>

<title>Wildtype ger cells-merged dataset creation and Validation</title>
<p>ScRNA-seq datasets from E11.5 to P5 (retrieved from the GEO database, GSE136441 and merged object submiited to Github) were visualized using Seurat. E11.5 cells were discarded and new merged dataset from E10.5-P5 was created, subsets of germ cell clusters from E10.5, E11.5, and E15.5 were integrated using Seurat’s “Merge” function. The resulting merged dataset was then processed by normalizing and scaling the data, followed by the identification of variable genes. Th ebatch correction was performed using and pre-harmony and post-harmony data was assessed by visualizing LISI (Local Inverse Simpson’s Inde) score confirming successful batch mixing. Cell clusters were determined using Seurat’s sha nearest neighbor (SNN) algorithm with PCA uction using top 15 dimesnions and 2.8 resolution. To visualize these clusters, dimensionality uction was applied (umap) with following criteria: RunUMAP(new_merge, dims=1:15, n.neighbors=40, min.dist=0.6, spread=1) enabling the identification of distinct cell populations.</p>
<p>Cell cycle stages of germ cells across the different developmental stages (E10.5-P5) were validated by visualizing meiosis stage specific expression pattern via feature plot. This visualization technique allows for the capture of subtle trends and helps in comparing expression peaks, providing insights into the transition from mitosis to meiosis across the different developmental stages. Additionally, a violin plot was employed to visualize the variability in average raw UMI levels across germ cells. This approach allowed for an effective comparison of gene expression profiles, highlighting the differences in gene expression patterns between different stages.</p>

<title><italic>In vitro</italic> gonad culture: microtubule inhibitor/BFA treatment and organelle tracker assay</title>
<p>To perform in vitro culture of mouse fetal ovaries on membrane inserts with or without inhibitors, we prepared sterile culture medium, constituting DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin. Inhibitor stock solutions were prepared in DMSO and diluted at desi concentration in culture media (Ciliobrevin D from Millipore, 25 μM for 6 hours, BFA from Invitrogen, 5μg/ml for 6 hours). Control medium containing the vehicle DMSO was prepared simultaneously. Fetal ovaries were dissected from E11.5 embryos under a stereomicroscope in sterile PBS, we have kept the surrounding mesonephric tissue intact and attached to the gonad to ensure proper development. We have also collected corresponding fetus tail of each fetal gonad to perform genetic sex determination. We have placed membrane inserts into a 24-well plate and added ∼500 µL of culture medium (with or without inhibitors) to the lower chamber and ensu no contact between medium and the insert surface. Next, we gently placed isolated ovaries onto the membrane surface using sterile forceps. The plate is then incubated in a CO₂ incubator at 37°C for ∼6 hours. After the designated culture period, confirmed ovaries (post genetic-sex analysis), were carefully removed from the membrane inserts and washed three times with basal media to remove any residual inhibitors. Next, we collected ovaries and fixed in 4% PFA for downstream immunolocalization studies. To inhibit the microtubule growth using cold treatment, we transfer dissected gonad to a chilled culture medium, maintained at 0-4°C. The tissue is fully immersed in the pre-cooled medium and incubated on ice for ∼60 minutes. This low-temperature exposure destabilizes microtubules by disrupting tubulin dynamics, effectively depolymerizing existing microtubules and inhibiting further polymerization. After the incubation, the tissue is washed with fresh ice-cold medium and fixed in 4% PFA. To stain specifically for organelles: Fetal ovaries were dissected and cultu in vitro in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with organelle-specific fluorescent dyes. LysoTracker™ Deep (Thermo Fisher, L7528, 1 mM stock) or MitoTracker™ (Thermo Fisher, M7514) or MitoTracker™ Deep (Thermo Fisher, M22426), and ER-Tracker™ (Thermo Fisher, E34251) or ER-Tracker™ (Thermo Fisher, E34250) were each added at a final concentration according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The ovaries were incubated in this dye-containing medium at 37 °C with 5% CO₂ for 12 hours. Following incubation, tissues were collected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for subsequent immunostaining.</p>

<p>Embryonic ovaries were pooled and treated with Trypsin then were neutralized followed by centrifugation as mentioned before to in scRNA Sequencing method section to create dissociated single cells. The resulting cell pellet was re-suspended in ∼80 microliters MACS buffer i.e. PBS with 0.5% BSA and 2 mM ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). ∼20 microliters Anti-SSEA1 (CD15) microbeads (MiltenyiBiotec Inc., #130-094-530) were added to the cell suspension followed by incubated for 20 min on ice. After adding 1 ml MACS Buffer to the suspension, the SSEA1 bound cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 300 g for 10 min at 4°C. SSEA1+ve and SSEA1-ve cells were then separated by applying cell suspension to MS columns according to the manufacturer’s instruction (MiltenyiBiotec Inc.). The SSEA1+ve cells were retained by the column and were filte thrice to obtain pure germ cell population. The cells were counted, and viability was assessed via trypan staining and using automated cell counter (Fischer Scientific). For validation of MACS protocol the cells were fixed in 4 % PFA to perform Immunostaining of DDX4 and were also sto in trizol to perform RNA synthesis and PCR for germ cell specific gene expression.</p>

<title>IRE1-Xbp1 Assay</title>
<p>The IRE1-XBP1 ratiometric assay (from Montana Molecular #U0921G) is a genetically encoded biosensor system utilizes a BacMam Vector carrying dual-fluorescence biosensor. For each assay reaction 50 μl transduction mix consisting of XBP1-IRE1 sensor (15 μl) plus sodium butyrate (0.6 μl per well) was prepared in basal media. To standardize the working conditions, manufacturer provided thapsigargin (1 μm per well) was used as positive control and untransduced cells were used as negative control. For each experiment equal amounts of SSEA1- ve and SSEA1 +ve cells were added to a 96-well plate in duplicates. ∼50 microliters of transduction mix was added to each reaction well. The plate was incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature and then transfer to 5% CO2 and 37°C for 24 hrs. The enzymatic activity was then measured at 37°C by monitoring XBP1-IRE-1 sensor’s fluorescent intensity (top read) at Ex/Em=488/525 nm and basal constitutive fluorescent intensity at 565/620 using microplate reader (BioTek Synergy H1). IRE1-Xbp1 assay comparing MACS sorted SSEA1⁺ germ vs SSEA1⁻ somatic cells at E11.5 was performed across 6 experiments (∼32 mice, ≥5 mice and &gt;=20 ovaries per experiment).

<p>This manuscript provides evidence that mouse germline cysts develop an asymmetric Golgi, ER, and microtubule-associated structure that resembles the fusome in Drosophila germline cysts. This <bold>fundamental</bold> study provides new evidence that fusome-like structures exist in germ cell cysts across species.

<p>This study identifies Visham, an asymmetric structure in developing mouse cysts resembling the Drosophila fusome, an organelle crucial for oocyte determination. Using immunofluorescence, electron microscopy, 3D reconstruction, and lineage labeling, the authors show that primordial germ cells (PGCs) and cysts, but not somatic cells, contain an EMA-rich, branching structure that they named Visham, which remains unbranched in male cysts. Visham accumulates in regions enriched in intercellular bridges, forming clusters reminiscent of fusome &quot;rosettes.&quot; It is enriched in Golgi and endosomal vesicles and partially overlaps with the ER. During cell division, Visham localizes near centrosomes in interphase and early metaphase, disperses during metaphase, and reassembles at spindle poles during telophase before becoming asymmetric. Microtubule depolymerization disrupts its formation.</p>
<p>Cyst fragmentation is shown to be non-random, correlating with microtubule gaps. The authors propose that 8-cell (or larger) cysts fragment into 6-cell and 2-cell cysts. Analysis of Pard3 (the mouse ortholog of Par3/Baz) reveals its colocalization with Visham during cyst asymmetry, suggesting that mammalian oocyte polarization depends on a conserved system involving Par genes, cyst formation, and a fusome-like structure.</p>
<p>Transcriptomic profiling identifies genes linked to pluripotency and the unfolded protein response (UPR) during cyst formation and meiosis, supported by protein-level reporters monitoring Xbp1 splicing and 20S proteasome activity. Visham persists in meiotic germ cells at stage E17.5 and is later transferred to the oocyte at E18.5 along with mitochondria and Golgi vesicles, implicating it in organelle rejuvenation. In Dazl mutants, cysts form, but Visham dynamics, polarity, rejuvenation, and oocyte production are disrupted, highlighting its potential role in germ cell development.</p>
<p>Overall, this is an interesting and comprehensive study of a conserved structure in the germline cells of both invertebrate and vertebrate species. Investigating these early stages of germ cell development in mice is particularly challenging. Although primarily descriptive, the study represents a remarkable technical achievement. The images are generally convincing, with only a few exceptions.</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>(1) Some titles contain strong terms that do not fully match the conclusions of the corresponding sections.</p>
<p>(1a) Article title &quot;Mouse germline cysts contain a fusome-like structure that mediates oocyte development&quot;:</p>
<p>The term &quot;mediates&quot; could be misleading, as the functional data on Visham (based on comparing its absence to wild-type) actually reflects either a microtubule defect or a Dazl mutant context. There is no specific loss-of-function of visham only.</p>
<p>(1b) Result title, &quot;Visham overlaps centrosomes and moves on microtubules&quot;:</p>
<p>The term &quot;moves&quot; implies dynamic behavior, which would require live imaging data that are not described in the article.</p>
<p>(1c) Result title, &quot;Visham associates with Golgi genes involved in UPR beginning at the onset of cyst formation&quot;:</p>
<p>The presented data show that the presence of Visham in the cyst coincides temporally with the expression and activity of the UPR response; the term &quot;associates&quot; is unclear in this context.</p>
<p>(1d) Result title, &quot;Visham participates in organelle rejuvenation during meiosis&quot;:</p>
<p>The term &quot;participates&quot; suggests that Visham is required for this process, whereas the conclusion is actually drawn from the Dazl mutant context, not a specific loss-of-function of visham only.</p>
<p>(2) The authors aim to demonstrate that Visham is a fusome-like structure. I would suggest simply referring to it as a &quot;fusome-like structure&quot; rather than introducing a new term, which may confuse readers and does not necessarily help the authors' goal of showing the conservation of this structure in Drosophila and Xenopus germ cells. Interestingly, in a preprint from the same laboratory describing a similar structure in Xenopus germ cells, the authors refer to it as a &quot;fusome-like structure (FLS)&quot; (Davidian and Spradling, BioRxiv, 2025).</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The revised manuscript has been clearly improved, and the authors have addressed all of our comments. I would like to point out two minor issues:</p>
<p>(1) As suggested by the reviewers, the authors now use the term fusome instead of visham. However, they also acknowledge that this structure lacks many components of the Drosophila fusome. It may therefore be more appropriate to refer to it as a &quot;mouse fusome&quot; or as a &quot;fusome-like structure (FLS),&quot; as used in Xenopus.</p>
<p>(2) I agree with Reviewer 3 that co-localization between EMA and acTubulin on still images does not convincingly demonstrate that fusome vesicles move along microtubules (Figure S2E).</p>

<p>The manuscript provides evidence that mice have a fusome, a conserved structure most well studied in Drosophila that is important for oocyte specification. Overall, a myriad of evidence is presented demonstrating the existence of a mouse fusome. This work is important as it addresses a long-standing question in the field of whether mice have fusomes and sheds light on how oocytes are specified in mammals.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>Overall, the authors did a good job of responding to reviewer comments that have improved the manuscript by including higher quality microscope images, revising text for clarity and using the term mouse fusome instead of using a new term. However, two of the headings in the results section that didn't correspond to the data presented in that section still have not been revised eventhough the authors stated that they were revised in their response to reviewer comments. The heading of the first section of the results is: &quot;PGCs contain a Golgi-rich structure known as the EMA granule&quot; even though no evidence in that section shows it is Golgi rich. The heading of the fifth section of the results is: &quot;The mouse fusome associates with polarity and microtubule genes including pard3&quot; however, only evidence for pard3 is presented.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review)</bold></p>
<p>Summary</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the constructive and thoughtful evaluation of our work. We appreciate the recognition of the novelty and potential implications of our findings regarding UPR activation and proteasome activity in germ cells.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) The microscopy images look saturated, for example, Figure 1a, b, etc. Is this a normal way to present fluorescent microscopy?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The apparent saturation was not present in the original images, but likely arose from image compression during PDF generation. While the EMA granule was still apparent, in the revised submission, we will provide high-resolution TIFF files to ensure accurate representation of fluorescence intensity and will carefully optimize image display settings to avoid any saturation artifacts.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors should ensure that all claims regarding enrichment/lower vs. lower values have indicated statistical tests.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully agree. In the revised version, we will correct any quantitative comparisons where statistical tests were not already indicated, with a clear statement of the statistical tests used, including p-values in figure legends and text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(a) In Figure 2f, the authors should indicate which comparison is made for this test. Is it comparing 2 vs. 6 cyst numbers?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge that the description was not sufficiently detailed. Indeed, the test was not between 2 vs 6 cyst numbers, but between all possible ways 8-cell cysts or the larger cysts studied could fragment randomly into two pieces, and produce by chance 6-cell cysts in 13 of 15 observed examples. We will expand the legend and main text to clarify that a binomial test was used to determine that the proportion of cysts producing 6-cell fragments differed very significantly from chance.</p>
<p>Revised text:</p>
<p>“A binomial test was used to assess whether the observed frequency of 6-cell cyst products differed from random cyst breakage. Production of 6-cell cysts was strongly preferred (13/15 cysts; ****p &lt; 0.0001).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(b) Figures 4d and 4e do not have a statistical test indicated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will include the specific statistical test used and report the corresponding p-values directly in the figure legends.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Because the system is developmentally dynamic, the major conclusions of the work are somewhat unclear. Could the authors be more explicit about these and enumerate them more clearly in the abstract?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will revise the abstract to better clarify the findings of this study. We will also replace the term Visham with mouse fusome to reflect its functional and structural analogy to the Drosophila and Xenopus fusomes, making the narrative more coherent and conclusive.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The references for specific prior literature are mostly missing (lines 184-195, for example).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this observation of a problem that occurred inadvertently when shortening an earlier version.  We will add 3–4 relevant references to appropriately support this section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The authors should define all acronyms when they are first used in the text (UPR, EGAD, etc).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will ensure that all acronyms are spelled out at first mention (e.g., Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), Endosome and Golgi-Associated Degradation (EGAD)).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The jumping between topics (EMA, into microtubule fragmentation, polarization proteins, UPR/ERAD/EGAD, GCNA, ER, balbiani body, etc) makes the narrative of the paper very difficult to follow.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are not jumping between topics, but following a narrative relevant to the central question of whether female mouse germ cells develop using a fusome.  EMA, microtubule fragmentation, polarization proteins, ER, and balbiani body are all topics with a known connection to fusomes. This is explained in the general introduction and in relevant subsections. We appreciate this feedback that further explanations of these connections would be helpful. In the revised manuscript, use of the unified term mouse fusome will also help connect the narrative across sections.  UPR/ERAD/EGAD are processes that have been studied in repair and maintenance of somatic cells and in yeast meiosis.  We show that the major regulator XbpI is found in the fusome, and that the fusome and these rejuvenation pathway genes are expressed and maintained throughout oogenesis, rather than only during limited late stages as suggested in previous literature.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) The heading title &quot;Visham participates in organelle rejuvenation during meiosis&quot; in line 241 is speculative and/or not supported. Drawing upon the extensive, highly rigorous Drosophila literature, it is safe to extrapolate, but the claim about regeneration is not adequately supported.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We believe this statement is accurate given the broad scope of the term &quot;participates.&quot; It is supported by localization of the UPR regulator XbpI to the fusome. XbpI is the ortholog of HacI a key gene mediating UPR-mediated rejuvenation during yeast meiosis.  We also showed that rejuvenation pathway genes are expressed throughout most of meiosis (not previously known) and expanded cytological evidence of stage-specific organelle rejuvenation later in meiosis, such as mitochondrial-ER docking, in regions enriched in fusome antigens. However, we recognize the current limitations of this evidence in the mouse, and want to appropriately convey this, without going to what we believe would be an unjustified extreme of saying there is no evidence.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comprehensive summary and for highlighting both the technical achievement and biological relevance of our study. We greatly appreciate the thoughtful suggestions that have helped us refine our presentation and terminology.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) Some titles contain strong terms that do not fully match the conclusions of the corresponding sections.</p>
<p>(1a) Article title “Mouse germline cysts contain a fusome-like structure that mediates oocyte development”</p>

<p>We will change the statement to: “Mouse germline cysts contain a fusome that supports germline cyst polarity and rejuvenation.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1b) Result title “Visham overlaps centrosomes and moves on microtubules”</p>

<p>We acknowledge that “moves” implies dynamics. We will include additional supplementary images showing small vesicular components of the mouse fusome on spindle-derived microtubule tracks.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1c) Result title “Visham associates with Golgi genes involved in UPR beginning at the onset of cyst formation”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will revise this title to: “The mouse fusome associates with the UPR regulatory protein Xbp1 beginning at the onset of cyst formation” to reflect the specific UPR protein that was immunolocalized.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1d) Result title “Visham participates in organelle rejuvenation during meiosis”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will revise this to: “The mouse fusome persists during organelle rejuvenation in meiosis.”</p>

<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comment. To maintain conceptual clarity and align with existing literature, we will refer to the structure as the mouse fusome throughout the manuscript, avoiding introduction of a new term.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for emphasizing the importance of our study and for providing constructive feedback that will help us clarify and strengthen our conclusions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) Line 86 - the heading for this section is &quot;PGCs contain a Golgi-rich structure known as the EMA granule&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the enrichment of Golgi within the EMA PGCs was not shown until the next section. We will revise this heading to:</p>
<p>“PGCs contain an asymmetric EMA granule.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Line 105-106, how do we know if what's seen by EM corresponds to the EMA1 granule?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will clarify that this identification is based on co-localization with Golgi markers (GM130 and GS28) and response to Brefeldin A treatment, which will be included as supplementary data. These findings support that the mouse fusome is Golgi-derived and can therefore be visualized by EM. The Golgi regions in E13.5 cyst cells move close together and associate with ring canals as visualized by EM (Figure 1E), the same as the mouse fusomes identified by EMA.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Line 106-107-states &quot;Visham co-stained with the Golgi protein Gm130 and the recycling endosomal protein Rab11a1&quot;. This is not convincing as there is only one example of each image, and both appear to be distorted.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Space is at a premium in these figures, but we have no limitation on data documenting this absolutely clear co-localization. We will replace the existing images with high-resolution, noncompressed versions for the final figures to clearly illustrate the co-staining patterns for GM130 and Rab11a1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Line 132-133---while visham formation is disrupted when microtubules are disrupted, I am not convinced that visham moves on microtubules as stated in the heading of this section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will include additional supplementary data showing small mouse fusome vesicles aligned along microtubules.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Line 156 - the heading for this section states that Visham associates with polarity and microtubule genes, including pard3, but only evidence for pard3 is presented.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree and will revise the heading to: “Mouse fusome associates with the polarity protein Pard3.” We are adding data showing association of small fusome vesicles on microtubules.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Lines 196-210 - it's strange to say that UPR genes depend on DAZ, as they are upregulated in the mutants. I think there are important observations here, but it's unclear what is being concluded.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>UPR genes are not upregulated in DAZ in the sense we have never documented them increasing. We show that UPR genes during this time behave like pleuripotency genes and normally decline, but in DAZ mutants their decline is slowed.  We will rephrase the paragraph to clarify that Dazl mutation partially decouples developmental processes that are normally linked, which alters UPR gene expression relative to cyst development.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Line 257-259-wave 1 and 2 follicles need to be explained in the introduction, and how these fits with the observations here clarified.</p>
</disp-quote>

<p>(1) Figure 1E: need to use some immuno-gold staining to identify the Visham. Just circling an area of cytoplasm that contains ER between germ cell pairs is not enough.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insistence that the association between the mouse fusome and Golgi be clearly demonstrated. However, the EMA granule is a large structure discovered and defined by light microscopy, and presents no inherent challenge to documenting its Golgi association by immunofluorescence experiments, which we presented and now further strengthened as described in the next paragraph.  We believe that the suggested EM experiment would add little to the EM we already presented (Figure 1E, E')  Moreover, due to facility limitations, we are currently unable to perform immunogold staining.</p>
<p>To strengthen previous immunolocalization experiments, we have now included additional immunostaining data showing the clear colocalization of the fusome region with the Golgi markers GM130 and GS28 (Figure S1H). We have also incorporated a new experiment using the Golgi-specific inhibitor Brefeldin A (BFA) see Figure S1I.  Treatment of in vitro–cultured gonads with BFA, disrupted EMA granule formation, demonstrating that EMA granules not only associate with Golgi, but require Golgi function to to be maintained.</p>
<p>Additionally, in Figure 2, we showed that the fusome overlaps with the peri-centriolar region—a characteristic locus for Golgi due to its movement on microtubules.  We showed that the dynamic behavior of the fusome during the cell cycle, parallels Golgi dispersal and reassembly, and all these facts provide further strong support for the Golgi-association of the EMA granule and fusome.</p>

<p>(4) Figure 2b/c: seemly likely based on the snapshot of different stages of cytokinesis that the &quot;newly formed&quot; visham is accurate, but without live imaging, this claim of &quot;newly formed&quot; is putative/speculative. It is OK if it is labeled as &quot;putative&quot; in the figure panel.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The behavior of the Drosophila fusome during mitosis was deduced without live imaging (deCuevas et al. 1998). We clarified that the conversion of a single mouse germ cell with one round fusome to an interconnected pair of cells with two round fusomes of greater total volume following mitosis is the basis for deducing that new fusome formation occurs each cell cycle. However, we agree with the reviewer that the phrase &quot;newly formed&quot; in the original label on Figure 2c suggested a specific mechanism of fusome increase that was not intended and this phrase has been removed entirely.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Figure 2e/e is extremely difficult to follow. In order to improve the readability of these figure panels, can individual panels with a single stain be shown? The 'gap' between YFP+ sister cells is not immediately obvious in panel e or e&quot; with the current layout. Since this is a key aspect of the author's claim about cleavage of the cyst, it would be best to make this claim more robust by showing more convincing images. In Figure 2E, the staining pattern of EMA needs to be clarified and described more fully in the text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We mapped discontinuities in the microtubule connections, not the fusome or YFP.  YFP is the lineage marker indicating that the cells of a single cyst are being studied. Consequently, no gap between YFP cytoplasmic expression is expected because only in the last example (figure E”), has fragmentation already occurred (and here there is a YFP gap).  The acetylated tubulin gap proceeds fragmentation.  The mitotic spindle remnants labeled by AcTub link the cells into two groups separated by a gap, which is clearly shown in the data images and in the third column where only the relevant AcTub from the cyst itself is shown. In response to the reviewers question about the fusome, which is not directly relevant to fragmentation, we have now provided images of the separate fusome channel and corresponding measurements for all three Figure 2E-E'' cysts in the supplementary Figure S4H. We have improved the text regarding this important figure to try and make it easier to follow, and also added a new example of a 10-cell cyst also in S2H (lower panels).  We also added, movies allowing full 3D study of one of the 8 cell cysts and the new 10-cell cyst.  I also suggest that the reviewer examine how the deduced mechanism of fragmentation explains previously published but not fully understood data on cyst fragmentation going back to 1998 as described in the expanded Discussion on this topic.</p>

<p>(6) It would be best to support the proposed model in Figure 2G (4+4+4) with microscopy images of a 12-cell or 16-cell cyst? Would these 12-cell or 16-cell cysts be too large to technically recover in a section?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Unfortunately the reviewer 's suggestion that 12- or 16-cell cysts are too large to recover and present convincingly is correct. Because our analysis depends on capturing lineage-labeled cysts specifically at telophase with acetylated-tubulin connections, the likelihood of obtaining the correct stage is very low.  In addition, the dense packing of germ cells in the mouse gonad further limits our ability to fully reconstruct all the cells in large cysts, with difficulty increasing as cyst size grows.</p>
<p>However, as noted, we added a well-resolved 10-cell cyst—the largest size we could confidently analyze—in a 3D video in Supplementary Figure S2H (lower panel), which shows a 6 + 4 breakage pattern.</p>

<p>(12) It would be best to stain WT control vs DazL KO oogonia in Figure 4a with 5mC antibodies to support their claim that DNA methylation might be affected in the mutants.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We respectfully disagree that this additional experiment is necessary within the scope of the current study. At the developmental stage examined (E12.5), germ cells in the Dazl mutant are clearly in an arrested and hypomethylated state, as supported by previous evidence (Haston et al. 2009).This initial experiments was designed to show that in our hands Dazl mutants show this known pkuripotency delay. However, the effects of Dazl mutation on female germline cyst development as it relates to polarity or the fusome was not studied before, and that is what the paper addresses, building on previous work.</p>
<p>Because our study does not focus on germ-cell epigenetic modifications but rather on the consequences of Dazl loss on germ cell cyst development, adding 5mC immunostaining would not substantially advance the main conclusions. The existing data and previous published work already provide sufficient background.</p>

<p>(13) Figure 4c: a very interesting figure, it would be best to quantify developmental pseudotime (perhaps using monocle3 analysis) and compare more rigorously the developmental stage of WT control vs DazL KO.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Developmental pseudotime, such as through Monocle3 analysis, might sometimes be valuable but involves assumptions that when possible are better addressed by direct experimental examination. Our conclusions regarding cyst developmental stage are supported by straightforward evidence rather to which computational trajectory inference would add little. Specifically, we have performed analysis of germ-cell methylation state, ring canal formation, pluripotency markers, UPR pathway activity assay (Xbp1 and Proteomic assay), Golgi-stress analysis and Pard3 which collectively document the developmental status of the WT and Dazl KO germ cells. These empirical data demonstrate the same developmental pattern reflected in Figure 4c, making the less reliable pseudotime-based computational method superfluous.</p>

<p>(20) The authors use WGA and EMA as interchangeable markers (Figure 5a) without fully explaining why they have switched markers.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Because it is germ cell specific, we used EMA as a fusome marker during the time when it is found up through E13.5.  After that point we used WGA which is still usable, but also labels somatic cells.  This rationale is explicitly described at the end of the section “Fusome is highly enriched in Golgi and vesicles”, where we state:</p>
<p>“EMA staining disappears from germ cells at E14.5 (Figure 1I). However, very similar (but non–germ-cell-specific) staining continued with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) at later stages (Figure 1G, G’; Figure S1G).”</p>
<p>To ensure this is fully clear to readers, we have now added an additional statement in the start of the text section discussing the figure 5:</p>

<p>(1) Line 93: Fig. 1B: DDX4 marks germ cells; do all the red and yellow cells in the NE inset originate from the same PGC? There are only 2 cells marked in yellow among the group of red cells. Is it a z-projection issue? Or do they come from different PGCs?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This experiment used vasa staining to identify all germ cells, which are produced by multiple PGCs. Green labeling is a lineage marker derived from a single PGC (due to the low frequency of tamoxifen-activated labeling). Consequently, the two yellow cells observed in the NE inset of Fig. 1B represent YFP-labeled germ cells (YFP + DDX4 double-positive) that have arisen from a single, lineage-traced PGC. This approach, introduced in 2013, is described in the Methods, and represents the field's single largest technical advance that has made it possible to analyze mouse germ cell development at single cell resolution.</p>
<p>To ensure clarity, we have added a brief explanatory note to the figure legend indicating that yellow cells represent the lineage-traced progeny of a single PGC, while the red staining marks all germ cells.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this problem. We have now more clearly described in the text that the female fusome increases in some cells with close attachments to other cells (future oocytes) and decreases in distant nurse cells.  It branches due to rosette formation..  In males, the fusome remains much like the initial EMA granules present in early germ cells, with only fine and difficult to see connections.  The quantification shown in Figures 1C and 1C′ was performed manually, based on the presence of either (i) fused, branched EMA-positive fusome structures or (ii) dispersed, punctate EMA granules. This assessment was carried out across multiple E13.5 male and female gonad samples to ensure robustness.  To facilitate independent evaluation, we have already provided supplementary videos S3B1 and S3B2, which display the EMA-stained E13.5 male and female gonads in three dimensions. These videos allow the structural differences to be examined more clearly than in static images.</p>
<p>In response to the reviewer’s request, we now additionally include the single-channel fusome image in Supplementary Figure S1E′. This presentation highlights the fusome signal alone and further clarifies the morphological differences underlying the quantification.</p>

<p>We have now performed quantification of DNMT3 staining, which is presented in Figure 4A. While the red intensity (DNMT3 or EMA) can appear to differ between images, this variation can result from biological differences between tissues or minor technical variability despite using consistent microscope settings. To account for this, we normalized the staining intensity using the somatic cell signal as an internal reference, ensuring that the quantification reflects genuine differences between WT and Dazl-/- samples rather than global intensity variation.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. While the current images are small, they can be examined in detail using zoom to visualize the structures clearly. As noted, EMA staining is not affected, (we agree) as cells are in arrested state. This arrested state creates stress on Golgi. The fragmentation of Gs28-labeled Golgi membranes is a classical indicator of Golgi stress, even though the fragmented membranes may remain functionally active. Our results show that Dazl deletion specifically affects Golgi in germ cells, while Golgi in neighboring somatic cells appears healthy. To quantify this effect, we have now included manual quantification of Golgi fragmentation in Figure 4F, assessing tissues for the presence of fragmented versus intact Golgi structures. This confirms that Golgi fragmentation is a germ cell–specific phenotype in Dazl– samples, while pre-formed EMA-positive fusomes remain unaffected but probably in arrested state.</p>

<p>(19) Finally: curiosity question: have the authors tried to use known markers of the Drosophila fusome in mice, such as Spectrin or other markers described in Lighthouse, Buszczak and Spradling, Dev Bio, 2008? And conversely, do EMA and WGA label the fusome in Drosophila?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, we and others used the most specific markers of the Drosophila fusome such alpha-spectrin, adducin-like Hts, tropomodulin, etc. to search for fusomes in vertebrate species. It was unsuccessful in clarifying the situation, because Hts and alpha-spectrin in Drosophila and other insects generate a protein skeleton that stabilizes the fusome and is easily stained. But this structure is simply not conserved in vertebrates. The polarity behavior of the fusome, it core developmental property, is conserved, however. The mammalian fusome still acquires and maintains cyst polarity, and goes even farther and reflects both initial cyst formation and cyst cleavage, before marking oocyte vs nurse cell development in the smaller cysts.  Expression of the inner microtubule-rich portion of the fusome, its Par proteins, and many ER-related and lysosomal fusome proteins are mostly conserved but their ability to mark the fusome alone varies with time and context (only some of the examples are shown in Figure 3I'). Nearly all of the proteins identified in Lighthouse et al. 2008 are expressed.  These proteins may be involved in rejuvenation as studied here.  We modified the first section of the Discussion to explicitly compare mouse, Xenopus and Drosophila fusomes, which was not possible before this work.</p>

<p>Research is showing that it's more complicated than that.  All cyst cells enter &quot;pre-meiotic S phase&quot;, and most cell cycles are conventionally considered to start after the previous M phase-</p>
<p>i.e. in G1 or S, not in the next prophase, an ancient view limited just to meiosis. Absent this old tradition from meiosis cytology, pre-meiotic S would just be called meiotic S as some workers on meiosis do.  In addition, in different species, nurse cells diverge from meiosis on different schedules, including many much later in the meiotic cycle.  Two cyst cells in Drosophila fully enter meiosis by all criteria, the oocyte and one nurse cell that only exits in late zygotene.  In Xenopus and mouse, scRNAseq shows that many cyst cells enter meiosis up to leptotene and zygotene, including nurse cells that specifically downregulate meiotic genes during this time, possibly to assist their nurse cell functions, while others remain in meiosis even longer (Davidian and Spradling, 2025; Niu and Spradling, 2022). Eventually, only the oocytes within each fragmented mouse cyst complete meiosis.</p>
