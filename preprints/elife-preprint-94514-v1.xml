<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Oligo-astheno-teratozoospermia (OAT), a recurent cause of male infertility, is the most frequent disorder of spermatogenesis with a probable genetic cause. Patients and mice bearing mutations in the <italic>ARMC2</italic> gene have a decreased sperm concentration, and individual sperm show multiple morphological defects and a lack of motility – a canonical OAT phenotype. Intra Cellular Sperm Injection (ICSI) is required to treat such a condition but it has limited efficacy and was associated with a small increase in birth defects. Consequently, new targeted treatments are needed to restore spermatogenesis. Here, a combination of <italic>in vivo</italic> injection and electroporation of capped and poly-A-tailed naked mRNA is tested as a strategy to treat <italic>ARMC2</italic>-related infertility in mouse. mRNAs coding for several reporter genes are tested and the efficiency and the kinetic of expression are assessed using <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> 2D and 3D imaging experiments. We show that mRNA-coded reporter proteins are detected for up to 3 weeks mostly in germ cells, making the use of mRNA possible to treat infertility. We compare these results with those obtained with a more conventional DNA plasmid vector. In contrast, the use of the non-integrative plasmid Enhanced Episomal Vector (EEV) shows low and transient expression in spermatogenic cells. Consequently, injection and electroporation of naked mRNA-<italic>Armc2</italic> into the testes of <italic>Armc2</italic>-deficient males were performed and we show the presence of normal and motile sperm in the epididymis. This study shows for the first time that mRNA-<italic>Armc2</italic> efficiently restores spermatogenesis and opens new paths for male infertility treatment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Worldwide, 10-15% of couples (or 70 million) face infertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Infertility is thus a major public health issue presenting significant medical, scientific and economic challenges (a multibillion € annual market) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. A significant proportion of infertility is due to altered gametogenesis, where the sperm and eggs produced are incompatible with fertilization and/or embryonic development. Approximately 40% of cases of infertility involve a male factor, either exclusively, or associated with a female deficiency.</p>
<p>Male gametogenesis, or spermatogenesis, is a highly complex physiological process which can be split into three successive steps: proliferation (mitosis of spermatogonia), reduction of the number of chromosomes (meiosis of spermatocytes), and spermatid differentiation (spermiogenesis). The whole process involves several thousands of genes, of which a large part are expressed almost exclusively in the testes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Because of this multiplicity of genes, spermatogenesis is strongly affected by genetic factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>], with most severe disorders likely to be of genetic origin.</p>
<p>For patients with severe infertility, only assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) – such as Intra Cytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) – can efficiently overcome the problems faced. However, there are some concerns surrounding the risks associated with this technique; statistical analyses of birth records has shown a real risk of birth defects associated with ICSI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. To overcome these drawbacks, a number of experimental strategies have been proposed to bypass ARTs and restore spermatogenesis, including gene therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Gene therapy consists of introducing a DNA sequence into the genome to compensate for a defective gene. It can thus rescue production of a missing protein, and is now widely applied both in research and for the treatment of human diseases. Given the genetic basis of male infertility, the first strategy tested to overcome spermatogenic failure associated with monogenic diseases was delivery of an intact gene to deficient germ cells. Gene therapy works efficiently in germ cells, and numerous publications have shown that conventional plasmids can be transferred into spermatogonia in several species with a high success rate, allowing their transcription in all cells of the germinal lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Most experiments were performed in mouse models, delivering DNA constructs into living mouse germ cells by testis electroporation after microinjection of a DNA-containing solution into the seminiferous tubules. Using this method, it was possible to rescue meiosis and fertility in mouse models of infertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. However, the genetic changes induced are transmitted to any descendants. Consequently, gene therapy cannot be used to treat infertility in humans, as for both ethical reasons and to avoid any eugenic deviations, transmissible changes are illegal in humans in most countries. Moreover, genetic modification of germ cell lines presents multiple biological risks, including that of inducing cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Gene therapies have thus raised both ethical controversy and long-term safety issues.</p>
<p>For these reasons, we decided to test an alternative strategy to DNA transfection based on the use of naked mRNA. Thanks to this small change, there should be no risk of genomic insertion, and thus there is no question of heritable alterations. The first part of this study presents a complete characterization of the protein expression patterns obtained following transfection of naked mRNA coding for reporter genes into the testes of mice.</p>
<p>Among infertility disorders, oligo-astheno-teratozoospermia (OAT) is the most frequent; it is likely to be of genetic origin. Spermatocytograms for OAT patients show a decrease in sperm concentration, multiple morphological defects and defective motility. Because of these combined defects, patients are infertile and can only conceive by ICSI. The aim of this work was 1/ to perform a full characterization of the efficiency of naked mRNA to express proteins, using reporter genes, and 2/ to apply the protocol to a preclinical mouse model of OAT. Patients and mice carrying mutations in the <italic>ARMC2</italic> gene present a canonical OAT phenotype and are completely infertile. The preclinical <italic>Armc2</italic> deficient (<italic>Armc2</italic> KO) mouse model is therefore a valuable model to assess whether <italic>in vivo</italic> injection of naked mRNA combined with electroporation can restore sperm spermatogenesis. We chose this model for several reasons: first, it is an easy model to implement. Armc2 KO mice are sterile and all sperm exhibit short, thick or coiled flagella [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. As a result, 100% of sperm are completely immobile, thus it should be easy to determine the efficacy of the technique by measuring sperm motility with a CASA system. Second, the Armc2 gene codes for an 867-amino acid protein and this large size represents a challenge for expression in the testis following electroporation.</p>
<p>To determine the efficacy of naked mRNA transfection as a method to achieve protein expression in the testes, we assessed the level of transcription of reporter proteins after mRNA injection compared to the injection of a non-integrating plasmid, the Enhanced Episomal Vector (EEV). EEV is a vector derived from Epstein-Barr virus, it includes an EBV Ori and the EBNA1 protein. It does not integrate or modify the host genome. Replication of this vector is synchronized with host cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>].</p>
<p>In the present in vivo work, we injected and electroporated three distinct mRNAs coding for the reporter proteins green fluorescent protein (GFP), luciferase (Luc) and mCherry, and an EEV episome vector containing the sequences coding for both GFP and luciferase reporter proteins. We first characterized and validated the method of injection via the rete testis followed by electroporation in adult males. Next, we compared the kinetics and patterns of expression of the electroporated mRNAs and EEV by several methods, including whole testis imaging, in vivo bioluminescence imaging and tissue clearing.</p>
<p>Then we used a preclinical mouse model of OAT to test the mRNA transfection protocol, with the aim of restoring fertility. Three- and 5-weeks after injection and electroporation of <italic>Armc2</italic>-mRNA into the testes of <italic>Armc2</italic> KO mice, we identified normal motile sperm cells in the epididymis.</p>

<title><italic>Armc2</italic>-mRNA</title>
<p><italic>Armc2</italic>-mRNA used for in vivo testes microinjection and electroporation was obtained from Trilink (San Diego, USA). The commercial <italic>Armc2-</italic>mRNA has an AG CleanCap, a poly A tail of 120 adenosines and 3 HA FLAG. The main challenge with mRNA-based therapies is mRNA stability. To improve mRNA stability in vivo and avoid its degradation by ribonucleases, optimization techniques were implemented. Thus, the used mRNA had codon optimization, a polyA tail and a CleanCap. To verify germ the efficiency of cell transfection, an <italic>EGFP-</italic>mRNA was injected together with the <italic>Armc2-</italic>mRNA. During the injection, the concentration of <italic>EGFP-</italic>mRNA and <italic>Armc2</italic>-mRNA were 300 ng µL<sup>-1</sup> each.</p>

<label>1.</label><title><italic>In vivo</italic> microinjection and electroporation of mouse testes</title>
<p>Two routes have been described for microinjection of DNA into the testes: direct injection through the <italic>tunica albuginea,</italic> or injection into the lumen of the seminiferous tubules via the <italic>rete testis</italic>. We chose the <italic>rete testis</italic> route and evaluated the efficacy of the microinjection protocol, in particular as we wished to better characterize the diffusion of the injected solution in the volume of the testis, as we were unable to find any information on this parameter in the literature. The efficacy of microinjection <italic>via rete testis</italic> was assessed using fluorescent i-particles NIRFiP-180, and by measuring their diffusion in testis cross sections examined by microscopy 3 days post-injection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). To avoid lesions due to overfilling, the injection was controlled by measuring the expansion of the staining of the peripheral seminiferous tubules during the injection. Injections were stopped when the testes were filled to 2/3 of their capacity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">fig 1</xref> A-B). In testis cross sections, the fluorescent i-particles NIRFiP-180 were heterogeneously distributed, and mainly observed in seminiferous tubules located in the peripheral region of the testes, with fewer particles present in the center of the testes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1 C-D</xref>). Moreover, no fluorescent i-particles NIRFiP-180 were visible in the peritubular space. These results indicated that microinjection through the <italic>rete testis</italic> did not produce a homogenous distribution of the particles throughout the seminiferous tubules. Nevertheless, the seminiferous tubules remained intact, as no signal was observed in the peritubular space (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C-D</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we assessed the overall safety of the <italic>rete testis</italic> microinjection and electroporation of mRNA and EEV into testes. The safety of the protocol was evaluated by comparing macroscopic and microscopic anatomies of control (injected with control solution, PBS, 0.05% FG), and treated testes (injected either with EEV-<italic>GFP</italic> (PBS, 0.05% FG) or <italic>GFP-</italic>mRNA (PBS, 0.05 % FG)). Three days post-injection, the testes were first observed under a binocular microscope to identify possible macroscopic degeneration of the seminiferous tubules (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>1 and 2B1). Degenerations appear as pearly white lesions at the surface of the testis as illustrated in <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig 1</xref> following over electroporation. With the protocol used, no such lesions were observed. Next, the testes were measured and weighted. No differences were observed between control and treated testes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> A2, A3, B2, B3), Then, microscopic differences were sought by histological analysis of 5-µm sections (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). No difference was observed between the control condition and EEV-<italic>GFP</italic> or <italic>GFP-</italic>mRNA on the full cross sections (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> C1, C2, C3). Next, we observed all the different testicular cells, including spermatogonia, spermatocytes, Sertoli cells, round spermatids and epidydimal sperm cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>1, D2, D3) in each condition. The layered structure of germ cells was respected in all cases. Analysis of the histological sections revealed no differences in the tubules area of the testes injected either with EEV-<italic>GFP</italic> or <italic>GFP-</italic>mRNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>). Finally, Harris-Shorr staining of the epididymal sperm cells showed no morphological defects (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that <italic>in vivo</italic> microinjection and electroporation of EEV or mRNA is safe.</p>

<p>After validating the injection method, we compared the kinetics of GFP expression for mRNA and EEV. To do so, we injected and electroporated one testis of129 adult B6D2 mice with EEV-<italic>GFP</italic> and of 65 mice with <italic>GFP-</italic>mRNA. At 0, 1, 7, 15, 21-, 28-, 35-42 and 49-days post-injection, the whole testes were observed under an inverted microscope. The exogenous fluorescence was directly visible at the surface of the testes when illuminated with light at the appropriate wavelength (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). These observations revealed no testicular lesions at any post-injection time (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>.A1-H1 and 4A1-F1). In addition, both <italic>GFP-</italic>mRNA and EEV-<italic>GFP</italic> induced GFP expression in the testes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>2-H2 and 4A2-F2). It is worth noting that both vectors induced GFP expression from the very first day. However, the durations of expression were different. For EEV, GFP fluorescence was still observable on day 42 for 100% of samples, and 56% of samples were positive on day 49, indicating that expression lasted around 1.5 months (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4G</xref>). In contrast, for mRNA, 100% of testes were labelled on day 21, but none showed any fluorescence on day 28 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4G</xref>). Thus, EEV transfection allowed a considerably longer duration of expression than mRNA. (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In addition to differences in duration of expression, the GFP expression patterns were clearly different: mRNA produced a large, diffuse pattern, highlighting the shape of the seminiferous tubules; EEV-<italic>GFP</italic> produced a punctiform pattern (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>.)

<label>3.</label><title>Kinetics of EEV and mRNA expression assessed by <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging</title>
<p>To further assess and compare the kinetics of expression of the two vectors, we expressed exogenous luciferase in the testis using EEV or mRNA and observed the level of luciferase by <italic>in vivo</italic> bioluminescence imaging. For EEV, we took advantage of the fact that the EEV plasmids contains the DNA sequence of the luciferase protein (CAGs-GFP-T2A-Luciferase) in addition to the DNA sequence of the GFP fluorescent protein (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig supp 2</xref>). For mRNA, we injected commercial naked <italic>luciferase</italic>-mRNA into the <italic>rete testis</italic> according to the same protocol as used for <italic>GFP-</italic>mRNA. For this set of experiments, we injected the EEV-<italic>GFP-Luc</italic> and <italic>luciferase-</italic>mRNA into the testes of 6 adult mice on day 0. Importantly, we injected a similar number of copies of mRNA and EEV. The testes were imaged <italic>in vivo</italic> to detect bioluminescence expression, on day 1 and weekly until disappearance of the signal, no more than 120 days post-injection (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). For EEV-<italic>GFP-Luciferase</italic>, the bioluminescence induced by transfection was detected from day 1. After a rapid decrease in signal intensity over the first 3 weeks, a weak but constant signal remained detectable for 3 months, then faded away (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> A1-A2). For <italic>Luciferase</italic>-mRNA, expression was also detected from day 1. The bioluminescence decreased gradually over 3 weeks, becoming undetectable thereafter (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>1-B2). These results are consistent with our previous results (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>) and confirm that EEV allows a longer expression of exogenous protein within the testis. Overall, our results indicated stronger expression for mRNA than for EEV, but with expression decreasing rapidly over-time, and almost no remaining signal after 3 weeks. In contrast, residual expression was detectable for several months with EEV.</p>

<label>4.</label><title>Assessing testicular and cellular <italic>GFP-</italic>mRNA expression using whole testicle optical clearing, light sheet microscopy, and 3D-microscopic reconstructions</title>
<p>To better characterize the spatial distribution of <italic>GFP-</italic>mRNA expression in the testis, we performed whole testicular optical clearing. On day 0, we injected and electroporated 6 testes with <italic>GFP-</italic>mRNA. On day 1, we harvested the testes, cleared them with a modified optical clearing protocol (see Methods). After complete clearing (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6 A</xref>), we observed the testes under a light sheet microscope and performed 3D reconstruction (video 1, 2 and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> BC). From this 3D reconstruction, we determined the volume of testis stained with GFP. The testis was sliced into 500 stacks, and the volume occupied by GFP staining was estimated by measuring the GFP-positive area in each stack and multiplying it by the thickness of the stack (10 µm). Measurements were possible only for the first 250 stacks due to optical problems with the last 250 stacks. To overcome this problem, and acquire information for the whole testis, the sample was turned by 180° and the measures repeated. A total GFP-stained surface of 0.51 mm<sup>3</sup> and 0.23 mm<sup>3</sup> was determined for face 1 and face 2, respectively. The corresponding total volume for the 250 stacks was measured as 60 mm<sup>3</sup>, therefore 0.81% and 0.24% of the testis volume was transfected for face 1 and face 2 respectively (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> BC).</p>

<label>5.</label><title>Assessing GFP cellular expression using whole testicle optical clearing and confocal microscopy</title>
<p>Because the GFP fluorescence patterns were different for the two nucleic vectors when observed under the inverted microscope (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>), we wondered whether the same cell types were targeted in both cases. To address this question, the whole optical cleared testes from EEV-<italic>GFP</italic> and <italic>GFP-</italic>mRNA-transfected mice were observed under a confocal microscope. The different cell types were identified based on their positions within the seminiferous tubule, their cellular shape and their nuclear morphology – revealed by nuclear staining. For instance, Sertoli cells have an oval to elongated nucleus and the cytoplasm presents a complex shape (“tombstone” pattern) along the basement membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Round spermatids have small, round and compact nuclei with a nucleole and are localized between the spermatocytes and elongated spermatids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. For EEV-<italic>GFP</italic>, on day 1 post injection and electroporation, a strong punctiform green fluorescence was visible inside the seminiferous tubules (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7 A</xref>). Based on the different morphological criteria, this fluorescent signal was detected in spermatocytes, round spermatids and Sertoli cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref> BC). On day 7, the GFP signal induced by EEV<italic>-GFP</italic> was reduced and only isolated signals in a few seminiferous tubules (1 per 11 tubules) were observed (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7 D</xref>). These signals were associated only with Sertoli cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7 E</xref>).</p>

<p>Heterologous expression is well known to depend on the protein studied, we therefore tested the same reporter proteins to compare the mRNA and EEV vectors in the experiments presented above. Apart from the bioluminescence experiments with luciferase, we compared only GFP protein expression. To validate and confirm the capacity of naked mRNA to safely express proteins in the testes after injection and electroporation, we further challenged the method with another reporter protein – mCherry. We injected homemade naked mRNA coding for mCherry into the testes (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig supp 2BC</xref>). As previously with <italic>GFP-</italic> mRNA, no testicular lesions were observed (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig supp 3</xref> A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, F1). Assessment of the remanence of testicular expression of the mCherry fluorescent protein on days 0, 1, 7, 15, 21 and 28 post-injections revealed a strong red fluorescence from day 1 that remained detectable 15 days post-injection (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig supp3</xref> B2, C2 and D2).

<p>Before attempting to rescue expression, we felt it was important to better characterize Armc2 expression in healthy germ cells, and in particular to study the timing of expression. By IF, we determined when ARMC2 protein translation started during spermatogenesis. For these experiments, dissociated cells from testes were observed to detect the presence of ARMC2 on different spermatogenic cells. ARMC2 was present only in the flagellum of elongated spermatids (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig 9A</xref>). The specificity of the signal was validated using testicular cells from Armc2 KO mice, where no signal was observed on all spermatogenic cells (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig 9B</xref>). In WT cells, no evidence of ARMC2 was found in earlier germ cell types like spermatogonia or spermatocytes (data not shown).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The challenge of treating male infertility remains to be addressed. Current assisted reproduction techniques (ARTs) are unable to treat all patients, and alternative strategies need to be developed to meet the legitimate desire to be a father. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of naked mRNA as a means to induce expression of exogenous proteins in male germ cells in a preclinical adult mouse model. Based on previous studies using electroporation, we investigated whether the combination of the injection of naked mRNA and in <italic>vivo</italic> electroporation could lead to efficient protein expression in spermatogenic cells. We chose to first study the efficiency of capped and poly-A-tailed mRNA coding for reporter proteins and compared results to those obtained with a non-integrative enhanced episomal vector plasmid. No EEV plasmid has ever been tested in the context of infertility treatment before this study.</p>
<p>Using an adult mouse model, we optimized the micro-injection and electroporation method described by Michaelis et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. We show that the microinjection through the <italic>rete testis</italic> did not provide a homogenous distribution of the particles throughout the seminiferous tubules. Nevertheless, the seminiferous tubules remained intact, with no signal detected in the peritubular space. The peripheral expression observed was not due to the close vicinity of cells to the electrodes, but rather to a peripheral dispersal of the injected solution, as shown by the distribution of the fluorescent i-particles NIRFiP-180. Our results also showed that the combination of injection and electroporation is safe when electric pulses are carefully controlled. Using such a protocol, we were able to induce the expression of 3 reporter proteins, GFP, mCherry and luciferase in the testis by mRNA injection/electroporation. Based on whole testes fluorescence and, for the first time, <italic>in vivo</italic> bioluminescence imaging of testes, we characterized the kinetics of mRNA expression. Expression was observed to decrease rapidly after electroporation, with the total duration ranging from 15 to 21 days, depending on the molecule being expressed. Using whole testicular optical clearing, the reporter proteins were synthetized from the injected mRNA in Sertoli cells, spermatogonia, spermatocytes, round spermatids, and spermatozoa from day 1, and were still detectable after 1 week.</p>
<p>When using the EEV vector, expression persisted for longer – up to 119 days – but with a lower yield of seminiferous tubule and cellular transfection. In particular, a lower level of transfection of germ cells was observed than with the mRNA, and after 1 week, only Sertoli cells remained transfected.</p>
<p>These results suggest that although EEV expression lasted longer, mRNAs, by targeting more efficiently male germ cells and allowing higher transfection yields of seminiferous tubules, could be a more effective and potent tool to express exogenous proteins in germ cells. By expressing a missing protein in the case of male infertility due to monogenic causes, it could be possible to restore failed spermatogenesis and thus to treat infertility.</p>

<title>ARMC2 is expressed in late spermatogenesis stages</title>
<p>Dissociated WT testicular cells contained ARMC2 in the flagellum of spermatids. No <italic>Armc2</italic> expression was detected in earlier germ cell type lineages like spermatogonia. These results suggest that the ARMC2 protein is expressed late during spermatogenesis, which explains why motile sperm were only found in the cauda epididymis from 3 weeks after injection in our treated mice. Indeed, full spermiogenesis (from round cell to sperm) takes around 15 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], and the journey across the epididymis lasts around 8 days, making a total of 3 weeks. Our results also confirm those recently published by Lechtreck et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] from their study of the role of ARMC2 in the Intra-Flagellar Transport (IFT) of radial spokes in <italic>Chlamydomonas.</italic> Proteins are supplied to the flagellum by IFT trains, with some proteins binding directly to IFT train subcomplexes. This is the case, for example, for tubulin, which binds to the N-terminal domains of the central IFT-B proteins IFT74 and IFT81 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. In other cases, protein binding is mediated by adapters. For example, the placement of the Outer Dynein Arms (ODA) requires an adapter protein ODA16 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Lechtreck et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] suggested that the transport of the radial spokes along the flagellum involves ARMC2 acting as an IFT adapter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. The presence of ARMC2 in the flagella of elongating spermatid supports this hypothesis.</p>

<title>Exogenous <italic>Armc2</italic>-mRNA expression rescued the motility of oligo-astheno-teratozoospermic sperm</title>
<p>This is the first demonstration that proteins can be expressed in the testis following electroporation with capped and poly-A-tailed mRNA.</p>
<p>Our objective was to develop a new targeted therapeutic approach for infertility associated with monogenic defects. In this preclinical study, we tested the ability of mRNA to restore flagellar motility in a mouse model deficient for <italic>Armc2</italic> that displays an oligo-astheno-teratozoospermia .</p>
<p>Our results strongly suggest that the strategy is safe, as injection and electroporation of <italic>Armc2</italic>-mRNA or EEV-<italic>Armc2</italic> had no effect on testicular morphology or weight. More importantly, the technique was effective, with motile sperm cells found in <italic>Armc2</italic> KO epidydimal cauda 3 and 5 weeks after <italic>Armc2</italic>-mRNA injection. Naked mRNA injection/electroporation is therefore a promising method to treat infertility. In contrast, no motile spermatozoa were found after injection/electroporation of EEV-<italic>Armc2</italic>, confirming our previous results suggesting that this nucleic tool does not efficiently enter or transfect germ cells.</p>
<p>The method deployed here involved optimized, capped mRNA adapted for the expression of <italic>Armc2</italic>. The vector was injected via the rete testis into adult <italic>Armc2</italic> KO mice. The testes were then electroporated. The results obtained showed that the injected and electroporated testes had a morphology and weight similar to the controls at all times after treatment, thus validating the safety of the method in this preclinical model of male infertility.</p>
<p>Although motile sperm cells were observed at 3- and 5-weeks after <italic>Armc2</italic>-mRNA injection into the epidydimal cauda of <italic>Armc2</italic> KO mice, not all injected mice were efficiently treated. For instance, in a group of 5 mice littermates treated and euthanized at the same time (5 weeks post-injection), only 3 of the 5 had motile sperm cells. The absence of motile sperm at 5 weeks may be due to the type of spermatogenic cells transfected during the electroporation step. The transfected cells may differ between individuals, influenced by the injection and the position of the electrodes during electroporation. If the mRNA transfection takes place in a spermatogonia, it will take more than 6 weeks (including the time to cross the epididymis) before motile epididymal sperm cells emerge. This timeline could explain the absence of motile sperm in some littermates at 5 weeks.</p>
<p>Although we rescued the motility of oligo-astheno-teratozoospermic sperm, the transfection rate needs to be improved to obtain larger numbers of sperm cells. Indeed, our experiments did not provide enough motile sperm cells to carry out IVF or to allow natural mating. This low proportion could be explained by the mode of cell transfection. Nevertheless, ICSI with normal sperm could be implemented, increasing the overall safety of the technique.</p>

<title>Naked mRNA, a new therapeutic strategy to treat severe infertility</title>
<p>Non-obstructive Azoospermia (NOA) and severe oligozoospermia (SO) are the most severe disorders of spermatogenesis and are the most likely to be of genetic origin. NOA is defined by the complete absence of spermatozoa in the ejaculate. Approximately 10–15% of infertile men have azoospermia, and a further 15% have SO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. For patients with NOA, few clinical solutions are currently available. Generally, testicular sperm extraction is attempted to collect some spermatozoa from the seminiferous tubules, which can then be used for ICSI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. When no sperm are retrieved, intra-conjugal conception is impossible. Our results could also be applied to treat NOA, even if synthesis of the target protein does not persist throughout the whole spermatogenesis cycle. Indeed, it has been shown that spermatogenic proteins have a very low turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>] because synthesized proteins are stored in sperm organelles which remain stable until fertilization. Consequently, fertility rescue can probably be achieved even for proteins expressed earlier and involved in meiosis. Moreover, the presence of a few sperm in the ejaculate could be sufficient to obtain pups because with ICSI, only one sperm is required per oocyte. In other words, the persistent expression is not mandatory to treat infertility.</p>
<p>We used in this report electroporation to transfect the testicular cells. Although we injected 2/3 of the testes, the transfection is limited by the size of the electrodes which produce a restricted electric field. To increase the testicular transfection rate, encapsulation of mRNA into lipids nanoparticles could be used, as used for Covid vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. During the writing of this manuscript, Dong team [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>], used a self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) encapsulated in cholesterol-amino-phosphate derived lipid nanoparticle to restore spermatogenesis in infertile mice. They successfully restore the expression of the DNA Meiotic Recombinase 1 (DMC1) in <italic>Dmc1</italic> KO infertile mice by injecting a self-amplifying RNA-<italic>Dmc1</italic> in the testes. Dmc1 is 37 KDa protein implicated in the meiotic recombination during sperm meiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Although this impressive article reported successful treatment of mouse infertility, a safety study should be carried out to validate such a method. Indeed, saRNA are genetically engineered replicons derived from self-replicating single-stranded RNA viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. They can be delivered encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles, or as a completely synthetic saRNA produced after the <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription. The saRNA contains the alphavirus replicase genes and encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) complex which amplifies synthetic transcripts in situ and the target RNA sequence. The target RNA is expressed at high levels as a separate entity. As a result of their self-replicative activity, saRNAs can be delivered at lower concentrations than conventional mRNA to achieve comparable expression levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Moreover, saRNA constructs need to be condensed by a cationic carrier into a nanoparticle measuring ∼100 nm to enable their uptake into target cells and protect the saRNA from degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Finally, saRNA will amplify the RNA without cellular regulation. For all these reasons, if such a strategy is to be pursued, a potential toxicity effect due to saRNA over expression must be investigated in the testes and progeny. Another difficulty with saRNA relates to the size of the molecular construct. saRNA sequences are large and complex. The length of the sequence RdRP is around 7 kilobases, which often makes the full length of saRNA more than 9 kilobases once the sequence for the protein of interest has been integrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Dong et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>] successfully used their saRNA construct to rescue spermatogenesis failure induced by the absence of the small protein Dmc1, but it may be more challenging with larger proteins such as the structural proteins involved in OAT, including the 98-kDa ARMC2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Our next step will be to assess whether encapsulating <italic>Armc2</italic>-mRNA in LNP-CAP could allow a larger number of germ cells to be transfected.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this paper presents the first <italic>in vivo</italic> testicular injection and electroporation of capped and poly A tailed mRNA, demonstrating that it is an efficient strategy to transfect male germ cells and that the duration of expression of the resulting proteins is compatible with restoring spermatogenesis. Our comprehensive study revealed mRNA to be more efficient than an episomal vector, despite longer-lived expression in male germ cells with EEV. The difference was linked to EEV achieving a lower rate of seminiferous tubule transfection and a shorter duration of expression in germ cells. Our results also showed for the first time that functional sperm motility can be restored in mice with an oligo-astheno-teratozoospermia phenotype using a technique combining injection and electroporation of capped and poly-A-tailed mRNA. The findings presented open new opportunities to develop efficient strategies to treat male infertility with monogenic causes.</p>

<p>The authors assess the effectiveness of electroporating mRNA into male germ cells to rescue the expression of proteins required for spermatogenesis progression in individuals where these proteins are mutated or depleted. To set up the methodology, they first evaluated the expression of reporter proteins in wild-type mice, which showed expression in germ cells for over two weeks. Then, they attempted to recover fertility in a model of late spermatogenesis arrest that produces immotile sperm. By electroporating the mutated protein, the authors recovered the motility of ~5% of the sperm, although the sperm regenerated was not able to produce offspring using IVF.</p>
<p>This is a comprehensive evaluation of the mRNA methodology with multiple strengths. First, the authors show that naked synthetic RNA, purchased from a commercial source or generated in the laboratory with simple methods, is enough to express exogenous proteins in testicular germ cells. The authors compared RNA to DNA electroporation and found that germ cells are efficiently electroporated with RNA, but not DNA. The differences between these constructs were evaluated using in vivo imaging to track the reporter signal in individual animals through time. To understand how the reporter proteins affect the results of the experiments, the authors used different reporters: two fluorescent (eGFP and mCherry) and one bioluminescent (Luciferase). Although they observed differences among reporters, in every case expression lasted for at least two weeks.</p>
<p>The authors used a relevant system to study the therapeutic potential of RNA electroporation. The ARMC2-deficient animals have impaired sperm motility phenotype that affects only the later stages of spermatogenesis. The authors showed that sperm motility was recovered to ~5%, which is remarkable due to the small fraction of germ cells electroporated with RNA with the current protocol. The 3D reconstruction of an electroporated testis using state-of-the-art methods to show the electroporated regions is compelling.</p>
<p>The main weakness of the manuscript is that although the authors manage to recover motility in a small fraction of the sperm population, it is unclear whether the increased sperm quality is substantial to improve assisted reproduction outcomes. The quality of the sperm was not systematically evaluated in the manuscript, with the endpoints being sperm morphology and sperm mobility.</p>
<p>Some key results, such as the 3D reconstruction of the testis and the recovery of sperm motility, are qualitative given the low replicate numbers or the small magnitude of the effects. The presentation of the sperm motility data could have been clearer as well. For example, on day 21 after Armc2-mRNA electroporation, only one animal out of the three tested showed increased sperm motility. However, it is unclear from Figure 11A what the percentage of sperm motility for this animal is since the graph shows a value of &gt;5% and the reported aggregate motility is 4.5%. It would have been helpful to show all individual data points in Figure 11A.</p>
<p>The expression of the reporter genes is unambiguous; however, better figures could have been presented to show cell type specificity. The DAPI staining is diffused, and it is challenging to understand where the basement membranes of the tubules are. For example, in Figures 7B3 and 7E3, the spermatogonia seems to be in the middle of the seminiferous tubule. The imaging was better for Figure 8. Suboptimal staining appears to lead to mislabeling of some germ cell populations. For example, in Supplementary Figure 4A3, the round spermatid label appears to be labeling spermatocytes. Also, in some instances, the authors seem to be confusing, elongating spermatids with spermatozoa, such as in the case of Supplementary Figures 4D3 and D4.</p>
<p>The characterization of Armc2 expression could have been improved as well. The authors show a convincing expression of ARMC2 in a few spermatids/sperm using a combination of an anti-ARMC2 antibody and tubules derived from ARMC2 KO animals. At the minimum, one would have liked to see at least one whole tubule of a relevant stage.</p>
<p>Overall, the authors show that electroporating mRNA can improve spermatogenesis as demonstrated by the generation of motile sperm in the ARMC2 KO mouse model.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Here, the authors inject naked mRNAs and plasmids into the rete testes of mice to express exogenous proteins - GFP and later ARMC2. This approach has been taken before, as noted in the Discussion to rescue Dmc1 KO infertility. While the concept is exciting, multiple concerns reduce reviewer enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The approach, while not necessarily novel, is timely and interesting.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Overall, the writing and text can be improved and standardized - as an example, in some places in vivo is italicized, in others it's not; gene names are italicized in some places, others not; some places have spaces between a number and the units, others not. This lack of attention to detail in the preparation of the manuscript is a significant concern to this reviewer - the presentation of the experimental details does cast some reasonable concern with how the experiments might have been done. While this may be unfair, it is all the reviewers have to judge. Multiple typographical and grammatical errors are present, and vague or misleading statements.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors used a novel technique to treat male infertility. In a proof-of-concept study, the authors were able to rescue the phenotype of a knockout mouse model with immotile sperm using this technique. This could also be a promising treatment option for infertile men.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>In their proof-of-concept study, the authors were able to show that the novel technique rescues the infertility phenotype in vivo.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Some minor weaknesses, especially in the discussion section, could be addressed to further improve the quality of the manuscript.</p>
<p>It is very convincing that the phenotype of Armc2 KO mice could (at least in part) be rescued by injection of Armc2 RNA. However, a central question remains about which testicular cell types have been targeted by the constructs. From the pictures presented in Figures 7 and 8, this issue is hard to assess. Given the more punctate staining of the DNA construct a targeting of Sertoli cells is more likely, whereas the more broader staining of seminiferous tubules using RNA constructs is talking toward germ cells.</p>
<p>Further, the staining for up to 119 days (Figure 5) would point toward an integration of the DNA construct into the genome of early germ cells such as spermatogonia and/or possibly to Sertoli cells. Given the expression after RNA transfection for up to 21 days (Figure 4) and the detection of motile sperm after 21 days (Figure 11), this would point to either round spermatids or spermatocytes.</p>
<p>These aspects need to be discussed more carefully (discussion section: lines 549-574).</p>
<p>It would also be very interesting to know in which testicular cell type Armc2 is endogenously expressed (lines 575-591).</p>
