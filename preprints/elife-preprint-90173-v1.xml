<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The Zanzibar archipelago of Tanzania has become a low-transmission area for <italic>Plasmodium falciparum.</italic> Despite being considered an area of pre-elimination for years, achieving elimination has been difficult, likely due to a combination of imported infections from mainland Tanzania, and continued local transmission. To shed light on these sources of transmission, we applied highly multiplexed genotyping utilizing molecular inversion probes to characterize the genetic relatedness of 391 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> isolates collected across Zanzibar and in Bagamoyo District on the coastal mainland from 2016-2018. Overall, parasite populations on the coastal mainland and Zanzibar archipelago remain highly related. However, parasite isolates from Zanzibar exhibit population microstructure due to rapid decay of parasite relatedness over very short distances. This, along with highly related pairs within <italic>shehias</italic>, suggests ongoing low level local transmission. We also identified highly related parasites across <italic>shehias</italic> that reflect human mobility on the main island of Unguja and identified a cluster of highly related parasites, suggestive of an outbreak, in the Micheweni district on Pemba island. Parasites in asymptomatic infections demonstrated higher complexity of infection than those in symptomatic infections, but have similar core genomes. Our data support that importation remains a main source of genetic diversity and contribution to the parasite population on Zanzibar, but they also show local outbreak clusters where targeted interventions are essential to block local transmission. These results highlight the need for preventive measures against imported malaria and enhanced control measures in areas that remain receptive for malaria reemergence due to susceptible hosts and competent vectors.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Malaria cases in Tanzania comprise 3% of globally reported cases, but transmission is heterogeneous, with the coastal mainland witnessing declining but substantial transmission of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alegana et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">World Health Organization, 2022</xref>). On the other hand, the archipelago of Zanzibar is a pre-elimination setting, with low level seasonal transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Björkman et al., 2019</xref>). This is largely due to the routine implementation of a combination of effective control measures, including robust vector control and routine access to effective antimalarials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Björkman et al., 2019</xref>). Despite these efforts, malaria has been difficult to eliminate from the archipelago. There are several reasons this may be the case: (1) frequent importation of malaria from moderate or high transmission regions of mainland Tanzania and Kenya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Björkman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Le Menach et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Lipner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Monroe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Morgan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tatem et al., 2009</xref>); (2) ongoing local transmission due to residual vector capacity despite strong vector control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Björkman et al., 2019</xref>); and (3) a reservoir of asymptomatic infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Björkman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Björkman &amp; Morris, 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Parasite genomics has the potential to help us better understand malaria epidemiology by uncovering population structure and gene flow, providing insight into changes in the parasite population including how parasites move between regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Neafsey et al., 2021</xref>). Genomics has previously been used to study importation and transmission chains in other low transmission settings in Africa and elsewhere (H. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Morgan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Moser et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Patel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Roh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Sane et al., 2019</xref>). Previously, we had investigated the importation of malaria into Zanzibar from the mainland using whole genome sequencing, showing highly similar populations within the mainland and within the archipelago, but also identifying highly related parasite pairs between locations suggesting a role for importation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Morgan et al., 2020</xref>). However, this work lacked sufficient samples to assess transmission of parasites within Zanzibar. The larger and spatially rich sample set analyzed in this manuscript offers an opportunity for more refined analyses of transmission across Zanzibar and how parasites are related to those from coastal mainland.</p>
<p>A panel of molecular inversion probes (MIPs), a highly multiplexed genotyping assay, were designed in a previous study to target single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) throughout the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aydemir et al., 2018</xref>). We leveraged this assay to investigate the genetic epidemiology of parasites in the coastal mainland and Zanzibar utilizing 391 samples collected from cross-sectional surveys of both asymptomatic infections and symptomatic, uncomplicated malaria cases during 2016-2018. Specifically, we use identity by descent analyses to compare the genetic relatedness of mainland and Zanzibari parasites, and to investigate the geography/spatial relationships of genetically related parasites on the archipelago. We further characterize how the genetic complexity of infections differ by clinical status and describe patterns of antimalarial drug resistance polymorphisms in the parasite populations. In this low transmission setting, these analyses characterize fine-scale local parasite populations that contribute to continued transmission within the region, highlighting a key barrier to malaria elimination in the Zanzibar archipelago.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Samples from coastal Tanzania (178) and Zanzibar (213) were previously sequenced through multiple studies (<bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, Supplemental Figure 1</bold>). These samples include 213 dried blood spots (DBS) collected in Zanzibar between February 2016 and September 2017, coming from cross-sectional surveys of asymptomatic individuals (<italic>n</italic> = 70) and an <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy study of artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) with single low dose primaquine (SLDP) in pediatric uncomplicated malaria patients in the western and central districts of Unguja island and Micheweni District on Pemba island (<italic>n</italic> = 143) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Msellem et al., 2020</xref>). These samples were geolocalized to shehias, the lowest geographic governmental designation of land in Zanzibar, across its two main islands, Unguja and the northern region of Pemba (<bold>Supplemental Figure 1</bold>). Mainland Tanzania samples were collected in rural Bagamoyo District, where malaria transmission persists, and residents frequently travel to Dar es Salaam, the major port from where travelers depart for Zanzibar. Of the mainland Bagamoyo samples, 138 were whole blood collected from 2015-2017 as part of an <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy study of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) in pediatric uncomplicated malaria patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Topazian et al., 2022</xref>), and the remaining 40 samples were leukodepleted blood collected in 2018 from asymptomatic but RDT-positive children who participated in a study investigating the transmission of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> to colony reared mosquitos. This project leveraged molecular inversion probe (MIP) data from SRA including PRJNA926345, PRJNA454490, PRJNA545345, and PRJNA545347.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>In order to place coastal Tanzanian and Zanzibari samples in the context of African <italic>P. falciparum</italic> population structure across multiple regions, MIP data from 147 whole blood samples collected in Ahero District, Kenya from the same parasite clearance study were used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Topazian et al., 2022</xref>) in conjunction with a subset of data from 2,537 samples genotyped for a study of the 2013 Demographic Health Survey of the Democratic Republic of the Congo which included samples from DRC, Ghana, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Verity et al., 2020</xref>) (see <bold>Supplemental Figure 2</bold>).</p>

<title>Molecular Inversion Probe (MIP) Sequencing</title>
<p>Sequence data for the coastal Tanzanian and Zanzibari samples were generated in a similar fashion across studies. Chelex extracted DNA from DBS and Qiagen Miniprep (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) extracted DNA from leukodepleted blood were used in MIP captures, which were then sequenced as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aydemir et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Verity et al., 2020</xref>). Control mixtures of 4 strains of genomic DNA from <italic>P. falciparum</italic> laboratory lines were also sequenced as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Verity et al., 2020</xref>). We utilized two MIP panels, one being a genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) MIP panel and the second being a panel with the known drug resistance markers in <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Verity et al., 2020</xref>). These libraries were sequenced on Illumina Nextseq 500 instrument using 150lJbp paired end sequencing with dual indexing using Nextseq 500/550 Mid-output Kit v2.</p>

<p>MIP sequencing data was processed using <italic>MIPTools</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/bailey-lab/MIPTools">https://github.com/bailey-lab/MIPTools</ext-link>), which first merges reads and removes errors and Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) redundancy with <italic>MIPWrangler</italic> (Aydemir, unpublished). For the genome-wide panel, variant calling was performed using <italic>FreeBayes</italic> within <italic>MIPTools</italic>, for a pooled continuous sample that was filtered for a minimum UMI depth of 10, a within sample allele frequency threshold of 0.01 and a minimum alternate read count of 2 to obtain 5174 variant SNP sites. Utilizing <italic>bcftools</italic> (version 1.15.1), the samples and loci were filtered to only the known targeted SNPs, requiring a minor allele frequency threshold of 0.01, a sample missingness threshold of 10% and loci missingness threshold of 15%. After filtering and subsetting to biallelic sites, 282 samples were left at 1270 loci. The final numbers of samples used for analysis by group are shown in <bold>Supplemental Table 1</bold>. Sequencing coverage estimates for loci are shown in <bold>Supplemental Figure 3</bold>.</p>
<p>For the drug resistance panel, variant calling was performed as above, with additional <italic>FreeBayes</italic> parameters of a haplotype length of 3 and using the 30 best alleles at a given locus. Three aggregate amino acid summary tables were created with reference amino acid UMI counts, alternate amino acid UMI counts and the coverage depth for each variant, for a total of 309 samples at 2265 SNPs. We focused analysis on the following key known and putative drug resistance molecular marker genes and corresponding mutations: <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<italic>Pf</italic>) chloroquine resistance transporter (Pfcrt: C72S, M74I, N75E, K76T, T93S, H97Y, F145I, I218F, A220S, Q271E, N326S, M343L, C350R, G353V, I356T, R371I<italic>), Pf</italic> multidrug resistance 1 (Pfmdr1: N86Y, Y184F, S1034C, N1042D, D1246Y), <italic>Pf</italic> dihydrofolate reductase (Pfdhfr: A16V, N51I, C59R, S108N, I164L), <italic>Pf</italic> dihydropteroate synthase (Pfdhps: S436A, S436F, A437G, K540E, A581G, A613T, A613S), <italic>Pf cytochrome b</italic> (Pfcytb: Y268N,Y268S,Y268C) and <italic>Pf</italic> kelch 13 (Pfk13: P441L, F446I, G449A, N458Y, C469F, C469Y, M476I, A481V, Y493H, R515K, P527H, N537I, N537D, G538V, R539T, I543T, P553L, R561H, V568G, P574L, C580Y, R622I, A675V) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">World Health Organization, 2020</xref>).

<title>Analysis of Population Relatedness and Structure</title>
<p>To investigate genetic relatedness of parasites across regions, identity by descent (IBD) estimates were assessed using the within sample major alleles and estimated utilizing a maximum likelihood approach using the <italic>inbreeding_mle</italic> function from the <italic>MIPanalyzer</italic> package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Verity et al., 2020</xref>). Next, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed to query the comparative genetic variation of the samples through utilizing the genome-wide SNP panel. We pruned 51 samples that had a pairwise IBD of greater than 0.90 to one randomly selected sample as a representative of the clonal population to avoid clonal structure from dominating the analysis. Within-sample allele frequencies were calculated, with an imputation step replacing missing values with the median per each locus, and PCA was performed using the <italic>prcomp</italic> function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Verity et al., 2020</xref>) (<italic>R</italic> version 4.2.1).</p>
<p>To include geographic information with querying genetic variation, Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC) analysis was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Jombart, 2008</xref>). Pseudohaplotypes were created by pruning the genotype calls at all loci for each sample into a single haplotype, and redundant haplotypes were removed (282 reduced to 272 with unique pseudohaplotypes). DAPC was conducted at the district level, and samples from districts with less than five samples (272 samples to 270 samples in 6 districts) were retained (<bold>Supplemental Figure 4B</bold>). For the main DAPC analysis (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>), highly related isolates were pruned to a single representative infection (272 reduced to 232) and then included districts with at least 5 samples (232 reduced to 228 samples in 5 districts).

<title>Zanzibari falciparum parasites were closely related to coastal mainland parasites but showed higher within than between population IBD and evidence of microstructure on the archipelago</title>
<p>To examine geographic relatedness, we first used principal component analysis (PCA). Zanzibari parasites are highly related to other parasites from East Africa and more distantly related to Central and West African isolates (<bold>Supplemental Figure 2</bold>).

<p>However, after performing K-means clustering of <italic>shehias</italic> in Zanzibar and mainland Tanzania, parasites within each population show more highly related pairs within their respective clusters than between clusters (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref></bold>). Comparisons of parasite pairs between Zanzibar and coastal Tanzania showed no pairs with an IBD greater than 0.20 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, Supplemental Figure 8</bold>).

<p>To further assess the differentiation within the parasite population in Zanzibar, we conducted Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC) according to the districts of origin for each isolate. Parasites differentiated geographically, with less variation near the port of Zanzibar town and more differentiation in isolates collected in districts further from the port (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>). This underlying microstructure is also supported by classic isolation by distance analysis (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, Supplemental Figure 10</bold>). Isolation by distance analysis across all of Zanzibar and within Unguja showed rapid decay of relatedness over very short geographic distances (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref></bold>).

<title>Within Zanzibar, parasite clones are shared within and between shehias suggesting local outbreaks</title>
<p>Among the sample pairs in Zanzibar that are highly related (IBD of 0.25 or greater), we see different patterns of genetic relatedness suggesting common local and short distance transmission of clones and occasional long distance transmission (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></bold>). In Unguja (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold>), we see multiple identical or near identical parasite pairs shared over longer distances, suggesting longer distance gene flow, as well as multiple <italic>shehias</italic> containing highly related pairs. In Northern Pemba, there is one large cluster of highly related parasites shared within and between six <italic>shehias</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>). Network analysis (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></bold>) for all sample pairs with an IBD of greater than 0.25 from these <italic>shehias</italic> illustrates this, with pairs linked by yellow lines showing the highest IBD. The largest network represents two highly related clusters (groups linked by yellow edges, mean IBD of 0.99) connected by a highly related intermediate (FMH42), suggesting that the clusters are related though parasites that have recombined while on the archipelago. FMH42 links the lower cluster with pairwise IBD of 0.65 and the upper cluster with a pairwise IBD of 0.27. These symptomatic isolates collected from February 2016 to September 2017 in northern Pemba likely derive from sustained transmission from a seeding event.</p>

<title>Compared to symptomatic infections, asymptomatic infections demonstrate greater genetic complexity, especially in coastal Tanzania</title>
<p>Asymptomatic infections were compared to roughly contemporaneously collected isolates from those presenting with acute, uncomplicated malaria.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we leverage high-throughput targeted sequencing using molecular inversion probes (MIPs) to characterize the populations and the relationships of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> isolates in Zanzibar and coastal mainland Tanzania. The parasite populations appear to be highly related to each other (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>) when evaluated using SNPs in the core genome. Interestingly, within Zanzibar, structure could be observed, with parasites closer to the main ferry terminal in Zanzibar town clustered more closely with coastal mainland parasites (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, Supplemental Figure 1</bold>) compared to parasites that were more geographically distant. This, in combination with the evidence of rapid decline of genetic relatedness with distance on the archipelago (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref></bold>), is consistent with population microstructure within the island chain. This microstructure within the archipelago is supported by K-means clustering where Zanzibari isolates show higher within cluster than between cluster IBD (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref></bold>). It is also consistent with isolates with higher IBD (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A and B</xref></bold>) in Unguja and Pemba compared to a maximum IBD of 0.20 between Zanzibar and coastal mainland Tanzania (<bold>Supplemental Figure 8</bold>) or between Unguja and Pemba (<bold>Supplemental Figure 9</bold>). Parasite populations within the very low transmission region of Zanzibar may be more isolated than expected, allowing them to differentiate from each other. This may be indicative of very effective local malaria control, yet with continued micro-transmission remaining. Thus, directly targeting local malaria transmission, including the asymptomatic reservoir which contributes to sustained transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barry et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Sumner et al., 2021</xref>), may be an important focus for ultimately achieving malaria control in the archipelago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Björkman &amp; Morris, 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the overall genetic similarity between archipelago populations, we did not find parasite pairs with high levels of IBD between the coastal mainland and Zanzibar, with the highest being 0.20. While this level still represents a significant amount of genetic sharing, similar to a cousin, the lack of higher levels does not allow us to identify specific importation events. This is largely due to the study design, which is based on convenience sampling, the relatively low numbers of samples and lack of sampling from all mainland travel hubs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bisanzio et al., 2023</xref>). Sampling was also denser in Unguja compared to Pemba. On the other hand, we see clear transmission of highly related parasites within each population (IBD &gt; 0.99). In Zanzibar, we see this both within and between <italic>shehias</italic>, suggesting that parasite gene flow occurs over both short and long distances. These results are similar to our previous work using whole genome sequencing of isolates from Zanzibar and mainland Tanzania, showing increased within population IBD compared to between population IBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Morgan et al., 2020</xref>). The network of highly related <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites from 6 <italic>shehias</italic> in North Pemba provides an excellent example of likely recent near clonal transmission, consistent with an outbreak (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></bold>). A recent study investigating population structure in Zanzibar also found local population microstructure in Pemba (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Holzschuh et al., 2023</xref>). Overall, given the findings of microstructure with significant local sharing of highly related strains, these small clusters still potentially drive much of the malaria transmission that occurs within the archipelago through routine human movement or mosquito travel between locales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Huestis et al., 2019</xref>). Less frequent longer distance transmission events also occur, likely due to longer range human migration within the islands.</p>
<p>Asymptomatic parasitemia has been shown to be common in falciparum malaria around the globe and has been shown to have increasing importance in Zanzibar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Lindblade et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Morris et al., 2015</xref>). What underlies the biology and prevalence of asymptomatic parasitemia in very low transmission settings where anti-parasite immunity is not expected to be prevalent remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Björkman &amp; Morris, 2020</xref>). Similar to a few previous studies, we found that asymptomatic infections had a higher COI than symptomatic infections across both the coastal mainland and Zanzibar parasite populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Sarah-Matio et al., 2022</xref>). Potential reasons for this phenomenon include low level immune response resulting in chronic infection with multiple clones over time in asymptomatic individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Felger et al., 2012</xref>), and dominance of more virulent clones in shorter symptomatic infections resulting in lower COI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Collins et al., 2022</xref>). In Zambia, one study suggested that infections that cause asymptomatic infection may be genetically different than those that cause symptomatic infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Searle et al., 2017</xref>). However, this study included samples collected over different time periods and relied on a low-density genotyping assay which only investigated the diversity of 24 single nucleotide polymorphisms across the genome. Here, based on SNPs throughout the core genome, we did not see differential clustering of asymptomatic or symptomatic infections in Zanzibar or the mainland (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>), suggesting that these parasite populations remain similar when comparing clinical status. However, this genotyping approach does not address potential variation in the many hypervariable gene families that encode genes known to be associated with pathogenesis (e.g. <italic>var</italic>, <italic>rifin</italic> and <italic>stevor</italic> genes) and does not address differences in expression of genes associated with pathogenesis that may reflect differences in the populations. Investigation with other methods, such as long-read genome sequencing and transcriptional profiling, would be needed to address these differences. Finally, any collection of “asymptomatic” isolates is likely to be heterogeneous, including those that are pre-symptomatic, those who may have been previously treated, and detection of multiple strains is also reliant on the ability of the genotyping method or sampling strategy to sensitively capture minor strains (minority genomes).</p>
<p>While mutations for partial artemisinin resistance were not observed in K13, other antimalarial resistant mutations of concern were observed. Validated drug resistance mutations linked to sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine resistance (Pfdhfr-N51I, Pfdhfr-C59R, Pfdhfr-S108N, Pfdhps-A437G, Pfdhps-K540E) were found at high prevalence (<bold><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold>). Prevalence of polymorphisms associated with amodiaquine resistance (Pfcrt-K76T, Pfmdr1-N86Y, Pfmdr1-Y184F, Pfmdr1-D1246Y) were seen at similar proportions as previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Msellem et al., 2020</xref>). The wild-type Pfmdr1-N86 was dominant in both mainland and archipelago populations, concerning for reduced lumefantrine susceptibility. Polymorphisms associated with artemisinin resistance did not appear in this population. However, continued surveillance is warranted given emergence of these mutations in East Africa and reports of rare resistance mutations on the coast consistent with spread of emerging Pfk13 mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Moser et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, parasites between Zanzibar and coastal mainland Tanzania remain highly related, but population microstructure on the island reflects ongoing low level transmission in Zanzibar, partially driven by asymptomatic infections that potentially constitute a long-term reservoir. This is likely the result of the continued pressure on the population through the implementation of effective control measures. In this study, parasite genomics allows us to parse differences in parasite populations and reveals substructure in an area of low transmission intensity. A recent study identified “hotspot” <italic>shehias</italic>, defined as areas with comparatively higher malaria transmission than other <italic>shehias</italic>, near the port of Zanzibar town and in northern Pemba (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bisanzio et al., 2023</xref>). These regions overlapped with <italic>shehias</italic> in this study with high levels of IBD, especially in northern Pemba (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></bold>). These areas of substructure represent parasites that differentiated in relative isolation and are thus important locales to target intervention to interrupt local transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bousema et al., 2012</xref>). A potential strategy is targeting these focal regions through both mass drug administration and vector control to eliminate these sources of transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Morris et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Okell et al., 2011</xref>). Such strategies and measures preventing imported malaria could accelerate progress towards zero malaria in Zanzibar.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Zanzibar archipelago is close to achieving malaria elimination, but despite the implementation of effective control measures, there is still a low-level seasonal malaria transmission. This could be due to the frequent importation of malaria from mainland Tanzania and Kenya, reservoirs of asymptomatic infections, and competent vectors. To investigate population structure and gene flow of P. falciparum in Zanzibar and mainland Tanzania, they used 178 samples from mainland Tanzania and 213 from Zanzibar that were previously sequenced using molecular inversion probes (MIPs) panels targeting single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). They performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and identity by descent (IBD) analysis to assess genetic relatedness between isolates. Parasites from coastal mainland Tanzania contribute to the genetic diversity in the parasite population in Zanzibar. Despite this, there is a pattern of isolation by distance and microstructure within the archipelago, and evidence of local sharing of highly related strains sustaining malaria transmission in Zanzibar that are important targets for interventions such as mass drug administration and vector control, in addition to measures against imported malaria.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study presents important samples to understand population structure and gene flow between mainland Tanzania and Zanzibar, especially from the rural Bagamoyo District, where malaria transmission persists and there is a major port of entry to Zanzibar. In addition, this study includes a larger set of SNPs, providing more robustness for analyses such as PCA and IBD. Therefore, the conclusions of this paper are well supported by data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Some points need to be clarified:</p>
<p>1. SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD) can introduce bias in PCA and IBD analysis. Were SNPs in LD filtered out prior to these analyses?</p>
<p>2. Many IBD algorithms do not handle polyclonal infections well, despite an increasing number of algorithms that are able to handle polyclonal infections and multiallelic SNPs. How polyclonal samples were handled for IBD analysis?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript describes P. falciparum population structure in Zanzibar and mainland Tanzania. 282 samples were typed using molecular inversion probes. The manuscript is overall well-written and shows a clear population structure. It follows a similar manuscript published earlier this year, which typed a similar number of samples collected mostly in the same sites around the same time. The current manuscript extends this work by including a large number of samples from coastal Tanzania, and by including clinical samples, allowing for a comparison with asymptomatic samples.</p>
<p>The two studies made overall very similar findings, including strong small-scale population structure, related infections on Zanzibar and the mainland, near-clonal expansion on Pemba, and frequency of markers of drug resistance. Despite these similarities, the previous study is mentioned a single time in the discussion (in contrast, the previous research from the authors of the current study is more thoroughly discussed). The authors missed an opportunity here to highlight the similar findings of the two studies.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The overall results show a clear pattern of population structure. The finding of highly related infections detected in close proximity shows local transmission and can possibly be leveraged for targeted control.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A number of points need clarification:</p>
<p>It is overall quite challenging to keep track of the number of samples analyzed. I believe the number of samples used to study population structure was 282 (line 141), thus this number should be included in the abstract rather than 391. It is unclear where the number 232 on line 205 comes from, I failed to deduct this number from supplementary table 1.</p>
<p>Also, Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1 should be swapped. It is more important for the reader to know the number of samples included in the analysis (as given in Supplementary Table 1) than the number collected. Possibly, the two tables could be combined in a clever way.</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>
The authors took the somewhat unusual decision to apply K-means clustering to GPS coordinates to determine how to combine their data into a cluster. There is an obvious cluster on Pemba islands and three clusters on Unguja. Based on the map, I assume that one of these three clusters is mostly urban, while the other two are more rural. It would be helpful to have a bit more information about that in the methods. See also comments on maps in Figures 1 and 2 below.</p>
<p>Following this point, in Supplemental Figure 5 I fail to see an inflection point at K=4. If there is one, it will be so weak that it is hardly informative. I think selecting 4 clusters in Zanzibar is fine, but the justification based on this figure is unclear.</p>
<p>For the drug resistance loci, it is stated that &quot;we further removed SNPs with less than 0.005 population frequency.&quot; Was the denominator for this analysis the entire population, or were Zanzibar and mainland samples assessed separately? If the latter, as for all markers &lt;200 samples were typed per site, there could not be a meaningful way of applying this threshold. Given data were available for 200-300 samples for each marker, does this simply mean that each SNP needed to be present twice?</p>
<p>Discussion:</p>
<p>
I was a bit surprised to read the following statement, given Zanzibar is one of the few places that has an effective reactive case detection program in place: &quot;Thus, directly targeting local malaria transmission, including the asymptomatic reservoir which contributes to sustained transmission (Barry et al., 2021; Sumner et al., 2021), may be an important focus for ultimately achieving malaria control in the archipelago (Björkman &amp; Morris, 2020).&quot; I think the current RACD program should be mentioned and referenced. A number of studies have investigated this program.</p>
<p>The discussion states that &quot;In Zanzibar, we see this both within and between shehias, suggesting that parasite gene flow occurs over both short and long distances.&quot; I think the term 'long distances' should be better defined. Figure 4 shows that highly related infections rarely span beyond 20-30 km. In many epidemiological studies, this would still be considered short distances.</p>
<p>Lines 330-331: &quot;Polymorphisms associated with artemisinin resistance did not appear in this population.&quot; Do you refer to background mutations here? Otherwise, the sentence seems to repeat lines 324. Please clarify.</p>
<p>Line 344: The opinion paper by Bousema et al. in 2012 was followed by a field trial in Kenya (Bousema et al, 2016) that found that targeting hotspots did NOT have an impact beyond the actual hotspot. This (and other) more recent finding needs to be considered when arguing for hotspot-targeted interventions in Zanzibar.</p>
<p>Figures and Tables:</p>
<p>
Table 2: Why not enter '0' if a mutation was not detected? 'ND' is somewhat confusing, as the prevalence is indeed 0%.</p>
<p>Figure 1: Panel A is very hard to read. I don't think there is a meaningful way to display a 3D-panel in 2D. Two panels showing PC1 vs. PC2 and PC1 vs. PC3 would be better. I also believe the legend 'PC2' is placed in the wrong position (along the Y-axis of panel 2).</p>
<p>Supplementary Figure 2B suffers from the same issue.</p>
<p>The maps for Figures 1 and 2 don't correspond. Assuming Kati represents cluster 4 in Figure 2, the name is put in the wrong position. If the grouping of shehias is different between the Figures, please add an explanation of why this is.</p>
<p>Figure 2: In the main panel, please clarify what the lines indicate (median and quartiles?). It is very difficult to see anything except the outliers. I wonder whether another way of displaying these data would be clearer. Maybe a table with medians and confidence intervals would be better (or that data could be added to the plots). The current plots might be misleading as they are dominated by outliers.</p>
<p>In the insert, the cluster number should not only be given as a color code but also added to the map. The current version will be impossible to read for people with color vision impairment, and it is confusing for any reader as the numbers don't appear to follow any logic (e.g. north to south).</p>
<p>The legend for Figure 3 is difficult to follow. I do not understand what the difference in binning was in panels A and B compared to C.</p>
<p>Font sizes for panel C differ, and it is not aligned with the other panels.</p>
<p>Why is Kusini included in Supplemental Figure 4, but not in Figure 1?</p>
<p>Supplemental Figures 6 and 7: What does the width of the line indicate?</p>
<p>What was the motivation not to put these lines on the map, as in Figure 4A? This might make it easier to interpret the data.</p>
