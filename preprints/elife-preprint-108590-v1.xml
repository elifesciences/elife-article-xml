<title>Abstract</title><p>Mutations of <italic>EIF2AK4</italic>, which encodes the eIF2Î± kinase GCN2, cause a severe inherited form of pulmonary hypertension called pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD). Some pathogenic variants of GCN2 are amenable to pharmacological reactivation by low concentrations of ATP-pocket binding inhibitors. Kinase inhibition at modestly elevated concentrations limits the clinical utility of these drugs against PVOD. We therefore performed an <italic>in cellulo</italic> chemical screen for GCN2 activators and identified three structurally distinct compounds with low micromolar stimulatory activities. Unlike previously described GCN2 activators, one of these molecules activated GCN2 independently of GCN1. Modelling supported by structure activity screens suggested it binds within the ATP-pocket of GCN2, but unlike existing ligands does not protrude inward into the allosteric pocket or outward into the solvent. This overcomes a key requirement of other GCN2 activators.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2Î±) mediates the response to a variety of stresses by regulating translation, metabolism and cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). In yeast, GCN2 is the sole eIF2Î± kinase and triggers the General Control Response to the accumulation of uncharged tRNA and to ribosome stalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Gene duplication gave rise to a family of eIF2Î± kinases in multicellular organisms linking eIF2Î± phosphorylation to a variety of other stresses. HRI (EIF2AK1) is activated by haem deficiency, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>), PKR (EIF2AK2) responds to cytosolic double stranded RNA during viral infections, while PERK (EIF2AK3) is activated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Mutations affecting these kinases have been linked to the development of disease and so their manipulation by small molecules is being pursued as a means to develop therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>).</p>
<p>The eIF2 complex recruits initiator methionyl-tRNA to ribosomes commencing protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). This requires eIF2 to bind GTP, which is subsequently hydrolysed. Bound GTP is replenished by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) eIF2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>), but phosphorylated p-eIF2Î± binds avidly to eIF2B inhibiting its GEF activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). When levels of eIF2-GTP-tRNA-Met subsequently fall, most translation is disfavoured, but some transcripts are translated more efficiently owing to the presence of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) within their 5â untranslated regions (5âUTRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). ATF4 and CHOP are transcription factors upregulated in this manner during stress to induce genes of the Integrated Stress Response (ISR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Eventually, PPP1R15A (also called GADD34), itself an ISR target, dephosphorylates p-eIF2Î± to restore the basal state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>).</p>
<p>GCN2 is comprised of five domainsâRWD, pseudokinase, kinase, HisRS-like, and C-terminalâand exists constitutively as a homodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Its kinase activity is stimulated when the RWD domain interacts with colliding ribosomes via the cofactor GCN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>) or when the HisRS domain interacts with deacylated tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Direct interaction between GCN2 and the ribosome P-stalk can also mediate GCN2 activation during ribosome stalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>).</p>
<p>Mutations of <italic>EIF2AK4,</italic> which encodes GCN2, cause the aggressive subtypes of familial pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) and pulmonary capillary haemangiomatosis (PCH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Some pathogenic alleles generate hypomorphic variants of GCN2 that we and others have shown can be activated by small molecule inhibitors that bind to the GCN2 ATP pocket, e.g. neratinib and GCN2iB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Type-1 inhibitors bind the ATP pocket of the kinase in its active conformation (DFG-Asp-in, Î±C-helix-in), while type 2 inhibitors bind the inactive conformation (DFG-out, Î±C-helix-out) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Type 1.5 inhibitors, by contrast, bind an intermediate conformation (DFG-Asp-in, Î±C-helix-out). Several type 1 and 1.5 kinase inhibitors can activate GCN2 at low concentrations while inhibiting at higher concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). GCN2iB is a relatively selective type 1.5 inhibitor of GCN2 that activates the kinase at submicromolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). It is hypothesised that drug-induced stabilisation of one GCN2 protomer within a dimer is propagated to the second protomer to cause its activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Several inhibitors of other kinases that are in clinical use or development as anticancer agents activate GCN2 in a GCN1-dependent manner, which may contribute to their therapeutic efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). For this reason, GCN2 activators are being sought as potential anticancer drugs.</p>
<p>The complexity of GCN2 activation, involving direct and indirect detection of amino acid deprivation and ribosome stalling, has hampered efforts to reconstitute GCN2 function <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). We therefore performed a cell-based chemical screen for GCN2-dependent activators of the ISR, followed by <italic>in vitro</italic> validation using orthogonal approaches. In doing so, we identified three novel, structurally distinct GCN2 activators. Notably, one of these, designated compound 20, activates GCN2 in a GCN1-independent manner.</p>

<title>Chemical screen for GCN2 activators</title>
<p>We generated clonal Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell lines expressing an ATF4::NanoLuc reporter comprising the 5â untranslated region (UTR) of human ATF4 mRNA fused to NanoLuc luciferase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Activation of the ISR could be detected as bioluminescence in response to ISR activators histidinol, tunicamycin and latrunculin A (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). A high-throughput screen of the BioAscent library of 123,222 drug-like compounds performed by the ALBORADA Drug Discovery Institute, yielded two separate pools of potential ISR inhibitors and activators. Using this knowledge, we assembled a subset of 6,600 compounds from the BioAscent library enriched for potential ISR activators and screened these in 348-well format at 10ÂµM for 16 hours. To increase sensitivity, screens were performed with test compound alone or combined with the half-maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) of histidinol. This yielded 153 compounds that activated the reporter at least three standard deviations above baseline (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Chemical Screen of novel GCN2-specific ISR-activating molecules.</title>
<p>(A) Schematic of ATF4::NanoLuc reporter, exploiting the upstream open reading frames (uORFs). Short uORFs 1, 2 and 3 precede the ATF4 translation start site, with uORF3 overlapping the ATF4 coding sequence, but out-of-frame. During the ISR, skipping of uORF3 leads to increased translation initiation at the ATF4 initiator AUG. (B) Relative Light Unit (RLU) of ATF4 signal in CHO stable cell-line overexpressing ATF4::NanoLuc treated with 1mM histidinol, 2.5 Âµg/mL tunicamycin, or 1 ÂµM latrunculin A (n=3; Â± SEM). (C) Chemical screen of 6,600 small molecules tested with CHO stable cell-line overexpressing ATF4::NanoLuc. The molecules were treated alone or with submaximal ISR activation with 0.3mM histidinol. All molecules were displayed along the x-axis based on their z-score of relative reporter signal when treated with compound alone (pale symbols). Z-score for treatment with compound and histidinol is also plotted at the same x-axis position (dark symbols). Molecules with z-score &gt; 3 (i.e., over 3 standard deviations from the mean reporter signal) were identified as hits: ISR activator in orange and ISR augmenter (exaggerating ISR activation by histidinol) in green. (D) Pipeline of molecule short-listing, primary screening using CHO ATF4::NanoLuc reporter (153 hits), NanoLuc alone control (134 hits), selection based on cytotoxicity (130 hits), orthogonal CHO ATF4::FLuc reporter (89 hits), and subsequent GCN2 specificity in GCN2 null reporter cells (30 hits) and compound quality control via LC-MS (16 hits), finally validation by GCN2-specific FACS to a short list of 3 compounds.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>The pipeline used to filter hit compounds is illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>. Counter screens were performed against constitutively expressed Nanoluc, to exclude trivial activators of luminescent proteins, leaving 134 hits. Cytotoxicity assays excluded immediately toxic compounds leaving 130. Hits were then re-screened using a second CHO ATF4::Luc2 reporter cell line, shortlisting 89 lead compounds. GCN2-deficient ATF4::NanoLuc CHO reporter cells were generated by introducing the reporter into <italic>Eif2ak4-/-</italic> CHO cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Thirty compounds were selected based on GCN2 dependency, where stimulation was lost in GCN2 null cells. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) verified compound purity and quality leaving 16 lead compounds of high confidence from the original library stocks.</p>

<title>Orthogonal secondary screen</title>
<p>The ISR can be activated in isolation or in combination with other stress signalling pathways, for example as part of the unfolded protein response (UPR) to ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). To distinguish between inducers of ER stress and selective activators of the ISR, we used dual reporter CHO cells that express a fluorescent ISR reporter (CHOP::GFP) and a reporter of IRE1 activity (XBP1::Turquoise) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Histidinol served as a positive control for ISR activation via GCN2, while tunicamycin was used to induced ER stress and activate the UPR. <italic>Eif2ak4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> CHO cells were used to assess GCN2 dependence, while <italic>Ppp1r15a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells, which are impaired in the dephosphorylation of eIF2Î±, were used to amplify the effects of ISR activation. Histidinol selectively activated the CHOP::GFP ISR reporter in wildtype and <italic>Ppp1r15a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells, but not in GCN2 deleted cells, validating this system (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). As expected, the ISR was exaggerated in the <italic>Ppp1r15a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells owing to their defective dephosphorylation of eIF2Î±. Tunicamycin activated both the CHOP::GFP and XBP1::Turquoise reporter in all three genotypes.</p>

<p>The 16 lead compounds were next examined both in the presence and absence of a submaximal concentration of histidinol. Using this orthogonal approach, three compounds were found to be GCN2 selective activators of the ISR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>&amp;C). Those which induced ER stress or showed minimal GCN2 dependence are not shown. Reporter activation was measured by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) after 18 hours of treatment with 30ÂµM compound 18, 20ÂµM compound 20, and 7.5ÂµM compound 21. The three GCN2 selective activators included compound 18, <italic>N-(4-{[(furan-2-yl)methyl]sulfamoyl}phenyl)-3-methyl-1-phenyl-1H-thieno[2,3-c]pyrazole-5-carboxamide</italic>, containing a furan and two phenyl rings; compound 20, <italic>4â-methyl-Nâ¼2â¼-2-pyrimidinyl-4,5â-bi-1,3-thiazole-2,2â-diamine</italic>, containing two aminothiazoles; and compound 21, <italic>5-(4-bromophenyl)-2-(methylsulfonyl)pyrimidine</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>Larger quantities of compound 18 were then purchased from TimTec, USA (compound ST51216373); compound 20 was synthesised by ChemBridge, USA (compound 5935953); and compound 21 was purchased from Specs, Netherlands (compound AC-907/25005415). After validating their effects using the assays described above, we next confirmed activation of the ISR by these compounds at the transcriptional level.

<p>In CHO cells, compound 18 was the least potent with an EC<sub>50</sub> of greater than 30ÂµM in CHO cells without obvious inhibition up to 100ÂµM (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Notably, compound 18 failed to activate the ISR measurably in either HeLa cells or human embryonic kidney 293T cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Compound 20 activated the ISR in CHO cells in a biphasic manner with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 4.8ÂµM (95% CI 4.0-5.6ÂµM) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). It was active in 293T cells though with a lower potency, EC<sub>50</sub> of 17ÂµM, but was inactive in HeLa cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>).

<p>GCN1 mediates the interaction between stalled ribosomes and GCN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Histidinol is a competitive inhibitor of the histidyl-tRNA synthetase that depletes the cell of charged histidyl-tRNA, thus causing ribosome stalling and activation of the ISR in a GCN1-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). Using GCN1 deficient human 293T cells transiently expressing the ATF4::NanoLuc reporter, we confirmed that activation of the ISR by histidinol requires GCN1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Low concentrations of GCN2iB (5-70nM) had minimal effect on ISR reporter activation, while neratinib robustly triggered the ISR. The stimulatory effects of neratinib were significantly attenuated in GCN1 deficient cells consistent with the observation that GCN1 knockout renders astrocytoma cells resistant to neratinib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). By contrast, activation of the ISR by compound 20, chosen for having the largest effect size in 293T cells, did not require GCN1 to activate the ISR reporter (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Indeed, loss of GCN1 modestly increased ISR activation at the highest concentration of compound 20 suggesting a mode of action independent of ribosome stalling. To gain confidence in this observation, we inactivated the <italic>Gcn1</italic> gene in CHO cells by CRISPR/Cas9. Neratinib-induced activation of the ATF4::NanoLuc ISR reporter was lost in GCN1 deficient CHO cells; however, ISR activation by compound 20 was completely insensitive to loss of GCN1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>

<p>To examine further the interaction of compounds 18 and 20 with GCN2âs kinase domain, we generated in bacteria a recombinant protein comprising Glutathione S-transferases (GST) fused to the kinase domain of human GCN2 (residues 585 to 1005 of NCBI reference Sequence NP_001013725.2). GST was chosen both to facilitate protein purification, and to enhance dimerisation of the kinase domain in order to cause autophosphorylation and constitutive activation. When incubated <italic>in vitro</italic> with increasing concentrations of ATP and a fixed quantity of His6-tagged bacterially expressed eIF2Î± N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>), GST-GCN2 kinase domain phosphorylated its substrate on serine 51, as detected by immunoblotting (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Neratinib dose-dependently inhibited eIF2Î± phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>, lanes 1-5). The lack of activation by neratinib likely reflected the requirement for autoinhibitory domains of GCN2 to observe this effect. Therefore, in this system inhibition of eIF2Î± kinase activity was used as a surrogate for target engagement. Compounds 18 and 20 also inhibited eIF2Î± phosphorylation, while compound 21 appeared inactive in this assay (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). High concentrations of ATP were unable to completely overcome the inhibition by compounds 18 or 20, suggesting a mode of action, at least partially, non-competitive in nature (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>&amp;F).</p>
<p>To test the ability of compound 20 to activate full-length GCN2, we next generated full-length human GCN2 (uniprot ID: Q9P2K8) through baculoviral expression using an N-terminal twin StrepII tag. Despite exerting only a modest effect on GCN2 autophosphorylation at T899 within the activation loop, compound 20 robustly triggered the phosphorylation of full-length eIF2Î± to an even greater extent than purified tRNAs, a known endogenous stimulus of GCN2 activity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>).</p>

<title>In silico docking of compounds 18 and 20 to the GCN2 kinase domain and structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis</title>
<p>We used the SiteMap module from Schrodinger Suite to identify binding sites based on drug interactions with nearby GCN2 residues. Published crystals structures of the GCN2 kinase domain (see methods) show the ATP binding pocket comprises a large solvent exposed region and a buried hydrophobic region that extends beyond the gatekeeper residue (Met802) and towards the IZC-helix (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Compound 18 was predicted to occupy a similar pocket to that of the ligand in the PDB 6N3N crystal structure demonstrating a Type 1.5 binding configuration, characterised by the DFG loop being âinâ and the IZC-helix being in the âoutâ conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). The furan motif of compound 18 is predicted to be buried in the allosteric pocket around Î±C-helix, between gatekeeper Met802 and Leu640 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). The compoundâs sulfone was predicted to interact with Phe867 of the conserved DFG-motif. In neratinib, a triad of hydrogen bonding was predicted between the 8-position of the isoquinoline core (Ar-H bond), the amine linker (H bond) and the 2-position of the fluorobenzene ring (Ar-H Bond) with Asp866, similar to the predicted interaction between the amide linkage of compound 18 and Asp866 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Both neratinib and compound 18 were also predicted to protrude into the solvent exposed space (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B-E</xref>).

<p>Due to the metabolic liabilities of furans in medicinal chemistry programs, we sought to explore the importance of this motif for binding and activity using available structural analogues. Replacement of the sulfonamide furan motif with some benzene derivatives including phenolic (BCC0106222), 2-bromobenzene (BCC0113320), 3-acetylbezene (BCC0104214), preserved ISR activation while others (BCC0073242 and BCC0043997) resulted in a loss of activity (Supplementary Table 1). Incorporation of heterocyclic ring systems (BCC0073142, Z56783036) or modification of solvent exposed region (Z88478561, Z226209130, Z11741677) were similarly not tolerated (Supplementary Table 1). However, modifying the furan motif to benzene derivative 2-bromobenzene (BCC0113320) and heterocyclic ring (BCC0077119) preserved GCN2-specific ISR activation.</p>
<p>Unlike compound 18 and neratinib, compound 20 was not predicted to protrude into the allosteric pocket (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>&amp;G). Analogues extending further towards the IZC-helix and protruding into the solvent exposed region were inactive (e.g., Z134826202 and Z118606822), suggesting that the small size of compound 20 may be advantageous, fitting into the ATP-binding pocket of GCN2 and facilitating stronger activation (Supplementary Table 1). Hydrogen bond interaction was predicted between the NH<sub>2</sub> of the compound 20 aminothiazole with the carbonyl of the hinge region Cys805. Additional interaction was predicted between the linker NH of compound 20 and backbone carbonyl of Asp866 in the DFG-motif. Such 2-aminopyrimidine rings are present in many kinase ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). Rather than this interacting with hinge region residues, this moiety in compound 20 was predicted to form a pi-cation interaction with Lys619 and a hydrogen bond with DFG Asp866, as has been reported for other ligands of kinase ATP pockets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Replacement of this pyrimidine ring with 2-pyridine analogues (BCC0084738, BCC0079350 and BCC0083923) was well tolerated, likely due to the conserved hydrogen bonding interaction between the pyridine nitrogen and Asp866. Removal of a nitrogen from the ring system, such as BCC0057014, BCC0089519, BCC0084744, and BCC0084833 all resulted in a loss of activity, possibly due to their lack of interaction with Asp866 (Supplementary Table 1). Due to toxicity issues surrounding 3-aminothiazoles, modifications were made to replace the terminal thiazole ring system with phenyl derivatives (BCC0080152, BCC0075509, BCC0084830, BCC0057431 and BCC0080200).</p>
<p>However, these resulted in a decrease in activity towards GCN2, suggesting that there might be a steric component contributing to activity. Replacing the thiazole with a minimally steric affecting thiophene (BCC0079876) also led to activity loss, possibly due to the twisting of central thiazole ring that impaired hydrogen bonding between pyrimidine nitrogen and Asp866. We were therefore unable to improve upon compound 20âs activity but gained valuable SAR information for future development.</p>

Our chemical screen identified three chemically distinct GCN2 activating molecules, one of which is, to our knowledge, the first to show independence from GCN1 for its activity. This may prove useful as a tool compound for the study of GCN2 in cells and using purified components since it overcomes at least one hurdle to kinase activation.</p>
<p>Compounds 18 and 20 demonstrate weak inhibition of the related kinase PKR. Previous structural analyses have shown the kinase domains of PKR and GCN2 to be highly conserved, particularly at the ATP-binding pocket, which likely contributes to this effect. Indeed, a previous publication reported that other small molecule inhibitors of GCN2, including a series based on a triazolo[4,5-d]pyrimidine scaffold, demonstrated cross-inhibition of PKR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). Furthermore, the PKR inhibitor C16 has been shown to activate GCN2 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Intriguingly, viral infections or synthetic dsRNA known to activate PKR, have also been shown to trigger GCN2 in some circumstances, though if this relates to structural similarities of their kinase domains has not been studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>).</p>
<p>A remarkable finding in the current study was the lack of dependence on GCN1 for compound 20 to activate GCN2 in cells. During amino acid starvation, ribosome-associated GCN1 facilitates binding of uncharged tRNAs to GCN2, thus facilitating GCN2 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). GCN1 also functions as a disome detector, enabling GCN2 activation in response to ribosome collisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). In genetic screens identifying modifiers of GCN2 activation by a small molecule, such as the dual HER2/EGFR inhibitor neratinib and the WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775, GCN1 has repeatedly been found to be necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). We were able to confirm this GCN1 dependence for neratinib in the present study. It was therefore surprising that GCN2 activation by compound 20 did not appear to require GCN1 in human or hamster cells. While GCN1 is essential for the activation of GCN2 by amino acid starvation in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>), <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have shown that GCN2 activation by the ribosome P-stalk or by deacylated tRNAs does not absolutely require GCN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Yet we found compound 20 able to activate purified full-length human GCN2 to a far higher level than was possible with purified tRNAs. Our modelling suggests that unlike neratinib, compound 20 can fit within the ATP-pocket without needing to protrude into the solvent, nor extending deeply into the hydrophobic region beyond the gatekeeper Met802 residue towards the IZC-helix. Indeed, analogues extending in these directions were inactive, perhaps suggesting value to this moleculeâs small size. This may prove useful as a tool compound for studies in which GCN1 is unavailable or non-functional.</p>
<p>There are limitations to our study. So far, our experiments have been limited to cultured cells, purified proteins, and <italic>in silico</italic> modelling. We have yet to test our compounds in an animal model. Although our pipeline excluded molecules showing toxicity, it is likely that prolonged activation of the ISR will have toxic consequences via targets including CHOP and PPP1R15A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Our most promising molecule, compound 20, contains a 2-aminothiazole. Although known to be a versatile scaffold, appearing in several clinically useful drugs including anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial and anticancer agents, 2-aminothiazole is sometimes considered a toxicophore owing to toxic consequences following its metabolism, and as a pan-assay interference compound (PAINS), owing to frequent false positives in high-throughput drug screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Our use of orthogonal approaches to support its activity as a GCN2 activator, mitigate against it being a non-specific hit. Nevertheless, if this compound were to be developed further, attempts to âdesign outâ this feature by, for example, replacing the sulphur for an oxygen (thiazole to oxazole switch) could be attempted. Indeed, computational modelling reveals an adjacent NH which should form a stronger H-bond to oxygen of an oxazole, which may result in an improved potency to GCN2. Another potential limitation of our study is the use of existing analogues in SAR studies, the so-called âanalogue by catalogueâ approach. Although less systematic than chemically synthesising further series <italic>de novo</italic>, it was cost effective and generated useful information on the tolerability of modifications of our lead scaffolds. Finally, our compounds were identified in a screen of CHO cells and appear to be more effective in these cells that in HeLa and 293T models. The absence of detectable activity in HeLa cells does not appear to be a species effect, since some activity was observed in human 293T cells and when using recombinant human GCN2 protein. It is likely therefore to reflect cell-type effects, since cancer cell lines are known to demonstrate dramatic differences in drug efficiency, even when using different strains of the same cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). This should be considered carefully when using these compounds as tools or for further drug development.</p>
<p>In summary, we performed a chemical screen for novel activators of GCN2. We identified three chemically distinct scaffolds, and demonstrated one to be independent of the GCN2 cofactor GCN1.</p>

<title>In silico modelling</title>
<p>Five reported crystal structures for human GCN2 were considered (PDB 63N3, 6N3O, 6N3L, 7QWK, and 7QQ6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). Of these, 6N3N and 6N3L share â¼100% sequence homology. While 6N3N has unresolved amino acids residues, these are remote from the ATP binding site and should not impact the binding of the ligands. A visual inspection of 6N3O, 6N3N, and 6N3L highlighted that the activation loop in 6N3L is cut short and does not extend beyond the IZC-helix, affecting the orientation of the DFG loop and its residues (Asp866, Phe867, Gly868). As such, 6N3L was not considered for further analysis. PDB sequences 7QWK and 7QQ6 share â¼75% sequence homology, with 7QWK containing unresolved residues remote from the ATP binding site. As observed with PDB 6N3L, the activation loop containing the DFG residues is cut short in both cases and does not extend beyond the IZC-helix. Inspection of the binding mode of crystallised ligands of 7QQ6 and 7QWK demonstrate that these bind in a Type I binding pocket, compared to Type II binding as observed in 6N3O.</p>
<p>Prior to docking, the protein structure (PDB ID: 6N3N) was put through the Protein Preparation Protocol of Maestro.

<p>This study presents a screen for small-molecule activators of the kinase GCN2 that phosphorylates the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2Î±) in response to diverse stress stimuli. Among the compounds identified, one stands out as a potent activator that functions independently of GCN1, which is <bold>important</bold> for probing mechanisms of Integrated Stress Response regulation and may have translational relevance in the context of pathogenic GCN2 mutations. While some reviewers found the biochemical analyses <bold>convincing</bold>, others viewed the cellular evidence as limited, particularly with respect to time points, endogenous readouts, and broader cell-type validation, which prevents a clear assessment of the compound's potential potency in a physiological context.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript describes a chemical screen for activators of the eIF2 kinase GCN2 (EIF2AK4) in the integrated stress response (ISR). Recently, reported inhibitors of GCN2 and other protein kinases have been shown at certain concentrations to paradoxically activate GCN2. The study uses CHO cells and ISR reporter screens to identify a number of GCN2 activator compounds, including a potent &quot;compound 20.&quot; These activators have implications for the development of new therapies for ISR-related diseases. For example, although not directly pursued in this study, these GCN2 activators could be helpful for the treatment of PVOD, which is reported for patients with certain GCN2 loss-of-function mutations. The identified activators are also suggested to engage with the GCN2 directly and can function while devoid of GCN1, a co-activator of GCN2.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript appears to be a largely rigorous study that flows in a logical manner. The topic is interesting and significant.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Portions of the manuscript are not fully clear. There are some experimental presentation and design concerns that should be addressed to support the stated conclusions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Zhu, Emanuelli, and colleagues describe a novel pharmacological activator of the Integrated Stress Response kinase GCN2. The work is conclusive and biochemically solid. This work significantly adds to the pharmacological arsenal targeting the ISR and, in particular, GCN2.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Strong biochemistry, novel molecular activator of GCN2 (GCN1 independent).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The rationale for the screen is not exploited in the results (e.g., pathogenic GCN2 mutants), and lots of cell-based read-outs are not endogenous.</p>
<p>Major points</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the justification of the work. Since the authors justify the screen for GCN2 activators with loss-of-function mutants associated with diseases, it would be of interest to evaluate whether the best compounds identified in the study are indeed able to prompt activation of those mutants (or at least of the most prevalent). This approach could actually go in parallel with the docking experiments carried out in the last figure of the manuscript, where mutants could be modelized as well.</p>
<p>(2) The compounds are only tested using Â« artificial Â» proximal signaling outputs. It would be interesting to evaluate whether the best identified compounds are capable of prompting endogenous eIF2alpha phosphorylation in cellular models.</p>
<p>(3) Other GCN2 activators (other than GCN2iB, e.g., HC-7366) were recently identified. In this context, it would be of interest to carry out a small benchmarking study to evaluate how the compounds identified in the current study perform against the previously identified molecules.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors describe the results of a high-throughput screen for small-molecule activators of GCN2. Ultimately, they find 3 promising compounds. One of these three, compound 20 (C20), is of the most interest both for its potency and specificity. The major new finding is that this molecule appears to activate GCN2 independent of GCN1, which suggests that it works by a potentially novel mechanism. Biochemical analysis suggests that each binds in the ATP-binding pocket of GCN2, and that at least in vitro, C20 is a potent agonist. Structural modeling provides insight into how the three compounds might dock in the pocket and generates testable hypotheses as to why C20 perhaps acts through a different mechanism than other molecules.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Of the 3 compounds identified by the authors, C20 is the most interesting, not just for its intriguing mechanistic distinction as being GCN1-independent (shown genetically in two distinct cell lines, CHO and 293T in Figure 4, and in contrast to other GCN2 activators) but also for its potency. In in-cellulo assays, compound 21 appears as more of an ISR enhancer than an activator per se, and although compound 18 and compound 21 lead to upregulation of the ISR targets (Figure 2), that degree of upregulation is probably not significantly different from that induced by those compounds in Gcn2-/- cells. For C20, the effect appears stronger (although it is unclear whether the authors performed statistical analysis comparing the two genotypes in Figure 2D). In Figure 3, only C20 activates the ISR robustly in both CHO and 293T. Ultimately, C20 might be a tool for providing mechanistic insight into the details of GCN2 activation and regulation, and could be exploited therapeutically.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are some limitations to the existing work. As the authors acknowledge, they do not use any of the compounds in animals; their in vivo efficacy, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics are unknown. But even in the context of the in cellulo experiments, it is puzzling that none of the three compounds, including C20, has any effects in HeLa cells when Neratinib does. It's beyond the scope of this paper to address definitively why that is, but it would at least be reassuring to know that C20 activates the ISR in a wider range of cells, including ideally some primary, non-immortalized cells. In addition, the ISR is a complex, feedback-regulated response whose output varies depending on the time point examined. The in cellulo analysis in this paper is limited to reporter assays at 18 hours and qRT-PCR assays at 4 and 8 hours. A more extensive examination of the behavior of the relevant ISR mRNAs and proteins (eIF2, ATF4, CHOP, cell viability, etc.) for C20 across a more extensive time course would give the reader a clearer sense of how this molecule affects ISR output. I also find it a bit strange that the authors describe C20 as &quot;demonstrat(ing) weak inhibition of ... PKR&quot;-the measured IC50 is ~4 Î¼M, which is right around its EC50 for GCN2 activation. This raises the confounding possibility that C20 would simultaneously activate GCN2 while inhibiting PKR. While perhaps inhibition of PKR is not relevant under the conditions when GCN2 would be activated either experimentally or therapeutically, examining in cells the effects of C20 on GCN2 and PKR across a dose range would shed light on whether this cross-reactivity is likely to be of concern.</p>

<p>We thank the editors and reviewers for their encouraging comments and constructive feedback. We will revise the text to enhance clarity as suggested. New experiments are planned to address questions raised regarding the time course of responses to the hit compounds. We also intend to examine additional endogenous readouts of the integrated stress response, including effects on translation. The effects of lead compound 20 will be examined in a wider range of cells, including primary cells.</p>
