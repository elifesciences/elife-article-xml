<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>A central signal that marshals host defense against many infections is the lymphocyte-derived cytokine interferon-gamma (IFNγ). The IFNγ receptor is expressed on most human cells, and its activation leads to the expression of antimicrobial proteins that execute diverse cell-autonomous immune programs. One such immune program consists of the sequential detection, ubiquitylation, and destruction of intracellular pathogens. Recently, the IFNγ-inducible ubiquitin E3 ligase RNF213 was identified as a pivotal mediator of such a defense axis. RNF213 provides host protection against viral, bacterial, and protozoan pathogens. To establish infections, potentially susceptible intracellular pathogens must have evolved mechanisms that subdue RNF213-controlled cell-autonomous immunity. In support of this hypothesis, we demonstrate here that a causative agent of bacillary dysentery, <italic>Shigella flexneri,</italic> uses the type III secretion system (T3SS) effector IpaH1.4 to induce the degradation of RNF213. <italic>S. flexneri</italic> mutants lacking IpaH1.4 expression are bound and ubiquitylated by RNF213 in the cytosol of IFNγ-primed host cells. Linear (M1-) and lysine-linked ubiquitylation of <italic>S. flexneri</italic> requires RNF213 but is independent of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC). We find that ubiquitylation of <italic>S. flexneri</italic> is insufficient to kill intracellular bacteria, suggesting that <italic>S. flexneri</italic> employs additional virulence factors to escape from host defenses that operate downstream from RNF213-driven ubiquitylation. In brief, this study identified the bacterial IpaH1.4 protein as an inhibitor of mammalian RNF213 and highlights evasion of RNF213-driven immunity as a characteristic of the human-tropic pathogen <italic>Shigella</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The lymphocyte-derived cytokine IFNγ is a strong inducer of cell-autonomous immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). The IFNγ-inducible E3 ubiquitin ligase ring finger protein 213 (RNF213) provides protection against a diverse group of intracellular pathogens that includes viruses, protozoa, and bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). RNF213 binds to bacteria that enter the host cell cytosol. Once bound to Gram-negative bacteria such as <italic>Salmonella</italic>, RNF213 directly ubiquitylates the bacterial surface molecule, lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In addition to RNF213, the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) was reported to play a critical role in the ubiquitylation of cytosolic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Whereas LUBAC catalyzes linear ubiquitin chains, the types of ubiquitin linkages deposited on bacterial surfaces by RNF213 are unknown. Following ubiquitylation cytosolic bacteria can be captured by ubiquitin-binding proteins and delivered into autolysosomes for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>).</p>
<p>While the predominantly vacuolar pathogen <italic>Salmonella</italic> is susceptible to RNF213-mediated cytosolic host defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>), the cytosol-adapted Gram-negative pathogen <italic>Burkholderia thailandensis</italic> is resistant. <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> escapes RNF213-driven host defense in part through the secretion of the virulence factor TssM, a ubiquitin esterase that removes ubiquitin from LPS on the bacterial surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). However, whether and how other cytosolic bacterial pathogens escape from RNF213-driven ubiquitylation is unknown.</p>
<p><italic>Shigella</italic> spp. are the etiological agent of bacillary dysentery and a leading cause of diarrheal deaths, malnutrition, and growth retardation in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). <italic>Shigella</italic> spp. invade the intestinal epithelium, enter the host cell cytosol of infected human colonic epithelial cells, and trigger an acute inflammatory response that involves the secretion of IFNγ by lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). IFNγ signaling in epithelial cells induces the expression of human guanylate binding protein 1 (GBP1), a defense protein that blocks bacterial intracellular motility and cell-to-cell spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). To counter this potent cell-autonomous immune program, <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> employs its type III secretion system (T3SS) to deliver the GBP1 inhibitor IpaH9.8 into the host cell cytosol. Loss of IpaH9.8 results in diminished <italic>S. flexneri</italic> virulence and a potent antibacterial host response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>).</p>
<p>IpaH9.8 belongs to a family of T3SS effectors that contain a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain involved in substrate recognition and a novel E3 ligase (NEL) domain that transfers K48-linked ubiquitin to its bound substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). K48-linked ubiquitylation tags the substrate for proteasomal degradation. These IpaH proteins belong to a ‘second wave’ of T3SS effectors that are under the control of the transcriptional regulator MxiE. Second wave T3SS effectors have been shown to promote host cell survival, to dampen inflammation, and to counteract cell-autonomous immune programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>), yet their full repertoire of targets remains to be determined.</p>
<p>In the present work we found that the MxiE-regulated T3SS effector IpaH1.4 facilities the proteasomal degradation of RNF213. Remarkably, RNF213 functions independent of LUBAC to promote the linear and lysine-linked ubiquitylation of <italic>ipaH1.4-</italic> deficient <italic>S. flexneri</italic> mutants. We observed that ubiquitylated <italic>S. flexneri</italic> continued to replicate inside the host cell cytosol, indicating that <italic>S. flexneri</italic> employs additional unknown virulence mechanisms to interfere with its degradation. Thus, our study demonstrates that the human enteric pathogen <italic>S. flexneri</italic> directly interferes with RNF213 expression and also limits host defense downstream of RNF213-driven ubiquitylation.</p>

<title>Deletion of <italic>mxiE</italic> renders <italic>S. flexneri</italic> susceptible to linear ubiquitylation</title>
<p>Previous studies identified a cell-autonomous host defense program in which mammalian cells attach linear ubiquitin (M1) to the surface of the Gram-negative pathogen <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> upon bacterial spillage into the host cell cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Recently, it was reported that the cytosol-adapted pathogen <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> secretes a ubiquitin esterase that renders the bacteria resistant to this type of cytosolic ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that resistance to host-driven linear ubiquitylation is a common feature of bacterial pathogens that are adapted to a cytosolic milieu. To test this concept, we monitored ubiquitylation of the professional cytosolic pathogen <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> (serotype 2a, strain 257T) by immunofluorescence. We found that wildtype (WT) <italic>S. flexneri</italic> remained largely devoid of M1-linked ubiquitin in both alveolar A549 and colonic HT29 epithelial cell lines under both unprimed and IFNγ-primed conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> – C). In contrast to WT <italic>S. flexneri,</italic> a Δ<italic>mxiE</italic> mutant strain that has diminished expression of ‘second-wave’ T3SS effector proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), was robustly stained with anti-M1 antibodies in IFNγ-primed host cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> – C). These observations indicate that <italic>S. flexneri</italic> uses MxiE-dependent effectors to evade an IFNγ-activated ubiquitylation pathway that targets cytosolic bacteria.</p>

<title>Linear and lysine-linked ubiquitin is attached to <italic>S. flexneri</italic> Δ<italic>mxiE</italic></title>
<p>The ubiquitin protein contains seven lysine residues.

To determine which ubiquitin linkage types are present on the surface of <italic>S. flexneri</italic> Δ<italic>mxiE</italic> bacteria, we generated A549 cells that overexpressed internally tagged ubiquitin (INT-Ub) variants, which contain only a single lysine residue or lack lysines altogether.

<p>In addition to its incorporation into linear ubiquitin chains, 7KR ubiquitin can also function as donor ubiquitin and be attached as mono-ubiquitin to a substrate or to an existing ubiquitin chain as a chain terminator. To distinguish between 7KR INT-Ub signals originating from linear versus mono-ubiquitylation, we generated an N-terminally HA-tagged 7KR INT-Ub variant. The N-terminal tag prevents linear ubiquitylation but still allows 7KR INT-Ub to be attached as mono-ubiquitin via its C-terminal carboxyl group. We found that the addition of this N-terminal HA-tag significantly reduced but not completely abolished the number of Δ<italic>mxiE</italic> bacteria decorated with 7KR INT-Ub (Fig. S1). These data indicate that much of the association of 7KR INT-Ub with cytosolic Δ<italic>mxiE</italic> bacteria is due to the formation of M1-linked linear ubiquitin chains.</p>
<p>Collectively, our data confirmed that M1-linked ubiquitin is bound to <italic>S. flexneri</italic> Δ<italic>mxiE</italic> but also indicated that other additional ubiquitin linkage types are attached to <italic>mxiE</italic>-deficient bacteria. The functional importance of these lysine-linked ubiquitin chains was demonstrated by improved bacterial targeting of INT-Ub variants that can form additional K27-linkages or both K27– and K63-linkages (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Linkage-specific antibodies against K27 and K63 confirmed that these two linkage types are present on <italic>ΔmxiE</italic> bacteria in IFNγ-primed A549 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-C</xref>). Staining with an antibody that detects most ubiquitin linkage types (FK2) showed near complete overlap with anti-M1 staining (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D-E</xref>). Because the percentage of FK2-positve but M1-negatve bacteria (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). was much smaller than the percentage of bacteria that were K27-or K63-positive (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-C</xref>), these data suggest that most <italic>S. flexneri ΔmxiE</italic> bacteria are decorated with both linear and lysine-linked ubiquitin.</p>

<title>The ubiquitylation of <italic>S.flexneri ΔmxiE</italic> is dependent on RNF213 but not LUBAC</title>
<p>Previous work showed that the multimeric E3 ligase LUBAC can deposit M1-linked ubiquitin on the surface of cytosolic <italic>S. enterica</italic> Typhimurium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>).

<p>Unexpectedly, deletion of either HOIP or HOIL-1, each an essential component of the LUBAC complex, did not diminish linear ubiquitylation of <italic>ΔmxiE</italic> when compared to WT cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Similarly, the internally tagged 7KR-Ub variant decorated <italic>S. flexneri ΔmxiE</italic> independent of the LUBAC component HOIP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Collectively, these data demonstrate that LUBAC is dispensable for linear ubiquitylation of <italic>ΔmxiE</italic> bacteria in the host cell cytosol of IFNγ-primed A549 cells.</p>
<p>The ubiquitin E3 ligase RNF213 was recently shown to ubiquitylate pathogen-containing vacuoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>) as well as Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria inside the host cell cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Like HOIL-1, RNF213 is an IFNγ-inducible protein (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>)). Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we detected RNF213 on the surface of <italic>ΔmxiE</italic> but not WT bacteria in IFNγ-primed A549 as well colonic HT29 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D-G</xref>). The vast majority of ubiquitylated <italic>S.flexneri ΔmxiE</italic> mutants (∼93%) co-stained with anti-RNF213 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>), indicative of a functional role for RNF213 in the ubiquitylation of <italic>ΔmxiE</italic> bacteria. To directly probe for RNF213 function, we infected a pool of CRISPR-generated A549 RNF213<sup>KO</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>) with <italic>S. flexneri ΔmxiE</italic> and stained these IFNγ-primed cells for M1-, K27-, and K63-linked ubiquitin. We found that in the absence of human RNF213, antibodies specific for M1-, K27-, and K63-linked ubiquitin no longer stained the surface of <italic>S.flexneri ΔmxiE</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3H-I</xref>). In agreement with these immunofluorescence data, both WT and lysine-less ubiquitin (7KR-Ub) localized to <italic>ΔmxiE</italic> bacteria in WT but not in RNF213<sup>KO</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Together, these data demonstrate that human RNF213 is essential for the linear and lysine-linked ubiquitylation of MxiE-deficient <italic>S. flexneri</italic> mutants.</p>
<p>Ectopic expression of <italic>S. flexneri</italic> virulence factors IpaH1.4 or IpaH2.5 induces RNF213 degradation</p>
<p>The transcription factor MxiE induces the expression of several secreted effector proteins of the IpaH family that act as bacterial ubiquitin E3 ligases and tag host proteins for proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Since our data revealed that the <italic>S. flexneri</italic> virulence factor MxiE blocks bacterial ubiquitylation by RNF213, we hypothesized that <italic>S. flexneri</italic> infections induce the proteasomal degradation of RNF213 in a MxiE-dependent manner. To test this hypothesis, we measured RNF213 protein levels by immunoblotting in cells that had been infected with WT or <italic>ΔmxiE S. flexneri</italic>. Our data revealed that RNF213 protein levels are drastically reduced upon infection with WT <italic>S. flexneri</italic> and that the deletion of <italic>mxiE</italic> partially restored RNF213 expression in infected cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Similarly, and as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>), HOIP protein expression is diminished in cells infected with WT <italic>S. flexneri</italic> but much less so in the case of infections with <italic>ΔmxiE S. flexneri</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>).</p>

<p>To directly test whether <italic>S. flexneri</italic> promote proteasomal degradation of RNF213, we conducted infections in the presence of the proteasomal inhibitor MG132. As expected, MG132 largely restored RNF213 total protein levels in <italic>S. flexneri</italic>-infected cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). We next tested whether a specific IpaH effector facilitates the degradation of RNF213. To this end, we transiently expressed GFP-fusion proteins of individual IpaH family members in HEK 293T cells that ectopically expressed RNF213 and measured their effects on RNF213 protein levels by immunoblotting. Our mini-screen revealed that the ectopic expression of the two closely related paralogs IpaH1.4 and IpaH2.5 were sufficient to promote RNF213 degradation in HEK 293T cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Of note, the substrate-binding LRR domains of IpaH2.5 and IpaH1.4 are 98.9% identical in DNA sequence and were previously shown to have comparable substrate specificity and functional redundancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Both IpaH1.4 and 2.5 share a highly conserved NEL E3 ubiquitin ligase domain that contains an essential catalytic cysteine residue at position 368 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Catalytically inactive forms of IpaH1.4 or IpaH2.5, in which Cys368 is mutated to a serine (C/S), failed to degrade RNF213 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). As an additional control we included overexpression of IpaH9.8, an inhibitor of GBPs, which also did not impact RNF213 expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>), as anticipated.</p>
<p>To investigate potential physical interactions between IpaH1.4 and IpaH2.5, we reanalyzed a previously generated dataset that employed a method known as ubiquitin-activated interaction traps (UBAITs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). As depicted in Fig. S2A, the human ubiquitin gene was fused to the 3′ end of IpaH2.5, producing a C-terminal IpaH2.5-ubiquitin fusion protein. When incubated with ATP, a ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, and a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2, the IpaH2.5-ubiquitin “bait” protein is capable of binding to and ubiquitylating target substrates. This ubiquitylation creates an iso-peptide bond between the IpaH2.5 bait and its substrate, thereby enabling purification via a Strep affinity tag incorporated into the fusion construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). IpaH2.5-ubiquitin bait and IpaH3-ubiquitin control proteins were incubated with lysates from murine intestinal tissue. To detect interaction partners in a physiologically relevant setting, we used intestinal lysates derived from mice infected with <italic>Salmonella,</italic> which in contrast to <italic>Shigella</italic> causes pronounced inflammation in WT mice and therefore better simulates human <italic>Shigellosis</italic> in an animal model. Using UBAIT we identified HOIP (Rnf31) as a likely IpaH2.5 binding partner (Fig. S2B), thus confirming previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>) and validating the effectiveness of our approach. Strikingly, we identified mouse Rnf213 as the most abundant interaction partner of the IpaH2.5-ubiquitin bait protein (Fig. S2B). Collectively, our data and concurrent reports showing direct interactions between IpaH1.4 and human RNF213 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>) indicate that the virulence factors IpaH1.4 and IpaH2.5 directly bind and degrade mouse as well as human RNF213.</p>

<title>Loss of IpaH1.4 is sufficient to render <italic>S. flexneri</italic> susceptible to RNF213-driven ubiquitylation in human and murine host cells</title>

<p>Previous work showed that IpaH1.4 binds to and degrades the LUBAC subunit HOIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). To determine whether the degradation of RNF213 could be indirect and HOIP-dependent, or vice versa, we monitored RNF213 expression in HOIP<sup>KO</sup> cells and HOIP expression in RNF213<sup>KO</sup> cells. We found that expression of RNF213 remained at WT levels in the absence of HOIP and that the degree of IpaH1.4-dependent RNF213 degradation was comparable in WT and HOIP<sup>KO</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Similarly, infections with WT but not Δ<italic>ipaH1.4</italic> mutant <italic>S. flexneri</italic> resulted in a substantial reduction of HOIP protein expression in RNF213<sup>KO</sup> cells (Fig. S3B). These observations show that IpaH1.4 targets RNF213 and HOIP for degradation independent from each other.</p>
<p>The sustained RNF213 expression in cells infected with <italic>S. flexneri</italic> Δ<italic>ipaH1.4</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>) correlated with staining of cytosolic Δ<italic>ipaH1.4</italic> bacteria with RNF213 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B-C</xref>). As expected, the complementation of the Δ<italic>ipaH1.4</italic> mutant with WT IpaH1.4 efficiently prevented RNF213 recruitment to cytosolic bacteria, whereas complementation with catalytically inactive IpaH1.4 did not (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C-D</xref>). Through the use of linkage-specific antibodies, we also observed M1-, K27-, and K63-linked ubiquitin on cytosolic Δ<italic>ipaH1.4</italic> bacteria in IFNγ-primed WT A549 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5E</xref>, S3C-E). In contrast to IFNγ-primed WT A549 cells, IFNγ-primed RNF213<sup>KO</sup> A549 cells lacked linear ubiquitylation of Δ<italic>ipaH1.4</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). This ubiquitylation of <italic>S. flexneri</italic> Δ<italic>ipaH1.4</italic> was independent of LUBAC, as it occurred in HOIL-1<sup>KO</sup>, HOIP<sup>KO</sup>, and WT A549 cells at comparable frequencies (Fig. S3F).</p>
<p>Although <italic>S. flexneri</italic> is a human-adapted pathogen, some IFNγ-inducible host defense programs targeting <italic>S. flexneri</italic> and the corresponding bacterial evasion mechanisms transcend host barriers. For example, the <italic>Shigella</italic> virulence factor IpaH9.8 inhibits both human and murine guanylate binding proteins (GBPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). We therefore asked whether RNF213 ubiquitylates <italic>S. flexneri ΔipaH1.4</italic> in at least one other mammalian species, the mouse. To do so, we infected unprimed and IFNγ-primed WT and Rnf213<sup>KO</sup> mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs, Fig. S4A) with <italic>S. flexneri</italic> WT and <italic>ΔipaH1.4</italic> mutant. We observed that <italic>ΔipaH1.4</italic> bacteria became decorated with mouse Rnf213 (Fig. S4B) and linear ubiquitin chains (Fig. S4C). The IFNγ-dependent increase in the percentage of M1-ubiquiitn decorated <italic>ΔipaH1.4 S. flexneri</italic> bacteria was reversed in <italic>Rnf213</italic><sup>KO</sup> MEFs (Fig. S3C). Collectively, these data depict a conserved role for the mammalian ubiquitin E3 ligase RNF213 in cytosolic immune surveillance and demonstrate that IpaH1.4 can evade both mouse and human RNF213-driven linear ubiquitylation.</p>
<p>Ubiquitylated microbial cargo can be delivered into microbicidal lysosomes in an autophagy-like process commonly referred to as xenophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Previous work showed that linear ubiquitylation of <italic>S. enterica</italic> leads to bacterial clearance by xenophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). In contrast to the xenophagic killing of ubiquitylated <italic>S. enterica,</italic> we found that ubiquitylated <italic>S. flexneri ΔIpaH1.4</italic> and <italic>ΔmxiE</italic> mutant bacteria continued to replicate inside IFNγ-primed A549 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>), reminiscent of the continued growth of ubiquitylated <italic>B. thailandensis tssM</italic> mutants inside the host cell cytosol of human IFNγ-primed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Thus, our data indicate that <italic>S. flexneri</italic>, like <italic>B. thailandensis,</italic> can block ubiquitin-dependent xenophagy both at the stage of ubiquitylation and at another so far undetermined downstream step of this cell-autonomous host defense pathway.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Xenophagy is a cell-autonomous defense program in which intracellular pathogens are captured and delivered into degradative lysosomes. Ubiquitylation of intracellular pathogens is the most common initiating step for xenophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Like other steps of the xenophagy cascade, pathogen ubiquitylation is augmented in cells primed with the lymphocyte-derived cytokine IFNγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). An antimicrobial E3 ubiquitin ligase, RNF213, is itself an IFNγ-inducible protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Here, we report that the enteric human pathogen <italic>S. flexneri</italic> employs the T3SS effector IpaH1.4 to induce the proteasomal degradation of RNF213. Accordingly, loss of IpaH1.4 results in RNF213-depdendent ubiquitylation of <italic>S. flexneri</italic>. However, IpaH1.4-deficient <italic>S. flexneri</italic> mutants, despite their ubiquitylation, continue to replicate inside the cytosol of IFNγ-primed human cells. These observations suggest that <italic>S. flexneri</italic> not only evades RNF213-driven ubiquitylation but also the downstream degradation of ubiquitylated bacteria.</p>
<p>Accompanying previous reports on <italic>Chlamydia</italic> and <italic>Burkholderia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), our study on <italic>Shigella</italic> provides evidence that host-adapted intracellular pathogens escape from RNF213-driven host defense. Each of these pathogens evolved a mechanistically distinct strategy to escape ubiquitylation by RNF213. The soil-dwelling accidental pathogen <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> is recognized and ubiquitylated by RNF213 but instantly removes ubiquitin from its surface through the activity of its secreted ubiquitin esterase TssM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). The human pathogen <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> decorates its surrounding vacuole with the secreted T3SS effector GarD, which renders the <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-containing vacuole invisible to RNF213 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). In contrast to TssM and GarD, the <italic>Shigella</italic> effector IpaH1.4 is a direct inhibitor of RNF213, which is further supported by recently published biochemical studies demonstrating direct interactions between the LRR domain of IpaH1.4 and the RING domain of RNF213 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>).</p>
<p>IpaH1.4 and IpaH2.5 have nearly 99% sequence identity in their substrate-binding LRR domains and overexpression of either paralog is sufficient to trigger RNF213 degradation. However, only IpaH1.4 appears to be essential for <italic>S. flexneri</italic>-triggered RNF213 degradation – as shown in the present work – or for HOIP degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). While these observations agree with a previous report demonstrating low expression of IpaH2.5 under standard culture conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>), it remains to be seen whether IpaH2.5 is expressed and possibly redundant with IpaH1.4 for virulence during <italic>in vivo</italic> infections.</p>
<p>The mechanism by which IpaH1.4 and its paralog IpaH2.5 promote RNF213 degradation can be gleaned from previous studies characterizing IpaH1.4 and IpaH2.5 as ubiquitin E3 ligases that directly conjugate K48-linked ubiquitin to the LUBAC subunit HOIP leading to HOIP degradation by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Indeed, studies published during the revisions of our manuscript show that IpaH1.4 and IpaH2.5 similarly bind to and directly ubiquitylate RNF213 to facilitate RNF213’s proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Such direct interactions are additionally supported by our data showing that transient IpaH2.5-RNF213 interactions can be trapped via formation of covalent bonds between these proteins in a UBAIT assay.</p>
<p>The deletion of <italic>ipaH1.4</italic> leads to <italic>S. flexneri</italic> ubiquitylation in IFNγ-primed host cells. Different ubiquitin linkage types and their incorporation into heterotypic conjugates create a rich diversity of ubiquitin modifications with unique functional outputs, which is commonly referred to as the ‘ubiquitin code.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). We found that at least three linkage types are attached to <italic>S. flexneri</italic> Δ<italic>ipaH1.4</italic> in an RNF213-dependent manner: K27, K63, and linear (M1). Linear ubiquitylation is a head-to-tail inter-ubiquitin linkage through the amino group of the N-terminal methionine (M1) and the C-terminal carboxyl group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). The LUBAC complex is the only recognized ubiquitin E3 ligase able to conjugate M1-linked ubiquitin chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). However, we observed that LUBAC is dispensable for M1-linked ubiquitylation of cytosolic <italic>S. flexneri</italic> Δ<italic>ipaH1.4.</italic> We found that lysine-less internally tagged ubiquitin or an M1-specific antibody bound to <italic>S. flexneri</italic> Δ<italic>ipaH1.4</italic> in cells lacking LUBAC (HOIL-1<sup>KO</sup> or HOIP<sup>KO</sup>) but failed to bind bacteria in RNF213-deficient cells. These data corroborate our previous observations, which suggested that IFNγ-induced linear ubiquitylation of <italic>Chlamydia-</italic> and <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>-containing vacuoles occur independent of LUBAC in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). While RNF213 itself may catalyze such linear ubiquitin conjugation, it is equally possible that this reaction is carried out by additional ubiquitin E3 ligases that are being recruited to the bacterial surface alongside RNF213.</p>
<p>It was previously reported that RNF213 ubiquitylates LPS on the surface of <italic>S. enterica</italic> prompting the recruitment of LUBAC, which catalyzes the conjugation of linear ubiquitin to the surface of <italic>S. enterica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Whereas LUBAC was found to be essential for M1-linked ubiquitylation of cytosolic <italic>S. enterica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), we find that LUBAC is dispensable for M1-linked ubiquitylation of <italic>S. flexneri</italic> Δ<italic>ipaH1.4</italic> bacteria. While differences between <italic>S. enterica</italic> and <italic>S. flexneri,</italic> for example in the composition of their bacterial cell walls, could possibly contribute to these discrepant results, it is also important to note that the previous <italic>S. enterica</italic> infection studies were conducted in naïve cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), whereas our studies were performed under IFNγ priming conditions. We therefore propose that a boost in the expression of RNF213 and other IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) renders LUBAC obsolete for M1-linked ubiquitylation of Gram-negative bacteria. Future studies are needed to determine how RNF213 co-operates with LUBAC and other host factors to ubiquitin-tag intracellular pathogens.</p>
<p><italic>Shigella</italic> is a human adapted pathogen that secretes T3SS effectors to directly interfere with type I and III IFN signaling in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Additionally, <italic>Shigella</italic> employs virulence factors that inhibits ISGs which act downstream from IFN signaling. For example, the T3SS effector IpaH9.8 blocks the activity of IFNγ-inducible antimicrobial ISGs such as GBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Here we report that IpaH1.4 inactivates another ISG, <italic>i.e.</italic> RNF213. Because ubiquitylated <italic>S. flexneri</italic> Δ<italic>ipaH1.4</italic> and Δ<italic>mxiE</italic> mutants continue to replicate inside the cytosol of IFNγ-primed host cells, we propose that <italic>S. flexneri</italic> also uses a mxiE-independent T3SS effector to interfere with host defenses occurring downstream from RNF213. Collectively, these data indicate that <italic>Shigella</italic> is equipped with redundant counter-immune mechanisms. This type of bacterial effector redundancy is not unique to <italic>Shigella</italic>. It was recently shown that the rodent pathogen <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic> can tolerate various combinations of individual T3SS effector deletions <italic>in vivo,</italic> an observation that led to the ‘T3SS effector networks’ hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Further characterization of the <italic>Shigella</italic> T3SS effector network that renders bacteria resistant to IFNγ-inducible cell-autonomous immune program will provide a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of this important human enteric pathogen. Given the rise of extensively drug-resistant <italic>Shigella</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>), such an understanding may prove to be essential for the development of critically needed novel therapeutic approaches to treat Shigellosis.</p>

DNA of full length human RNF213 with N-terminal mCherry was a gift from Daisuke Morito (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). RNF213 was amplified in segments using PCR and cloned using Golden Gate assembly with the enzyme kit BsmBI-v2 (New England Biolabs). Endogenous BsmBI sites were removed from RNF213 by introducing silent mutations in primers used to add enzyme overhangs for Golden Gate assembly. RNF213 was first cloned into a modified Gateway donor vector pDONR221 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing a golden gate cloning site in between ATTP sites to make pENTR-mCherry-RNF213. mCherry-RNF213 was transferred into piggybac vector PB-TA-ERN using LR clonase enzyme (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for dox-inducible expression of mCherry-RNF213.

<p>RNF213 knockout mice were generated using a modified iGONAD methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). Briefly, 1-day time mated, vaginal-plug-positive 8 – 24-week-old C57BL/6J female mice were put under isoflurane anesthesia. A dorsal surgical incision was made, and the ovary/oviduct was exposed. The oviduct was injected with a 0.5 μL Cas9/CRISPR mix which included 6.1 μM Cas9 protein (IDT, Cat. #1081058), 30 μM sgRNAs (IDT, Alt-R CRISPR-Cas9 sgRNA), and 0.02% Fast Green FCF (VWR, Cat. #AAA16520-14) in Opti-MEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. #11058021). The 30 μM sgRNA concentration included the following two sgRNAs targeting exon 28 of Rnf213: 5’-TTAAATACTGGTAAGGTCGT(TGG)-3’ and 5’-AGTCGGAGTAGCAAAATCCC(TGG)-3’. After the Cas9/sgRNA mix injection, the oviducts were covered with tissue and then electroporated using a CUY21EDIT II (BEX Co., Ltd.) electroporator with the settings: Square mA mode, Pd V: 60 V, Pd A: 100 mA, Pd on: 5 ms, Pd off: 50 ms, Pd N: 3, and Decay: 10%. This procedure was done on both set of oviducts in the mouse. After surgery, female mice were housed together and at 19-21 days post-surgery monitored for pup birth. Pups were genotyped and three founder mice with out-of-frame 101 bp, 284 bp, or 407 bp deletions within exon 28, respectively, were selected and bred to homozygosity.

<title>UBAIT Substrate Capture Assays</title>
<p>UBAIT assays were performed essentially as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Briefly, unknown substrates were captured from colon and cecum lysates from 6-8 weeks old wild type C57BL/6 (Charles River) mice. All mouse infection experiments conducted were in accordance with the policies of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at UT Southwestern. Mice were orally infected by gavage with 1×10<sup>9</sup> <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> Typhimurium S1344 WT and after 4 days mice were euthanized and colon and cecum were removed, washed and homogenized in Lysis Buffer (1x Ubiquitination buffer (Boston Biochem), 1x protease inhibitor (Sigma), 1mM DTT). Homogenates were then centrifuged at 13,000g at 4°C for 10 minutes and supernatants were added to UBAIT reactions. The supernatant were incubated with 25 ug of purified Strep-IpaH2.5-3xFLAG-Ub or Strep-IpaH3-3xFLAG-Ub and rotated at 4°C. After 1 hour, His-UbE1 (100nM), His-UbcH5b (2000nM), energy regeneration buffer (Boston Biochem), MgCl (1mM) and 1 x ubiquitination buffer were added to a final volume of 500 µl. The reaction was run at 30°C for 10 minutes and then 300 µl TBS buffer (25 mM Tris-HCL pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1mM DTT) and 30 µl of washed Strep-Tactin Superflow beads (Iba LifeSciences) were added and rotated for 2 hours at 4°C. The beads were washed 4 times in TBS-T (TBS+ 0.5% Triton-X100) and 2 times in TBS. Strep-IpaH2.5-3xFLAG-Ub was eluted from the beads in 150 µl Strep-tag elution buffer (Iba LifeSciences). Eluted sample and beads were centrifuged, and supernatant moved to a new tube. SDS (0.25% final concentration) and DTT (5mM final concentration) were added, and samples were heated at 95°C for 5 minutes. Next, 1.2 ml TBS was added, followed by 20 µl of M2-FLAG beads (Sigma). The mixture was rotated for 2 hours at 4°C. M2-FLAG beads were washed 4 times in TBS-T followed by 2 times in TBS. Finally, 35 µl of hot (95°C) SDS-PAGE Loading Buffer was added and the beads were heated for an additional 5 minutes at 95°C. Samples were electrophoresed on a gradient precast SDS-PAGE gel (Biorad) and Coomassie stained. A lane of gel above the band with unmodified Strep-IpaH2.5-3xFLAG-Ub or Strep-IpaH3-3xFLAG-Ub was excised, and proteins were digested overnight with trypsin (Pierce) following reduction and alkylation with DTT and iodoacetamide (Sigma–Aldrich). Following solid-phase extraction cleanup with an Oasis HLB µelution plate (Waters), the resulting peptides were reconstituted in 10 µL of 2% (v/v) acetonitrile (ACN) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water. Two µL of each sample were injected onto an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos (Thermo) mass spectrometer, coupled to an Ultimate 3000 RSLC-Nano liquid chromatography systems (Thermo) at the Mass Spectrometry Core at University of Texas Southwestern. Samples were injected onto a 75 μm i.d., 75-cm long, (Lumos) EasySpray column (Thermo), and eluted with a gradient from 0-28% buffer B over 90 minutes. Buffer A contained 2% (v/v) ACN and 0.1% formic acid in water, and buffer B contained 80% (v/v) ACN, 10% (v/v) trifluoroethanol, and 0.1% formic acid in water. The Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer operated in positive ion mode with a source voltage of 2.0-2.4 kV and an ion transfer tube temperature of 275 °C. MS scans were acquired at 120,000 resolution in the Orbitrap and up to 10 MS/MS spectra were obtained in the Orbitrap for each full spectrum acquired using higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) for ions with charges 2-7. Dynamic exclusion was set for 25 seconds after an ion was selected for fragmentation. Raw MS data files were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer v.2.4 (Thermo), with peptide identification performed using Sequest HT searching against the human reviewed protein database from UniProt. Fragment and precursor tolerances of 10 ppm and 0.6 Da (Lumos) was specified, and three missed cleavages were allowed. Carbamidomethylation of Cys was set as a fixed modification and oxidation of Met was set as a variable modification. The false-discovery rate (FDR) cutoff was 1% for all peptides. The abundance of identified peptides found for Strep-IpaH2.5 UBAIT were compared to those found for control IpaH3 UBAIT that was included in the same experiment. Hits for IpaH2.5 were included when abundance levels were at least 2-fold higher than UBAIT controls.</p>

<p>Shigella flexneri is a bacterial pathogen that is an important globally significant cause of diarrhea. Shigella pathogenesis remains poorly understood. In their manuscript, Saavedra-Sanchez et al report their discovery that a secreted E3 ligase effector of Shigella, called IpaH1.4, mediates the degradation of a host E3 ligase called RNF213. RNF213 was previously described to mediate ubiquitylation of intracellular bacteria, an initial step in their targeting to xenophagosomes. Thus, Shigella IpaH1.4 appears to be an important factor to permit evasion of RNF213-mediated host defense. Strengths: The work is focused, convincing, well-performed and important, and the manuscript is well-written. The revised version addressed all the concerns raised during the initial review.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors find that the bacterial pathogen Shigella flexneri uses the T3SS effector IpaH1.4 to induce degradation of the IFNg-induced protein RNF213. They show that in the absence of IpaH1.4, cytosolic Shigella is bound by RNF213. Furthermore, RNF213 conjugates linear and lysine-linked ubiquitin to Shigella independently of LUBAC. Intriguingly, they find that Shigella lacking ipaH1.4 or mxiE, which regulates the expression of some T3SS effectors, are not killed even when ubiquitylated by RNF213 and that these mutants are still able to replicate within the cytosol, suggesting that Shigella encodes additional effectors to escape from host defenses mediated by RNF213-driven ubiquitylation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors take a variety of approaches, including host and bacterial genetics, gain-of-function and loss-of-function assays, cell biology, biochemistry, . Overall, the experiments are elegantly designed, rigorous, and convincing.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study the authors set out to investigate whether and how Shigella avoids cell autonomous immunity initiated through M1-linked ubiquitin and the immune sensor and E3 ligase RNF213. The key findings are that the Shigella flexneri T3SS effector, IpaH1.4 induces degradation of RNF213. Without IpaH1.4, the bacteria are marked with RNF213 and ubiquitin following stimulation with IFNg. Interestingly, this is not sufficient to initiate the destruction of the bacteria, leading the authors to conclude that Shigella deploys additional virulence factors to avoid this host immune response. The second key finding of this study is that M1 chains decorate the mxiE/ipaH Shigella mutant independent of LUBAC, which is by and large, considered the only enzyme capable of generating M1-linked ubiquitin chains. These findings are fundamental in nature and of general interest.</p>
<p>Strengths and weaknesses:</p>
<p>The data is well-controlled and clearly presented with appropriate methodology. The authors provide compelling evidence that demonstrates that IpaH1.4 is the effector responsible for the degradation of RNF213 via the proteasome and their conclusions are well supported. They have clearly demonstrated how Shigella disarms RNF213-mediated immunity.</p>
<p>This work builds on prior work from the same laboratory that suggests that M1 ubiquitin chains can be formed independently of LUBAC (in the prior publication this related to Chlamydia inclusions). Two key pieces of evidence support this statement - fluorescence microscopy-based images and accompanying quantification in Hoip and Hoil knockout cells for association of M1-ub, using an M1 specific antibody, and the use of an internally tagged Ub-K7R mutant. Whilst it remains possible that the M1 antibody is non-specific, as acknowledged by the authors, the data in supplementary figure 1, comparing K7R-ub and the N-terminally tagged K7R ub variant, provides evidence that during Shigella infection, LUBAC independent M1-ubiquitin chains are indeed formed. This represents an important new angle in ubiquitin biology.</p>
<p>The importance of IFNgamma priming for RNF213 association to the mxiE or ipaH1.4 remains an interesting question that awaits future studies that compare different intracellular bacteria and the role of RNF213.</p>
<p>Overall, the findings are important for the host-pathogen field, cell autonomous/innate immune signaling fields and microbial pathogenesis fields and the work is a very valuable addition to the recent advances in understanding the role of RNF213 in host immune responses to bacteria.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Shigella flexneri is a bacterial pathogen that is an important globally significant cause of diarrhea. Shigella pathogenesis remains poorly understood. In their manuscript, Saavedra-Sanchez et al report their discovery that a secreted E3 ligase effector of Shigella, called IpaH1.4, mediates the degradation of a host E3 ligase called RNF213. RNF213 was previously described to mediate ubiquitylation of intracellular bacteria, an initial step in their targeting of xenophagosomes. Thus, Shigella IpaH1.4 appears to be an important factor in permitting evasion of RNF213-mediated host defense.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The work is focused, convincing, well-performed, and important. The manuscript is well-written.</p>

<p>We would like to thank the reviewer for their time evaluating our manuscript and the positive assessment of the novelty and importance of our study. We provide a comprehensive response to each of the reviewer’s specific recommendations below and highlight any changes made to the manuscript in response to those recommendations.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) In the abstract (and similarly on p.10), the authors claim to have shown &quot;IpaH1.4 protein as a direct inhibitor of mammalian RNF213&quot;. However, they do not show the interaction is direct. This, in my opinion, would require demonstrating an interaction between purified recombinant proteins. I presume that the authors are relying on their UBAIT data to support the direct interaction, but this is a fairly artificial scenario that might be prone to indirect substrates. I would therefore prefer that the 'direct' statement be modified (or better supported with additional data). Similarly, on p.7, the section heading states &quot;S. flexneri virulence factors IpaH1.4 and IpaH2.5 are sufficient to induce RNF213 degradation&quot;. The corresponding experiment is to show sufficiency in a 293T cell, but this leaves open the participation of additional 293T-expressed factors. So I would remove &quot;are sufficient to&quot;, or alternatively add &quot;...in 293T cells&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer and made the recommended changes to the text in the abstract, in the results section on page 7, and in the Discussion on page 11. During the revision of our manuscript two additional studies were published that provide convincing biochemical evidence for the direct interaction between IpaH1.4 and RNF213 (PMID: 40205224; PMID: 40164614). These studies address the reviewer’s concern extensively and are now briefly discussed and cited in our revised MS.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In the abstract the authors state &quot;Linear (M1-) and lysine-linked ubiquitin is conjugated to bacteria by RNF213 independent of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC).&quot; However, it is not shown that RNF213 is able to directly perform M1-ubiquitylation. It is shown that RNF213 is required for M1-linked ubiquitylation in IpaH1.4 or MxiE mutants, this is different than showing conjugation is done by RNF213 itself. This should be reworded.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree and edited the text accordingly</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Introduction: one of the main points of the paper is that RNF213 conjugates linear ubiquitin to the surface of bacteria in a manner independent of the previously characterized linear ubiquitin conjugation (LUBAC) complex. This is indeed an interesting result, but the introduction does not put this discovery in much context. I would suggest adding some discussion of what was known, if anything, about the type of Ub chain formed by RNF213, and specifically whether linear Ub had previously been observed or not.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now provide context in the Introduction on page 3 and briefly discuss previous work that had implicated LUBAC in the ubiquitylation of cytosolic bacteria. We emphasize that LUBAC specifically generates linear (M1-linked) ubiquitin chains, while the types of ubiquitin linkages deposited on bacteria through RNF213-dependent pathways had remained unidentified.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Figure 3C: is the difference in 7KR-Ub between WT and HOIP KO cells significant? If so, the authors may wish to acknowledge the possibility that HOIP partially contributes to M1-Ub of MxiE mutant Shigella</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The frequencies at which bacteria are decorated with 7KR-Ub is not statistically different between WT and HOIP KO cells. We have included this information in the panel description of Figure 3.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) On page 11, the authors state that &quot;...we observed that LUBAC is dispensable for M1-linked ubiquitylation of cytosolic S. flexneri ∆ipaH1.4. We found that lysine-less internally tagged ubiquitin or an M1-specific antibody bound to S. flexneri ∆ipaH1.4 in cells lacking LUBAC (HOIL-1KO or HOIPKO) but failed to bind bacteria in RNF213-deficient cells&quot;. In fact, what is shown is that M1-ubiquitylation in ∆ipaH1.4 infection is RNF213-dependent (5E), but the work with lysine mutants, HOIP or HOIL-1 KOs are all with ∆mxiE, not ∆ipaH1.4 (3B) in this version of the manuscript. Ideally, the data with ∆ipaH1.4 could be added, but alternatively, the conclusion could be re-worded.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now include the data demonstrating that staining of ∆ipaH1.4 with an M1-specific antibody is unchanged from WT cells in HOIL-1 KO and HOIP KO cells. These data are shown in supplementary data (Fig. S3E) and referred to on page 9 of the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The UBAIT experiment should be explained in a bit more detail in the text. The approach is not necessarily familiar to all readers, and the rationale for using Salmonella-infected ceca/colons is not well explained (and seems odd). Some appropriate caution about interpreting these data might also be welcome. Did HOIP or HOIL show up in the UBAIT? This perhaps also deserves some discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As expected, HOIP (listed under its official gene name Rnf31 in the table of Fig.S2B) was identified as a candidate IpaH1.4 interaction partner as the third most abundant hit from the UBAIT screen. Remarkably, Rnf213 was the hit with the highest abundance in the IpaH1.4 UBAIT screen. To address the reviewer’s comments, we now explain the UBAIT approach in more detail and provide the rational for using intestinal protein lysates from <italic>Salmonella</italic> infected mice. The text on page 8 reads as follows: “To investigate potential physical interactions between IpaH1.4 and IpaH2.5, we reanalyzed a previously generated dataset that employed a method known as ubiquitin-activated interaction traps (UBAITs) (32). As shown in Fig. S2A, the human ubiquitin gene was fused to the 3′ end of IpaH2.5, producing a C-terminal IpaH2.5-ubiquitin fusion protein. When incubated with ATP, ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2, the IpaH2.5-ubiquitin &quot;bait&quot; protein is capable of binding to and ubiquitylating target substrates. This ubiquitylation creates an iso-peptide bond between the IpaH2.5 bait and its substrate, thereby enabling purification via a Strep affinity tag incorporated into the fusion construct (32). IpaH2.5-ubiquitin bait and IpaH3-ubiquitin control proteins were incubated with lysates from murine intestinal tissue. To detect interaction partners in a physiologically relevant setting, we used intestinal lysates derived from mice infected with <italic>Salmonella,</italic> which in contrast to <italic>Shigella</italic> causes pronounced inflammation in WT mice and therefore better simulates human <italic>Shigellosis</italic> in an animal model. Using UBAIT we identified HOIP (Rnf31) as a likely IpaH2.5 binding partner (Fig. S2B), thus confirming previous observations (28) and validating the effectiveness our approach. Strikingly, we identified mouse Rnf213 as the most abundant interaction partner of the IpaH2.5-ubiquitin bait protein (Fig. S2B). Collectively, our data and concurrent reports showing direct interactions between IpaH1.4 and human RNF213 (36, 37) indicate that the virulence factors IpaH1.4 and IpaH2.5 directly bind and degrade mouse as well as human RNF213.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) It would be helpful if the authors discussed their results in the context of the prior work showing IpaH1.4/2.5 mediate the degradation of HOIP. Do the authors see HOIP degradation? If indeed HOIP and RNF213 are both degraded by IpaH1.4 and IpaH2.5, are there conserved domains between RNF213 and HOIP being targeted? Or is only one the direct target? A HOIP-RNF213 interaction has previously been shown (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47289-2">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47289-2</ext-link>). Since they interact, is it possible one is degraded indirectly? To help clarify this, a simple experiment would be to test if RNF213 degraded in HOIP KO cells (or vice-versa)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestions. We conducted the proposed experiments and found that WT <italic>S. flexneri</italic> infections result in RNF213 degradation in both WT and HOIP KO cells. Similarly, we found that HOIP degradation was independent of RNF213. We have included these data in Figs. 5A and S3B of our revised submission. A study published during revisions of our paper demonstrates that the LRR of IpaH1.4 binds to the RING domains of both RNF213 and LUBAC (PMID: 40205224). We refer to this work in our revised manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors find that the bacterial pathogen Shigella flexneri uses the T3SS effector IpaH1.4 to induce degradation of the IFNg-induced protein RNF213. They show that in the absence of IpaH1.4, cytosolic Shigella is bound by RNF213. Furthermore, RNF213 conjugates linear and lysine-linked ubiquitin to Shigella independently of LUBAC. Intriguingly, they find that Shigella lacking ipaH1.4 or mxiE, which regulates the expression of some T3SS effectors, are not killed even when ubiquitylated by RNF213 and that these mutants are still able to replicate within the cytosol, suggesting that Shigella encodes additional effectors to escape from host defenses mediated by RNF213-driven ubiquitylation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors take a variety of approaches, including host and bacterial genetics, gain-of-function and loss-of-function assays, cell biology, and biochemistry. Overall, the experiments are elegantly designed, rigorous, and convincing.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors find that ipaH1.4 mutant S. flexneri no longer degrades RNF213 and recruits RNF213 to the bacterial surface. The authors should perform genetic complementation of this mutant with WT ipaH1.4 and the catalytically inactive ipaH1.4 to confirm that ipaH1.4 catalytic activity is indeed responsible for the observed phenotype.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to thank the reviewer for their time evaluating our manuscript and the positive assessment of our work, especially its scientific rigor. We conducted the experiment suggested by the reviewer and included the new data in the revised manuscript. As expected, complementation of the ∆ipaH1.4 with WT IpaH1.4 but not with the catalytically dead C338S mutant restored the ability of Shigella to efficiently escape from recognition by RNF213 (Figs. 5C-D).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors set out to investigate whether and how Shigella avoids cell-autonomous immunity initiated through M1-linked ubiquitin and the immune sensor and E3 ligase RNF213. The key findings are that the Shigella flexneri T3SS effector, IpaH1.4 induces degradation of RNF213. Without IpaH1.4, the bacteria are marked with RNF213 and ubiquitin following stimulation with IFNg. Interestingly, this is not sufficient to initiate the destruction of the bacteria, leading the authors to conclude that Shigella deploys additional virulence factors to avoid this host immune response. The second key finding of this paper is the suggestion that M1 chains decorate the mxiE/ipaH Shigella mutant independent of LUBAC, which is, by and large, considered the only enzyme capable of generating M1-linked ubiquitin chains.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The data is for the most part well controlled and clearly presented with appropriate methodology. The authors convincingly demonstrate that IpaH1.4 is the effector responsible for the degradation of RNF213 via the proteasome, although the site of modification is not identified.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1)The work builds on prior work from the same laboratory that suggests that M1 ubiquitin chains can be formed independently of LUBAC (in the prior publication this related to Chlamydia inclusions). In this study, two pieces of evidence support this statement -fluorescence microscopy-based images and accompanying quantification in Hoip and Hoil knockout cells for association of M1-ub, using an antibody, to Shigella mutants and the use of an internally tagged Ub-K7R mutant, which is unable to be incorporated into ubiquitin chains via its lysine residues. Given that clones of the M1-specific antibody are not always specific for M1 chains, and because it remains formally possible that the Int-K7R Ub can be added to the end of the chain as a chain terminator or as mono-ub, the authors should strengthen these findings relating to the claim that another E3 ligase can generate M1 chains de novo.</p>
<p>(2) The main weakness relating to the infection work is that no bacterial protein loading control is assayed in the western blots of infected cells, leaving the reader unable to determine if changes in RNF213 protein levels are the result of the absent bacterial protein (e.g. IpaH1.4) or altered infection levels.</p>
<p>(3)The importance of IFNgamma priming for RNF213 association to the mxiE or ipaH1.4 strain could have been investigated further as it is unclear if RNF213 coating is enhanced due to increased protein expression of RNF213 or another factor. This is of interest as IFNgamma priming does not seem to be needed for RNF213 to detect and coat cytosolic Salmonella.</p>
<p>
Overall, the findings are important for the host-pathogen field, cell-autonomous/innate immune signaling fields, and microbial pathogenesis fields. If further evidence for LUBAC independent M1 ubiquitylation is achieved this would represent a significant finding.</p>

<p>We would like to thank the reviewer for their time evaluating our manuscript and the positive assessment of our work and its significance. We provide a comprehensive response to the main three critiques listed under ‘weaknesses’ and also have responded to each of the reviewer’s specific recommendations below. We highlight any changes made to the manuscript in response to those recommendations.</p>
<p>(1) As the reviewer correctly pointed out, 7KR ubiquitin cannot only be used for linear ubiquitylation but can also function as a donor ubiquitin and can be attached as mono-ubiquitin to a substrate or to an existing ubiquitin chain as a chain terminator. To distinguish between 7KR INT-Ub signals originating from linear versus mono-ubiquitylation, we followed the reviewer’s advice and generated a N-terminally tagged 7KR INT-Ub variant. The N-terminal tag prevents linear ubiquitylation but still allows 7KR INT-Ub to be attached as a mono-ubiquitin. We found that the addition of this N-terminal tag significantly reduced but not completely abolished the number of Δ<italic>mxiE</italic> bacteria decorated with 7KR INT-Ub. These data are shown in a new Fig. S1 and indicate that 7KR lacking the N-terminal tag is attached to bacteria both in the form of linear (M1-linked) ubiquitin and as donor ubiquitin, possibly as a chain terminator. While we cannot rule out that the anti-M1 antibodies used here cross-react with other ubiquitin linkages, we reason that the 7KR data strongly argues that linear ubiquitin is part of the ubiquitin coat encasing IpaH1.4-deficient cytosolic <italic>Shigella.</italic> Collectively, our data show that both linear and lysine-linked (especially K27 and K63) ubiquitin chains are part of the RNF213-dependent ubiquitin coat on the surface of IpaH1.4 mutants. And furthermore, our data strongly indicate that this ubiquitylation of IpaH1.4 mutants is independent of LUBAC.</p>
<p>(2) We used GFP-expressing strains of <italic>S. flexneri</italic> for our infection studies and were therefore able to use GFP expression as a loading control. We have incorporated these data into our revised figures. These new data (Figs. 4A, 5A, and S3B) show that bacterial infection levels were comparable between WT and mutant infections and that therefore the degradation of RNF213 (or HOIP – see new data in Fig. S3B) is not due to differences in infection efficiency.</p>
<p>(3) We agree with the reviewer that the mechanism by which RNF213 binds to bacteria is an important unanswered question. Similarly, whether other ISGs have auxiliary functions in this process or whether binding efficiencies vary between different bacterial species are important questions in the field. However, these questions go far beyond the scope of this study and were therefore not addressed in our revisions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) An N-terminally tagged K7R-ub should be used as a control to test whether the signal found around the mutant shigella is being added via the N terminal Met into chains. As it is known that certain batches of the M1-specific antibodies are in fact not specific and able to detect other chain types, the authors should test the specificity of the antibody used in this study (eg against different di-Ub linkage types) and include this data in the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer in principle. The anti-linear ubiquitin (anti-M1) monoclonal antibody, clone 1E3, prominently used in this study was tested by the manufacturer (Sigma) by Western blotting analysis and according to the manufacturer “this antibody detected ubiquitin in linear Ub, but not Ub K11, Ub K48, Ub K63.” However, this analysis did not include all possible Ub linkage types and thus the reviewer is correct that the anti-M1 antibody could theoretically also detect some other linkage types. To address this concern, we added new data during revisions demonstrating that 7KR INT-Ub targeting to <italic>S. flexneri</italic> is largely dependent on the N-terminus (M1) of ubiquitin. Our combined observations therefore overwhelmingly support the conclusion that linear (M1-linked) as well as K-linked ubiquitin is being attached to the surface of IpH1.4 <italic>S. flexneri</italic> bacteria in an RNF213-dependent and LUBAC-independent manner.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The M1 signal detected on bacteria with the antibody is still present in either Hoip or Hoil KO’s but due to the potential non-specificity of the antibody, the authors should test whether K7R ub is detected on bacteria in the Hoil ko (in addition to Hoip KO). This would strengthen the authors’ data on LUBAC-independent M1 and is important because Hoil can catalyse non-canonical ubiquitylation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The specific linear ubiquitin-ligating activity of LUBAC is enacted by HOIP. We show that linear ubiquitylation of susceptible <italic>S. flexneri</italic> mutants as assessed by anti-M1 ubiquitin staining or 7KR INT-Ub recruitment occurs in HOIPKO cells at WT levels (Figs. 3B, 3C, S3E [new data]). In our view , these data unequivocally show that the observed linear ubiquitylation of cytosolic <italic>S. flexneri ipaH1.4</italic> and <italic>mxiE</italic> mutants is independent of LUBAC.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) For Figure 4A, do mxiE bacteria show similar invasion - authors should include a bacterial protein control to show levels of bacteria in WT and mxiE infected conditions. A similar control should be included in Figure 5A.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We used GFP-expressing strains of <italic>S. flexneri</italic> for our infection studies and were therefore able to use GFP expression as a loading control. We have incorporated these data into our revised figures. These new data (Figs. 4A, 5A, and S3B) show that bacterial infection levels were comparable between WT and mutant infections and that therefore the degradation of RNF213 (or HOIP – see new data in Fig. S3B) is not due to differences in infection efficiency.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Can the authors speculate why IFNg priming is needed for the coating of Shigella mxiE mutant but not in the case of Salmonella or Burkholderia? Is this just amounts of RNF213 or something else?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our studies we did not directly compare ubiquitylation rates of cytosolic <italic>Shigella, Burkholderia,</italic> and <italic>Salmonella</italic> bacteria with each other under the same experimental conditions. However, such a direct comparison is needed to determine whether IFNgamma priming is required for RNF213-dependent bacterial ubiquitylation of some but not other pathogens. Two papers published during the revisions of our manuscript (PMID: 40164614, PMID: 40205224) reports robust RNF213 targeting to IpaH1.4 <italic>Shigella</italic> mutants in unprimed cells HeLa cells (whereas we used A549 and HT29 cells). Therefore, differences in reagents, cell lines, and/or other experimental conditions may determine whether IFNgamma priming is necessary to observe substantial RNF213 translocation to cytosolic bacteria.</p>
