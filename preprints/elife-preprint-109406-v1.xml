<abstract><p>The mechanisms regulating the formation of organ-specific vasculature are still poorly understood. We have previously identified a population of late-forming endothelial progenitor cells in zebrafish embryos (termed secondary vascular field, SVF), which emerge from the lateral plate mesoderm after 24 hpf stage, after blood circulation has been initiated. Here we investigate the functional role of SVF cells and the molecular mechanisms that govern the emergence of these SVF cells and their contribution to vasculature. We identified that the bHLH transcription factor Hand2 and Junctional Adhesion Molecule Jam2b are expressed in the SVF-forming region and are required for the emergence of SVF cells in zebrafish embryos. Time-lapse imaging and <italic>jam2b:Cre</italic> based lineage tracing showed that SVF cells serve as the major source of the intestinal vasculature, including the supraintestinal artery (SIA) and subintestinal vein (SIV), which are subsequently remodeled to provide the blood flow to many internal organs. To analyze the functional role of <italic>jam2b</italic> and a related <italic>jam2a</italic> gene in vascular development, we generated double maternal-zygotic <italic>jam2a; jam2b</italic> mutants, which display a greatly reduced number of SVF cells and show defects in the intestinal vasculature development. Further analysis showed that <italic>hand2</italic> functions in the SVF-forming region upstream of <italic>jam2b</italic> and is required to induce expression of transcription factor <italic>etv2/etsrp,</italic> a known master regulator of vasculogenesis. In summary, our results identify new roles for Jam2 signaling and Hand2 function in the emergence of organ-specific vascular progenitors. The presence of similar progenitors in mammalian embryos suggests that this mechanism is evolutionarily conserved.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It has been well established that organ-specific blood vessels exhibit a large diversity of specialized endothelial cells. However, their developmental origin has been debatable. Previous studies have suggested that the progenitors of internal organ vasculature in mammalian embryos form by differentiation <italic>de novo,</italic> or vasculogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> Different studies have demonstrated that the endocardium, and endoderm or mesothelium may contribute to the organ vasculature in mammals and avian embryos.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> In contrast, several studies have argued that the posterior cardinal vein (PCV) serves as the major source of organ-specific vascular endothelial cells in zebrafish embryos.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> According to this model, individual cells from the PCV migrate at 30-48 hours post fertilization (hpf) and coalesce into the intestinal vessels, which include the supraintestinal artery (SIA) and the subintestinal vein (SIV). These vessels subsequently undergo remodeling and ultimately provide blood supply for the internal organs, including the pancreas and the liver.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> However, this model in zebrafish contrasts with the <italic>de novo</italic> vasculogenesis model, suggested in mammalian embryos. In addition, it is unclear if the PCV is the only or even the main source of internal organ-specific vascular progenitors.</p>
<p>In zebrafish, similar to mammalian embryos, the earliest vascular progenitors originate from the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) during late gastrulation and somitogenesis, and coalesce into the major axial vessels, the dorsal aorta (DA) and the PCV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> This process is thought to be largely complete by the 24 hpf stage, when blood circulation is first initiated. We have recently demonstrated that between 24 and 48 hpf a separate group of late-forming vascular progenitors emerges from the LPM along the yolk extension at the site termed the secondary vascular field (SVF).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> SVF cells can uniquely incorporate into the PCV after blood circulation has already been established, and show high expression of vascular progenitor markers, including <italic>etv2/etsrp, tal1/scl, npas4l,</italic> while they are negative for the expression of more differentiated endothelial markers such as <italic>kdrl</italic> or <italic>fli1a.</italic> Previous time-lapse imaging using <italic>etv2</italic> reporter lines demonstrated that SVF cells can contribute to the intestinal vasculature, including the SIA and SIV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> However, the ultimate fate of SVF cells has not been clear due to the absence of genetic tools to perform the lineage tracing. Furthermore, mechanisms regulating the emergence of SVF cells and their contribution to vasculature remain largely unknown.</p>
<p>To identify the molecular signature of SVF cells, we have previously performed transcriptomic analysis of the zebrafish trunk region at 30 hpf.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> This analysis identified some SVF marker genes, which have not been previously associated with vascular development, including <italic>junctional adhesion molecule 2b (jam2b).</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> Vertebrate JAM homologs have been implicated in diverse processes including leukocyte-endothelial interaction and transendothelial migration, maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), vascular development, and others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> A related zebrafish paralog <italic>jam2a</italic> has been previously implicated in HSC formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> However, the role of <italic>jam2b</italic> in vascular development has not been described.</p>
<p>Here we analyzed the role of zebrafish <italic>jam2b</italic> in the formation of intestinal vasculature and the emergence of SVF cells. We demonstrate that <italic>jam2b</italic> is expressed along the lateral plate mesoderm in the region that includes SVF cells. By using genetic lineage tracing and time-lapse imaging we demonstrate that <italic>jam2b-</italic>positive cells contribute to multiple tissues, including the mesothelium, pericardium, fin buds and venous and intestinal vasculature. To study the role of Jam2 homologs in vascular development, we have generated genetic mutants in <italic>jam2b</italic> and a related homolog <italic>jam2a</italic>. Double <italic>jam2a; jam2b</italic> maternal-zygotic mutants show a reduced number of SVF cells, which correlates with the defects in the formation of the intestinal and venous vasculature, and display reduced regenerative potential after endothelial cell ablation. We further demonstrate that the transcription factor <italic>hand2</italic> functions upstream of <italic>jam2b</italic> and is required for the formation of SVF cells. Altogether, our results identify a new role for Jam2 signaling and Hand2 function in the emergence of organ-specific vascular progenitors.</p>

<title><italic>Jam2b</italic> expression analysis</title>
<p>During the previous transcriptomic analysis, we have identified <italic>jam2b</italic> as one of the markers for SVF cells, which are late-forming vascular progenitors that emerge along the yolk extension at 24-48 hpf.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> As we and others have previously demonstrated, <italic>jam2b</italic> expression is localized to the ventrolateral region of the LPM along the anterior and trunk regions during 20 somite – 48 hpf stages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> It is bilaterally expressed along the yolk extension during 24-48 hpf, where SVF cells originate (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. S1</xref>). We have previously demonstrated that <italic>jam2b</italic> and the vascular progenitor marker <italic>etv2/etsrp</italic> expression in the SVF cells partially overlaps along the medial portion of <italic>jam2b</italic> expression domain within the mid-trunk region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup></p>

<title>Generation and characterization of <italic>jam2b<sup>Gt(2A-Gal4)</sup></italic> knock-in reporter line</title>
<p>To analyze <italic>jam2b+</italic> cells in live embryos, we used CRISPR / Cas9-mediated non-homologous recombination approach <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> to insert Gal4 transcriptional activator into the genomic locus of <italic>jam2b</italic> (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. S2A</xref>). Similar to the endogenous <italic>jam2b</italic> mRNA expression, <italic>jam2b<sup>Gt(2A-Gal4)ci55</sup>;UAS:GFP</italic> (further abbreviated as <italic>jam2b<sup>Gt(2A-Gal4)</sup>;UAS:GFP</italic>) expression was observed bilaterally in the lateral plate mesoderm along the yolk and yolk extension at 24 hpf (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. S2B</xref>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A,B</xref>). At 3 and 5 dpf <italic>jam2b<sup>Gt(2A-Gal4)</sup>;UAS:GFP</italic> expression was observed in the cell layer surrounding the yolk and yolk extension, which presumptively corresponds to the mesothelium (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C-F</xref>). GFP expression was also observed in a subset of muscle cells within the skeletal and craniofacial muscle, and in the cells at the periphery of the eye (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C-F</xref>). GFP expression in the trunk portion of the LPM partially overlapped with <italic>etv2</italic> expression in SVF cells at 30 hpf (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G-I</xref>). Interestingly, GFP-positive cells were observed in the vasculature between 30 hpf and 3 dpf (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J-R</xref>). The majority of GFP+ cells were located in the PCV, while a few cells were found within the ISV and SIA, and in less frequent cases contribution to the DA and parachordal lymphangioblasts (PLs) was observed (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. S3</xref>). In addition, some GFP cells were located in the thoracic duct at 4 dpf, suggesting that SVF cells contribute to lymphatic vasculature (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1S-U</xref>). Due to very bright GFP expression over the yolk, we could not reliably analyze GFP cell presence in the SIV vessel, which is also positioned over the yolk and yolk extension. Overall, these findings suggest that <italic>jam2b+</italic> cells contribute to the vasculature, including the PCV, ISVs, intestinal vasculature and lymphatics. These findings are consistent with our previously reported contribution of SVF cells to the PCV and intestinal vasculature <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>.</p>

<title><italic>Jam2b</italic>+ cells are derived from the lateral plate mesoderm and incorporate into functional vasculature</title>

<p>In an attempt to identify the origin of SVF cells, we analyzed <italic>jam2b<sup>Gt(2A-Gal4)</sup>;UAS:GFP</italic> expression at the 18-somite stage. Similar to <italic>jam2b</italic> mRNA expression, GFP-positive cells were located bilaterally in the lateral plate mesoderm, mostly lateral and ventral to the emerging <italic>etv2+</italic> vascular progenitors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G-I</xref>). There was no apparent overlap between <italic>jam2b<sup>Gt(2A-Gal4)</sup>;UAS:GFP</italic> and <italic>etv2</italic> expression at this stage. This domain largely overlapped with the expression domain of <italic>prrx1a</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2J-L</xref>), which labels the lateral portion of the LPM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> To analyze the behavior of these cells, we performed time-lapse imaging of <italic>jam2b<sup>Gt(2A-Gal4)</sup>;UAS:GFP</italic> embryos starting at the 18-somite stage. GFP-positive cells remained in the same LPM region from the 18-somite stage to 24-30 hpf stages (Movie 2). As the embryo continued to undergo convergent extension, the same LPM region became bilaterally located along the yolk extension. Thus, <italic>jam2b</italic>-expressing cells observed at 24-30 hpf along the yolk extension are derived from the ventrolateral portion of the LPM.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Genetic lineage tracing of <italic>jam2b+</italic> cells</title>
<p>To perform genetic lineage tracing of <italic>jam2b</italic>-expressing cells, we generated <italic>UAS:Cre</italic> and <italic>UAS:CreERT2</italic> zebrafish transgenic lines using Tol2 transgenesis. Subsequently they were crossed to <italic>jam2b<sup>Gt(2A-Gal4)</sup>; actb2:loxP-BFP-loxP-dsRed; fli1:GFP</italic> adults, which ubiquitously express floxed BFP under <italic>actb2</italic> promoter, in combination with the <italic>jam2b<sup>Gt(2A-Gal4</sup></italic> knock-in driver and vascular endothelial <italic>fli1:GFP</italic> reporter (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). This approach permanently labels <italic>jam2b</italic>-derived cells, which switch their color from BFP to dsRed due to Cre-LoxP recombination. The embryos were then analyzed at 3 dpf by confocal microscopy, revealing switched dsRed-positive cells in the presumptive mesothelial layer surrounding the yolk and yolk extension, a subset of skeletal muscle cells and vasculature (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B,E</xref>). In addition, both epicardial and myocardial layers within the heart were labeled by dsRed fluorescence (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C,D</xref>). An embryo negative for <italic>jam2b<sup>Gt(2A-Gal4)</sup></italic> expression was included for autofluorescence control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>). The majority of labeled vascular endothelial cells were positioned in the SIA and PCV, while a few cells were positioned in the DA, PL, and ISVs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F,G,I-K</xref>). Most ISVs, which showed dsRed expression, were venous, and very little contribution to arterial ISVs was observed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F,G,K</xref>). Due to intense dsRed fluorescence in the mesothelial layer along the yolk and yolk extension we were unable to reliably determine the contribution of <italic>jam2b+</italic> cells to the SIV. To determine when <italic>jam2b+</italic> cells contribute to vasculature, <italic>UAS:CreERT2</italic> line was crossed to <italic>jam2b<sup>Gt(2A-Gal4)</sup>; actb2:loxP-BFP-loxP-dsRed; fli1:GFP</italic> adults and 4-hydroxitamoxifen (4-OHT) was added at different time points to induce Cre-LoxP recombination. 4-OHT addition at 7 hpf mostly in labeled SIA with a smaller fraction of cells present in the SIV, PCV and venous ISVs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3L</xref>). Only cells in the SIA were labeled when 4-OHT was added at 22 hpf. Addition of 4-OHT at 7 hpf and subsequent washing out at 22 hpf resulted in the labeling of SIA and a small number of cells within the PCV (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3L</xref>). These results argue that <italic>jam2b+</italic> cells contribute to vasculature both before and after 22 hpf. However, contribution after 22 hpf was largely limited to the intestinal vasculature, which supports our findings that SVF cells show major contribution to the SIA and SIV.</p>

<title>Intestinal vasculature forms largely by new vasculogenesis</title>

To clarify the contribution of new vasculogenesis towards the intestinal vasculature, we photoconverted all vascular endothelial cells in <italic>etv2:Kaede</italic> transgenic line at 24 hpf stage, which expresses green to red photoconvertible Kaede in all vascular endothelial cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> and then analyzed the percentage of red and green labeled cells at 4 dpf in the intestinal vasculature over the yolk extension region, where SVF cells are observed.

<p>To analyze the functional role of Jam2b in vascular development, we generated <italic>jam2b</italic> mutants using CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome editing.

<p>Previous studies have argued that internal organ-specific vessels, including the intestinal vessels, are derived from the PCV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> According to the recent model, individual cells migrate and assemble into the two vessels, SIA and SIV, which can further branch and give rise to interconnecting vessels, ICV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> Our recent study challenged this model and showed that SVF cells can contribute to intestinal vasculature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> However, it has not been clear if SVF cells have only a minor contribution to the intestinal vasculature. Our current results suggest that SVF cells may be the main source of the intestinal vasculature, while the PCV only has a minor contribution. <italic>Etv2:Kaede</italic> photoconversion showed that most cells in the intestinal vasculature emerge after the 24 hpf stage and, therefore, they were not present in the PCV at the time of the photoconversion. Although <italic>jam2b<sup>Gt(2A-Gal4);</sup> UAS:Cre</italic> based lineage tracing resulted in only a fraction of the PCV and intestinal vessels labeled with switched dsRed expression, this could be due to the relative inefficiency or mosaic expression of Cre. Based on our earlier time-lapse lineage tracing experiments, it appears that some SVF cells migrate directly to the SIA and SIV, while others integrate into the PCV first, and only afterwards exit the PCV and migrate to the intestinal vasculature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> Thus, our model can be reconciled with the previous observations if some SVF cells first integrate into the PCV and subsequently contribute to the intestinal vasculature. It is also possible that the earlier studies focused largely on the anterior portion of the intestinal vasculature, which forms the plexus-like structure and is largely derived from the PCV. Our study focused on the mid-trunk region along the yolk extension, where SVF cells are positioned, which is posterior to the intestinal plexus, analyzed in the previous studies.</p>
<p><italic>jam2b</italic> expression within the LPM is observed during somitogenesis stages. It is evident that this region gives rise to diverse cell types, including mesothelial, pectoral fin, pericardium and muscle. Similar contribution has also been demonstrated for <italic>hand2</italic>-positive LPM cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> which largely overlap with <italic>jam2b</italic> expression. Only a small fraction of <italic>jam2b</italic>-positive cells contributes to the vascular endothelium. The cells fated to become endothelium are located at the edge of the medial portion of the <italic>jam2b</italic> expression domain in the trunk region, closest to the midline (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that all <italic>jam2b</italic> cells are multipotent initially, yet they experience different signals based on their relative position. The cells closest to the midline in the trunk region become induced to differentiate into vascular endothelium. The inductive signal is currently unknown and will require further investigation. Interestingly, <italic>vegfaa</italic> is expressed in the region where intestinal vessels form.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.= Furthermore, <italic>vegfaa</italic> mutants show reduced number of SVF cells, which correlates with the defects in the intestinal vessel formation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> suggesting that <italic>vegfaa</italic> could be a candidate signal.</p>
<p>During embryonic vasculogenesis arterial and venous progenitors originate from the LPM during somitogenesis stages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> While the arterial progenitors originate close to the midline, venous progenitors emerge from the more lateral portion of the LPM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> As we show here, early venous progenitors emerge adjacent to <italic>jam2b</italic>-positive LPM cells, which are positioned further laterally from the venous progenitors. While <italic>jam2b</italic> and <italic>etv2</italic> expression overlaps in later forming SVF cells, it does not appear to overlap in early endothelial progenitors, which was also corroborated in our scRNA-seq data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> We also did not observe <italic>jam2b<sup>Gt(2A-Gal4)</sup>; UAS:GFP</italic> expression in the PCV prior to 24 hpf stage, suggesting that <italic>jam2b</italic> may not be involved in early vasculogenesis. It appears that <italic>jam2b+</italic> LPM cells maintain vasculogenic potential until later stages past 24 hpf.</p>
<p>The mechanism of how <italic>jam2a; jam2b</italic> mutants regulate SVF cell specification is unclear. A previous study has demonstrated that antibodies against murine Jam-B (Jam2) inhibited angiogenesis in vitro and interfered with the VEGFR2 signaling pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> Our previous data indicate that VEGF signaling is required to upregulate <italic>etv2</italic> expression during early vasculogenesis, and it is also required for SVF cell emergence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> It is possible that Jam2 signaling is required to promote VEGF signaling, which will have to be investigated in future studies.</p>
<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that <italic>hand2</italic> function is required for the PCV development. <italic>npas4l</italic> and <italic>etv2</italic> expression were reduced in the venous progenitors, arguing that <italic>hand2</italic> functions upstream of these transcription factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> We show here that SVF cells are also absent in <italic>hand2</italic> mutants. It is possible that <italic>hand2</italic> directly regulates <italic>npas4l</italic> and /or <italic>etv2</italic> expression. Alternatively, <italic>hand2</italic> may function through <italic>jam2b</italic> and indirectly be involved in SVF specification through VEGF or a different pathway.</p>
<p>In summary, this study demonstrates that <italic>jam2b-</italic>positive LPM serves as a major source of internal organ-specific vascular progenitors and identifies the functional requirement for <italic>jam2a</italic> and <italic>jam2b</italic> in promoting <italic>etv2</italic> expression and vasculogenesis. Because analogous late-forming vascular progenitors have been also identified in the mammalian embryos,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> it is likely that the mechanisms regulating their emergence are also evolutionarily conserved. These results will be important to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the formation of different vascular beds and will promote the development of new approaches aimed at vascular regeneration.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Griciunaite et al. explores jam2b functions in the formation of late vascular precursors in what is termed the secondary heart field. The authors nicely show that expression of jam2b defines these cells in the lateral plate mesoderm and the intestinal vasculature using a target integration of Gal4 into the jam2b locus. This analysis is followed by using a UAS:cre approach to follow the lineage of jam2b expressing cells, demonstrating their contributions to the vasculature during a second round of specification of vascular precursors. This is confirmed with single-cell analysis of jam2b-gal4 expressing cells. The authors then explore the genetic requirements of jam2a and b in zebrafish and also show that hand2 functions in the secondary heart field upstream of jam2b.</p>
<p>Overall, the experimental evidence and results support the major conclusions. The study elucidates a novel role for jam2 in the specification of vascular precursors at later stages of development.</p>
<p>This understanding has important implications for treating vascular disease and regenerative therapies. The manuscript is very clearly written, and the major conclusions are likely to have a lasting impact on the field.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Griciunaite et al. report on the function of jam2b and hand2 in the formation of the intestinal vasculature derived from late-forming endothelial cells (ECs) within the secondary vascular field (SVF). They generate transgenic lines that allow for the tracking of jam2b-expressing cells, both with fluorescent proteins and through Cre-mediated recombination in reporter lines. They also show that double maternal zygotic mutants in jam2a and jam2b, as well as hand2 mutants, display defects in the formation of the intestinal vasculature.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The results are interesting, as they address the important question of how blood vessels form during later developmental time points and potentially identify specific genes regulating this process.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors generate a new tool, a Gal4 knock-in of the jam2b locus, to track EGFP-expressing cells over time and follow the developmental trajectory of jam2b-expressing cells. Figure 1 characterizes the line. However, it lacks quantification, e.g., how many etv2-expressing cells also show EGFP expression or the contribution of EGFP-expressing cells to different types of blood vessels. This type of quantification would be useful, as it would also allow for comparison of their findings to their previous data examining the contribution of SVF cells to different types of blood vessels. All the authors state that at 30 hpf, EGFP-expressing cells can be seen in the vasculature (apparently the PCV).</p>
<p>It is not clear why the authors do not use a nuclear marker for both ECs (as they did in their previous publication) and for jam2b-expressing cells. UAS:nEGFP and UAS:NLS-mcherry (e.g. pt424tg) transgenic lines are available. This would circumvent the problem the authors encounter with the strong fluorescence visible in the yolk extension. It would also facilitate quantifying the contribution of jam2b cells to different types of blood vessels.</p>
<p>(2) The time-lapse movie in Figure 2 is not very informative, as it just provides a single example of a dividing cell contributing to the PCV. Also, quantifications are needed. As SVF cells appear to expand significantly after their initial specification, it would be informative to know how many cell divisions and which types of blood vessels jam2b-expressing cells contribute to. Can the authors observe cells that give rise to different types of blood vessels? Jam2b expression in LPM cells apparently precedes expression of etv2. Is etv2 needed for maintenance, or do Jam2b-expressing cells contribute to different types of tissues in etv2 mutant embryos? Comparing time-lapse analysis in wildtype and etv2 mutant embryos would address this question.</p>
<p>(3) In Figure 3, the authors generate UAS:Cre and UAS:Cre-ERT2 transgenic lines to lineage trace the jam2b-expressing cells. It is again not clear why the authors do not use a responder line containing nuclear-localized fluorescent proteins to circumvent the strong expression of fluorescent proteins in the yolk extension. It is also unclear why the two transgenic lines give very different results regarding the number of cells being labelled. The ERT2 fusions label around 3 cells in the SIA, while the Cre line labels only about 1.5 cells per embryo, with very little contribution of labelled cells to other blood vessels. One would expect the Cre line requiring tamoxifen induction to label fewer cells when compared to the constitutive Cre line. What is the reason for this discrepancy? Are the lines single integration? Is there silencing? This needs to be better characterized, also regarding the reproducibility of the experiments. If the Cre lines were to be multiple copy integrations, outcrossing the line might lead to lower expression levels in future generations.</p>
<p>It is also not clear how the authors conclude from these findings that &quot;SVF cells show major contribution to the SIA and SIV&quot; when only 1.5 or 3 cells of the SIA are labelled, with even fewer cells labelled in other blood vessels. They speculate that this might be due to low recombination efficiency, a question they then set out to answer using photoconversion of etv2:KAEDE expressing cells, an experiment that they also performed in their 2014 and 2022 publications. To check for low recombination efficiency, the authors could examine the expression of Cre mRNA in their transgenic embryos. Do many more jam2b expressing cells express Cre mRNA than they observe in their switch lines? They could also compare their experiments using Cre recombinase with those using EGFP expression in jam2b cells. EGFP is relatively stable, and the time frames the authors analyze are short. As no quantification of EGFP-expressing cells is provided in Figure 1, this comparison is currently not possible. Do these two different approaches answer different questions here?</p>
<p>(4) Concerning the etv2:KAEDE photoconversion experiments: The percentages the authors report for SVF cells' contribution to the SIV and SIA differ from their previous study (Dev Cell, 2022). In that publication, SVF cells contributed 28% to the SIA and 48% to the SIV. In the present study, the numbers are close to 80% for both vessels. The difference is that the previous study analyzed 2dpf old embryos and the new one 4dpf old embryos. Do SVF-derived cells proliferate more than PCV-derived cells, or is there another explanation for this change in percentage contribution?</p>
<p>(5) Single-cell sequencing data: Why do the authors not show jam2b expression in their single-cell sequencing data? They sorted for (presumably) jam2b-expressing cells and hypothesize that jam2b expression in ECs at this time point is important for the generation of intestinal vasculature. Do ECs in cluster 15 express jam2b? Why are no other top marker genes (tal1, etv2, egfl7, npas4l) included in the dot blot in Figure 5b?</p>
<p>(6) Concerns about cell autonomy of mutant phenotypes: The authors need to perform in situ hybridization to characterize jam2a expression. Can it be seen in SVF cells? The double mutants show a clear phenotype in intestinal vessel development; however, it is unclear whether this is due to a cell-autonomous function of jam2a/b within SVF cells. The authors need to address this issue, as jam2b and potentially also jam2a are expressed within the tissue surrounding the forming SVF. For instance, do transplanted mutant cells contribute to the intestinal vasculature to the same extent as wild-type cells do?</p>
<p>(7) Finally, the authors analyze the phenotypes of hand2 mutants and their impact on the expression of jam2b and etv2. They observe a reduction in jam2b and etv2 expression in SVF cells. However, they do not show the vascular phenotypes of hand2 mutants. Is the formation of the SIA and SIV disturbed? Is hand2 cell autonomously needed in ECs? The authors suggest that hand2 controls SVF development through the regulation of jam2b. However, they also show that jam2b mutants do not have a phenotype on their own. Clearly, hand2, if it were to be required in ECs, regulates other genes important for SVF development. These might then regulate jam2b expression. The clear linear relationship, as the title suggests, is not convincingly shown by the data.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study by Griciunaite et al. investigates the function of the adhesion molecule Jam2 in initiating the formation of organ (intestinal)-specific vasculature in zebrafish. Their previous studies identified a group of late-forming vascular progenitors from the lateral plate mesoderm along the yolk extension termed the secondary vascular field (SVF), which can contribute to intestinal vasculature. Transcriptomic analysis of the zebrafish trunk region identified SVF-enriched marker genes, which include jam2b. They then performed expression analysis of jam2b using whole-mount in situ hybridization and Gal4 knock-in transgenic line analysis. These analyses show that jam2b is expressed in the SVF cells that correspond to etv2 and kdrl expression past 24 hours. Lineage tracing combining jam2b:Gal4 and UAS:Cre or UAS:CreERT2 show the contribution of jam2b in SVF and intestinal vasculature formation. jam2b mutations did not cause observable defects in the vasculature, but combined jam2a; jam2b mutations led to impaired ISV, PCV, SIA, SIV and thoracic duct lymphatic vasculature formation. Finally, the authors show that mutations in the transcription factor hand2 led to reduced jam2b expression and impaired SVF formation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors accomplished many feats in generating new reporter lines and mutations that are valuable to the community. The study provided an interesting perspective on organ-specific vascular development and origin heterogeneity. The genetic aspects of the study are clean, and the mutational phenotypes are convincing.</p>
<p>Several suggestions and major comments that can improve the manuscript include:</p>
<p>(1) Overall molecular mechanisms of Jam2 function are not fully uncovered in the study. How do the adhesion molecules Jam2a and Jam2b regulate SVF cell formation? Are they responsible for migration, adhesion or fate determination of these structures? The authors should provide a more in-depth study of the jam2a, jam2b mutations and assess the processes affected in these mutants. Combining these mutants with etv2:Kaede can also provide a stronger causative link between their functions and defects in SVF formation.</p>
<p>(2) Have the authors tested the specificity of the jam2b knock-in reporter line? This is an important experiment, as many of the conclusions derive from lineage tracing and fluorescence reporting from this knock-in line. One suggestion is to cross the jam2b:GFP or jam2b:Gal4, UAS:GFP line to the generated jam2b mutants, and examine the expression pattern of these lines. Considering that the ISH experiment showed lack of jam2b expression, the reporter line should not be expressed in the jam2b mutants.</p>
<p>(3) The rationale behind the regeneration study is not clear, and the mechanisms underlying the phenotype are not well described. How do the authors explain the phenotype with the impaired regeneration, and what is the significance of this finding as it relates to SVF formation and function?</p>
<p>(4) The authors need to include representative images of jam2b&gt;CreERT2 with 4-OH activation at different timepoints in Figure 3.</p>
<p>(5) The etv2:Kaede photoconversion experiment to show that the majority of intestinal vasculature derives after 24 hours needs to be supplemented with additional data on photoconverted post-24-hour-old endothelial cells, with the expectation that the majority of intestinal endothelial cells at 4 days will then be labeled with red Kaede. In addition, there have been data that show the red Kaede protein is not stable past several days in vivo, and 3 days might be sufficient for the removal or degradation of this photoconverted protein. Thus, the statement that intestinal vasculature forms largely by new vasculogenesis might be too strong based on existing data.</p>
<p>(6) To strengthen the claim that hand2 acts upstream of jam2b, the authors can perform combinatorial genetic epistatic analysis and examine whether jam2b mutations worsen hand2 homozygous or heterozygous effects on the SVF. Similarly, overexpressing jam2b might rescue the loss of SVF/etv2 expression in hand2 mutants.</p>

<p>We agree with the importance of quantification. We had performed quantification of <italic>jam2b<sup>Gt(2A-Gal4)</sup>;UAS:GFP</italic> contribution to different vascular beds, which was shown in Suppl. Fig. S3. We will clarify this in the revision. We also agree that nuclear GFP or mCherry would help to visualize and quantify cells. Unfortunately, we do not have nuclear UAS:GFP or UAS:mCherry line in our possession, and it will take too long to import it for the standard revision timeline. We are working on the construct, and will attempt to establish the line; therefore we are hoping to clarify these results with the nuclear line in the revised manuscript.</p>

We had previously performed detailed time-lapse analysis and quantification of SVF cell migration to PCV, SIA and SIV using <italic>etv2-2A-Venus</italic> line (Metikala et al 2022, Dev Cell), which has some of the same (or similar) information. It is very challenging to obtain this data using <italic>jam2b</italic> reporter line due to extensive and bright GFP expression in the mesothelial layer over the yolk and yolk extension; for that reason we can only trace some GFP cells but not all of them. Regarding <italic>etv2</italic> requirement for <italic>jam2b</italic> maintenance, we intend to address this question by analyzing <italic>jam2b</italic> cell contribution in <italic>etv2</italic> MO injected embryos, which recapitulates the phenotype in <italic>jam2b</italic> mutants.</p>

<p>(3) In Figure 3, the authors generate UAS:Cre and UAS:Cre-ERT2 transgenic lines to lineage trace the jam2b-expressing cells. It is again not clear why the authors do not use a responder line containing nuclear-localized fluorescent proteins to circumvent the strong expression of fluorescent proteins in the yolk extension. It is also unclear why the two transgenic lines give very different results regarding the number of cells being labelled. The ERT2 fusions label around 3 cells in the SIA, while the Cre line labels only about 1.5 cells per embryo, with very little contribution of labelled cells to other blood vessels. One would expect the Cre line requiring tamoxifen induction to label fewer cells when compared to the constitutive Cre line. What is the reason for this discrepancy? Are the lines single integration? Is there silencing? This needs to be better characterized, also regarding the reproducibility of the experiments. If the Cre lines were to be multiple copy integrations, outcrossing the line might lead to lower expression levels in future generations.</p>
<p>It is also not clear how the authors conclude from these findings that &quot;SVF cells show major contribution to the SIA and SIV&quot; when only 1.5 or 3 cells of the SIA are labelled, with even fewer cells labelled in other blood vessels. They speculate that this might be due to low recombination efficiency, a question they then set out to answer using photoconversion of etv2:KAEDE expressing cells, an experiment that they also performed in their 2014 and 2022 publications. To check for low recombination efficiency, the authors could examine the expression of Cre mRNA in their transgenic embryos. Do many more jam2b expressing cells express Cre mRNA than they observe in their switch lines? They could also compare their experiments using Cre recombinase with those using EGFP expression in jam2b cells. EGFP is relatively stable, and the time frames the authors analyze are short. As no quantification of EGFP-expressing cells is provided in Figure 1, this comparison is currently not possible. Do these two different approaches answer different questions here?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer brings up important points, we appreciate that. Unfortunately, we do not have a nuclear switch line in our possession, and it is not possible to obtain it in the normal manuscript revision time line. Regarding UAS:Cre and UAS:CreERT2 lines, they both show rather similar labeling, with most labeled cells present in the SIA. The difference in cell number (1.5 versus 3) is likely due to different levels of Cre expression, which may vary dependent on the integration site. The lines most likely are multi-copy integrations, which can be helpful, as this would result in higher Cre expression. We will address the silencing question by performing in situ hybridization or HCR analysis for Cre or CreERT2 and comparing it with endogenous <italic>jam2b</italic> expression, as the reviewer suggested. We have noticed that the switch line used, <italic>actb2:loxP-BFP-loxP-dsRed,</italic> exhibits lower recombination frequency compared to other switch lines (we used it because it was compatible with endothelial fli1:GFP line). We will attempt to answer this question by crossing to other switch lines, which may exhibit higher recombination frequency. In principle, UAS:GFP and switch lines should produce a similar result, except that GFP decays over time and therefore our initial expectation was that switch lines may produce a more accurate result. However, this may not be the case due to low recombination efficiency, which we will attempt to address in the revision.</p>

<p>(4) Concerning the etv2:KAEDE photoconversion experiments: The percentages the authors report for SVF cells' contribution to the SIV and SIA differ from their previous study (Dev Cell, 2022). In that publication, SVF cells contributed 28% to the SIA and 48% to the SIV. In the present study, the numbers are close to 80% for both vessels. The difference is that the previous study analyzed 2dpf old embryos and the new one 4dpf old embryos. Do SVF-derived cells proliferate more than PCV-derived cells, or is there another explanation for this change in percentage contribution?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>These numbers refer to different experiments; we apologize for the confusion. As reported earlier in Metikala et 2022, 28% of SVF cells contributed to the SIA and 48% to the SIV by 3 dpf (not 2 dpf; only PCV analysis was done at 2 dpf); SIA and SIV analysis was done based on time-lapse image analysis of etv2-2A-Venus line at 3 dpf, shown in Fig. 3C in Metikala et al. However, this only refers to SVF cell contribution. It does not mean that 28% or 48% cells in SIA or SIV are derived from SVF. The total fraction of SIA and SIV cells that are derived from SVF has not been quantified in the previous study, because that would require accurate tracking of all SVF cells, which is experimentally challenging. Etv2:Kaede experiment is slighly different, because it reports newly formed cells after 24 hpf. It cannot tell if new cells are all derived from SVF cells, although we are not aware of any other source of new endothelial cells at these stages. In the previous study by Metikala et al 2022, we reported ~22 newly formed SIA and ~50 newly formed cells in SIV by 3 dpf (Fig. 1 in Metikala et al 2022), although the entire number of cells was not quantified, therefore the percentage was not known. In the current study, we attempted to estimate the entire percentage of green only Kaede cells, which was close to 80% in both SIA or SIV at 4 dpf. Please note that this estimate was performed in the posterior portion of SIA and SIV that overlies the yolk extension and where SVF cells are observed. We did not quantify cells in the anterior SIV portion, which forms the basket over the yolk.</p>

<p>(5) Single-cell sequencing data: Why do the authors not show jam2b expression in their single-cell sequencing data? They sorted for (presumably) jam2b-expressing cells and hypothesize that jam2b expression in ECs at this time point is important for the generation of intestinal vasculature. Do ECs in cluster 15 express jam2b? Why are no other top marker genes (tal1, etv2, egfl7, npas4l) included in the dot blot in Figure 5b?</p>

<p>We appreciate the suggestion and will include additional marker genes as well as <italic>jam2b</italic> in the revised version of the manuscript.</p>

<p>(6) Concerns about cell autonomy of mutant phenotypes: The authors need to perform in situ hybridization to characterize jam2a expression. Can it be seen in SVF cells? The double mutants show a clear phenotype in intestinal vessel development; however, it is unclear whether this is due to a cell-autonomous function of jam2a/b within SVF cells. The authors need to address this issue, as jam2b and potentially also jam2a are expressed within the tissue surrounding the forming SVF. For instance, do transplanted mutant cells contribute to the intestinal vasculature to the same extent as wild-type cells do?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p><italic>jam2a</italic> expression has been characterized in the previous studies and it is shown in the Suppl. Fig. S4E. It is primarily enriched in the skeletal muscle. However, our single-cell RNA-seq analysis shows that SVF cells also express <italic>jam2a</italic>. We will include additional data on <italic>jam2a</italic> expression in the revised manuscript. We agree that transplation to address cell autonomy is an important experiment, yet there are some practical challenges to it. <italic>Jam2a,jam2b</italic> mutant phenotype is only partially penetrant, and about 50% reduction in SVF cell number, as well as partial SIA and SIV phenotypes are observed. Only a small number of transplanted cells may contribute to intestinal vasculature, therefore it may be challenging to see the differences, given the partial penetrance. In an attempt to address cell -autonomy question, we will try a different approach. We will overexpress <italic>jam2b</italic> labeled with 2A-mCherry, and test if it can rescue the mutant phenotype in cell autonomous manner. Overexpression will be done in a mosaic manner, with higher number of cells labeled than in a typical transplantation experiment.</p>

<p>(7) Finally, the authors analyze the phenotypes of hand2 mutants and their impact on the expression of jam2b and etv2. They observe a reduction in jam2b and etv2 expression in SVF cells. However, they do not show the vascular phenotypes of hand2 mutants. Is the formation of the SIA and SIV disturbed? Is hand2 cell autonomously needed in ECs? The authors suggest that hand2 controls SVF development through the regulation of jam2b. However, they also show that jam2b mutants do not have a phenotype on their own. Clearly, hand2, if it were to be required in ECs, regulates other genes important for SVF development. These might then regulate jam2b expression. The clear linear relationship, as the title suggests, is not convincingly shown by the data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As suggested, we will add the analysis of SIA and SIV in <italic>hand2</italic> mutants during the revision process. We could not assess that easily because the line was not maintained in vascular <italic>fli1:GFP</italic> background. We do not know if <italic>hand2</italic> is required cell-autonomously. This is an important question, but it may be answered better in a separate study. Regarding <italic>hand2-jam2b</italic> axis, it is very clear that <italic>jam2b</italic> expression in the posterior lateral plate mesoderm is completely lost in <italic>hand2</italic> mutants, except for its more anterior domain over the yolk. This does support the idea that <italic>hand2</italic> functions upstream of <italic>jam2b</italic>. However, the relationship may not be necessarily direct. We agree that <italic>hand2</italic> may regulate additional genes involved in SVF cell development. We will attempt to clarify this relationship and test if <italic>jam2b</italic> overexpression may rescue <italic>hand2</italic> mutant phenotype.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Overall molecular mechanisms of Jam2 function are not fully uncovered in the study. How do the adhesion molecules Jam2a and Jam2b regulate SVF cell formation? Are they responsible for migration, adhesion or fate determination of these structures? The authors should provide a more in-depth study of the jam2a, jam2b mutations and assess the processes affected in these mutants. Combining these mutants with etv2:Kaede can also provide a stronger causative link between their functions and defects in SVF formation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our data argue that the initial SVF cell specification (based on <italic>etv2</italic> expression) is reduced in <italic>jam2a;jam2b</italic> mutants. We do not know if the migration or fate determination of the remaining SVF cells is also affected, although this may be more challenging to answer, as there are only few SVF cells remaining. We agree that further mechanistic studies of <italic>jam2a,jam2b</italic> function are needed. However, we think that this would be better addressed in a separate study. We are currently raising mutants crossed into <italic>fli1:Kaede</italic> line, which should confirm that there are fewer new cells that emerge after Kaede photoconversion in <italic>jam2a,jam2b</italic> mutants.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Have the authors tested the specificity of the jam2b knock-in reporter line? This is an important experiment, as many of the conclusions derive from lineage tracing and fluorescence reporting from this knock-in line. One suggestion is to cross the jam2b:GFP or jam2b:Gal4, UAS:GFP line to the generated jam2b mutants, and examine the expression pattern of these lines. Considering that the ISH experiment showed lack of jam2b expression, the reporter line should not be expressed in the jam2b mutants.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We show in Suppl. Fig. 2 that <italic>jam2b<sup>Gt(2A-Gal4)</sup>;UAS:GFP</italic> knock-in line has similar expression pattern as <italic>jam2b</italic> mRNA by in situ hybridization, which argues for its specificity. In the revision, we plan to use HCR analysis to confirm than <italic>jam2b</italic> mRNA is expressed in the same cells as <italic>jam2b<sup>Gt(2A-Gal4)</sup>;UAS:GFP</italic>, as an additional evidence for its specificity. Unfortunately, it is not feasible to cross <italic>jam2b</italic> knock-in line into <italic>jam2b</italic> mutants, as suggested by the reviewer. Because <italic>jam2b</italic> knock-in line targets the endogenous <italic>jam2b</italic> genomic locus, which is very close in the genome to <italic>jam2b</italic> promoter deletion in <italic>jam2b</italic> mutants, the recombination frequency would be very low, and we would not get double <italic>jam2b</italic> knock-in and knock-out events in the same chromosome.</p>

<p>(3) The rationale behind the regeneration study is not clear, and the mechanisms underlying the phenotype are not well described. How do the authors explain the phenotype with the impaired regeneration, and what is the significance of this finding as it relates to SVF formation and function?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for this omission. This experiment was more thouroughly described in our previous study by Metikala et al 2022. In that study we showed that when endothelial cells are ablated by treating with MTZ from 6 to 45 hpf, this results in ablation of all vascular endothelial cells except for SVF cells, because they originate later than other cells. We subsequently showed that these SVF cells can partially form PCV and intestinal vasculature, helping them regenerate, which was confirmed by time-lapse imaging. In the current study, we tested if <italic>jam2a; jam2b</italic> double mutants show defects in such vascular regeneration. Indeed, regeneration after cell ablation was reduced, which correlated with reduction in SVF cell number. This argues that jam2a/b function is required for SVF cell emergence and vascular recovery after endothelial cell ablation. We will provide better description of this experiment and discuss interpretations in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(4) The authors need to include representative images of jam2b&gt;CreERT2 with 4-OH activation at different timepoints in Figure 3.</p>

<p>(5) The etv2:Kaede photoconversion experiment to show that the majority of intestinal vasculature derives after 24 hours needs to be supplemented with additional data on photoconverted post-24-hour-old endothelial cells, with the expectation that the majority of intestinal endothelial cells at 4 days will then be labeled with red Kaede. In addition, there have been data that show the red Kaede protein is not stable past several days in vivo, and 3 days might be sufficient for the removal or degradation of this photoconverted protein. Thus, the statement that intestinal vasculature forms largely by new vasculogenesis might be too strong based on existing data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is apparent from Fig. 4B that many other vessels, such as the dorsal aorta and many intersegmental vessels show robust red Kaede expression at 4 dpf, arguing that there is sufficient photoconverted Kaede present at this stage, and its degradation is unlikely to be the reason. However, we are planning to include additional control experiments, as suggested by the reviewer, to make this argument stronger.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) To strengthen the claim that hand2 acts upstream of jam2b, the authors can perform combinatorial genetic epistatic analysis and examine whether jam2b mutations worsen hand2 homozygous or heterozygous effects on the SVF. Similarly, overexpressing jam2b might rescue the loss of SVF/etv2 expression in hand2 mutants.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this suggestion. Double epistatic analysis, while informative, can be tricky. In this case, we are dealing with <italic>jam2a; jam2b</italic> redundancy and also the maternal effect. It may take a while considerable effort to generate different combinations of tripple mutant lines (jam2a,jam2b,hand2), and it is unclear whether double or tripple heterozygous embryos will show any defects to clarify their epistatic relationship. Instead, as suggested, we are planning to overexpress <italic>jam2b</italic> in wild-type and <italic>hand2</italic> mutants to address this point.</p>
