<title>Abstract</title><p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and atherosclerotic heart disease, frequently associated with dyslipidemia and hypertension, represent significant health concerns. We investigated the interplay among these conditions, focusing on the role of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and angiotensin II (Ang II) in renal injury via G protein Î±q subunit (Gq) signaling. We hypothesized that oxLDL enhances Ang II-induced Gq signaling via the AT1 (Ang II type 1 receptor)-LOX1 (lectin-like oxLDL receptor) complex. Based on CHO and renal cell model experiments, oxLDL alone did not activate Gq signaling. However, when combined with Ang II, it significantly potentiated Gq-mediated inositol phosphate 1 production and calcium influx in cells expressing both LOX-1 and AT1 but not in AT1-expressing cells. This suggests a critical synergistic interaction between oxLDL and Ang II in the AT1-LOX1 complex. Conformational studies using AT1 biosensors have indicated a unique receptor conformational change due to the oxLDL-Ang II combination. In vivo, wild-type mice fed a high-fat diet with Ang II infusion presented exacerbated renal dysfunction, whereas LOX-1 knockout mice did not, underscoring the pathophysiological relevance of the AT1-LOX1 interaction in renal damage. These findings highlight a novel mechanism of renal dysfunction in CKD driven by dyslipidemia and hypertension and suggest the therapeutic potential of AT1-LOX1 receptor complex in patients with these comorbidities.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dyslipidemia is a major risk factor of atherosclerotic heart disease in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). It has been postulated that the association between dyslipidemia and CKD is not solely a result of epidemiological comorbidities but rather a complex interplay of causality, where CKD exacerbates dyslipidemia, while dyslipidemia, in turn, contributes to the onset and progression of CKD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Since Moorhead et al. proposed the lipid nephrotoxicity hypothesis in 1982<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, accumulating evidence has suggested that increased plasma lipid levels contribute to the development of renal glomerular and tubular damage, primarily in animal models of dyslipidemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. The etiology of dyslipidemia-induced nephrotoxicity is complex and multifaceted, potentially involving the activation of certain cellular signaling pathways that culminate in renal injury through elevated levels of oxidized LDL (oxLDL)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. The lectin-like oxLDL receptor, LOX-1, is implicated in organ damage caused by dyslipidemia, and its expression is increased in hypertensive glomerulosclerosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. In murine models, a deficiency of LOX-1 leads to a reduction in renal dysfunction, which was precipitated by a systemic inflammatory state following significant myocardial ischemia and injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. This supports the hypothesis that LOX-1 plays a role in the development of inflammation-induced renal injury. However, to date, no studies have investigated the role of LOX-1 in nephrotoxicity caused by dyslipidemia.</p>
<p>Hypertension is an established risk factor for CKD, and it has been suggested that hypertension and dyslipidemia act synergistically to induce renal dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. The development of renal damage due to hypertension involves direct renal injury by vasoactive hormones, such as angiotensin II (Ang II), in addition to renal hemodynamic abnormalities associated with elevated body pressure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. We have shown that LOX-1 and the Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1) of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) are coupled on the plasma membrane, and that G protein-dependent and Î²-arrestin-dependent AT1 activation mechanisms are involved in the signaling mechanism by oxLDL and the intracellular uptake of oxLDL, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it was recently demonstrated that AT1 exhibits different modes and degrees of G protein activation depending on the conformational changes that occur during activation by various ligands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Specifically, G protein Î±q subunit (Gq)-biased agonists induce a more open conformation of AT1 than Ang II, resulting in a more potent activation of Gq, which is the primary mediator of Ang II-induced hypertension. In contrast, Î²-arrestin-biased agonists induce a closer conformational change, leading to the activation of Î²-arrestin without the activation of Gq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Indeed, we found that oxLDL selectively activates G protein Î±i subunit (Gi) of AT1, without activating Gq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, similar to that induced by Î²-arrestin-biased agonists<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. However, given that Ang II and oxLDL coexist in physiological environments, it is plausible to hypothesize that the effect of these ligands on AT1 in living organisms may differ from their effects when administered individually. Indeed, we found that the combination treatment of oxLDL and Ang II enhanced pro-inflammatory NFÎºB activity compared to each treatment alone in cells overexpressing both AT1 and LOX-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Based on our findings and the aforementioned structure-activity relationship of AT1, we hypothesized that the binding of both oxLDL and Ang II to LOX-1 and AT1, respectively, may result in a more open AT1 structure, leading to stronger downstream Gq signaling. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate and clarify this hypothesis, focusing specifically on renal component cells, and ultimately demonstrate the in vivo relevance of this phenomenon in the development of renal injury or renal dysfinction under conditions of Ang II and oxLDL overload.</p>

<title>Oxidized LDL potentiates Ang II-induced Gq signaling in a LOX-1-dependent manner</title>
<p>First, we examined the additive effect of oxLDL on Ang II-stimulated AT-1-Gq signaling in CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cells that did not endogenously express LOX-1 and AT-1 but were genetically engineered to express these receptors (CHO-LOX-1-AT1) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> shows the dose-response curve of Ang II-induced IP1 production, which serves as a measure of Gq activity, in the presence of varying concentrations of oxLDL in CHO-LOX-1-AT1 cells. Consistent with previous findings, oxLDL alone did not stimulate IP1 production in CHO-LOX-1-AT1 cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. However, when oxLDL was supplemented at concentrations of 10 and 20 Î¼g/mL (but not at 5 Î¼g/mL), it caused a similar leftward shift in the dose-response curve of Ang II, resulting in a more than 80% decrease in the Effective Concentration 50 (EC50) (EC50 values: 0 Î¼g/mL, 9.40 Ã 10â»â¹ M; 5 Î¼g/mL, 5.21 Ã 10â»â¹ M; 10 Î¼g/mL, 1.68 Ã 10â»â¹ M; 20 Î¼g/mL, 1.55 Ã 10â»â¹ M). The maximum IP1 production induced by Ang II in CHO-LOX-1-AT1 cells was unaffected by the addition of oxLDL.</p>

<p>Additionally, we observed that oxLDL administration decreased Ang II-induced IP1 production in CHO cells expressing AT1 alone (CHO-AT1), in contrast to CHO cells expressing both AT1 and LOX-1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). This finding suggests that the potentiating effect of oxLDL on Ang II-AT1-Gq activity is dependent on the presence of LOX-1. However, the reason for the decrease in IP1 production caused by oxLDL supplementation was not determined in this study. Native LDL, which does not bind to LOX-1, did not alter Ang II-induced Gq activity in CHO-LOX-1-AT1 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Furthermore, the presence of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) that bind to LOX-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, did not enhance Ang II-induced IP1 production (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>).</p>
<p>We found that enhanced IP1 production by co-treatment of oxLDL with Ang II was similarly observed in CHO-cells expressing LOX-1 and mutated AT1 with impaired ability to activate Î² arrestin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1e</xref>). Moreover, the potentiating effect of oxLDL on IP1 production was unaffected by Pertussis Toxin (PTX), a Gi inhibitor, or RKI-1448, a downstream Rho kinase inhibitor targeting G12/13 signaling in CHO-LOX-1-AT1 cells. However, this phenomenon was completely inhibited by YM-254890, the Gq inhibitor (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>). These results suggest that the potentiating effect of oxLDL on Ang II-induced IP1 production is not influenced by Î²-arrestin, Gi, or G12/13, which are the main effectors of AT1 signaling aside from Gq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>oxLDL potentiates Ang II-induced calcium influx in a LOX-1-dependent manner</title>
<p>Calcium influx is a representative cellular phenomenon that occurs in response to Ang II-AT1-Gq activation. We found that oxLDL and low concentrations of Ang II (10<sup>â12</sup> M) did not induce calcium influx in CHO-LOX-1-AT1 cells when treated alone, but apparently induced calcium influx when treated together (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g, h</xref>). Ang II alone at higher concentrations (10<sup>â11</sup> M) induced calcium influx, and no further enhancement was observed with oxLDL supplementation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h</xref>). The combined effect of oxLDL and Ang II on calcium influx was completely blocked by YM254890, suggesting that this phenomenon was Gq-dependent (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1i</xref>). Importantly, oxLDL supplementation with Ang II did not affect the calcium influx in CHO cells expressing AT1 alone (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1j</xref>).</p>

<p>Our findings revealed a decrease in green puncta, which represent AT1-eGFP, upon treatment with Ang II, oxLDL alone, and their co-treatment compared with the control group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). However, the extent of membrane AT1 reduction was similar across all the treatment groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Consistent with our previous report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, oxLDL treatment resulted in a reduction in the red puncta representing LOX-1-mScarlet (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Importantly, co-treatment with oxLDL and Ang II did not further enhance the reduction of red puncta compared to oxLDL treatment alone (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Based on these findings, it is conceivable that co-treatment with oxLDL and Ang II does not increase the content of activated AT1 compared to individual treatments alone.</p>
<p>AT1 intramolecular FlAsH-BRET biosensors were used to detect AT1 conformational changes in CHO cells expressing LOX-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Among several biosensors previously tested <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, we used two sensors with FlAsH insertion at the third intracellular loop (ICL3P3) and cytoplasmic-terminal tail (C-tailP1) of AT1 that interacts with Renilla luciferase (RlucII) at the end of the cytoplasmic tail (AT1-ICL3P3 and AT1-C-tailP1, respectively), as these sensors were shown to enhance BRET signaling induced by Ang II compared to biased agonists, including SI, SII, DVG, and SBpA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. In CHO cells expressing LOX-1 alone (CHO-LOX-1) transduced with lentivirus encoding AT1-C-tailP1, 10<sup>â5</sup> M Ang II and the combination of Ang II and 10 Î¼g/mL oxLDL induced BRET similarly, whereas oxLDL alone did not alter BRET (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). In contrast, in CHO-LOX-1 cells transduced with AT1-ICL3P3-encoded lentivirus, the combination of Ang II and oxLDL induced BRET more prominently than Ang II alone, whereas oxLDL alone did not alter BRET (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). Furthermore, the difference between oxLDL and the combination treatment was abolished by a neutralizing antibody against LOX-1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). These findings suggested that the concomitant binding of oxLDL to LOX-1 and Ang II to AT1 induced a conformational change in AT1 that was distinct from that induced by Ang II or oxLDL alone.</p>

<p>To confirm the pathophysiological significance of this phenomenon observed in the overexpressing cells, we validated it in cells endogenously expressing LOX-1 and AT1. We found that oxLDL in combination with Ang II did not increase the cellular IP1 content in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), bovine vascular endothelial cells (BACEs), human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (HAVSMCs), or rat macrophages (A10) (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). In contrast, in normal rat kidney epithelial cells (NRK52E) and fibroblasts (NRK49F), the combination of oxLDL and Ang II, but not Ang II alone, increased IP1 accumulation, which was suppressed in the presence of YM-25480, the Gq inhibitor (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a, b</xref>). IP1 accumulation induced by co-treatment with Ang II and oxLDL was abolished by the siRNA-mediated knockdown of either AT1 or LOX-1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 c, d</xref>; the knockdown efficacy is shown in <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>).

We also verified protein expression of Î±SMA as a molecular marker of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) upon the indicated stimulation for 3 days in rat kidney cells. The combination of Ang II (10<sup>â7</sup> M) and oxLDL (5 Î¼g/mL) induced Î±SMA expression in NRK49F or NRK52E to the same extent or less than TGFÎ², a major inducer of EMT, respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a, b</xref>). The results of the combination treatment were strikingly different from that of oxLDL or Ang II treatment alone, which did not affect Î±SMA expression in both types of cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c, d</xref>). The induction of Î±SMA by the combined treatment was suppressed in the presence of a Gq inhibitor or ARB in both types of cells, suggesting the AT1-Gq-dependent pathway in this phenomenon (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e, f</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5g, h</xref>). As a final in vitro assay, the proliferative activity of NRK49F cells after 24 h of treatment with Ang II and oxLDL, either alone or in combination, was measured using the BrdU assay (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). When administered alone, Ang II and oxLDL increased and reduced BrdU incorporation, respectively. The reducing effect of oxLDL on proliferation was blocked by Irbesartan, but not by a Gq inhibitor, consistent with our findings that oxLDL induces biased activation of AT1, which favors Gi but not Gq signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Oxidized LDL potentiated the Ang II-induced increase in BrdU incorporation, which was blocked in the presence of a Gq inhibitor or an ARB (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). The siRNA-mediated knockdown of AT1 completely abolished the effects of Ang II and oxLDL, either alone or in combination.

<title>Oxidized LDL-inducible diet exacerbates Ang II-induced renal dysfuntion in wildtype mice, but not in LOX-1 knockout mice</title>
<p>To examine the relevance of this phenomenon in renal injury, we replicated the in vivo conditions that occurred during simultaneous stimulation with oxLDL and Ang II in wildtype (WT) and LOX-1 knockout (LOX-1 KO) mice. This was achieved by inducing oxLDL via a high-fat diet (HFD) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> and Ang II via a subcutaneously implanted osmotic mini-pump (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>). Two different doses of Ang II were used in the experiment: a pressor dose of 0.7 Î³, which was demonstrated to increase blood pressure (BP) and induce renal dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, and a subpressor dose of 0.1 Î³, which does not affect BP. For the intended analysis, the results are presented separately for mice exposed to subpressor and pressor doses of Ang II, utilizing the same outcomes of control animals infused with saline for comparison. Consistent with a previous report, the HFD used in the study prominently increased the plasma LOX-1 ligand concentration, which was undetectable under a normal diet (ND) after 6 weeks of feeding (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>). Notably, the HFD did not intensify but rather attenuated the body weight increase during the experimental period compared to the ND (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6a-c</xref>). The pressor dose of Ang II similarly increased BP in HFD-fed and ND-fed WT mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6d</xref>). However, notably, there was a modest trend of attenuated BP elevation by 0.7 Î³ Ang II infusion in LOX-1 KO mice, in line with the previous report showing reduced Ang II-induced BP elevation by LOX-1 deficiency in mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6d, f</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. As expected, a subpressor dose of Ang II did not alter BP in the corresponding mouse group (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6e</xref>). Regarding biofluid analysis, HFD with saline infusion did not alter the urinary 8-OHdG concentration as a marker of oxidative stress and urinary albumin excretion (UAE) compared to ND with saline infusion in either WT or LOX-1 KO mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c, d</xref>). The pressor dose of Ang II with ND significantly increased the urinary 8-OHdG concentration and UAE in WT mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c, d</xref>). Notably, HFD feeding in WT mice with a pressor dose of Ang II resulted in a prominent increase in urinary 8-OHdG concentration and UAE compared to mice fed with ND (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c, d</xref>). In WT mice administered with a subpressor dose of Ang II, a significant increase in UAE was observed when comparing the effects of HFD to ND (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7d</xref>). There were no significant differences in urinary 8-OHdG levels between the two dietary conditions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref>). Interestingly, when LOX-1 KO mice were fed either HFD or ND and then administered the corresponding dose of Ang II, no differences were observed in the measured parameters (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c, d</xref>). These findings indicate that the combination of HFD and Ang II administration appears to have a more pronounced effect on certain biofluid markers of renal injury in WT mice than in LOX-1 KO mice. The presence or absence of LOX-1 appears to influence the interaction between HFD and Ang II, affecting these specific parameters in mice. We did not find a difference in plasma aldosterone concentration between ND- and HFD-fed WT mice with a pressor dose of Ang II (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We conducted a series of experiments to provide empirical support for our hypotheses. We propose that the simultaneous binding of Ang II to AT1 and oxLDL to LOX-1 triggers distinct and more pronounced structural modifications in AT1 than the individual modifications induced by each ligand. This structural alteration in AT1 leads to the enhanced activation of Gq signaling.</p>
<p>Our experiments showed that oxLDL enhanced the effects of Ang II-induced production of IP1, a downstream signaling molecule associated with Gq activation and subsequent calcium influx. However, this effect was observed only in the presence of both LOX-1 and AT1. Considering that oxLDL selectively activates Gi but not Gq through the LOX-1-AT1 dependent pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, it is evident that the observed phenomenon cannot be attributed solely to the additive effect of oxLDL on AT1 activation. Rather, the simultaneous binding of oxLDL and Ang II to their respective receptors, LOX-1 and AT1, which form a single complex, underlies this phenomenon. Indeed, our findings from live imaging of the membrane receptors revealed that the combination of Ang II and oxLDL did not induce any additional influence on the internalization of both receptors upon AT1-Î²-arrestin activation compared to each ligand alone, suggesting that the quantity of activated receptors is not affected by the combination treatments. Considering the conformation-activation relationship in AT1 activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, this supports the hypothesis that the simultaneous binding of Ang II and oxLDL in a single AT1-LOX-1 complex induces a greater conformational change, resulting in a more open conformation of AT1 compared with each ligand alone. However, it is technically challenging to directly identify structural modifications of the receptor complex using techniques such as crystal structure analysis. Instead, we utilized AT1 conformational sensors capable of differentiating between the conformational changes induced by Ang II and biased AT1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Interestingly, we observed that one of the two conformational sensors employed in this study detected an augmented response in the presence of the combination treatment compared with Ang II alone. Importantly, this enhanced response was significantly inhibited when an LOX-1 antibody was introduced, indicating the dependency of LOX-1 on this phenomenon. These results indicate that the combined treatment with Ang II and oxLDL in the presence of LOX-1 induces a unique conformational change in individual AT1 molecules, which differs from the conformational changes induced by each single treatment alone.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the ability of LOX-1 ligands to enhance Ang II-AT1 signaling is not commonly observed. This was corroborated by the observation that BSA-conjugated AGE, a recognized ligand of LOX-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, failed to augment the production of IP1 by Ang II compared to control BSA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). While the exact reason for this discrepancy is not yet understood, it is noteworthy that the predicted particle size of oxLDL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> is significantly larger at 250 Ã compared to the maximum particle size of AGE-BSA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, which is 120 Ã. This suggests a potentially greater impact of oxLDL on the structural modifications within the AT1-LOX-1 complex. However, further structural analysis is required to validate this hypothesis.</p>
<p>Notably, the Gq bias resulting from combination treatment varied across the mammalian cells examined. Specifically, we observed a combinatorial effect exclusively in renal epithelial and fibroblasts, whereas vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells did not display the same response. In these renal cells, we observed increased Gq signaling, along with other cellular phenomena such as calcium influx, changes in gene expression, and alterations in cellular characteristics, including EMT and cell proliferation. Specifically, EMT is an important cellular phenomenon in renal epithelial cells to acquire the phenotype of myofibroblasts and induce fibrosis by the excessive production and deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, although there is a debate regarding the precise role of EMT in vivo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Numerous studies have suggested that the EMT plays a critical role in Ang II-mediated renal fibrosis. EMT is also involved in the pathological transition of normal fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, which promotes fibrosis. We found that Î±SMA expression, a well-known indicator of EMT, was dramatically enhanced when renal epithelial cells and fibroblast cells were subjected to the combination treatment of Ang II and oxLDL, in comparison to individual treatments. Additionally, fibroblast proliferation, as assessed by the BrdU assay, was notably enhanced by the combined treatment, as opposed to each treatment administered separately. Interestingly, the use of 5 Î¼g/mL oxLDL in our study showed a tendency to decrease proliferation, which was counteracted by the administration of an ARB but not a Gq inhibitor. These findings suggest that the presence of Ang II leads to a significant transformation in the function of oxLDL, primarily due to its altered influence within the AT1-LOX-1 complex. Taken together, these results suggest that the simultaneous binding of oxLDL to LOX-1 and Ang II to AT1 results in a Gq-biased shift in AT1 activation, leading to a cellular phenomenon that could potentially contribute to renal damage.</p>
<p>In an animal study, we introduced a biological environment in which both circulating Ang II and oxLDL (an LOX-1 ligand) were increased in mice. Previous studies using mice fed an HFD have consistently reported the onset of renal injury, as determined by various measurements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. In contrast, 6 weeks of HFD feeding without Ang II treatment did not alter renal function in our mice. This can be attributed to the lack of obesity induced by the high-fat diet in this study. We used this diet based on a previous study that confirmed increased circulating LOX-1 ligand levels without body weight gain in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, and this diet decreased body weight in our experiments. Obesity is a well-established and clinically proven risk factor of renal dysfunction. The mechanisms underlying this association are complex and involve various factors other than lipid abnormalities, such as hemodynamic changes that affect kidney circulation and the impact of adipose tissue on the production of adipokines and other inflammatory mediators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Consequently, we observed the influence of elevated lipid particle levels on renal function, independent of obesity. We found that the effect of an HFD became obvious with an increase in the Ang II load in WT mice. In particular, in WT mice treated with high-dose Ang II, which elevated systolic BP by approximately 30 mm Hg, an HFD induced notable increases in urinary reactive oxygen species and urinary albumin. In contrast, an HFD had no impact on Ang II-infused LOX-1 KO mice, as evidenced by equivalent urinalysis measurements for renal injury between the diets. Correspondingly, simultaneous administration of an HFD and Ang II resulted in a consistent alteration in the expression of genes related to renal injury, including fibrosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress, except for some genes in WT mice, but not in LOX-1 KO mice. This strongly suggests that the combined effect of Ang II and HFD on renal function is LOX-1 dependent. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the effect of high-dose Ang II infusion on BP tended to be less pronounced in LOX-1 KO mice compared to WT mice, although there were no differences in BP elevation between the diets in each group of mice. These findings align with those of previous studies indicating that LOX-1 knockout mice show resistance to Ang II-induced elevation of BP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Specifically, when mice were infused with 2 Î³ Ang II (equivalent to 25 g mice) for a duration of 28 days, wildtype mice experienced a BP increase exceeding 180 mmHg, while LOX-1 knockout mice demonstrated a reduction of approximately 40 mmHg in this elevation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the same research group reported that Ang II infusion led to less severe renal injury in LOX-1KO mice compared to WT mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Importantly, these findings were observed in mice fed with an ND, suggesting that the protective effect of LOX-1 loss-of-function against Ang II-induced elevated BP occurs through the LOX-1-AT1 complex, independent of the presence of oxLDL. Taken together, the effects of LOX-1 on AT1 signaling are complex, involving both ligand-dependent and -independent mechanisms, and further investigation is required for a comprehensive understanding of the LOX-1-AT1 interaction.</p>
<p>Finally, the current findings unequivocally demonstrated the molecular interactions between key molecules associated with dyslipidemia and hypertension in the kidneys. Moreover, this interaction can be effectively inhibited by ARBs, suggesting an additive effect in preventing the development of CKD, particularly in patients with hypertension and dyslipidemia. Interestingly, Ang II-dependent hypertensive animal models, including constriction of the renal artery and infusion of Ang II in rats and mice, have revealed a progressive increase in intrarenal Ang II levels, surpassing what can be accounted for by circulating Ang II levels alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. This is due to Ang II-dependent renal activation of the renin-angiotensin system, as indicated by increased urinary angiotensinogen (AGT) secretion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Importantly, the elevation of urinary AGT is also evident in patients with various pathologies, including hypertension and CKD, implying that renal Ang II levels increase even in individuals who do not exhibit elevated levels of circulating Ang II<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Taken together, the current finding of the synergistic effect of Ang II and oxLDL on AT1 activation in renal tissue is highly relevant for the development of kidney disease. RA system inhibitors, ARB, and ACE inhibitors are prioritized therapies to prevent the development of CKD with proteinuria in patients with hypertension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. In addition to the well-established inhibitory effects of Ang II on the contraction of efferent arterioles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, a novel renal protective action of RA system inhibitors has been proposed. Particularly in hypertension accompanied by dyslipidemia, RA system inhibitors may exhibit anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic, and antioxidant effects in the kidneys by inhibiting the Gq signaling pathway through the AT1-LOX-1 complex in renal tubular cells and fibroblasts. Collectively, the current findings suggest that RA inhibitors can concomitantly reduce the effect of increased renal Ang II and oxLDL levels on the development of CKD in patients with hypertension and dyslipidemia, although direct evidence in clinical studies to support this remains to be elucidated.</p>
<p>This study has several limitations as follows: 1) The kidney, a complex organ vital for maintaining homeostasis, comprises a myriad of distinct cell types working in concert to execute its multifaceted functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. The experiments conducted in mice raised questions regarding the specific cell types implicated in the synergistic effect of Ang II and oxLDL within the LOX-1-AT1 complex in the kidney. Addressing this issue would ideally require single-cell analysis, which is a challenge for future research. 2) The study employed systemic LOX-1 knockout mice. For a more detailed analysis, a phenotypic investigation using renal tissue-specific LOX-1 and AT1 knockout mice is required. Of particular importance is the analysis using tubule-specific knockout mice, in which the localization of these components has been verified through immunohistochemical staining. 3) The administration of Ang II (both pressor and subpressor doses) and its combination with HFD did not result in any histological changes in terms of fibrosis and mesangial expansion, despite the observed alterations in the associated gene expression and urinalysis for renal injury. Alterations in gene expression and urinalysis for renal injury may be sensitive and relatively early phenomena, and this discrepancy could potentially be attributed to the relatively short intervention duration of 4 weeks. Therefore, concurrent pathohistological alterations in the renal tissue might become evident with a more extended intervention period. 4) This study was limited by its inability to detect the amplification of Gq signaling in mouse renal tissue due to the concurrent administration of Ang II and HFD. Overcoming this limitation is a challenge for future studies.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the current findings suggest that the simultaneous binding of oxLDL and Ang II to their respective receptors within the complex induces a distinct conformational change compared with the effect of each ligand alone. This unique conformational change results in the heightened activation of G protein signaling and subsequent unfavorable cellular reactions in renal component cells. The relevance of this phenomenon was confirmed in mouse models, in which renal dysfunction was prominently exacerbated when there was a concomitant increase in Ang II and oxLDL levels. Notably, this effect was abolished by the deletion of LOX-1, indicating LOX-1 dependency of this in vivo phenomenon (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>). These findings indicate the clinical relevance of the direct interaction between hypertension and dyslipidemia and further support the clinical significance of RA inhibition in treating patients with CKD.</p>

Samples were prepared by 4-fold dilution of plasma with HEPES-EDTA buffer (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.4), and standards were prepared by dilution of oxidized LDL with HEPES-EDTA buffer. Following three washes with PBS, the plates were incubated for 1 h at 25Â°C with chicken monoclonal anti-apoB antibody (HUC20, 0.5 Î¼g/mL) in HEPES-EDTA containing 1% (w/v) BSA. After three washes with PBS, the plates were incubated for 1 h at 25Â°C with peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-chicken IgY (Merck, NJ, USA) diluted 5000 times with HEPES-EDTA containing 1% (w/v) BSA. After five washes with PBS, the substrate solution containing 3,3â,5,5â-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB solution, Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA, USA) was added to the plates and incubated them for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated with 2 M sulfuric acid. Peroxidase activity was determined by measuring absorbance at 450 nm using a SpectraMax 340PC384 Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, CA, USA).</p>

<title>Tissue preperation</title>
<p>Kidneys were perfused with cold PBS before removal. Kidney samples were rapidly excised. A quarter of samples were stored at 4Â°C in RNAlater (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) for RNA extraction. The remaining quarters were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4Â°C for histological evaluation. The remaining half was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at â80Â°C for further analysis.</p>

<title>Periodic acid-Schiff and Masson-Trichrome staining</title>
<p>The degree of glomerular mesangial expansion and glomerular area (representing the structural integrity of the glomeruli) were assessed in a blinded manner using periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining. Collagen accumulation was determined by Masson-Trichrome (MTC) staining. For MTC staining, the area displaying fibrosis was quantitatively evaluated in a blinded manner by measuring the blue staining in six strongly magnified fields of view using the ImageJ software, and the average was calculated after determining the ratio of the total area.</p>

<title>Fluorescent immunostaining</title>
<p>For fluorescent immunostaining of LOX-1 and AT-1, the mice were perfused with cold saline before tissue removal. After 3 days of zinc fixation, the tissue was replaced with 70% ethanol. The 3-Î¼m-thick kidney tissue sections were immunohistochemically stained with antibodies against ATGR (1:200, Cosmo Bio, Japan) and OLR-1 (1:200, TS58 from the laboratory of T.S., Shinshu University School of Medicine, Nagano, Japan). Following deparaffinization (using Lemosol and gradient ethanol) and rehydration, the slices were subjected to antigen retrieval by autoclaving in citrate buffer (0.01 M; pH 6.0). Subsequently, the slices were washed thrice with PBS and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature. The slides were then incubated with primary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) High Cross-Adsorbed Secondary Antibody, Alexa Fluor Plus 488 and 594 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) were used as secondary antibodies for ATGR and OLR-1, respectively. After incubation with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, the slices were washed with PBS. Finally, slides were sealed and photographed. Visual analyses were performed using a BZ-800L microscope (Keyence, Japan).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study demonstrates a key role of oxLDL in enhancing Ang II-induced Gq signaling by promoting the AT1/LOX1 receptor complex formation. Importantly, Gq-mediated calcium influx was only observed in LOX1 and AT1 both expressing cells, and AT1-LOX1 interaction aggravated renal damage and dysfunction under the condition of a high-fat diet with Ang II infusion, so this study indicated a new therapeutic potential of AT1-LOX1 receptor complex in CKD patients with dyslipidemia and hypertension.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study is very exciting and the work is also very detailed, especially regarding the mechanism of LOX1-AT1 receptor interaction and its impact on oxidative stress, fibrosis, and inflammation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The direct evidence for the interaction between AT1 and LOX1 receptors in cell membrane localization is relatively weak. Here I raise some questions that may further improve the study.</p>
<p>Major points:</p>
<p>(1) The authors hypothesized that in the interaction of AT1/LOX1 receptor complex in response to ox-LDL and AngII, there should be strong evidence of fluorescence detection of colocalization for these two membrane receptors, both in vivo and in vitro. Although the video evidence for AT1 internalization upon complex activation is shown in Figure S1, the more important evidence should be membrane interaction and enhanced signal of intracellular calcium influx.</p>
<p>(2) Co-IP experiment should be provided to prove the AT1/LOX1 receptor interaction in response to ox-LDL and AngII in AT1 and LOX1 both expressing cells but not in AT1 only expressing cells.</p>
<p>(3) The authors mentioned that the Gq signaling-mediated calcium influx may change gene expression and cellular characteristics, including EMT and cell proliferation. They also provided evidence that oxidative stress, fibrosis, and inflammation were all enhanced after activating both receptors and inhibiting Gq was effective in reversing these changes. However, single stimulation with ox-LDL or AngII also has strong effects on ROS production, inflammation, and cell EMT, which has been extensively proved by previous studies. So, how to distinguish the biased effect of LOX1 or AT1r alone or the enhanced effect of receptor conformational changes mediated by their receptor interaction? Is there any better evidence to elucidate this point?</p>
<p>(4) How does the interaction between AT1 and LOX1 affect the RAS system and blood pressure? What about the serum levels of rennin, angiotensin, and aldosterone in ND-fed or HFD-fed mice?</p>

<p>Individuals with chronic kidney disease often have dyslipidemia, with the latter both a risk factor for atherosclerotic heart disease and a contributor to progressive kidney disease. Prior studies suggest that oxidized LDL (oxLDL) may cause renal injury through the activation of the LOX1 receptor. The authors had previously reported that LOX1 and AT1 interact to form a complex at the cell surface. In this study, the authors hypothesize that oxLDL, in the setting of angiotensin II, is responsible for driving renal injury by inducing a more pronounced conformational change of the AT1 receptor which results in enhanced Gq signaling.</p>
<p>They go about testing the hypothesis in a set of three studies. In the first set, they engineered CHO cell lines to express AT1R alone, LOX1 in combination with AT1R, or LOX1 with an inactive form of AT1R and indirectly evaluated Gq activity using IP1 and calcium activity as read-outs. They assessed activity after treatment with AngII, oxLDL, or both in combination and found that treatment with both agents resulted in the greatest level of activity, which could be effectively blocked by a Gq inhibitor but not a Gi inhibitor nor a downstream Rho kinase inhibitor targeting G12/13 signaling. These results support their hypothesis, though variability in the level of activation was dramatically inconsistent from experiment to experiment, differing by as much as 20-fold. In contrast, within the experiment, differences between the AngII and AngII/oxLDL treatments, while nominally significant and consistent with their hypothesis, generally were only 10-20%. Another example of unexplained variability can be found in Figures 1g-1j. AngII, at a concentration of 10-12, has no effect on calcium flux in one set of studies (Figure 1g, h) yet has induced calcium activity to a level as great as AngII + oxLDL in another (Figure 1i). The inconsistency of results lessens confidence in the significance of these findings. In other studies with the LOX1-CHO line, they tested for conformational change by transducing AT1 biosensors previously shown to respond to AngII and found that one of them in fact showed enhanced BRET in the setting of oxLDL and AngII compared to AngII alone, which was blocked by an antibody to AT1R. The result is supportive of their conclusions. Limiting enthusiasm for these results is the fact that there isn't a good explanation as to why only 1 sensor showed a difference, and the study should have included a non-specific antibody to control for non-specific effects.</p>
<p>The authors then repeated similar studies using publicly available rat kidney epithelial and fibroblast cell lines that have an endogenous expression of AT1R and LOX1. In these studies, oxLDL in combination with AngiI also enhanced Gq signaling, while knocking down either AT1R or LOX1, and treatment with inhibitors of Gq and AT1R blocked the effects. Like the prior set of studies, however, the effects are very modest and there was significant inter-experimental variability, reducing confidence in the significance of the findings. The authors then tested for evidence that the enhanced Gq signaling could result in renal injury by comparing qPCR results for target genes. While the results show some changes, their significance is difficult to assess. A more global assessment of gene expression patterns would have been more appropriate. In parallel with the transcriptional studies, they tested for evidence of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) using a single protein marker (alpha-smooth muscle actin) and found that its expression increased significantly in cells treated with oxLDL and AngII, which was blocked by inhibition of Gq inhibition and AT1R. While the data are sound, their significance is also unclear since EMT is a highly controversial cell culture phenomenon. Compelling in vivo studies have shown that most if not all fibroblasts in the kidney are derived from interstitial cells and not a product of EMT. In the last set of studies using these cell lines, the authors examined the effects of AngII and oxLDL on cell proliferation as assayed using BrdU. These results are puzzling---while the two agents together enhanced proliferation which was effectively blocked by an inhibitor to either AT1R or Gq, silencing of LOX1 had no effect.</p>
<p>The final set of studies looked to test the hypothesis in mice by treating WT and Lox1-KO mice with different doses of AngII and either a normal or high-fat diet (to induce oxLDL formation). The authors found that the combination of high dose AngII and a high-fat diet (HFD) increased markers of renal injury (urinary 8-ohdg and urine albumin) in normal mice compared to mice treated with just AngII or HFD alone, which was blunted in Lox1-KO mice). These results are consistent with their hypothesis. However, there are other aspects of these studies that are either inconsistent or complicating factors that limit the strength of the conclusions. For example, Lox1- KO had no effect on renal injury marker expression in mice treated with low-dose AngII and HFD. It also should be noted that Lox1-KO mice had a lower BP response to AngII, which could have reduced renal injury independent of any effects mediated by the AT1R/LOX1 interaction. Another confounding factor was the significant effect the HFD diet had on body weight. While the groups did not differ based on AngII treatment status, the HFD consistently was associated with lower total body weight, which is unexplained. Next, the authors sought to find more direct evidence of renal injury using qPCR of candidate genes and renal histology. The transcriptional results are difficult to interpret; moreover, there were no significant histologic differences between groups. They conclude the study by showing the pattern of expression of LOX1 and AT1R in the kidney by immunofluorescence and conclude that the proteins overlap in renal tubules and are absent from the glomerulus. Unfortunately, they did not co-stain with any other markers to identify the specific cell types. However, these results are inconsistent with other studies that show AT1R is highly expressed in mesangial cells, renal interstitial cells, near the vascular pole, JG cells, and proximal tubules but generally absent from most other renal tubule segments.</p>
<p>In sum, this study tackles an important clinical issue and provides some in vitro evidence to support a mechanism whereby dyslipidemia could accelerate renal functional decline through activation of the AT1R/LOX1 complex by oxLDL and AngII.</p>
<p>However, a very high degree of variability in the results, modest within-experiment differences, some internal inconsistencies that aren't explained, and the lack of compelling and strongly supportive in vivo results suggest this is still more a hypothesis than an established likely mechanism.</p>
