<abstract>
<p>Among brain areas, axonal projections carry channels of information that can be mixed to varying degrees. Here, we assess the rules for the network consisting of the primary visual cortex and higher visual areas (V1-HVA). We use large field-of-view two-photon calcium imaging to measure correlated variability (i.e., noise correlations, NCs) among thousands of neurons, forming over a million unique pairs, distributed across multiple cortical areas simultaneously. The amplitude of NCs is proportional to functional network connectivity, and we find that they are robust, reproducible statistical measures, and are remarkably similar across stimuli. We used these NCs to measure the statistics of functional connectivity among tuning classes of neurons in V1 and HVAs. Using an unbiased clustering approach, we identify that there are approximately 60 distinct tuning classes found in V1 and HVAs. We find that NCs are higher between neurons from the same tuning class, both within and across cortical areas. Thus, in the V1-HVA network, mixing of channels is avoided. Instead, discrete channels of visual information are broadcast within and across cortical areas, at both the micron and millimeter length scales. This principle for the functional organization and correlation structure at the individual neuron level across multiple cortical areas can inform and constrain computational theories of neocortical networks.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neurons have characteristic preferences, or tuning, and their activity is transmitted via axonal projections to other brain areas. In the early stages of visual processing, visual information can be preserved. For example, the retina-to-lateral geniculate nucleus (<bold>LGN</bold>) network tends to preserve unmixed channels, by ensuring that axons from retinal ganglion cells with similar tuning tend to converge on individual LGN neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Liang et al., 2018</xref>). By contrast, the LGN-to-primary visual cortex (<bold>V1</bold>) network famously mixes channels to give neurons receptive fields with both dark-sensing and light-sensing subregions, and thus robust orientation tuning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hubel and Wiesel, 1962</xref>). That said, discrete visual information can be transmitted from the retina to cortex. For example, when direction-selective neurons in the retina are genetically ablated, there is a decrease in direction-selective neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Rasmussen et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>In the visual cortical system in mice, the primary visual cortex (<bold>V1</bold>) and its projections to multiple higher visual areas (<bold>HVAs</bold>) span millimeters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Wang and Burkhalter, 2007</xref>). Local networks within V1 can have precise local (&lt; 50 microns) cellular-resolution functional connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ko et al., 2011</xref>). Studies of longer-range, millimeter-scale networks typically lack cellular resolution, but there are general biases observed. Neurons in V1 and HVAs respond to diverse visual stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Yu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Vries et al., 2020</xref>) and are sensitive to a broad range of features including orientation and spatiotemporal frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Andermann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Marshel et al., 2011</xref>). Although individual V1 neurons broadcast axonal projections to multiple HVAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Han et al., 2018</xref>), the spatiotemporal frequency preferences of these feedforward projections generally match those of the target HVAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Glickfeld et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Han and Bonin, 2023</xref>). Feedback connections from HVAs carry frequency-tuned visual signals as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Huh et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, there are HVA-specific spatiotemporal biases, but cellular resolution, millimeter-scale principles for cortical wiring remain to be elucidated.</p>
<p>In the current study, we investigated the degree of discreteness of the V1-HVA functional networks in direction and frequency information processing, by measuring the noise correlations (<bold>NC</bold>, also called spike count correlation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Vinci et al. (2016)</xref>) between functional tuning groups of neurons. Functional tuning groups were defined using an unbiased clustering approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Han et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Yu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Baden et al., 2016</xref>). Large field-of-view (<bold>FOV</bold>) calcium imaging enables us to densely sample across millimeter cortical space, which allows us to simultaneously observe large and dense samples of neurons in these tuning groups to analyze NCs within- and-across cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Yu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stirman et al., 2016</xref>). NCs are due to connectivity (direct or indirect connectivity between the neurons, and/or shared input), and thus provide a trace of connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cohen and Kohn, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Vinci et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Snyder et al., 2015</xref>). In particular, the connectivity that influences NCs is effective <italic>in vivo</italic>, during normal sensory processing, something that is not verified with purely anatomical measures. Activity-based estimates of neuronal networks can provide higher fidelity measures than anatomical-based studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Randi et al., 2023</xref>). We find that NCs are a reliable measure at the population level. We also find that neurons can be categorized into six functional groups, and NCs are higher within these groups, both within and across cortical areas, indicating discrete channels in the network to preserve information. Moreover, we find that naturalistic videos draw upon the same functional networks, and modeling suggests that recurrent connectivity is critical for stabilizing these networks.</p>

<title>Visual cortical neurons form six tuning groups</title>
<p>To measure neuronal activity, we used multi-region population calcium imaging of L2/3 neurons in V1 and four HVAs (lateromedial, <bold>LM</bold>; laterointermediate, <bold>LI</bold>; anterolateral, <bold>AL</bold>; and posteromedial, <bold>PM</bold>) using a multiplexing, large field-of-view two-photon microscope with sub-cellular resolution developed in-house (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stirman et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Mice expressed the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Madisen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) in cortical neurons. We located the V1 and HVAs of each mouse using retinotopic maps obtained by intrinsic signal optical imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Marshel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Smith et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>). We imaged neurons in two to four cortical areas simultaneously (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), while mice viewed stimuli on a display system. We typically imaged neurons in V1 and one or more HVAs. Up to 500 neurons (V1: 129 ± 92; HVAs: 94 ± 72; mean ± SD.) were recorded per imaging region (500 × 500 μm<sup>2</sup>). The imaging regions were matched for retinotopy so that the neurons in the simultaneously imaged areas had overlapping receptive fields (<bold>RFs</bold>). Calcium signals were used to infer probable spike trains for each neuron, as our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Yu et al., 2022</xref>). We mapped RFs for individual neurons and populations using small patches of drifting gratings (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B, C</xref>). Neurons in HVAs (LM, AL, PM and LI) had significantly larger RFs than V1 neurons (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1D</xref>). Population RFs for a 500 × 500 μm<sup>2</sup> imaging region of HVAs covered significantly larger portions of visual space than that of V1 (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1D</xref>), as expected given their differing magnification factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Schulz et al., 2015</xref>). The overlap of population RFs confirmed that simultaneously imaged cortical areas (V1 and HVAs), each containing <italic>∼</italic>102 neurons, responded to stimuli in the same region of the stimulus display system (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1C</xref>). These experiments were repeated in 24 mice for a total of 17,990 neurons and noise correlations were measured for a total of 1,037,701 neuron pairs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Mouse V1 and HVA neurons exhibit diverse tuning preferences (i.e., biases) to drifting grating stimuli, in terms of spatiotemporal preferences and sharpness of orientation and direction tuning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Marshel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Andermann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Vries et al., 2020</xref>). Previous studies suggested that the projection from V1 to HVAs matches the spatiotemporal preferences of the target HVAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Glickfeld et al., 2013</xref>). We sought to determine whether this was a general principle, that extended across V1 and HVAs. We recorded neuronal responses from V1 and multiple HVAs (LM, LI, AL, and PM) to sine-wave drifting grating stimuli with various spatiotemporal properties (8 directions x 3 spatial frequencies x 3 temporal frequencies for a total of 72 conditions; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). HVAs exhibited similar responsiveness and reliability to the 72 different parameterized drifting gratings. V1 and LM were only marginally more reliable than other areas (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1E</xref>). Neurons were partitioned into 65 tuning classes using an unbiased Gaussian Mixture Model (<bold>GMM</bold>) (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">S2</xref>). This GMM classification was reliable, in that the center of the Gaussian profile of each class was consistent among GMMs of random subsets of neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Neurons were consistently classified into the same class (<italic>Methods</italic>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>To examine the spatiotemporal frequency selectivity of HVAs, we manually partitioned the 65 GMM classes into six spatial frequency (<bold>SF</bold>) - temporal frequency (<bold>TF</bold>) selective groups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Groups 1, 2, and 3 all prefer low TF (1-2 Hz), and prefer low SF (0.02 cpd), medium SF (0.05 cpd), and high SF (0.19 cpd) respectively. Groups 4, 5, and 6 all prefer high TF (8 Hz) and prefer low SF, medium SF, and high SF respectively. Group 4 (low SF, high TF) was the only group that exhibited clearly increasing responses to the drift speed of the grating stimulus (drift speed = TF/SF, and is measured in deg/s). These groupings were robust and reliable (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1G,H</xref>). While all visual areas had a similar fraction of neurons tuned to low TF and low SF (Group 1), fractions in other groups varied by area. AL had a larger fraction of neurons tuned to high TF, and low SF (Groups 4) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). PM and LI had a larger fraction of neurons tuned to high SF and low TF (Groups 3) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Overall, there is a trend of increasing of preferred TF from the posterior-medial to the anterior-lateral visual cortex, and a trend of increasing of preferred SF from the anterior to the posterior visual cortex (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A, B</xref>).</p>
<p>Neurons in all six groups exhibited orientation and direction selectivity. The preferred directions of neurons were evenly distributed in V1 and HVAs, except high SF groups (Group 3 and 6) of AL, PM, and LI biased to cardinal directions (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3C</xref>). The unbiased GMM approach revealed that the orientation selectivity index (OSI) and direction selectivity index (DSI) of visual neurons were jointly modulated by SF and TF. Neurons tuned to high SF and low TF (Group 3) exhibited lower OSI in all tested areas than all of the other groups (Group 3: mean OSI = 0.6; other groups ranged from 0.71 – 0.80; p &lt; 0.0001, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Neurons tuned to high TF and medium-high SF (Groups 5 and 6) exhibited lower direction selectivity than other groups (Group 5, 6, mean DSI 0.38; other groups, mean DSI 0.45 - 0.54; p &lt; 0.0001, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>).</p>

<title>NCs are robust measurements of functional networks</title>
<p>A unique aspect of this data set is the scale of the NC measurements, which allows us to measure NCs with individual neuron precision within dense local networks and over millimeter length scales, in awake mice. Pioneering work in this area focused on local populations, typically less than 1 mm across (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Harris and Mrsic-Flogel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wertz et al., 2015</xref>) or electrode studies over long distances with few neurons in each location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Clay Reid and Alonso, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Siegle et al., 2021</xref>). To investigate the V1-HVA functional network, we computed the NCs of pairs of neurons within individual cortical areas (within-area NC), and NCs for pairs of neurons where the two neurons are in different cortical areas (inter-area NC) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). NCs are computed from the residual activity of individual neurons after subtracting the expected neuron firing on nominally identical trials. In this section, we evaluated the fidelity of our NC measurements. We considered potential measurement noise due to the imprecision of spike inference and the finite number of trials.</p>

<p>We first evaluated the accuracy of NC calculations using inferred spikes from calcium imaging. We characterized the accuracy of spike inference using previously published data of simultaneous two-photon imaging and electrophysiological recording of GCaMP6s-positive neurons from mouse V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with a previous benchmark study on spike train inference accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Theis et al., 2016</xref>), we found that the spike train inference methods used in the current study recovered 40-70% of the ground truth spikes (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A</xref>). We found that a similar fraction of spikes were missing regardless of the inter-spike interval. Nevertheless, the inferred spike train was highly correlated with the true spike train (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A</xref>; linear correlation, r = 0.80 ± 0.03 (n = 6)). Computing correlations between pairs of neurons using their inferred spike trains accurately reproduced the true correlation values (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4B</xref>; linear correlation, r = 0.7). We further examined the fidelity of correlation calculations using modified spike trains that are missing spikes. We examined randomly deleting spikes, deleting isolated spikes, or deleting spikes within bursts (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4D</xref>; Methods). We found that at the 1 s time scale, correlation calculations were tolerant to these spike train perturbations. The fidelity of correlation computations were &gt;0.6 with up to 60% missing spikes (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4E</xref>; Methods). Thus, with conventional spike inference accuracy, about 80% variance of the true correlation is recovered (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4E</xref>). Thus, NCs are a robust measurement even with imperfectly inferred spike trains.</p>
<p>Next, we evaluated the robustness of NC measurements, given the finite number of trials that are feasible to obtain. We computed NCs for both within-area neuron pairs and inter-area neuron pairs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). NCs were computed using spike counts within 1 s bins, similar to previous work with electrophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cohen and Kohn, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Smith and Sommer, 2013</xref>). Although both within-area and inter-area NCs had wide distributions (range: −0.2 – 0.6). The mean NCs across a population were positive and at least five times larger than control data, which are NCs computed after shuffling the trials (5 – 20-fold, 25 – 75% quantile; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). The estimation of the population mean NC converges fast with increasing numbers of neurons, as suggested by both simulation and experimental data (e.g., the margin of error at 95% CI for mean NC is 0.008 for 100 neuron pairs, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). While the population-level NC calculations are reliable, the NC estimation of individual neuron pairs is noisier due to the limited number of trials, albeit positively correlated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). A linear model explains about 53 <italic>±</italic> 24 % of the variance between NCs for individual neuron pairs computed using different random subsets of trials. In summary, this evidence indicates that NCs can be accurately measured at the population level with our large FOV calcium imaging methods, despite imperfect spike train inference and a finite number of trials.</p>

<title>Tuning similarity is a major factor in the V1-HVA functional network</title>
<p>Having established that NC measurements were reliable and robust, we examined potential NC-regulating factors, including firing rate, the physical distance between the neurons (laterally, across the cortex), signal correlation (<bold>SC</bold>, the similarity between two neurons’ average responses to stimuli), and RF overlap. We assessed the contributions of individual factors using a linear models. We found that both within- and inter-area NCs are similarly modulated by the aforementioned factors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>; r<sup>2</sup> of linear regression model). SC is the most pronounced factor that explains about 10% of the variance of within-area NCs, and about 5% of the variance of inter-area NCs (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5A</xref>). Fraction RF overlap contributes about 6% and 3% variance of within- and inter-area NCs, respectively (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5B</xref>). The firing rate explained about 2% of the variance of within- and inter-area NCs (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5C</xref>). Thus SC, RF overlap, and firing rate positively regulate both within and inter-area NC, with SC providing the strongest predictor.</p>

<p>(<bold>A</bold>) The variance of within-area and inter-area NCs (during grating stimuli) is explained by individual factors including firing rate (FR), signal correlation (signal corr.), neuron distance (neu. dist.), and receptive field (RF) overlap.

</fig>
<p>We then evaluated whether NCs are modulated by tuning similarity independent of RF overlap. In the subset of orientation-selective neurons, both within- and inter-area NCs were significantly modulated by orientation tuning selectivity. That is, neuron pairs that shared the same preferred orientation exhibited higher NCs (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5D</xref>). NCs of a subset of neurons with non-overlapping RFs were significantly higher when the neurons shared the same preferred orientation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>; t-test, p &lt; 0.05 for V1, LM and AL neuron pairs, insufficient data for PM and LI). This result confirms that the connectivity between neurons is modulated by tuning similarity (SC) independent of RF overlap, over millimeter distance scales.</p>
<p>Overall, about 20% of the variance of within-area NCs, and 10% of the variance of inter-area NCs are explained by the aforementioned factors jointly (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>; r<sup>2</sup> of multi-linear regression model). Although inter-area NCs have a smaller mean and variance, it is less predictable by known factors (within-area NCs pooled over all tested area 0.012 ± 0.052, inter-area NCs between V1 and all tested HVAs 0.0063 ± 0.04; both t-test and F-test p &lt; 10<sup>−4</sup>). In an expansion of prior work on local functional sub-networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wertz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Harris and Mrsic-Flogel, 2013</xref>), we find that signal correlation is the strongest factor regulating both within-area and inter-area NC networks, suggesting that neurons exhibiting similar tuning properties are more likely to form functional sub-networks across a broad spatial scale, spanning millimeters in the mouse V1-HVA network.</p>

<title>Neurons are connected through functionally discrete channels</title>
<p>Seeing as HVAs exhibited biased SF-TF selectivity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>), and after finding that tuning selectivity (SC) is a major factor for functional connectivity even across the millimeter length scale (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), we assessed the precision of this network. We performed additional analysis to determine whether the ST-TF biases in HVAs could be due to simple, weak biases in the NC network. Alternatively, there could be precise discrete channels of connectivity in the V1-HVA network to preserve information among similarly tuned neurons. We found evidence for this latter situation: discrete channels. Moreover, we found that the discrete channels consist of a greater number of neuron pairs with high NCs, rather than a small number of neuron pairs with very high NCs.</p>
<p>For this analysis, we focused on neuron pairs with high NCs, which we defined as NCs &gt; 2.5 times the standard deviation of trial shuffled NCs for the population (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). We focused on these high NC pairs, because they can represent high fidelity communication channels between neurons. Within each SF-TF group, for both V1 and HVAs, about 10-20% of neuron pairs exhibited high NCs, in contrast to 5% for inter SF-TF group connections (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A, B</xref>). The fraction of pairs that exhibit high NCs is relatively uniform across tuning groups and HVAs with a few exceptions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). For example, in HVA PM group 3 contains a higher fraction of high fidelity connections than the other HVAs. Overall, these results show that mixing between groups is limited, and instead group-specific high-NC sub-networks exist between neurons across millimeters cortical space.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="469114v4_fig4.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>To determine whether it is the number of high NC pairs or the magnitude of the NCs, we performed further analysis. Prior findings from studies of axonal projections from V1 to HVAs indicated that the number of SF-TF-specific boutons —rather than the strength of boutons— contribute to the SF-TF biases among HVAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Glickfeld et al., 2013</xref>). Though the functional connectivity is not completely defined by the feedforward axonal projections from V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Huh et al., 2018</xref>), this number vs. strength question is one that we can address with our data set. We found that the biased representation of SF-TF among HVAs is linearly related to the number of neuron pairs with high NCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). That is, there are more high NC pairs that are in-group. By contrast, the fraction of pairs with high NCs does not account the SF-TF biases of HVAs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). That is, the in-group pairs do not tend to have higher NCs. Thus, the biases in SF-TF are likely related to the abundance of SF-TF-specific connections, but not the strength of the connections.</p>
<p>To this point, we have focused on the six SF-TF groups. The evidence supports group-specific channels among these neurons. However, these six groups originated with 65 classes from data-driven GMM clustering, which were then manually collected into the six SF-TF groups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The trends we see for groups may reflect general SF-TF biases. In that case, we would expect that the in-class NCs would exhibit similar distributions of NCs as the in-group NCs. However, there might be further precision in the specific channels not captured by the SF-TF groups. A hint towards that can be seen in the fact that orientation tuning can modulate NCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), because some of the 65 GMM classes differ by preferred orientation (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>). Indeed, we found that when we plotted the NC distribution for in-class neuron pairs and compared it to the distribution for in-group neuron pairs, we found a pronounced positive tail for the in-class distribution (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Thus the GMM classes provide relevant, granular labels for neurons, which form functional sub-networks with discrete channels, which are more precise than predicted from simpler SF-TF biases or groups.</p>
<p>The GMM classes are widely distributed in all tested areas (<xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7B</xref>). We constructed an inter V1-HVA connectivity matrix for the 65 classes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). The connection weight is defined by the fraction of pairs with high NCs. To investigate the modular structure of this network, we performed community detection analysis using the Louvain algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Rubinov and Sporns, 2010</xref>). This analysis assigned densely connected nodes to the same module (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Overall, the connectivity matrix was split into four community modules (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">S7C</xref>). Interestingly, the corresponding node in V1 and HVAs for each module exhibited similar direction and SF-TF preferences (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). For example, the module 2 nodes exhibited narrow vertical direction tuning and preferred high SF and low TF. Module 1 exhibited high SF preference without direction bias. Area differences in the characteristic tuning selectivity of each module are small, suggesting that the GMM class channels are common across the V1HVA network. This is consistent with the overall broad-casting projection structure of V1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Han et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, V1 and HVA neurons can be classified by their selectivity to oriented gratings, and they form precise, discrete channels or sub-networks. These subnetworks of neuron pairs with high NCs preserve selectivity by limiting inter-channel mixing. The organization of V1-HVA sub-networks exhibited properties that are consistent with that of V1-HVA feedforward projections in that the number of high-fidelity connections, rather than the strength of the connections, accounted for SF-TF biases among HVAs. Moreover, the precision of these networks extends beyond prior observations of general SF-TF biases, to include orientation and direction tuning.</p>

<title>Functional connectivity is stable across stimuli</title>
<p>Functional connectivity is dynamic and transient, which complicates its relationship with structural (i.e., anatomical) connectivity, yet can provide more accurate predictions for network dynamics than the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Randi et al., 2023</xref>). We performed additional analysis to determine whether the NC-based functional connectivity analysis we performed above provides fundamental insights into neuron circuits beyond a stimulus-specific transient. We compared NC measurements in response to drifting gratings (<italic>NC</italic><sub><italic>grat</italic></sub>) to NC measurements in response to naturalistic videos (<italic>NC</italic><sub><italic>nat</italic></sub>). This analysis was restricted to the subset of neurons that responded to both types of stimuli in a separate set of experiments.</p>
<p>So far, we have shown that SC (i.e., neuron tuning similarity) is the best predictor for NCs. However, a neuron pair that shares a high SC to drifting gratings does not guarantee a high SC to naturalistic videos (<italic>corr</italic>(<italic>SC</italic><sub><italic>grat</italic></sub>, <italic>SC</italic><sub><italic>nat</italic></sub>) = 0.084 <italic>±</italic> 0.065).

<title>Recurrent connection contributes to the stability of NC network</title>
<p>Surprised by the cross-stimulus stability of the NC-based functional connectivity of the visual cortical network among V1 and HVAs, we went on to investigate what could be an underlying mechanism. NCs can be due to both shared input and direct/indirection wiring. Indeed, using a simple model with two leaky integrate-and-fire (<bold>LIF</bold>) neurons, we found that the NC is positively regulated by a larger fraction of shared input as well as by the increasing recurrent connection strength (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A, B</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="469114v4_fig6.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>We then asked how the two sources contribute to the cross-stimulus stability of the NC functional network using LIF neuronal network simulations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). The simulated neuronal network contained 80 excitatory neurons and 20 inhibitory neurons that are randomly connected. The input layer contains 1000 independent Poisson spiking neurons. The network parameters are determined based on previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Song et al., 2000</xref>) and all the simulations generated comparable LIF firing rates (4-6 Hz), as well as NCs (population mean: 0.05−0.25) and SC values (population mean: 0.01−0.15).</p>
<p>In the first set of simulations, the feedforward (<bold>FFD</bold>) connection from the input layer to the LIF network is random. Increasing recurrent connection strengths (ranging from 0.05 to 0.3) generated NC-based networks with higher cross-stimulus stability (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). A recurrent connection strength of 0.2 best reproduced the mouse data. In the second batch of simulations, we fixed the recurrent connection strength to 0.2 but manipulated the input FFD connection structure ranging from random to increasingly wider bell shapes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). This means that the local neurons receive increasingly similar FFD input. We found that increasingly similar local FFD input does not lead to higher NC stability, but does increase SC similarity across stimuli (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). Also, the random FFD input connection structure (0.18 FFD, red) reproduced the experimentally observed NC network the best (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, the LIF simulations showed that although both shared input and recurrent connections contributed to the NC, the recurrent connections are critical for generating the observed cross-stimulus stability of the NC functional network. Moreover, the simulations suggested that the network can receive relatively random FFD input.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We used large scale two-photon calcium imaging across cortical areas to show that NC-based assessments of functional connectivity exhibited tuning-specific organization with single neuron precision, across millimeter length scales. This connectivity is consistent with the axonal projection patterns obeserved in the mouse visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Glickfeld et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Han et al., 2018</xref>), but goes further, to include the precise GMM classes we found– 65 different classes in response to grating stimuli. Moreover, we found that NC-based networks are consistent across stimulus classes. Thus, V1 broadcasts high-fidelity channels of information to HVAs. The projections preserve fidelity by minimizing mixing among channels, i.e., tuning groups or classes.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Multi-scale functional connectivity and structural connectivity</title>
<p>To better understand this aspect of network organization, we examined the connectivity of the nervous system at multiple scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Sporns, 2016</xref>), and considered the coefficient of variance (<bold>CV</bold>, = standard deviation / mean) at each level and process (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). At the small scale, neurons interact through the release of neurotransmitters, which can affect ion channel activity. At the mesoscale, e.g. the current study, neurons are organized into networks or circuits with specific structures and hierarchies to serve a function in information processing, processing stimuli and/or guiding behavior. At the macroscale, brain regions can have diverse functions and interact to generate adaptive behavior. Assessing neuronal dynamics at these different scales requires a variety of technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Dorkenwald et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Harris et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Silver et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Stringer et al., 2019</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Dispersion of connectivity in neural circuitry</title>
<p>Circle size indicates the dispersion value (coefficient of variance, CV) of a particular network parameter, which is defined by either functional or anatomical measurements of connectivity. Synaptic or cellular scale connectivity is characterized by the number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Dorkenwald et al., 2022</xref>) and size of synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Dorkenwald et al., 2022</xref>) and the post-synaptic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Silver et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Seeman et al., 2018</xref>). The strength of the post-synaptic potential is further broken down into multiple synaptic properties, including the number of release sites, release probability, and the quantal size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Holler et al., 2021</xref>). NC network connectivity is defined as the fraction of high NC per condition. It is computed from the current dataset. SF-TF-specific dispersion is a measure of the network in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref>. GMM-class-specific dispersion is a measure of the network in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4F</xref>. Mix-channel-dispersion is measured from the fraction of high fidelity connections per area regardless of tuning specificity. Also, the NC network dispersion is quantitatively similar when measured from the connectivity matrix generated by the population mean NCs.

<p>We compiled data on multiple scales and modalities of mechanistic connectivity of the mouse nervous system. To compare across modalities and scales we focused on the CV, called <italic>dispersion</italic> hereafter, of various parameters (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Dispersion (CV) is unitless and allows us to bring disparate data into the same axis. We compared the dispersion of multi-scale connectivity to gain insights into the computations bridging multi-scale interactions. Notice that both functional and structural connectivity are available at the microscopic scale, but only one of the two is available for mesoscale and macroscale networks (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Functional connectivity has been measured at the macroscale in mice using one-photon techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ren and Komiyama, 2021</xref>) and fMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kim et al., 2023</xref>), but these approaches lack cellular resolution, and the analyses to date do not provide a quantitative measurement of dispersion that can map onto the same axis, thus they are omitted from this discussion. Still, we can provide a large range of dispersion measurements (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).</p>
<p>The dispersion of components of multi-scale connectivity of the nervous system ranges from 0.1 to 1.5 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Synaptic interactions are characterized by the number and size of synapses, and the post-synaptic potential. The size of synapses and the post-synaptic potential exhibited larger dispersion compared to the number of synapses, suggesting that neuronal interactions are regulated by the size and strength of synapses rather than the number of synapses (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). The combination of high-resolution electron microscopy (EM) and slice electrophysiology has un-covered a linear relationship between synaptic size and strength in the mouse L2/3 somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Holler et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, dispersion reduces at larger spatial scales (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). The measurement at these larger scales could mask some key sources of variance in connectivity. This becomes clear when comparing the dispersion of the tuning channel-specific connectivity with that of the mixing-channel connectivity measured by the current study. The dispersion of the latter reduces for both inter- and within-area connectivity, suggesting that tuning channel-specific communication is a key contributor to defining the functional connectivity between brain regions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, axonal projections measured without tuning channel-specific information provide the connectivity between all cortical regions and shed light on laminar differences, but do not discriminate brain areas thoroughly (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). In particular, the dispersion of V1-HVA L2/3 projections is small and similar to that of the L2/3 channel-mixing NC functional network, emphasizing the importance of tuning specificity in organizing the network in these cortical layers. L1 being the major destination for cortical feedback projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Harris and Shepherd, 2015</xref>), exhibited the largest dispersion in the anterograde projection connectivity.</p>
<p>Additional efforts are needed to bridge analysis of multi-scale connectivity. For example, models have been developed to understand how small-scale processes, such as synaptic interactions, collectively give rise to population neuron-level behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Gerstner and Kistler, 2002</xref>). Synaptic interactions are described at various levels of detail and biological realism in these models to serve specific research purposes. Population-level neuronal network models can be scaled up to represent brain regions or systems, which involves adding more neurons, specifying cell types, and connecting multiple networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Markram et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sporns, 2014</xref>). Integrating functional connectivity with anatomical connectivity would help develop a system model with functional causality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Honey et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Sporns, 2016</xref>). These models can simulate complex tasks or behaviors by connecting various brain regions and networks, accounting for sensory inputs, decision-making, and motor outputs.</p>
<p>In summary, mesoscale two-photon imaging techniques open up the window of cellular-resolution functional connectivity at the system level. How to make use of the knowledge of functional connectivity remains unclear, given that functional connectivity provides important constraints on population neuron behavior. One approach to address the gap is to link functional connectivity with structural connectivity to learn how the two constrain each other and integrate the functional connectivity into network models.</p>

<title>Animals and surgery</title>
<p>All animal procedures and experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill or the University of California Santa Barbara and carried out in accordance with the regulations of the US Department of Health and Human Services. GCaMP6s expressing transgenic adult mice of both sexes were used in this study. Mice were 110 - 300 days old for data collection. GCaMP6s expressing were induced by the triple crossing of TITL-GCaMP6s line (Allen Institute Ai94), Emx1-Cre line (Jackson Labs #005628), and ROSA:LNL:tTA line (Jackson Labs #011008)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Madisen et al., 2015</xref>). Mice were housed under a 12-h/12-h light-dark cycle, and experiments were performed during the dark cycle of mice. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (1.5 - 1.8%) and acepromazine (1.5 - 1.8 mg/kg body weight) when performing visual cortex craniotomy. Carpofen (5 mg/kg body weight) was administered prior to surgery. Mice’s body temperature was maintained using physically activated heat packs during surgery. Mouse eyes were kept moist with ointment during surgery. The scalp overlaying the right visual cortex was removed, and a custom head-fixing imaging chamber with a 5-mm diameter opening was mounted to the skull with cyanoacrylate-based glue (Oasis Medical) and dental acrylic (Lang Dental). A 4-mm diameter craniotomy was performed over the visual cortex and covered with #1 thickness coverslip.</p>

<title>Locating visual areas with intrinsic signal optical imaging (ISOI)</title>
<p>ISOI experiments were carried out similarly as previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stirman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Smith et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Smith and Trachtenberg, 2007</xref>). Briefly, the pial vasculature images and intrinsic signal images were collected using CCD camera (Teledyne DALSA 1M30) at the craniotomy window. A 4.7 × 4.7 mm<sup>2</sup> cortical area was imaged at 9.2 μm/pixel spatial resolution and at 30 Hz frame rate. The pial vasculature was illuminated and captured through green filters (550 ± 50 nm and 560 ± 5 nm, Edmund Optics). The ISO image was collected by focusing 600 μm down from the pial surface. The intrinsic signals were illuminated and captured through red filters (700 ± 38 nm, Chroma and 700 ± 5 nm, Edmund Optics). Custom ISOI instruments were adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kalatsky and Stryker (2003)</xref>. Custom acquisition software for ISOI imaging collection was adapted from David Ferster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stirman et al., 2016</xref>). During ISOI, mice were 20 cm from a flat monitor (60 × 34 cm<sup>2</sup>), which covers the visual field (110°x 75°) of the left eye. Mice were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane (0.5%) and acepromazine (1.5–3 mg/kg). The body temperature was maintained at 37 °C using a custom electric heat pad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stirman et al., 2016</xref>). Intrinsic signal response to the vertical and horizontal drifting bar was used to generate azimuth and elevation retinotopic maps (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>). The retinotopic maps were then used to locate V1 and HVAs. Borders between these areas were drawn at the meridian of elevation and azimuth retinotopy manually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Marshel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Smith et al., 2017</xref>). The vasculature map then provided landmarks to identify visual areas in two-photon imaging.</p>

<title><italic>In vivo</italic> two-photon calcium imaging</title>
<p>Two-photon imaging was carried out using a custom Trepan2p microscope controlled by custom LabView software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stirman et al., 2016</xref>). Simultaneous dual-region imaging was achieved by splitting the excitation beam and temporally multiplexing laser pulses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stirman et al., 2016</xref>). Two-photon excitation light from an 80 MHz Ti:Sapph laser (Newport Spectra-Physics Mai Tai DeepSee) was split into two beams through polarization optics, and one path was delayed 6.25 ns relative to the other. The two beams were independently directed with custom voice-coil actuated steering mirrors and tunable lenses, such that the X, Y, Z planes of the two paths are independently positioned within the full field (4.4 mm diameter). Both beams were scanned by the resonant scanner (4 kHz, Cambridge Technologies), and a single photon signal was collected by a photo-multiplier tube (PMT) (H7422P-40, Hamamatsu), and demultiplexed using outboard electronics prior to digitization. In the current study, two-photon imaging regions of 500 × 500 μm<sup>2</sup> were collected at 13.3 Hz for two-region imaging or 6.67 Hz for quad-region imaging. Imaging was performed with &lt;80 mW of excitation (910 nm) laser power, as measured out of the front of the objective. Mice recovered in their home cage for at least 2 days after surgery, before acquiring two-photon imaging. Mice were head-fixed <italic>∼</italic> 11 cm from a flat monitor, with their left eye facing the monitor, during imaging. Approximately 70° x 45° of the left visual field was covered. If not otherwise stated, two-photon images were recorded from quiet awake mice. For anesthetized experiments, mice were lightly anesthetized under 1% isoflurane. During two-photon imaging, we monitored mouse pupil position and diameter using a custom-controlled CCD camera (GigE, National Instruments) at 20 - 25 fps. No additional light stimulation was used for pupil imaging.</p>

<title>Visual stimuli</title>
<p>Visual stimulation was displayed on a 60 Hz LCD monitor (9.2 × 15 cm<sup>2</sup>). All stimuli were displayed in full contrast. For course population RF and single neuron RF mapping (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B-D</xref>), a rectangular (7.5°x 8.8°) bright moving patch containing vertical drifting grating (2 Hz, 0.05 cpd) on a dark background was displayed. The moving patch appeared and disappeared on a random position of the full monitor in pseudo-random order without interruption by a gray screen, and presented on each position for 5 sec.</p>
<p>To characterize the value and structure of the correlation of V1 and HVAs, we showed mice full-screen sine-wave drifting grating stimuli in 8 directions (0 – 315°, in 45° step), with an of 0.02, 0.05 or 0.19 cpd, and a TF of 1, 2 or 8 Hz (72 conditions in total). Each of the sine-wave drifting grating stimuli was presented for 2 s in pseudo-random order. Stimuli with the same SF and TF were presented successively without interruption. A gray screen was presented for 3 seconds when changing the SF and TF of stimuli.</p>
<p>In a subset of experiments, we also characterized the cross-stimulus stability of functional networks using combo stimuli with naturalistic videos and full contrast drifting gratings (at 2 Hz, 0.05 cpd). Two naturalistic videos, each lasting for 32 s were generated by navigating a mouse home cage using a GoPro camera.</p>

<title>Calcium imaging processing</title>
<p>Calcium imaging processing was carried out using custom MATLAB codes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Yu et al., 2022</xref>). Two-photon calcium imaging was motion corrected using Suit2p sub-pixel registration module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Pachitariu et al., 2016</xref>). Neuron ROIs and cellular calcium traces were extracted from imaging stacks using custom code adapted from Suit2p modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Pachitariu et al., 2016</xref>). Neuropil contamination was corrected by subtracting the common time series (1st principal component) of a spherical surrounding mask of each neuron from the cellular calcium traces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Harris et al., 2016</xref>). Neuropil contamination corrected calcium traces were then deconvolved using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Pnevmatikakis et al., 2013</xref>). For each calcium trace, we repeated the MCMC simulation for 400 times and measured the signal-to-noise of MCMC spike train inference for each cell. For all subsequent analyses, only cells that reliable spike train inference results were included. Neurons with low responsiveness were excluded for subsequent analysis (trial averaged spike count to preferred spatiotemporal frequency summed over all orientations &lt; 1; or trial averaged spike count to a 32 s naturalistic video &lt; 1).</p>

<title>Receptive field</title>
<p>We mapped RFs by reverse correlation of neuronal responses with the locations of the moving patch of drifting grating stimulus. For population RF mapping, population neuronal responses of simultaneously recorded neurons from a 500 × 500 μm<sup>2</sup> imaging window were reverse correlated with the stimulus locations.</p>

<sec id="s6g">
<title>Gaussian mixture model</title>
<p>To characterize the tuning properties unbiasedly, neurons were clustered using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) based on the trial-averaged responses to the drifting gratings. Only reliable responsive neurons were included for GMM analysis (trial-to-trial Pearson correlation of the inferred spike trains &gt; 0.08, spike trains were binned at 500 ms). Neuronal responses of the whole population pooled over all texted areas, were first denoised and reduced dimension by minimizing the prediction error of the trial-averaged response using the principle components (PC). 45 PCs were kept for population responses to the drifting gratings. We also tested a wide range number of PCs (20 <italic>−</italic> 70), and we found the tuning group clustering was not affected by the number of PCs. Neurons collected from different visual areas and different animals were pooled together in training GMM. GMMs were trained using MATLAB build function <italic>fitgmdist</italic> with a wide range number of clusters. A model of 65 classes was selected based on the Bayesian information criterion. We also examined models with smaller (20, 30, and 45) or even larger numbers of classes (75), the overall results held regardless of the number of GMM classes. <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref> show the response pattern of GMM classes of drifting gratings. The size of each GMM class is shown in <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">figure S1F</xref>.</p>
<p>To summarize the spatial-temporal tuning properties of neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>), we manually organized the 65 GMM classes into 6 groups based on their preferred SF, TF (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>). Group 1 prefers low SF and low TF (LSLT, 0.02 cpd, 1-2 Hz), group 2 prefers medium SF and low TF (MSLT, 0.05 cpd, 1-2 Hz), group 3 prefers high SF low TF (HSLT, 0.19 cpd, 1-2 Hz), group 4 prefers low SF high TF (LSHT, 0.02 cpd, 8 Hz), group 5 prefers medium SF and high TF (MSHT, 0.05 cpd, 8 Hz), group 6 prefers high SF and high TF (HSHT, 0.19 cpd, 8 Hz) and group 7 not specific. Group 7 included 4 classes that did not exhibit specific response features, among them two classes are extremely small (each contains &lt;5 neurons), and the other two contain neurons with small response strength (mean spike count &lt; 0.5 spikes/s to preferred stimulus). As we have been inclusive in data selection for the GMM training and included low-firing neurons, the latter two classes contain about 1500 neurons in total. It is justifiable to exclude low-response neurons from further analysis. Thus, the whole group 7 was excluded for further analysis.</p>

<title>GMM classification accuracy</title>
<p>We examined the accuracy of GMM classification for neuron responses to drifting gratings. We performed GMM clustering on 10 random subsets of neurons (90% of all neurons). We found the center of the Gaussian profile of each class was consistent (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). The same class of different GMMs was identified by matching the center of the class. Then we asked whether a neuron was classified in the same class in each GMM model. We found neurons were consistently classified into the same class in GMMs of a random subset of data (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). We also performed GMM on population data after randomly shuffling neuron identity (10 permutations). Classes were identified by matching the center of the class and then grouped following the previous definition. We found that neurons are allocated into the same SF-TF group in GMMs of randomly ordered data (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1G, H</xref>). These analyses suggested that GMM provided a reliable classification of neurons.</p>

<title>ISOI warping</title>
<p>We spatially registered ISOI map of V1 to align with that of LM or AL. We first segmented the ISOI map by color segmentation using K-means clustering and then determined the center of each color segment.

<title>Correlation calculation</title>
<p>Noise correlation was defined as the trial-to-trial correlation of residual spike count (1 s time window, if not otherwise stated) after subtracting the mean response to each stimulus of the 72-condition sine-wave drifting gratings. Residual spike count to all stimuli (eg. gratings with different directions and SFs and TFs), and all trials were concatenated into one column vector per neuron (<italic>u</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, i = 1,2… N, neuron identity).

Mean response was a 72-element column vector, computed by trial averaging responses to sine-wave gratings with 72 conditions.

<p>We computed inter-area NCs with simultaneously recorded regions that shared greater than 40% of population RF. We kept this criterion even though we did not detect a relationship between the inter-area NC and the fraction of population RF overlap within the tested range (p = 0.37).</p>

<title>Tolerance of correlation calculation to inaccuracy in spike train inference</title>
<p>We quantify the spike train inference accuracy using a previously published data set with simultaneous cell-attached recording and two-photon imaging of GCamp6s from mouse V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Chen et al. (2013)</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://crcns.org/data-sets/methods/cai-1">http://crcns.org/data-sets/methods/cai-1</ext-link>). We performed spike train inference on the recordings with stable baseline and good correspondence between calcium trace and electrophysiology recording (linear correlation, r &gt; 0.1; bin 0.1 s; <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A, B</xref>). The signal-to-noise (SNR) of the calcium trace of the calibration data is 12.3 ± 5. It is comparable with the SNR of the calcium signal of the current study (8.7 ± 1.8).</p>
<p>We further evaluated how the correlation calculation was affected by inaccurate spikes train recovery. We took publicly available electrophysiology recordings of mouse V1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Theis et al.

We did four types of perturbations, (1) randomly missing spikes; (2) missing isolated spikes as the signal-to-noise of the calcium signal of isolated spikes may be low; (3) missing all spikes within a burst; (4) missing 60% spikes within a burst (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4C</xref>). We identified isolated spikes or burst spikes by thresholding the inter-spike-interval of each spike. A spike that was &gt;t s distance away from spikes franking itself was a t isolated spike. A spike that was &lt;t s distance away from another spike was a t burst spike. The residual spike count correlation computed with perturbed spikes trains was linearly correlated with ground truth (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4D</xref>) and exhibited good tolerance to up to 60% missing spikes by all types of perturbation (fidelity &gt; 0.6; <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4E</xref>).</p>

<title>Significance of noise correlation</title>
<p>Since the value of noise correlations was small, we tested whether these values were significantly above zero. We compared the noise correlation with trial-shuffled noise correlation, the latter was computed using trial-shuffled data (the order of trials were randomized for each neuron independently). The population-mean noise correlation computed with trial-aligned data was significantly higher than that of the trial-shuffled data with the size of the experimental population (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>

<title>Accuracy of noise correlation</title>
<p>We investigated the accuracy of noise correlation estimation with both data and model. The individual noise correlations of the same set of neurons varied when computing using a different random subset of trials (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). We computed the population mean value of the noise correlation of a random subset of neuron pairs and calculated the confidence interval for estimating the population mean noise correlation. The accuracy of population-mean estimation increases with the number of neurons, even with a limited number of trials (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). We further characterized the estimation accuracy by simulating correlated neuron population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Macke et al., 2009</xref>), which allows an arbitrary number of trials. The expected firing rate and expected population mean correlation match our experimental data.

<p>Using multi-region two-photon calcium imaging, the manuscript meticulously explores the structure of noise correlations (NCs) across the mouse visual cortex and uses this information to make inferences about the organization of communication channels between primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual areas (HVAs). Using visual responses to grating stimuli, the manuscript identifies 6 tuning groups of visual cortex neurons and finds that NCs are highest among neurons belonging to the same tuning group whether or not they are found in the same cortical area. The NCs depend on the similarity of tuning of the neurons (their signal correlations) but are preserved across different stimulus sets - noise correlations recorded using drifting gratings are highly correlated with those measured using naturalistic videos. Based on these findings, the manuscript concludes that populations of neurons with high NCs constitute discrete communication channels that convey visual signals within and across cortical areas.</p>
<p>Experiments and analyses are conducted to a high standard and the robustness of noise correlation measurements is carefully validated. However, the interpretation of noise correlation measurements as a proxy from network connectivity is fraught with challenges. While the data clearly indicates the existence of distributed functional ensembles, the notion of communication channels implies the existence of direct anatomical connections between them, which noise correlations cannot measure.</p>
<p>The traditional view of noise correlations is that they reflect direct connectivity or shared inputs between neurons. While it is valid in a broad sense, noise correlations may reflect shared top-down input as well as local or feedforward connectivity. This is particularly important since mouse cortical neurons are strongly modulated by spontaneous behavior (e.g. Stringer et al, Science, 2019). Therefore, noise correlation between a pair of neurons may reflect whether they are similarly modulated by behavioral state and overt spontaneous behaviors. Consequently, noise correlation alone cannot determine whether neurons belong to discrete communication channels.</p>
<p>Behavioral modulation can influence the gain of sensory-evoked responses (Niell and Stryker, Neuron, 2010). This can explain why signal correlation is one of the best predictors of noise correlations as reported in the manuscript. A pair of neurons that are similarly gain-modulated by spontaneous behavior (e.g. both active during whisking or locomotion) will have higher noise correlations if they respond to similar stimuli. Top-down modulation by the behavioral state is also consistent with the stability of noise correlations across stimuli. Therefore, it is important to determine to what extent noise correlations can be explained by shared behavioral modulation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This groundbreaking study characterizes the structure of activity correlations over a millimeter scale in the mouse cortex with the goal of identifying visual channels, specialized conduits of visual information that show preferential connectivity. Examining the statistical structure of the visual activity of L2/3 neurons, the study finds pairs of neurons located near each other or across distances of hundreds of micrometers with significantly correlated activity in response to visual stimulation. These highly correlated pairs have closely related visual tuning sharing orientation and/or spatial and/or temporal preference as would be expected from dedicated visual channels with specific connectivity.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study presents best-in-class mesoscopic-scale 2-photon recordings from neuronal populations in pairs of visual areas (V1-LM, V1-PM, V1-AL, V1-LI). The study employs diverse visual stimuli that capture some of the specialization and heterogeneity of neuronal tuning in mouse visual areas. The rigorous data quantification takes into consideration functional cell groups as well as other variables that influence trial-to-trial correlations (similarity of tuning, neuronal distance, receptive field overlap). The paper convincingly demonstrates the robustness of the clustering analysis and of the activity correlation measurements. The calcium imaging results convincingly show that noise correlations are correlated across visual stimuli and are strongest within cell classes which could reflect distributed visual channels. A simple simulation is provided that suggests that recurrent connectivity is required for the stimulus invariance of the results. The paper is well-written and conceptually clear. The figures are beautiful and clear. The arguments are well laid out and the claims appear in large part supported by the data and analysis results (but see weaknesses).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>An inherent limitation of the approach is that it cannot reveal which anatomical connectivity patterns are responsible for observed network structure. The modeling results presented, however, suggest interestingly that a simple feedforward architecture may not account for fundamental characteristics of the data. A limitation of the study is the lack of a behavioral task. The paper shows nicely that the correlation structure generalizes across visual stimuli. However, the correlation structure could differ widely when animals are actively responding to visual stimuli. I do think that, because of the complexity involved, a characterization of correlations during a visual task is beyond the scope of the current study.</p>
<p>An important question that does not seem addressed (but it is addressed indirectly, I could be mistaken) is the extent to which it is possible to obtain reliable measurements of noise correlation from cell pairs that have widely distinct tuning. L2/3 activity in the visual cortex is quite sparse. The cell groups laid out in Figure S2 have very sharp tuning. Cells whose tuning does not overlap may not yield significant trial-to-trial correlations because they do not show significant responses to the same set of stimuli, if at all any time. Could this bias the noise correlation measurements or explain some of the dependence of the observed noise correlations on signal correlations/similarity of tuning? Could the variable overlap in the responses to visual responses explain the dependence of correlations on cell classes and groups?</p>
<p>With electrophysiology, this issue is less of a problem because many if not most neurons will show some activity in response to suboptimal stimuli. For the present study which uses calcium imaging together with deconvolution, some of the activity may not be visible to the experimenters. The correlation measure is shown to be robust to changes in firing rates due to missing spikes. However, the degree of overlap of responses between cell pairs and their consequences for measures of noise correlations are not explored.</p>
<p>Beyond that comment, the remaining issues are relatively minor issues related to manuscript text, figures, and statistical analyses. There are typos left in the manuscript. Some of the methodological details and results of statistical testing also seem to be missing. Some of the visuals and analyses chosen to examine the data (e.g., box plots) may not be the most effective in highlighting differences across groups. If addressed, this would make a very strong paper.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Yu et al harness the capabilities of mesoscopic 2P imaging to record simultaneously from populations of neurons in several visual cortical areas and measure their correlated variability. They first divide neurons into 65 classes depending on their tuning to moving gratings. They found the pairs of neurons of the same tuning class show higher noise correlations (NCs) both within and across cortical areas. Based on these observations and a model they conclude that visual information is broadcast across areas through multiple, discrete channels with little mixing across them.</p>
<p>NCs can reflect indirect or direct connectivity, or shared afferents between pairs of neurons, potentially providing insight on network organization. While NCs have been comprehensively studied in neuron pairs of the same area, the structure of these correlations across areas is much less known. Thus, the manuscripts present novel insights into the correlation structure of visual responses across multiple areas.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study uses state-of-the art mesoscopic two-photon imaging.</p>
<p>The measurements of shared variability across multiple areas are novel.</p>
<p>The results are mostly well presented and many thorough controls for some metrics are included.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I have concerns that the observed large intra-class/group NCs might not reflect connectivity but shared behaviorally driven multiplicative gain modulations of sensory-evoked responses. In this case, the NC structure might not be due to the presence of discrete, multiple channels broadcasting visual information as concluded. I also find that the claim of multiple discrete broadcasting channels needs more support before discarding the alternative hypothesis that a continuum of tuning similarity explains the large NCs observed in groups of neurons.</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<p>Major concerns:</p>
<p>(1) Multiplicative gain modulation underlying correlated noise between similarly tuned neurons</p>
<p>(1a) The conclusion that visual information is broadcasted in discrete channels across visual areas relies on interpreting NC as reflecting, direct or indirect connectivity between pairs, or common inputs. However, a large fraction of the activity in the mouse visual system is known to reflect spontaneous and instructed movements, including locomotion and face movements, among others. Running activity and face movements are some of the largest contributors to visual cortex activity and exert a multiplicative gain on sensory-evoked responses (Niell et al, Stringer et al, among others). Thus, trial-by-fluctuations of behavioral state would result in gain modulations that, due to their multiplicative nature, would result in more shared variability in cotuned neurons, as multiplication affects neurons that are responding to the stimulus over those that are not responding ( see Lin et al, Neuron 2015 for a similar point).</p>
<p>As behavioral modulations are not considered, this confound affects most of the conclusions of the manuscript, as it would result in larger NCs the more similar the tuning of the neurons is, independently of any connectivity feature. It seems that this alternative hypothesis can explain most of the results without the need for discrete broadcasting channels or any particular network architecture and should be addressed to support its main claims.</p>
<p>(1b) In Figure 5 the observations are interpreted as evidence for NCs reflecting features of the network architecture, as NCs measured using gratings predicted NC to naturalistic videos. However, it seems from Figure 5 A that signal correlations (SCs) from gratings had non-zero correlations with SCs during naturalistic videos (is this the case?). Thus, neurons that are cotuned to gratings might also tend to be coactivated during the presentation of videos. In this case, they are also expected to be susceptible to shared behaviorally driven fluctuations, independently of any circuit architecture as explained before. This alternative interpretation should be addressed before concluding that these measurements reflect connectivity features.</p>
<p>(2) Discrete vs continuous communication channels</p>
<p>(2a) One of the author's main claims is that the mouse cortical network consists of discrete communication channels. This discreteness is based on an unbiased clustering approach to the tuning of neurons, followed by a manual grouping into six categories in relation to the stimulus space. I believe there are several problems with this claim. First, this clustering approach is inherently trying to group neurons and discretise neural populations. To make the claim that there are 'discrete communication channels' the null hypothesis should be a continuous model. An explicit test in favor of a discrete model is lacking, i.e. are the results better explained using discrete groups vs. when considering only tuning similarity? Second, the fact that 65 classes are recovered (out of 72 conditions) and that manual clustering is necessary to arrive at the six categories is far from convincing that we need to think about categorically different subsets of neurons. That we should think of discrete communication channels is especially surprising in this context as the relevant stimulus parameter axes seem inherently continuous: spatial and temporal frequency. It is hard to motivate the biological need for a discretely organized cortical network to process these continuous input spaces.</p>
<p>(2b) Consequently, I feel the support for discrete vs continuous selective communication is rather inconclusive. It seems that following the author's claims, it would be important to establish if neurons belong to the same groups, rather than tuning similarity is a defining feature for showing large NCs.</p>
<p>Finally, as stated in point 1, the larger NCs observed within groups than across groups might be due to the multiplicative gain of state modulations, due to the larger tuning similarity of the neurons within a class or group.</p>

<p>We appreciate the constructive reviews. We have performed additional analysis to address reviewer concerns, and we will submit a full revision in the near future. Our new analysis confirms that the visual stimulus can account for about a third of the variance in population neural activity. Pupil dynamics only account for a small fraction of the trial-to-trial variability, less than six percent. Once we regress out the stimulus responses and the pupil dynamics, we can use the network activity to predict the trial-to-trial variability of single neuron responses, and about eight percent of the variance is explained. Thus it appears as though multiplicative gain cannot account for the results. As for the concerns about missing spikes, we would like to direct readers to the supplementary figure that addresses that concern. The analysis shows that the correlation measurements are robust to the imprecisions of spike inference from calcium imaging data. Finally, we would also like to take the opportunity to clarify that we make no claim as to the discreteness of tuning classes. The GMM analysis was performed to obtain a data-driven, granular categorization of neuron tuning, to support detailed statistical analysis. We take no position on the discreteness or lack thereof of these groups. We agree that it is an interesting question, and we are happy to provide additional analysis in the revision to address this question. Our main result on functional connectivity structure holds regardless of the discreteness of neuron tuning selectivity.</p>
