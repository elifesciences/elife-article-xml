<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) is a broadly expressed target of peptide hormones with essential roles in energy and glucose homeostasis, as well as of the blockbuster weight-loss drugs semaglutide and liraglutide. Despite its large clinical relevance, tools to investigate the precise activation dynamics of this receptor with high spatiotemporal resolution are limited. Here we introduce a novel genetically-encoded sensor based on the engineering of a circularly-permuted green fluorescent protein into the human GLP1R, named GLPLight1. We demonstrate that fluorescence signal from GLPLight1 accurately reports the expected receptor conformational activation in response to pharmacological ligands with high sensitivity (max ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> = 528%) and temporal resolution (τ<sub>ON</sub> = 4.7 sec). We further demonstrated that GLPLight1 shows comparable responses to GLP-1 derivatives as observed for the native receptor. Using GLPLight1, we established an all-optical assay to characterize a novel photocaged GLP-1 derivative (photo-GLP1) and to demonstrate optical control of GLP1R activation. Thus, the new all-optical toolkit introduced here enhances our ability to study GLP1R activation with high spatiotemporal resolution.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) is expressed in various parts of the brain, especially in the basolateral amygdala and hypothalamic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alvarez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cork et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Trapp and Brierley, 2022</xref>, p. 1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Turton et al., 1996</xref>, p. 1), as well as broadly outside the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Campos et al., 1994</xref>). Its endogenous ligand, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), is an anorexigenic peptide, fully conserved across mammals, that carries out both neuromodulatory and endocrine hormonal functions for the control of energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Andersen et al., 2018</xref>, p. 1). GLP-1 is produced mainly by two cell types: preproglucagon (PPG) neurons principally located in the Nucleus of the Solitary Tract (NTS) of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Trapp and Brierley, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Turton et al., 1996</xref>), and enterocrine cells (ECs) located in the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Trapp and Brierley, 2022</xref>). Upon ingestion of a meal, GLP-1 is rapidly released along with gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) from the gut into the bloodstream where it targets β-cells of the pancreas and stimulates the production and secretion of insulin under hyperglycemic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Andersen et al., 2018</xref>, p. 1). This phenomenon, known as the “incretin effect” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Nauck and Meier, 2018</xref>), is impaired in metabolic disorders, such as type-2 diabetes mellitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Holst et al., 2009</xref>), making GLP-1 signaling an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of these disorders. In addition to its role in controlling satiety and food intake, central GLP-1 has also been shown to play central neuroprotective roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hölscher, 2022</xref>), illustrating its multifaceted role in human physiology.</p>
<p>The human GLP1R (hmGLP1R) is a prime target for drug screening and drug development efforts, since GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP1RAs) are among the most effective and widely-used weight-loss drugs available to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Shah and Vella, 2014</xref>). Among the techniques that can be adopted in these screening efforts are those able to monitor ligand binding to GLP1R through radioactivity-based assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Knudsen et al., 2007</xref>) or fluorescently-labelled ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ast et al., 2020</xref>), and those able to monitor the coupling of GLP1R to downstream signaling pathways, for example through scintillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Runge et al., 2003</xref>), fluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Biggs et al., 2018</xref>) or bioluminescence resonance energy transfer assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>, p. 1). A technology to directly probe ligand-induced GLP1R conformational activation with high sensitivity and spatiotemporal resolution could facilitate drug screening efforts and open important new applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Frank et al., 2018</xref>), but is currently lacking.</p>
<p>To overcome these limitations, here we set out to engineer and characterize a new genetically-encoded sensor based on the GLP1R, using an established protein engineering strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Duffet et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Patriarchi et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Sun et al., 2018</xref>). This sensor, which we call GLPLight1, offers a direct and real-time optical readout of GLP1R conformational activation in cells, thus opening unprecedented opportunities to investigate GLP1R physiological and pharmacological regulation in detail under a variety of conditions and systems. We demonstrated its potential for use in pharmaceutical screening assays targeting GLP1R, by confirming that GLP1R and GLPLight1 show similar ligand recognition profiles, including high specificity towards GLP-1 over other class-B1 GPCR ligands, low-affinity for glucagon, and specific functional deficits of GLP-1 alanine mutants. Finally, to extend the optical toolkit further, we also developed a photocaged GLP-1 derivative (photo-GLP1) and adopted it in concert with GLPLight1 to enable all optical control and visualization of GLP1R activation.</p>

<title>Development of a genetically-encoded sensor to monitor hmGLP1R activation</title>
<p>To develop a genetically encoded sensor based on the hmGLP1R, we initially replaced the third intracellular loop (ICL3) of hmGLP1R with a cpGFP module from the dopamine sensor dLight1.3b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Patriarchi et al., 2018</xref>), between residues K336 and T343 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref></bold>). This initial sensor prototype had poor surface expression and a very small fluorescence response upon addition of a saturating concentration (10 μM) of GLP-1 (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> = 39%, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1a">Figure 1-figure supplement 1a</xref></bold>). Removal of the endogenous GLP1R N-terminal secretory sequence (amino acids 1-23) from this construct improved the membrane expression and the fluorescence response to GLP-1 (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> = 107%, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1a">Figure 1-figure supplement Fig. 1a</xref></bold>). We then performed a lysine scan on the residues spanning the intracellular loop-2 (ICL2) of the sensor. From this screening we identified one beneficial mutation (L260K) that more than doubled the dynamic range of the sensor (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> = 180%, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1b">Figure 1-figure supplement 1b</xref></bold>). Next, we performed site-saturated mutagenesis on both receptor residues adjacent to the cpGFP and screened a subset of 95 variants. This small-scale screening led us to identification of a new variant (containing the mutations K336Y and T343N) with ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> of about 341% (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1a">Figure 1-figure supplement 1c–d</xref></bold>). To further enhance surface expression of the sensor, we introduced a C-terminal endoplasmic reticulum export sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Stockklausner and Klocker, 2003</xref>) on this variant (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1a">Figure 1-figure supplement 1e</xref></bold>). We then introduced three previously-described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Wan et al., 2021</xref>) mutations in the cpGFP moiety, which improved the basal brightness of the probe without affecting its dynamic range (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1a">Figure 1-figure supplement 1f–g</xref></bold>). Finally, we mutated eight phosphorylation sites on the C-terminal domain that are responsible for GLP1R internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Thompson and Kanamarlapudi, 2015</xref>) (S431A, S432A, T440A, S441A, S442A, S444A, S445A, and T448A) aiming to maximally reduce the possibility of sensor internalization. The resulting sensor variant showed good membrane expression and a 528% maximal fluorescence response upon GLP-1 binding (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1a">Figure 1b–c</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1a">Figure 1-figure supplement 1h</xref></bold>). This final variant was named GLPLight1 and was chosen for further characterization. To aid with control experiments during GLPLight1 validation, we also set out to develop a sensor variant carrying mutations in the peptide binding pocket. We screened a panel of 14 single point mutations and identified a combination of 3 mutations (L141A, N300A and E387A) that abolished the fluorescent response to GLP-1 application while showing a good membrane expression of the sensor (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1b">Figure 1-figure supplement 2a–c</xref></bold>). This control variant was named GLPLight-ctr.</p>

<title>In vitro characterization of GLPLight1</title>
<p>To establish the utility of GLPLight1 as a new tool to investigate the human GLP1R in pharmacological assays, we first characterized its properties in vitro. We started by comparing sensor expression and fluorescent response among different cell types. To do so, we expressed GLPLight1 in primary cortical neurons in culture, via adeno-associated virus (AAV) transduction. Two weeks post-transduction, GLPLight1 was well expressed on the neuronal membrane and showed a maximal response of 456% to GLP-1 application (10 μM) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b–c</xref></bold>). We then measured the spectral properties of the sensor in HEK cells. The fluorescence spectra were similar to those of previously described green GPCR-sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Duffet et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Sun et al., 2018</xref>), and showed a peak excitation around 500 nm, peak emission around 512 nm, and an isosbestic point at around 425 nm (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref></bold>). Work on previously developed GPCR-based sensors that respond to neuropeptide ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Duffet et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ino et al., 2022</xref>) revealed that the conformational activation kinetics of these receptor types is at least an order of magnitude slower than what has been reported for monoamine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Feng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Patriarchi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Sun et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Wan et al., 2021</xref>), likely reflecting the more complex and polytopic binding mode of peptide ligands to their receptor.</p>
<p>Next, we compared the coupling of GLPLight1 and its parent receptor (WT GLP1R) to downstream signaling. We first measured the agonist-induced recruitment of G proteins and β-arrestin-2 using a split luciferase assay. In agreement with the known pleiotropic signaling of WT GLP1R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Rowlands et al., 2018</xref>), in our assay activation of the receptor led to a strong recruitment of miniGs, miniGq, miniGi, β-arrestin-2 as well as miniG12, albeit to a lower extent. In comparison to WT GLP1R, the coupling of GLPLight1 to all tested signaling partners was significantly reduced (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1c">Figure 1-figure supplement 3a-j</xref></bold>). To further confirm the absence of coupling to intracellular cyclic-AMP (cAMP) signaling of GLPLight1, we performed a titration of GLP-1 on the sensor and WT GLP1R in a luminescence-based cAMP assay. This revealed that the WT GLP1R showed high intracellular cAMP increase with an EC50 of 8.0 pM whereas no such increase was observed for GLPLight1 even at the highest GLP-1 concentrations tested (100 nM, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1c">Figure 1-figure supplement 3k</xref></bold>). These results indicate that GLPLight1 is unlikely to couple with endogenous intracellular signaling pathways.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Application of GLPLight1 as a tool for pharmacological screening</title>
<p>GLPLight1 is a novel genetically-encoded sensor capable of providing a sensitive intensiometric readout of hmGLP1R activation in response to its endogenous ligands. As such, this tool could have great potential for applications in the drug discovery and development field; however, a more careful characterization of its pharmacological response profile is needed to ensure its implementation as a screening tool. We thus performed a series of in vitro pharmacological experiments in which we characterized GLPLight1 responses under different conditions and with a variety of ligands with known pharmacological effects on GLP1R, with the aim to demonstrate the applicability of this sensor as a pharmacological screening tool. We started by testing the reversibility of sensor response via competition of GLP-1 with an antagonist peptide. To do so, we imaged GLPLight1-expressing HEK293T cells upon addition, in sequence, of 1.0 μM GLP-1 followed by 10 μM Exendin-9 (Ex-9), a well-known peptide antagonist of GLP1R. Ex-9 could partially reverse the signal to 42% of the maximal GLP-1 response, within less than 5 minutes in vitro (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–b</xref></bold>). Next, we tested whether two clinically-used anti-obesity drugs that are known GLP1RAs, liraglutide or semaglutide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">O’Neil et al., 2018</xref>), could trigger a response from the sensor. As expected, GLPLight1 responded to both GLP1RAs with almost maximal activation, on par with GLP1 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref></bold>). These results indicate that GLPLight1 can serve as a direct readout of pharmacological drug action on the hmGLP1R with higher temporal resolution than previously available approaches, such as downstream signaling assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Knowing that GLP-1 is produced along with GLP-2 and glucagon via proteolytic processing of a common preproglucagon precursor protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Drucker, 2001</xref>), we decided to investigate the specificity of our sensor against these other peptides. While the sensor did not respond with any detectable increase in fluorescence to GLP-2, it responded to glucagon with a ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> of 324% (61% of maximal response to GLP-1). To further characterize the sensitivity of GLPLight1 to its two endogenous agonists, we performed titrations of GLP-1 and glucagon in HEK293T cells and determined that GLPLight1 had a 94-fold higher affinity for GLP-1 compared to glucagon (EC<sub>50</sub> = 28 nM for GLP-1, EC<sub>50</sub> = 2.6 μM for glucagon), in agreement with previously-reported results employing a downstream cAMP readout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Runge et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, the affinity of GLP-1 measured in primary neurons (EC<sub>50</sub> = 9.3 nM) was comparable to the one in HEK cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref></bold>). Additionally, GLPLight1 did not respond to a panel of other endogenous class B1 GPCR peptide ligands that were tested at high concentration (1.0 μM), including GIP, CRF, PTH, PACAP or VIP.</p>
<p>The binding of GLP-1 to its receptor occurs via the N-terminus of the peptide, as demonstrated by previous structural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jazayeri et al., 2017</xref>) and mutagenesis studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Longwell et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). We therefore set out to determine whether the general trends observed by fluorescence response of GLPLight1 is in agreement with the pharmacological readout of GLP1R activation obtained using classical assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adelhorst et al., 1994</xref>). We synthesized four single-residue alanine mutants of GLP-1 at selected N-terminal positions (H1A, E3A, G4A, T5A) using automated fast-flow peptide synthesis (AFPS, see Supplementary Information) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hartrampf et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mijalis et al., 2017</xref>). All peptides were obtained in good yields and excellent purities after RP-HPLC purification. Titrations of individual GLP-1 mutants on GLPLight1-expressing cells revealed clear effects of the mutations on either the maximal sensor response (E<sub>max</sub>), the potency (EC<sub>50</sub>) of the peptide ligand, or both (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref></bold>). In particular, the critical role of H1 and G4 for both binding and activation has been reported in the literature several times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Manandhar and Ahn, 2015</xref>). In agreement with these results, we observed a significant reduction of E<sub>max</sub> and EC<sub>50</sub> for H1A (56% and 1300 nM, respectively) (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref></bold>, <bold>Entry a</bold>) and G4A (14% and 993 nM, respectively) (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref></bold>, <bold>Entry c</bold>), compared to WT GLP-1 using GLP1Light as a readout. Furthermore, position E3 was reported to be critical for binding, but not for activation. Here, we determined an E<sub>max</sub> of 96% compared to WT GLP-1 (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref></bold>, <bold>Entry b</bold>), as well as a reduced EC<sub>50</sub> (757 nM) for E3A, which is in agreement with the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Manandhar and Ahn, 2015</xref>) (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref></bold>). Finally, T5 has been reported as less important for GLP1R binding and activation than the other investigated peptide positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adelhorst et al., 1994</xref>). Accordingly, our experiments with GLPLight1 T5A showed the highest E<sub>max</sub> (100%) and EC<sub>50</sub> (188 nM) (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref></bold>, <bold>Entry d</bold>) of all alanine mutants investigated herein. Overall, we conclude that fluorescence response of GLPLight1 can be used to study the relative trends for E<sub>max</sub> and potency of GLP1R ligands.</p>

<p>State-of-the-art techniques for detecting endogenous GLP-1 or glucagon release in vitro from cultured cells or tissues consist of costly and time-consuming antibody-based assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kuhre et al., 2016</xref>) or analytical chemistry procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Amao et al., 2015</xref>). Given the genetically-encoded nature and the fast optical readout of GLPLight1, this tool has the potential to facilitate studies investigating the physiological regulation of GLP-1 release in vitro. To establish whether GLPLight1 could be sensitive enough to detect endogenous GLP-1 release in an in vitro setting, we cultured sensor-expressing HEK293T cells in the presence or absence of a GLP-1/glucagon-producing immortalized enteroendocrine cell line (GLUTag cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brubaker et al., 1998</xref>)). To distinguish the two cell types in the co-culture system, the HEK239T cells were co-transfected with a cytosolic red fluorescent protein (mKate2). To detect whether the GLPLight-expressing cells had detected endogenous GLP-1 release by the enterocrine cells, we bath-applied GLP-1 to cause full activation of the sensor. We observed that the response to GLP-1 of sensor-expressing cells cultured in the presence of GLUTag cells was significantly lower than that of cells cultured in their absence (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2a">Figure 2-figure supplement 1</xref></bold>). These results indicate that GLPLight1 was partially pre-activated by endogenous GLP-1 secreted by the enterocrine cells present in the dish. The detection of endogenous GLP-1 by the sensor opens the possibility to use it as a screening tool for studying intrinsic/extrinsic factors that regulate GLP-1 release from enterocrine cells in vitro.</p>

<title>Development and in vitro characterization of photo-GLP1</title>
<p>To investigate the spatiotemporal activation of GLP1R and GLPLight1, a photocaged derivative of GLP-1 was envisioned. To ensure that the photocaged GLP-1 derivative does not activate GLP1R or GLPLight1 prior to uncaging (i.e. in the dark), the photocage must be located on or near GLP-1 regions that are essential for binding. Photocaging of peptides can be achieved by the attachment of a photocaging molecule at a side-chain functionality, backbone amide, or at the C-or N-terminus of the peptide. Recently, we reported the optical control of orexin-B using a UV-visible light-sensitive C-terminal photocage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Duffet et al., 2022b</xref>). As opposed to orexin-B, GLP-1 primarily binds via its N-terminus to GLP1R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jazayeri et al., 2017</xref>). We therefore explored an N-terminal caging strategy to generate a photocaged GLP-1 derivative (photo-GLP1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). GLP-1 was prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) utilizing AFPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hartrampf et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mijalis et al., 2017</xref>). Before cleavage of the peptide from the resin, photocaging of the GLP-1 N-terminal amine was carried out by treating the resin-bound peptide with an active ester (<italic>N</italic>-hydroxysuccinimide [NHS] ester) form of the nitrobenzene-type photocage (see <bold>Supplementary Information</bold>). Cleavage of the resulting photocaged peptide from the resin followed by RP-HPLC purification successfully provided photo-GLP1 in 5% overall yield with &gt;95% purity. To confirm the release of WT GLP-1 upon treatment of photo-GLP1 with UV light, photo-GLP1 (80 μM in HBSS) was irradiated under LED light (λ = 370 nm, 0.64 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) for 20 min with air cooling. Subsequent LCMS and UHPLC analysis demonstrated complete uncaging of photo-GLP1 to afford WT GLP-1, confirmed by co-injection of a standard sample of WT GLP-1 (80 μM in HBSS) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3a">Figure 3-figure supplement 1</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>We then leveraged on GLPLight1 to establish an all-optical assay for characterizing photo-GLP1 uncaging in vitro. We bath-applied photo-GLP1 (10 μM) onto GLPLight1-expressing HEK293T cells and performed optical uncaging by exposing a defined area directly next to the cells to 405 nm laser light (UV light) for defined periods of time, while the sensor fluorescence was imaged using 488 nm laser light. Application of photo-GLP1 by itself failed to trigger any response from GLPLight1, indicating a lack of functional activity in the absence of UV light (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3b">Figure3-figure supplement 2a</xref></bold>). On the contrary, after photo-GLP1 was added to the bath, the fluorescence of GLPLight1 visibly increased upon 10 seconds of UV light exposure, indicating that GLP-1 could successfully be uncaged and activated the sensor on the cells. Higher durations of UV light exposure led to a higher degree of GLPLight1 responses, and the maximal uncaging duration tested (100 sec) triggered approximately 30% of the maximal response of the sensor, as assessed in the same assay by bath-application of a saturating GLP-1 concentration (10 μM) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b–c</xref></bold>). Importantly, to show that the sensor signals are not due to UV light-induced artifacts, we reproduced the maximal (100 sec) uncaging protocol on GLPLight-ctr-expressing HEK293T cells and confirmed that in this case no sensor response could be observed. Furthermore, pre-treatment of the cells with the GLP1R antagonist Ex-9 significantly blunted the sensor response evoked by the optical uncaging (100 sec) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3b">Figure3-figure supplement 2b</xref></bold>). These results indicate that photo-GLP1 can be effectively uncaged in vitro using 405 nm light to control hmGLP1R activation.</p>

<sec id="s2e">
<title>High-resolution all-optical visualization and control of GLP1R activity</title>
<p>Upon performing the uncaging experiments, we noticed that the profile of the sensor response to bath-applied GLP-1 differed, depending on whether or not photo-GLP1 was present in the bath. To investigate this phenomenon more in detail, we measured and compared the sensor activation kinetics when GLPLigth1 was activated by direct bath application of GLP-1 in the presence or absence of an equimolar concentration of photo-GLP1 in the bath. The sensor response was strikingly different in the two conditions, and exhibited an approximate two-fold reduction in the speed of activation in the presence of photo-GLP1 (τ<sub>ON</sub> without photo-GLP1 = 4,7 sec; τ<sub>ON</sub> with photo-GLP1 = 68,1 sec; <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d–e</xref></bold>). These results indicate that photo-GLP1, in the dark (i.e. with an intact photocage), can affect the kinetics of GLP1R activation, and this is likely mediated by its binding to the receptor extracellular domain (ECD), which competes for the functionally-active GLP-1. In fact, since the GLP1R belongs to class-B1 GPCRs, the binding of GLP-1 is known to involve an initial step where the peptide C-terminus is recruited to the ECD, followed by a second step involving insertion of the peptide N-terminus into the receptor binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). Given that our photocage was placed at the very N-terminus of photo-GLP1, our results show that this caging approach prevents the peptide’s ability to activate GLP1R but, at the same time, preserves its ability to interact with the ECD.</p>
<p>We next asked whether we could leverage GLPLight1 to obtain spatial information on the extent of GLP1R activation in response to photo-GLP1 uncaging. To do so, we performed optical photo-GLP1 uncaging on three separate areas of about 400 μm<sup>2</sup> placed at different locations in a large field of view (FOV, approximately 40,000 μm<sup>2</sup>). UV light was applied for a total of 40 seconds on the three uncaging regions during the imaging session. Surprisingly, GLPLight1 shows a fluorescent response in all three uncaged areas, while its fluorescence remained unaltered throughout the rest of the FOV, indicating high spatial localization of the response to GLP-1 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref></bold>). As a control, the omission of photo-GLP1 in the cell bath led to no sensor response upon uncaging (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref></bold>). Additionally, the same session was repeated on GLPLight-ctr-expressing cells. Also in this case, no response to uncaging could be observed (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref></bold>). To determine whether the sensor readout in this assay could report GLP1R activation with even subcellular resolution, we repeated the uncaging experiment by selecting an uncaging area of approximately 16 μm<sup>2</sup> directly on a cell membrane. In this case, the application of UV light led to localized activation of GLPLight1 that was limited to a portion of the cell membrane and did not spread to neighboring cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref></bold>). These results demonstrate that the optical nature of the GLPLight1 readout makes it possible to determine the spatial extent of GLP1R activation with very spatial high-resolution, down to sub-cellular domains.</p>
<p>Finally, we tested whether uncaging of photo-GLP1 could be used to control functional signaling downstream of hmGLP1R activation. To this aim, we employed a recently developed genetically encoded sensor for cyclic-AMP (G-Flamp1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Wang et al., 2022</xref>), which is the main second messenger involved in cellular signaling downstream of GLP1R activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Holz et al., 2015</xref>). We imaged a field of HEK293T cells co-transfected with the hmGLP1R and G-Flamp1 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref></bold>) during application of photo-GLP1 to the cells and after optical uncaging of photo-GLP1 (2 sec, 1 nM) within a limited area of about 70 μm<sup>2</sup> located directly above a single HEK293T cell. As a result of uncaging, the signal from the cAMP sensor increased visibly and significantly only in the cell directly underneath the uncaged area (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref></bold>). The same uncaging protocol applied in the absence of photo-GLP1 on the cells failed to trigger any response from the cAMP sensor (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4a">Figure 4-figure supplement 1</xref></bold>), indicating that the sensor signals reliably reported intracellular cAMP signaling triggered by uncaged GLP-1. Furthermore, as a positive control, we bath-applied the same concentration of GLP-1 (1 nM) at the end of each recording to stimulate simultaneously the activation of the receptor on all cells. Indeed, this could elicit a response in all the imaged cells that did not respond to the previous uncaging protocol (‘distant cells’) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b–d</xref></bold>). As part of our observations, we observed a small dip of the G-Flamp-1 signal in response to photo-GLP1 bath application. To assess whether this signal drop was caused by the signaling activity of the photo-GLP1 or was an artifact from G-Flamp-1 imaging, we repeated the measurement by applying HBSS to the cells. The small signal drop could be detected also in these experiments (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4a">Figure 4-figure supplement 1</xref></bold>), demonstrating that the initial dip in G-Flamp-1 signal was artefactual, possibly due to temperature or pressure changes onto the cells. Overall, our results demonstrate that uncaging of photo-GLP1 can be used to achieve optical control of GLP1R signaling activation with high spatiotemporal resolution.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we report the first genetically encoded sensor engineered based on cpGFP and the human GLP1R. We show that this tool can directly report ligand-induced conformational activation of this receptor with the high sensitivity and spatiotemporal resolution typical of GPCR-based sensors. Using this new probe, we found that ligand-induced conformational activation of the human GLP1R occurs on slower timescales compared to the reported kinetics of other similarly-built GPCR-sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Labouesse and Patriarchi, 2021</xref>). This new insight is not surprising given that previously developed sensors were built from class-A GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Labouesse and Patriarchi, 2021</xref>), while GLP1R belongs to a different class of GPCRs (class B1) that is characterized by a distinct ligand-binding mechanism that involved initial ligand ‘capture’ by the receptor’s ECD, followed by ligand insertion into the receptor binding pocket for initiating the transduction of signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Accordingly, our observations show that the receptor activation kinetics can be largely influenced by pre-incubation with an inactive form of the GLP-1 peptide (photo-GLP1), likely because the inactive peptide interacts with and occupies the receptor’s ECD.</p>
<p>We showcased the sensitivity and utility of GLPLight1 as a pharmacological tool to aid drug screening and development efforts by characterizing its response to various naturally occurring peptide ligands, as well as clinically-used agonists and peptide-derivatives with diverse pharmacological actions on GLP1R. Besides its applications in pharmacology and drug discovery, given its high sensitivity and the lack of interference with intracellular signaling, GLPLight1 holds great potential to be used for investigating the dynamics of endogenous GLP-1 and/or glucagon directly in living systems. For example, future studies could leverage on AAV-mediated expression of GLPLight1 in living tissues or animals for implementing its use through in vivo imaging techniques, such as fiber photometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gunaydin et al., 2014</xref>), mesoscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cardin et al., 2020</xref>) or two-photon microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Helmchen, 2009</xref>). Through such efforts, GLPLight1 might help shine new light on the hidden mechanisms of GLP-1 and/or glucagon release dynamics in relation to physiological or pathological conditions.</p>
<p>Finally, we leveraged GLPLight1 to characterize the uncaging of the photocaged GLP-1 derivative (photo-GLP1) described for the first time in this work. Optical tools to selectively activate GLP1R could contribute to mechanistic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Frank et al., 2018</xref>), and the photoswitchable GLP-1 LirAzo was recently used to optically control insulin secretion and cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Broichhagen et al., 2015</xref>). As opposed to photoswitchable peptides, in which the side chain or part of the peptide backbone is replaced by a photoswitchable moiety such as an azobenzene, photo-GLP1 releases native GLP-1 upon optical uncaging. By deploying GLPLight1 and photo-GLP1 in concert in an all-optical assay, we determined that the spatial spread of GLP1R activation in response to GLP-1 release can be localized to single-cells or even sub-cellular domains. Furthermore, by combining a state-of-the-art cAMP sensor with photo-GLP1, we demonstrated the optical control of hmGLP1R-dependent downstream cellular signaling with single-cell resolution, opening exciting new opportunities for investigating the spatial regulation of this signaling pathway.</p>
<p>In summary, we developed and utilized a new all-optical toolkit to unveil a previously inaccessible spatial dimension of the GLP-1/GLP1R system. These tools may thus be readily implemented in a variety of applications, some of which are showcased as part of this study, to advance our understanding of the roles of GLP-1/glucagon/GLP1R signaling system in physiology, or to foster the drug screening and development process targeting the GLP1R pathway.</p>

<p>The sequence coding for human GLP1R was ordered as a synthetic DNA geneblock (Integrated DNA Technologies) bearing HindIII and NotI restriction site for cloning into a CMV-promoter plasmid (Addgene #60360).

<title>Cell culture, imaging and quantification</title>
<p>Mammalian HEK293T cells (CRL-3216 from ATCC) were cultured in DMEM medium (Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 10% FBS (Thermo Fisher) and 1X final Antibiotic-Antimicotic (Thermo Fisher) and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The cells were transfected using Effectene transfection kit for individual dishes or 24 well plates (Qiagen) or Linear PEI (Sigma Aldrich) for T75 flask transfection following the manufacturer’s instructions and imaged 24-48h after transfection. Primary cortical neurons were prepared as follows: the cerebral cortex of 18 days old rat embryos were carefully dissected and washed with 5 mL sterile-filtered PBGA buffer (PBS containing 10 mM glucose, 1.0 mg/mL bovine serum albumin and antibiotic-antimycotic 1:100 (10,000 units/mL penicillin; 10,000 μg/mL streptomycin; 25 μg/mL amphotericin B)) (ThermoFisher Scientific). Cortices were cut into small pieces and digested in 5.0 mL sterile filtered papain solution for 15 minutes at 37 °C. Tissues were then washed with complete DMEM medium containing 10% Fetal Calf Serum and penicillin/streptomycin (1:100), triturated and filtered through a 40 μm cell-strainer. Neurons were plated at a concentration of 40,000–50,000 cells per well onto poly-L-lysine (50 μg/mL in PBS, ThermoFisher Scientific) coated dishes and kept in NU-medium (Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) with 15% NU serum, 2% B27 supplement, 15 mM HEPES, 0.45% glucose, 1.0 mM sodium pyruvate, 2.0 mM GlutaMAX). The cultures were virally transduced after 4–6 days with adeno-associated viruses at a 1 × 10<sup>9</sup> GC/mL final titer and kept for 12–16 days in vitro. The HEK293T cells or neurons were rinsed with HBSS (Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution, Life Technologies) and kept in a final volume of HBSS being either 100 μL for individual 15 mm glass bottom insert dish or 500 μL for 24-well plates. Time lapse recordings were performed at room temperature (approx. 20 °C) on a Zeiss LSM 800 inverted confocal microscope controlled by Zeiss Zen Blue 2018 v2.6 software using either a 40X oil-based objective (individual dishes) or 20X air objective (24-well plates). The probes were excited using the following laser lines: 488 nm for GLPLight1 and GLPLight1-ctr. The ligands were all added in bolus before or during the time-lapse recording using a micropipette to reach the desired final concentration once mixed with HBSS imaging media. Optical uncaging was performed using a 40x Plan-Apochromat oil-based objective (N/A = 1,4; 69% transmittance at 405 nm from manufacturer’s datasheet) over specified surface areas with various scanning rates (described in each legend) and a pixel dwell time of 1.52 μsec. The average intensity of laser light used for uncaging was measured using a S120C Photodiode Power Sensor from Thorlabs and was kept at 0.38 mW. Image quantification was performed after manual selection of the regions of interest (ROI) corresponding to the cell membrane using the thresholding function from Fiji. The sensor response (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>) was calculated as followed: F<sub>t</sub>-F<sub>0</sub>)/F<sub>0</sub> with F<sub>t</sub> being the fluorescence intensity of the ROI at each time point t, and F0 being the mean fluorescence intensity of the 10 time points before ligand addition for each ROI. ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> values were calculated using a custom-made MatLab script and plotted in GraphPad Prism. The ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> images were obtained by dividing pixel-wise fluorescence intensities prior and post ligand addition using a separate MatLab script and displayed as a color-coded RGB image.</p>

<title>Plate reader-based imaging</title>
<p>The spectral characterization of the sensor was performed using GLPLight1 transfected HEK293T cells pre and post 10 μM GLP-1(7<bold>–</bold>37) addition. The excitation and emission spectra were measured at λ<sub>em</sub> = 560 nm and λ<sub>ex</sub> = 470 nm, respectively, on a TECAN M200 Pro plate reader at 37 °C. Transfected or untransfected cells were lifted using Versene<sup>®</sup> (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and resuspended in PBS at a concentration of 3.3 million cells per mL. For each condition, 300 μL of the cell suspension or PBS was transferred per individual wells of a black bottom 96-well plate. Untransfected cells were used to correct for autofluorescence whereas PBS alone was used to subtract the buffer Raman bands. Intracellular cAMP production was assessed with the GloSensor<sup>™</sup> cAMP assay. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with the pGLO20F and either human GLP1Ror GLPLight1 in separate T75 flasks. Note that the endogenous signal peptide (amino acids 1<bold>–</bold>23) from GLP1R WT was deleted to maintain a similar membrane expression compared to GLPLight1 for all signaling assays. Cells were lifted 24 h after transfection using Versene<sup>®</sup> and re-suspended at a final concentration of 1,500,000 cells per mL in DMEM without phenol red + 15 mM HEPES (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 100 μL of the cell suspension was dispensed per well in a 96-well white plate (Corning) and incubated with 2.0 mM of Luciferin potassium salt in 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) for 45–60 minutes. The cells were then imaged right after addition of 50 μL of ligand to reach the desired final concentration using a Cytation C10 (Biotek) plate reader in kinetic luminescence mode at 37 °C. Positive (2.5 mM Forskolin) and negative controls (assay medium) were always included in triplicate alongside the constructs to be tested. The dose-response curves were obtained using the average luminescence value of the 5 timepoints after the peak of cAMP production of the positive control. Luminescence complementation assays were conducted using HEK293T cells co-transfected with GLPLight1-SmBit or GLP1R-SmBit along with either miniGs-LgBit, miniGi-LgBit, miniGq-LgBit, miniG12-LgBit or Beta-arrestin-2-LgBit. After transfection, cells were seeded in a 96-well Optiplate<sup>®</sup>, using 10,000 cells per well for the miniGs-LgBit condition and 50,000 cells for all others. Cells were then incubated for 45–60 minutes at 37 °C with the NanoGlo<sup>®</sup> live cell reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The baseline luminescence was recorded for 100 cycles (approx. 460 sec), paused for manual addition of the ligand or the vehicle and resumed for another 200 cycles (approx. 920 sec). The ΔR/R<sub>0</sub> values were calculated by dividing the raw luminescence intensities after GLP-1(7-37) addition by the ones after vehicle addition. This ratio was then normalized using the average luminescence intensity before addition as a baseline for both GLPLight1 and GLP1R conditions. The quantification of the maximal recruitment was calculated using the average ΔR/R<sub>0</sub> between t = 600 sec and t = 700 sec.</p>

<title>Flow cytometry</title>
<p>After transfection, HEK293T cells were harvested using Versene<sup>®</sup>. After resuspension in FACS buffer (1 × PBS, 1.0 mM EDTA, 25 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 1% FBS) 300,000 cells were dispensed in each well of a 96-well plate, mixed with an equivalent volume of ligand to reach the desired concentration, and were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature before the start of the measurement. Transduced neurons were washed once using the FACS buffer, gently mechanically lifted using a cell scraper and homogenized by repeated up and down pipetting in FACS buffer. They were then incubated for 15 minutes on ice to minimize cell death before measurement. All flow cytometry experiments were performed on a FACS Canto II 2L using a high-throughput sampler (HTS). Forward scattering (FSC), side-scattering (SSC) and 488 nm-excited fluorescence (FITC) data were acquired for a total of 50,000–100,000 events per well. The cells were manually gated using non-expressing cells as comparison, to define the FITC-positive population. Within this subgroup, the mean FITC intensity was calculated for each condition and normalized to the maximum FITC signal.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> Tools and Resources paper presents new tools for investigating GLP-1 signaling: a genetically-encoded sensor constructed from a mutated GLP1R receptor as well as a caged agonist peptide. The evidence for these tools working as advertised is largely <bold>convincing</bold> and they may be helpful for screening compounds that bind to GLP1R. On the other hand, their overall utility is limited by their very weak apparent affinity relative to the likely biological concentration and response. <bold>Incomplete</bold> characterization of the properties of the tools makes it difficult to anticipate which applications are most likely to succeed.</p>

<p>This paper presents two new tools for investigating GLP-1 signaling. The genetically encoded sensor GLPLight1 follows the plan for other GPCR-based fluorescent sensors, inserting a circularly permuted GFP into an intracellular loop of the GPCR. The light-uncaged agonist peptide, photo-GLP1, has no detectable agonist activity (as judged by the GLPLight1 sensor) until it is activated by light. However, based on the current characterization, it is unclear how useful either of these tools will be for investigating native GLP-1 signaling.</p>
<p>The GLPLight1 sensor has a strong fluorescent response to GLP-1 with an EC50 of ~10 nM, and its specificity is high, as shown by lack of response to ligands of related class B GPCRs. However, the native GLP1R enables biological responses to concentrations that are ~1000-fold lower than this (as shown, for instance, in a supplemental figure of this paper). This makes it difficult to see how the sensor will be useful for in vivo detection of GLP-1 release, as claimed; although there may be biological situations where the concentration is adequate to stimulate the sensor, this is not established. Data using a GLP-1 secreting cell line suggest that the sensor has bound some of the released GLP-1, but it is difficult to have confidence without seeing an actual fluorescence response to stimulated release.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the sensor might be used for drug screening, but it is unclear that this would be an improvement over existing high-throughput methods using the cAMP response to GLP1R activation (since those are much more sensitive and also allow detection of signaling through different downstream pathways).</p>
<p>The utility of the caged agonist PhotoGLP1 is similarly unclear. The data demonstrate a substantial antagonism of GLP-1 binding by the still-caged compound, and it is therefore unclear whether the kinetics of the response to PhotoGLP1 itself would mimic the normal activation by GLP-1 in the absence of the caged compound. A further concern is that the light-dependence of the agonist effect of PhotoGLP1 was evaluated only with the GLPLight1 sensor and not with GLP1R signaling itself, which is 1000x more sensitive and which would be the presumed target of the tool. In addition, PhotoGLP1 is based upon native GLP-1, which is rapidly truncated and inactivated by the peptidase DPPIV, expressed in most cell types, and expressed at very high levels in the plasma. The utility of PhotoGLP1 is therefore limited to acute (minutes) in vitro experiments.</p>
