<title>Summary</title><p>Cell migration is a key process in the shaping and formation of tissues. During sprouting angiogenesis, endothelial tip cells invade avascular tissues by generating actomyosin-dependent forces that drive cell migration and vascular expansion. Surprisingly, ECs can still invade if actin polymerization is inhibited. In this study, we show that endothelial tip cells employ an alternative mechanism of cell migration that is dependent on Aquaporin (Aqp)-mediated water inflow and increase in hydrostatic pressure. In the zebrafish, ECs express <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> in newly formed vascular sprouts in a VEGFR2-dependent manner. Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 loss-of-function studies show an impairment in intersegmental vessels formation because of a decreased capacity of tip cells to increase their cytoplasmic volume and generate membrane protrusions, leading to delayed tip cell emergence from the dorsal aorta and slower migration. Further inhibition of actin polymerization resulted in a greater decrease in sprouting angiogenesis, indicating that ECs employ two mechanisms for robust cell migration <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our study highlights an important role of hydrostatic pressure in tissue morphogenesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The blood vascular system is a dynamic, multicellular tissue that adapts to the metabolic demands of development, growth and homeostasis by altering its pattern and morphology. Macroscopic transformation in the vascular network is achieved by microscopic changes in endothelial cell (EC) behaviours. For example, vascular expansion through sprouting angiogenesis requires the coordination of EC migration, proliferation, anastomosis, lumen formation and cell rearrangements, all of which require specific cell shape changes. At the initial phase of sprouting angiogenesis, endothelial tip cells generate numerous membrane protrusions such as filopodia and lamellipodia that drive migration and anastomosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Figueiredo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Gerhardt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Phng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Sauteur et al., 2017</xref>). During tubulogenesis, apical membranes deform by generating inverse blebs to expand lumens so that blood can be transported efficiently through the blood vascular network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gebala et al., 2016</xref>). However, following vessel perfusion, ECs become less dynamic and instead develop resistance to the deforming forces of blood pressure to maintain vessel morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kondrychyn et al., 2020</xref>). EC shape is therefore dynamic and changes depending on the morphogenetic state of vascular development.</p>
<p>It is well established that localized remodelling of actin cytoskeleton and non-myosin II contractility are instrumental in driving cell shape changes during tissue morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Clarke and Martin, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Munjal and Lecuit, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Murrell et al., 2015</xref>). More recently, there is an accumulating body of work implicating a role of water flow and the resulting changes in hydrostatic pressure as another mechanical mechanism of cell shape change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Choudhury et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chugh et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Li et al., 2020</xref>). For example, in the osmotic engine model of cell migration, water inflow at the leading edge and outflow at the rear leads to forward translocation of tumour cells in confined microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Stroka et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, hydrostatic pressure from the extracellular environment can drive tissue morphogenesis, as demonstrated during mouse blastocyst formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dumortier et al., 2019</xref>), development of the otic vesicle in the zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Mosaliganti et al., 2019</xref>) and blood vessel lumen expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gebala et al., 2016</xref>). Hydrostatic pressure can therefore generate sufficient forces to shape tissues and organs to their proper form and size during development.</p>
<p>We have previously discovered that EC migration persists after the inhibition of actin polymerization and in the absence of filopodia to generate new blood vessels in the zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Phng et al., 2013</xref>). This observation suggests the existence of an alternative mechanism of migration independent of actin polymerization. In this study, we sought to determine whether hydrostatic pressure regulates EC migration during sprouting angiogenesis in the zebrafish by investigating the function of Aquaporins (Aqp), which are transmembrane water channels that increase water permeability of cell membranes to promote transcellular water flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Day et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Farinas et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Kozono et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Preston et al., 1992</xref>). We discovered that ECs of newly formed intersegmental vessels (ISV) express <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> mRNA, and observed the enrichment of Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 proteins in the leading edge of migrating tip cells. Detailed single cell analyses showed that endothelial tip cells lacking <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> expression have reduced cell volume, membrane protrusions and migration capacity. As a result, there is defective sprouting angiogenesis and ISV formation in <italic>aqp1a.1;aqp8a.1</italic> double mutant zebrafish. Notably, when actin polymerization is inhibited in <italic>aqp1a.1</italic>;<italic>aqp8a.1</italic> double mutant zebrafish, there is a greater impairment in EC migration and sprouting angiogenesis, demonstrating the additive function of actin polymerization and hydrostatic pressure (that is created by water inflow) in generating membrane protrusions to drive EC migration <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title><italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> are differentially expressed by tip and stalk cells during sprouting angiogenesis</title>
<p>Of the 18 number of <italic>aquaporin</italic> genes that are expressed in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Tingaud-Sequeira et al., 2010</xref>), <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> mRNA have been detected in blood endothelial cells (ECs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Koun et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Rehn et al., 2011</xref>). We confirmed the endothelial expression of <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> at 30 hours post fertilization (hpf) and 2-, 3- and 4-days post fertilization (dpf) by whole-mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (Fig. S1). The two endothelial <italic>aqp</italic> genes, however, differ in spatial expression. While <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> is widely expressed in blood vessels of the head and trunk (dorsal aorta (DA), caudal artery (CA), ISVs, dorsal longitudinal anastomotic vessels (DLAV) and caudal vein plexus) at 30 hpf, <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> expression is absent in cerebral blood vessels and is restricted to the DA, CA and the ventral regions of ISVs in the trunk. After 1 dpf, <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> expression expands to the entire ISV and DLAV. Additionally, the expression of <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> gradually decreases in the DA and CA so that both are absent by 4 dpf. Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of ECs isolated at 34 hpf and 3 dpf further confirmed the endothelial expression of <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> mRNA (Fig. S2 A - D), revealed differential expression of <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> mRNA in distinct endothelial clusters and highlighted higher <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> transcript expression in all endothelial subtypes compared to <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> (Fig. S2 E - H).</p>
<p>We next examined the expression pattern of <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> at the beginning of sprouting angiogenesis at higher resolution using RNAscope and confocal microscopy. At 20 hpf, <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> mRNA is highly expressed in the DA with little expression in the PCV (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A, C</xref> and Fig. S3). Closer inspection uncovered heterogeneous expression in the DA, with higher expression in ECs that would be specified as tip cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A, C</xref> and Fig. S3B). Indeed, tip cells of newly formed vascular sprouts express higher levels of <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> compared to adjacent ECs in the DA at 20 hpf (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> – C, Fig. S3B) and the majority of ISVs (61%) display higher <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> expression in tip cells than in trailing stalk cells at 22 hpf (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). Although we previously observed <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> mRNA in the DA at 30 hpf (Fig. S1), its expression here is largely absent at 20 hpf (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B, D</xref> and Fig. S3C). At 22hpf, <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> mRNA expression in the DA increases (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E and F</xref>). Interestingly, unlike <italic>aqp1a.1</italic>, in 78% of ISVs analyzed, <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> mRNA is more highly expressed in stalk cells than tip cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). These observations highlight differential expression pattern of <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> in newly formed vascular sprouts, with <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> expression enriched in tip cells and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> expression in stalk cells.</p>

<title>VEGF-VEGFR2 signalling induces the expression of <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> mRNA</title>
<p>As <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> mRNA display differential tip-stalk cell expression, we explored whether their expression is regulated by the VEGFR2-Notch signalling axis, which controls endothelial tip-stalk cell specification during sprouting angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Benedito and Hellström, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Phng and Gerhardt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Siekmann et al., 2013</xref>). To inhibit VEGFR2 activity, embryos were treated with 1 µM ki8751 from 20 hpf. Relative quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) experiments showed that <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> mRNA expression was suppressed by 52% after 6 hours (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and by 40% after 24 hours (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) of ki8751 treatment when compared to DMSO-treated embryos (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> mRNA expression was also decreased by the inhibition of VEGFR2 activity, and its suppression was accentuated after 24 hours treatment (93% decrease, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) compared to after 6 hours (17% decrease, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0028). These results demonstrate that VEGFR2 activity upregulates the expression of <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic>, but the temporal dynamics is different for <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic>. To examine whether VEGFR2 activity also regulates Aquaporin expression in human ECs, we treated cultured human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) with ki8751 for 6 hours and analyzed <italic>AQP1</italic> expression by qPCR. <italic>AQP8</italic> expression was not examined since it is not expressed in HAECs (data not shown). Inhibition of VEGFR2 activity with 1 nM and 10 nM ki8751 decreased <italic>AQP1</italic> mRNA expression by 31% (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0023, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>) and 40% (<italic>p</italic> = 0.1032, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>), respectively, demonstrating cross-species conservation of VEGFR2 activity in inducing <italic>Aqp1</italic> mRNA expression.</p>
<p>Notch signalling was inhibited using the gamma-secretase inhibitor, Dibenzazepine (DBZ), which prevents proteolytic cleavage and consequently, activation of the Notch receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Groth et al., 2010</xref>). Treatment of embryos with DBZ from 20 hpf for 6 and 24 hours significantly decreased the expression of <italic>hey1</italic> and <italic>hey2,</italic> canonical targets of Notch signalling (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref>), confirming the effectiveness of the drug treatment in our experiments. When compared to DMSO-treated embryos, 6-hour treatment with DBZ did not cause a significant change in <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> expression levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref>). Longer treatment with DBZ for 24 hours, however, increased <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> expression by 98% (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) while <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> expression was relatively unchanged (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref>). These findings suggest that Notch signalling inhibits <italic>aqp8a.1</italic>, but not <italic>aqp1.a</italic>, expression.</p>

<title>Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 proteins are enriched at the leading front of migrating tip cells</title>
<p>To gain a better understanding of where within the cell Aquaporin protein functions, we generated stable <italic>Tg(fli1ep:aqp1a.1-mEmerald)<sup>rk30</sup></italic> and <italic>Tg(fli1ep:aqp8a.1-mEmerald)<sup>rk31</sup></italic>zebrafish lines in which ECs express Aqp1a.1 or Aqp8a.1 tagged with mEmerald, respectively. At 25 hpf, we observed an accumulation of Aqp1a.1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) and Aqp8a.1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>) in mCherryCAAX-positive membrane clusters in the cytoplasm and filopodia of tip cells. Interestingly, many of the Aqp1a.1- or Aqp8a.1-positive membrane clusters are located at the migrating front of the tip cell. Time-lapse imaging capturing the process of ISV formation between 24 to 30 hpf further showed sustained enrichment of Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 in clusters at the front of the tip cell as well as in filopodia (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C and D</xref>, Movie S1 and S2), suggesting that Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 may promote localized water flux at the migrating edge of tip cells.</p>

<title>Loss of Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 function leads to defective trunk blood vessel formation</title>
<p>We subsequently proceeded to generate zebrafish <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> mutants to investigate the function of Aquaporin-mediated water flow in blood vessel development. Using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technique, we targeted the first exons of <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> genes. The CRISPR-generating allele <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28</sup></italic> carries a 14-bp deletion and an 8-bp insertion in the 5’ end of the gene leading to a premature termination codon at amino acid 76 after 1 missense amino acid (Fig. S4A-B). The <italic>aqp8a.1<sup>rk29</sup></italic> allele carries a 4-bp deletion in the 5’ end of the gene that leads to a frameshift after T15 and premature termination codon at amino acid 73 after 58 missense amino acids (Fig. S5A-B). Premature termination codons are often more deleterious than missense mutations because they result in the loss of protein expression. Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay is a quality-control mechanism that selectively degrades mRNAs harboring premature termination codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chang et al., 2007</xref>). Using whole-mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization and qPCR analysis, we demonstrated that <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> mRNA expression is significantly decreased in <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup></italic> (Fig. S4C-D) and <italic>aqp8a.1<sup>rk29/rk29</sup></italic>(Fig. S5C-D) zebrafish embryos, respectively, suggesting a rapid degradation of mutant mRNAs and as a result, the loss of Aquaporin protein expression.</p>
<p>Although <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup>;aqp8a.1<sup>rk29/rk29</sup></italic>embryos look morphologically normal when compared to wildtype or <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>+/rk28</sup>;aqp8a.1<sup>+/rk29</sup></italic> embryos (Fig. S8A, B, C and D), we observed defects in blood vessel formation and patterning at 1 to 3 dpf. Compared to 28 hpf control embryos whose ISVs have reached the dorsal roof of the neural tube and started to form the DLAV, ISVs of <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup>;aqp8a.1<sup>rk29/rk29</sup></italic>embryos are much less developed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A and D</xref>) with significantly reduced length (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref> and Fig. S6H and K). Single deletion of <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref> and Fig. S6F and I) or <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref> and Fig. S6G and J) also led to defective ISV formation, although the defects are less severe compared to the loss of both <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> expression. Comparison of ISV length in <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup></italic>, <italic>aqp8a.1<sup>rk29/rk29</sup></italic> and <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup>;aqp8a.1<sup>rk29/rk29</sup></italic>embryos shows that the loss of <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> leads to a greater decrease in ISV length than the loss of <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>, Fig. S6I and J), and that the loss of both <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> resulted in the greatest reduction. These observations indicate an additive effect of Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 function in blood vessel development and implicate Aqp1a.1 as the more dominant Aquaporin protein in EC function, in line with the higher expression of <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> mRNA in tip cells.</p>

<p>We next examined the embryos at 3 dpf, a stage when arterial ISVs (aISVs) and venous (vISVs) are fully established and lumenized, connecting the DLAV to either the DA or PCV (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F and G</xref>), respectively. Such fully established ISVs are significantly reduced in embryos when <italic>aqp1a.1</italic>, <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> or both <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> are deleted. Instead, these embryos display an increased number of aISVs and vISVs that fail to establish a connection to the DLAV, DA or PCV (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref> – J). Quantification shows that while 19.1% of wildtype embryos display at least 1 incomplete ISV per embryo, this increased to 65.8% in <italic>aqp8a.1<sup>rk29/rk29</sup></italic>embryos, 83.3% in <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup></italic> embryos and 92.2% in <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup>;aqp8a.1<sup>rk29/rk29</sup></italic> embryos (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3K</xref>). The number of incomplete ISVs per embryo in <italic>aquaporin</italic> mutants was variable, between 1 to 6, 1 to 16 and 1 to 22 incomplete ISVs in <italic>aqp8a.1<sup>rk29/rk29</sup></italic>, <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup></italic>and <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup>;aqp8a.1<sup>rk29/rk29</sup></italic> embryos, respectively (Fig. S6A-D). We also found that incomplete ISVs appear with higher frequency in the zebrafish trunk (ISV number 6 to 15) rather than in the tail (ISV number 16 to 27, Fig. S6E). Detailed analysis revealed that most of the incomplete ISVs are vISVs that are connected to the PCV but not the DLAV (Class I, 75.2%), followed by the absence of aISV or vISV (Class II, 15.8%, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3L</xref> and Fig. S7A and B). A small fraction of the incompletely formed vessels are aISVs that are not connected to the DA (Class IV, 2.2%, Fig. S7D) or DLAV (Class V, 2.9%, Fig. S7E), or vISVs that are not connected to the DLAV (Class VII, 2.68%, Fig. S7F). At some regions, there is an aISV that is not connected to the DA and a vISV that is not connected to the DLAV (Class III, 1.2%, Fig. S7C).</p>
<p>As <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> is expressed in brain vasculature during development (Fig. S1), we examined whether cerebral vasculature is also affected in <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup></italic> embryos. At 4 dpf, we found that the length of the dorsal longitudinal vein (DLV), a main blood vessel that supplies blood to the choroid plexus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bill and Korzh, 2014</xref>) was reduced in <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup></italic> embryos (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0098, Fig. S9B). Also, in 2 out of 21 <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup></italic>embryos, the DLV was undeveloped (Fig. S9A and C), a defect that is also observed in 50% of <italic>vegfab<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>vegfc<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Parab et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, our analyses suggest that in the absence of Aqp1a.1 and/or Aqp8a.1 function, there is an initial delay in ISV formation during primary sprouting angiogenesis. By 3 dpf, some ISVs are completely formed (Fig. S8K and M), connecting the DA or PCV to the DLAV. However, the number of completely formed ISVs is significantly decreased, with the loss of Aqp1a.1 having a more severe impact compared to the loss of Aqp8a.1, and the combined loss of Aqp1a.1 or Aqp8a.1 having a greater deleterious effect.</p>

<title>Aquaporins promote endothelial tip cell protrusion and migration</title>
<p>To gain a better understanding of how incomplete ISV formation arise, we performed timelapse imaging in zebrafish depleted of both Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 function from 21 – 22hpf, when sprouting angiogenesis begins. In <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>+/rk28</sup>;aqp8a.1<sup>+/rk29</sup></italic> embryos, tip cells emerge from the DA between 20 and 24 hpf (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) and migrate dorsally between the somite boundaries over the notochord and neural tube to form primary ISVs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, Movie S3). However, in <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup>;aqp8a.1<sup>rk29/rk29</sup></italic>embryos, tip cell nuclei emerge between 22 and 28 hpf (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Furthermore, in some <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup>;aqp8a.1<sup>rk29/rk29</sup></italic> embryos, tip cells retract whereby membrane protrusions do not extend dorsally in the direction of migration but withdraw into the DA so that a primary ISV does not form at this location (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, Movie S4). These observations indicate that tip cell protrusion from the DA is significantly delayed in the absence of Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 function.</p>

<p>We have previously demonstrated that filopodia facilitate EC migration by serving as a template for lamellipodia formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Phng et al., 2013</xref>). Lamellipodia frequently emanate laterally from stable filopodia at the leading edge of tip cells, leading to rapid expansion of the filopodium, increase in volume and the formation of a stable protrusion in the direction of migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Phng et al., 2013</xref>). This was similarly observed in <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>+/rk28</sup>;aqp8a.1<sup>+/rk29</sup></italic> embryos (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, Movie S5) but not in <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup>;aqp8a.1<sup>rk29/rk29</sup></italic>embryos (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>, Movie S6).

<title>Tip cell volume regulation depends on Aquaporin-mediated water influx</title>
<p>Aquaporin channels permit bidirectional flow of water across the plasma membrane, with the direction of flow determined by the osmotic gradient between the extracellular environment and cell cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agre et al., 2002</xref>). We next sought to determine whether water flows in or out of tip cells during sprouting angiogenesis. We hypothesize that water flux across the cell membrane can lead to changes in tip cell volume, with water influx increasing the volume while outflow decreases. To quantify tip cell volume, we injected a plasmid encoding <italic>kdrl:mEmerald</italic> transgene into 1-cell stage wildtype or <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup>;aqp8a.1<sup>rk29/rk29</sup></italic>embryos to label ECs in a mosaic manner. mEmerald-positive tip cells were imaged and their volume measured at 24 to 25 hpf. Wildtype ECs are on average 946.6 ± 299.8 µm<sup>3</sup> in size (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A and C</xref>). In the absence of both Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 function (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>), tip cell volume significantly decreased by about 24% to 718.4 ± 308.5 µm<sup>3</sup> (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0176, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>) when compared to wildtype tip cells.

<p>It has been proposed that water influx through Aquaporin increases the diffusion of actin monomers and increases actin polymerisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Loitto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Papadopoulos et al., 2008</xref>). Given that filopodia formation is dependent on actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Mallavarapu and Mitchison, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Ridley, 2011</xref>), we examined whether actin polymerization is perturbed in the absence of Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 by quantifying the growth rate of actin bundles in tip cell filopodia by tracking Lifeact-mCherry signal in the filopodia. In wildtype embryos, the average growth rate of actin is 0.054 ± 0.015 µm per second whereas in <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup>;aqp8a.1<sup>rk29/rk29</sup></italic>embryos, the growth rate is significant decreased by 47% to 0.028 ± 0.010 µm per second (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>).

<title>Additive effects of actin polymerization and water influx in driving EC migration and sprouting angiogenesis</title>
<p>We have previously observed that ECs are still able to migrate to generate ISVs after the inhibition of actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Phng et al., 2013</xref>). In these experiments, embryos were treated with a low concentration of Latrunculin B (Lat. B), an inhibitor of actin polymerization, that resulted in the suppression of filopodia formation. Under such conditions, ECs can generate small membrane protrusions and migrate more slowly in a directed manner to generate ISVs. How ECs are still able to migrate after the inhibition of actin polymerization was unclear. As our current study demonstrates a role of water inflow and hydrostatic pressure as another mechanism of cell migration, we hypothesize that ECs employ water influx to migrate when actin polymerization is compromised and that the depletion of both water influx and actin polymerization will result in a greater inhibition of EC migration.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, we examined ISV development in embryos with decreased actin polymerization and water inflow by treating <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup>;aqp8a.1<sup>rk29/rk29</sup></italic>embryos with Lat. B. At 28 hpf, ISVs of wildtype embryos treated with DMSO have reached the dorsal roof of the neural tube (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>) and show an average length of 104.1 ± 13.47 µm (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). The treatment of wildtype embryos with 0.08 µg/ml Lat. B from 20 to 28 hpf (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>) resulted in a significant decrease in ISV length (61.53 ± 23.27 µm) compared to control embryos (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). A similar decrease in ISV length was also observed in <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup>;aqp8a.1<sup>rk29/rk29</sup></italic>embryos treated with DMSO (63.75 ± 30.24 µm, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C and E</xref>).

In the absence of actin polymerization and presence of Aquaporins, hydrostatic pressure deforms membranes to generate membrane protrusions. When Aquaporin function is lost, membrane protrusions is generated by actin polymerization. Fewer membrane protrusions are formed when only one mechanism is utilized, resulting in slower EC migration. See also Movie S7.</p></caption>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we demonstrate that endothelial tip cells utilize two mechanisms of migration concurrently during sprouting angiogenesis in the zebrafish - actin polymerization and hydrostatic pressure. The increase in hydrostatic pressure in endothelial tip cells is generated by Aqp1a.1- and Aqp8a.1-mediated water inflow. By performing detailed expression analyses, we showed that <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> are differentially expressed in newly formed vascular sprouts. <italic>Aqp1a.1</italic> is expressed earlier in the DA than <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> during development and in ECs destined to be tip cells. In newly formed ISVs, endothelial tip cells express higher <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> mRNA levels while stalk cells express higher <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> mRNA levels. In zebrafish harbouring mutations in both <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic>, there is delayed tip cell protrusion from the DA, decreased tip cell migration and increased occurrence of truncated ISVs at 3 dpf. We further discovered that <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> expression is upregulated by VEGFR2 activity, proposing that VEGFA-VEGFR2 signalling employs Aquaporin function to drive sprouting angiogenesis.</p>
<p>Several lines of evidence implicate Aquaporins in facilitating water flow into endothelial tip cells during sprouting angiogenesis. First, timelapse imaging showed enriched localization of Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 proteins at the migrating front of tip cells, suggesting that water flow occurs locally at the leading edge of the cell. Secondly, single cell analyses revealed Aqp1a.1- and Aqp8a.1-deficient tip cells have decreased cell volume, impaired expansion of cell membranes at the leading edge and decreased generation of stable cell protrusions. These observations implicate water flow into tip cells, leading to increased cell volume. Due to the incompressible property of water within an enclosed compartment such as the cell, water influx will lead to a rise in hydrostatic pressure. At the leading edge of tip cells, increased hydrostatic pressure would expand and deform membranes to generate protrusions. Additionally, water influx can reduce cytoplasmic viscosity and increase spacing between the plasma membrane and the underlying actin cytoskeleton, promoting actin monomer diffusion, actin polymerization and the generation of membrane protrusions to facilitate cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Boer et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Loitto et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>A key finding in this study is the demonstration that endothelial tip cells employ hydrostatic pressure as a second mechanism of cell migration <italic>in vivo</italic>. In a previous study, we discovered that ECs continue to migrate when actin polymerization is inhibited and in the absence of filopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Phng et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we show that hydrostatic pressure is the driving force for EC migration in the absence of actin-based force generation. When both mechanisms are perturbed, there is a greater impairment in EC migration (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D and E</xref>). This finding highlights the importance of hydrostatic pressure as an additional mechanism that reinforces actin-based cell shape changes and motility to ensure robust migration and formation of new blood vessels in complex three-dimensional environments. Such dual mode migration is advantageous when blood vessels develop in physically confined spaces such as in the zebrafish trunk, where ECs must emerge from the DA and migrate within somite boundaries and over tissues such as the notochord and neural tube to form ISVs. Such dependence on water flow in cell migration under confined microenvironment has been reported in human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and mouse S180 sarcoma cells, which show cell migration persistence in narrow channels after inhibition of actin polymerization or myosin II-mediated contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Stroka et al., 2014</xref>). In this context, AQP5 mediates water flow and the decrease or increase in AQP5 expression suppresses or enhances, respectively, cancer cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chae et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Jung et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Stroka et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Our findings on the endothelial function of zebrafish Aqp1a.1, which is homologous to mammalian AQP1, corroborate previous studies demonstrating a function of AQP1 in promoting cell migration. In tumour bearing AQP1-null mice, there is reduced tumour angiogenesis and AQP1-deficient ECs display reduced migration in an <italic>in vitro</italic> wound healing assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Maltaneri et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Saadoun et al., 2005</xref>). In chick, AQP1 expression levels affect neural crest cell migration speed and direction by regulating filopodia length and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">McLennan et al., 2019</xref>). The regulation of membrane protrusions has also been demonstrated for other Aquaporin proteins. For example, AQP9 weakens membrane-cytoskeleton anchorage and promote formation of membrane protrusions such as filopodia and blebs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Karlsson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Loitto et al., 2007</xref>). We also demonstrate for the first time a role of Aqp8a.1 in promoting EC migration and sprouting angiogenesis in the zebrafish. However, its mammalian ortholog, AQP8, was shown to inhibit migration of colorectal cancer cell lines <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Wu et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting cell- and context-dependent function of AQP8 in the regulation of cell migration.</p>
<p>A central determinant of water movement is the osmotic gradient across the membrane, with water flowing in the direction of higher solute concentration. Given a crucial role of water flow in regulating cell volume, shape and migration, it is also important to understand the function and distribution of ion channels, exchangers and transporters and water channels that generate an osmotic gradient across the cell. This is reflected in a growing number of studies demonstrating a role of ion transporters in cell migration. In neutrophils, the increase in cell volume and potentiation of cell migration depend on the sodium-proton exchanger 1 (NHE1) and the chloride-bicarbonate exchanger 2 (AE2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Nagy et al., 2023</xref>). In T cells, chemokine-induced migration depends on ion influx via SLC12A1, and water influx via AQP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Boer et al., 2023</xref>). In tumour cells migrating in narrow channels, the establishment of a polarized distribution of Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> pumps and Aquaporin proteins in cell membranes is required for net inflow of ions and water at the leading edge and net outflow at the trailing edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Stroka et al., 2014</xref>). We have also observed enrichment of Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 proteins in ECs, at the leading edge of migrating endothelial tip cells as well as apical membranes during lumen formation (not shown). This leads to the question of how Aquaporin localisation is regulated as this will determine the site of increased water flow and hydrostatic pressure. The rapid changes in subcellular localization of mammalian Aquaporins upon stimulation occurs mainly via trafficking to and from the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Markou et al., 2022</xref>), and can lead to changes in the amount of Aquaporin protein in the plasma membrane. The regulation of AQP subcellular relocalization via calmodulin- and/or phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms has been implicated for AQP0-5 and AQP7-9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Markou et al., 2022</xref>). For example, rapid translocation of AQP1 to plasma membrane upon a hypotonic stimulus is dependent on calmodulin activation and phosphorylation by protein kinases C (PKC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Conner et al., 2012</xref>). Phosphorylation of AQP2 by protein kinase A (PKA) is required for vasopressin-stimulated relocalization of AQP2 from storage vesicles to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Noda and Sasaki, 2005</xref>). Subcellular localization of AQP8 in hepatocytes is also regulated by PKA and PI3K signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gradilone et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">2003</xref>). In mouse neutrophils, exposure to a chemotactic gradient caused translocation of AQP9 to the leading edge of the cell that is mediated by PKC-dependent phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Karlsson et al., 2011</xref>). Further work is needed to elucidate the mechanism of Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 protein distribution in ECs and which ion transporters are expressed in ECs to regulate the ion movement and cell migration.</p>
<p>In this study, we have assumed that the function of Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 is a result of water permeation based on previous studies demonstrating water molecules flowing through mammalian AQP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Preston et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Zeidel et al., 1992</xref>) and AQP8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Ma et al., 1997</xref>) as well as through their zebrafish orthologs Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Tingaud-Sequeira et al., 2010</xref>). However, AQP1 and AQP8 are not water-specific channels. AQP1 can conduct unpolar gases carbon dioxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Nakhoul et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Prasad et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Wang et al., 2007</xref>) and nitric oxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Herrera et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Herrera and Garvin, 2007</xref>), and in zebrafish, Aqp1a.1 also mediates the transfer for small gaseous molecules such as carbon dioxide and ammonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Talbot et al., 2015</xref>). AQP8 is permeable to ammonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Jahn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Liu et al., 2006</xref>) and is present in the inner mitochondrial membrane of different cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Calamita et al., 2005</xref>), where it is suggested to mediate ammonia transport rather than water fluxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Soria et al., 2010</xref>). Among the three Aqp8 paralogs in teleost, Aqp8a.1 and Aqp8a.2 are also permeable to urea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Tingaud-Sequeira et al., 2010</xref>) and Aqp8b was shown to act mainly as a mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> channel (peroxiporin) in activated marine and freshwater teleost spermatozoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chauvigné et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">2015</xref>). Nevertheless, because water movement flows up an osmotic gradient, increased entry of ions into the cell through Aquaporins will also trigger water inflow.</p>
<p>In summary, our study highlights the role of water influx and hydrostatic pressure as another force-generating mechanism utilized by cells to build tissues during animal development. We demonstrate that endothelial tip cells employ both actin polymerization and hydrostatic pressure for robust sprouting angiogenesis. As morphogenetic events are governed by a coordination of cell shape changes, cell migration and rearrangements, we envision that the shaping and formation of other tissues will also depend on Aquaporin function and changes in hydrostatic pressure.</p>

After fixation embryos were washed three times in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST), dehydrated stepwise in 5-min washes in a series of increasing methanol concentrations (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) in PBS and then stored in 100% methanol at -20<sup>0</sup>C before use them for hybridization. The methanol-stored embryos were rehydrated stepwise in 5-min washes in series of decreasing methanol concentrations (75%, 50%, 25%) in PBS followed by three times 5-min washes in PBST, and permeabilized 20 min with 10 µg/mL proteinase K (ThermoFisher Scientific). Hybridization was carried out in buffer [50% formamide, 5x SSC, 50 g/mL heparin, 500 g/mL tRNA (Roche) and 0.1% Tween-20] containing 5% dextran sulfate (MW=500 kDa) at 69<sup>0</sup>C overnight. After stringency wash, the specimens were blocked with 2% blocking reagent (Roche) in maleic acid buffer [100 mM maleic acid, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.1% Tween-20, pH 7.5] and incubated overnight with anti-digoxigenin antibody, conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (dilution 1:5000, Roche) at 4<sup>0</sup>C. For detection of alkaline phosphatase, specimens were incubated in staining buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM NaCl, 25 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2% Polyvinyl alcohol and 0.1% Tween-20, pH 9.5] containing 375 µg/mL nitro-blue tetrazolium chloride (Roche) and 175 µg/mL 5-bromo-4-chloro-3’-indolyl-phosphate (Roche). Embryos were cleared in 70% glycerol overnight and imaged using Leica M205FA microscope. <bold>RNA probe synthesis.</bold> The cDNA-containing vectors were linearized with appropriate restriction enzymes (detailed maps of vectors will be provided upon request) and used as a template for RNA probe synthesis. Sense and antisense RNA probes were synthesized using MEGAscript SP6 or T7 kits (Invitrogen) and digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled rNTPs (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and purified using RNA Clean and Concentrator kit (Zymo Research). The following sense and antisense DIG-labeled riboprobes were generated: (i) <italic>aqp1a.1</italic>, 1.1 kb long probe comprised 121 nt of 5’UTR, 783 nt of the open reading frame (ORF) and 207 nt of 3’UTR; (ii) <italic>aqp8a.1</italic>, 0.8 kb long probe comprised 17 nt of 5’UTR, 783 nt of ORF and 30 nt of 3’UTR. Sense probes showed no specific or unspecific staining (data not shown).</p>

<title>Analysis of mRNA expression in tip and stalk cells</title>
<p>Embryos were mounted on slide and imaged using Olympus FV3000 confocal microscope and Olympus UPlanXApo 60x/NA 1.42 oil immersion objective. Maximum intensity projection of z-stacks was used to determine the level of cellular fluorescence in ImageJ. The tip and stalk cells were selected using freehand selection tool, “mean grey value”, “area” and “integrated density” in each ROI were measured first for channel 1 (aqp1a.1). A region next to cell that has no fluorescence was selected as background and measured. The step was repeated for channel 2 (aqp8a.1) on the same ROIs. Two parameters were calculated for each channel, (i) the corrected total cell fluorescence, CTCF=Integrated Density – (Area of selected cell x Mean fluorescence of background) and (ii) ratio, R=CTCF of tip cell/CTCF of stalk cell. We consider that if R &lt;0.9, expression is lower in tip cell, if R=0.9-1.1, expression is equal in tip and stalk cells, if R&gt;1.1, expression is higher in tip cell.</p>

<title>Single-cell RNA sequencing</title>
<p>ECs were isolated from <italic>Tg(kdrl:EGFP)<sup>s843</sup></italic> transgenic embryos. Cell sorting was carried out with FACSAriaII Cell Sorter (BD Bioscience). Single-cell suspension was loaded into the 10X Chromium system and cDNA libraries were constructed using Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3′ GEM, Library and Gel Bead Kit v2 (10X Genomics) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Library was sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 1500 Sequencer (Illumina, USA). Cell Ranger v2.1 was used to de-multiplex raw base call (BCL) files generated by Illumina sequencers into FASTQ files, perform the alignment, barcode counting, and UMI counting. Sequencing reads were mapped to the zebrafish genome assembly (GRCz11, Ensembl release 92). Further analyses were performed using Seurat package49 (version 4.3.0) in R software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.r-project.org">https://www.r-project.org</ext-link>). The expression matrices were first filtered by keeping genes that are expressed in a minimum of 3 cells and cells that expressed a minimum of 200 genes for downstream analysis. The data were then normalized using NormalizeData function which normalizes the gene expression for each cell by the total expression counts. To correct for batch effect between the data from the two-time points, the rpca method in the Seurat package was applied to integrate the data. The top 2000 variable genes identified using the vst method in FindVariableFeatures function were used for principal component analysis in RunPCA function, and the first 30 principal components were used for visualization analysis with Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) method, and in FindNeighbors function analysis. The cell clustering resolution was set at 0.5 in FindClusters function.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper details a study of endothelial cell vessel formation during zebrafish development. The results focus on the role of aquaporins, which mediate the flow of water across the cell membrane, leading to cell movement. The authors show that actin and water flow together drive endothelial cell migration and vessel formation. If any of these two elements are perturbed, there are observed defects in vessels. Overall, the paper significantly improves our understanding of cell migration during morphogenesis in organisms.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The data are extensive and are of high quality. There is a good amount of quantification with convincing statistical significance. The overall conclusion is justified given the evidence.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are two weaknesses, which if addressed, would improve the paper.</p>
<p>(1) The paper focuses on aquaporins, which while mediates water flow, cannot drive directional water flow. If the osmotic engine model is correct, then ion channels such as NHE1 are the driving force for water flow. Indeed this water is shown in previous studies. Moreover, NHE1 can drive water intake because the export of H+ leads to increased HCO3 due to the reaction between CO2+H2O, which increases the cytoplasmic osmolarity (see Li, Zhou and Sun, Frontiers in Cell Dev. Bio. 2021). If NHE cannot be easily perturbed in zebrafish, it might be of interest to perturb Cl channels such as SWELL1, which was recently shown to work together with NHE (see Zhang, et al, Nat. Comm. 2022).</p>
<p>(2) In some places the discussion seems a little confusing where the text goes from hydrostatic pressure to osmotic gradient. It might improve the paper if some background is given. For example, mention water flow follows osmotic gradients, which will build up hydrostatic pressure. The osmotic gradients across the membrane are generated by active ion exchangers. This point is often confused in literature and somewhere in the intro, this could be made clearer.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Directional migration is an integral aspect of sprouting angiogenesis and requires a cell to change its shape and sense a chemotactic or growth factor stimulus. Kondrychyn I. et al. provide data that indicate a requirement for zebrafish aquaporins 1 and 8, in cellular water inflow and sprouting angiogenesis. Zebrafish mutants lacking aqp1a.1 and aqp8a.1 have significantly lower tip cell volume and migration velocity, which delays vascular development. Inhibition of actin formation and filopodia dynamics further aggravates this phenotype. The link between water inflow, hydrostatic pressure, and actin dynamics driving endothelial cell sprouting and migration during angiogenesis is highly novel.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The zebrafish genetics, microscopy imaging, and measurements performed are of very high quality. The study data and interpretations are very well-presented in this manuscript.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Some of the findings and interpretations could be strengthened by additional measurements and further discussion. Also, a better comparison and integration of the authors' findings, with other previously published findings in mice and zebrafish would strengthen the paper.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Kondrychyn and colleagues describe the contribution of two Aquaporins Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 towards angiogenic sprouting in the zebrafish embryo. By whole-mount in situ hybridization, RNAscope, and scRNA-seq, they show that both genes are expressed in endothelial cells in partly overlapping spatiotemporal patterns. Pharmacological inhibition experiments indicate a requirement for VEGR2 signaling (but not Notch) in transcriptional activation.</p>
<p>To assess the role of both genes during vascular development the authors generate genetic mutations. While homozygous single mutants appear less affected, aqp1a.1;aqp8a.1 double mutants exhibit severe defects in EC sprouting and ISV formation.</p>
<p>At the cellular level, the aquaporin mutants display a reduction of filopodia in number and length. Furthermore, a reduction in cell volume is observed indicating a defect in water uptake.</p>
<p>The authors conclude, that polarized water uptake mediated by aquaporins is required for the initiation of endothelial sprouting and (tip) cell migration during ISV formation. They further propose that water influx increases hydrostatic pressure within the cells which may facilitate actin polymerization and formation membrane protrusions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors provide a detailed analysis of Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 during blood vessel formation in vivo, using zebrafish intersomitic vessels as a model. State-of-the-art imaging demonstrates an essential role in aquaporins in different aspects of endothelial cell activation and migration during angiogenesis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>With respect to the connection between Aqp1/8 and actin polymerization/filopodia formation, the evidence appears preliminary and the authors' interpretation is guided by evidence from other experimental systems.</p>
