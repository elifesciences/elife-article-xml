<title>Abstract</title><p>Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic RNA virus that causes Japanese encephalitis (JE) and poses a major threat to public health in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific. Current strategies rely on prophylactic methods to prevent disease, as no effective antiviral therapy exists. Here, we report that SIRT2, an NAD+-dependent deacetylase enzyme, mediates antiviral activity against JEV infection in mice. Interestingly, our study reveals that SIRT2 is downregulated in JEV infection, SIRT2 genetic deficiency/small molecule inhibition increases viral yield in neuronal cells and mice brains thereby reducing the survival rate in the infected mice, whereas SIRT2 gene therapy to the JEV-infected mice by Adeno-associated virus vector reduced the JEV load in mice brains and improved the survival rate. SIRT2 deficiency activates inflammatory cytokines and chemokines response in the JEV-infected mice brains through activating NF-κB transcription factor. Mechanistically, SIRT2 deacetylates NF-κB to reduce the transcriptional factor activity of NF-κB that down-regulates the Beclin-1-mediated autophagy, which is needed for the JEV replication. Overall, the present findings establish SIRT2 as a potential regulator of JEV infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>JE is a vector-borne zoonotic viral disease caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. JEV exhibits close resemblance to other members of the Flaviviridae family, including dengue virus, Zika virus, yellow fever virus, and West Nile virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Estimates suggest that JE is endemic in about twenty-four countries in the Southeast Asia, South Asia, and Western Pacific geographic regions. Almost 68 thousand clinical cases occur every year, posing a risk to three billion people<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. In the endemic areas, children aged 2 to 15 years are more susceptible to JEV, and exhibit adverse outcomes, with a 30% fatality rate and permanent neurologic or psychiatric sequelae of 30-50% in encephalitis patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Currently, vaccine administration in the endemic area is the only intervention against JEV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. The absence of clinically available therapeutics raises serious health threats and warrants the identification of master regulators of host proteins in the virus pathogenesis to determine an antiviral against JEV. Because of the high rate of mutations in RNA viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, it would be appropriate to target host proteins and the evolutionarily conserved host mechanisms for therapeutic intervention.</p>
<p>In this line, we recently identified the inhibition of NAD+-dependent host enzyme, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP1) inhibition, as a potential antiviral strategy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Possibly other NAD+-dependent host enzymes may also play a role in the JEV infection and the identification of such enzymes may be useful in designing a host protein-directed antiviral against JEV infection. In this context, sirtuins (SIRTs) are the well-explored NAD+- dependent enzymes and sirtuins’ role in RNA virus-infected animals/humans is largely unknown. Sirtuins are class III histone deacetylases that depend on NAD<sup>+</sup> as a cofactor for their enzymatic activity. Mammals have seven sirtuins (SIRT1-SIRT7), ubiquitously expressed with distinct sub-cellular localisation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. SIRTs govern several cellular processes through multiple targets and have critical implications in health and diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Of them, the major cytosolic protein SIRT2 is known to regulate cell division, inflammation, autophagy, mitophagy, oxidative stress, and senescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. In this context, the role, underlining molecular mechanism and signalling pathways of cytosolic sirtuin, SIRT2, in RNA viruses’ multiplication and viral pathogenesis in animal models remains largely unknown. Understanding the role of SIRT2 in distinct viral pathology, especially encephalitis-causing RNA viruses in mice models, and exploring molecular mechanisms in the evolutionarily conserved signalling axis, holds direct therapeutic relevance for preclinical studies. Further, this knowledge can be extended to develop therapeutics against several other viruses that utilise the same host proteins and similar mechanisms for their pathogenesis.</p>
<p>Several RNA viruses including the hepatitis C virus (HCV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, influenza A virus (IAV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, JEV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>, Dengue virus (DENV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, Zika virus (ZIKV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, Chikungunya virus (CHIKV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, Human rhinovirus (HRV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, Enterovirus 71 (EV-A71)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, poliovirus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, Coxsackievirus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, Newcastle disease virus (NDV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> etc., exploit evolutionarily conserved cellular autophagy for viral replication by different molecular mechanisms. In this context, the functional role of SIRT2 in RNA viruses-induced autophagy has not yet been explored. Of note, different RNA viruses target the host protein nuclear factor-κB (NF- κB), to modulate the inflammatory cytokine and chemokine transcription (reviewed in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>). The role of phosphorylation of IkB in the NF-κB-IkB axis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> has been well-studied in viral infections. In contrast, the role of post-translational modifications, particularly acetylation of NF-κB, on its transcriptional factor activity-mediated regulation of RNA virus-induced autophagy remains unexplored.</p>
<p>In our study, we uncover a key role for SIRT2 in regulating JEV replication and improving the survival in JEV-infected mice. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> model systems demonstrate that this effect is SIRT2-mediated deacetylation of NF-κB thereby regulating virus-induced autophagy and inflammatory cytokine. Further, we report that SIRT2 mediated NF-κB regulation negatively affects the virus-induced autophagy, which is needed for virus replication. Thereby SIRT2 exhibits an antiviral role in neuronal cells and mice infected with JEV.</p>

<title>The JEV infection down-regulates SIRT2 in the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models</title>
<p>Our recent study determined the role of NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent enzyme PARP1 in JEV replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. However, the role of other NAD+-dependent enzymes remains unexplored. We were interested in exploring the role of NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacetylase enzymes, Sirtuins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, in JEV replication. Because JEV replicates in the cytoplasm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, we wanted to understand the importance of SIRT2, a cytoplasmic sirtuin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, in the regulation of JEV replication. To begin with, we aimed to identify the molecular mechanisms occurring at the early viral replication time point that can be targeted as an antiviral against JEV infection. To determine the same, we infected the neuro2a cells with one multiplicity of infection (MOI) of JEV and observed the viral protein levels and infective virus yield over time. We found that the maximum rate of JEV multiplication occurs between 24-36 hours post-infection (hpi) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>-<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>) and therefore considered 30 hpi as an early accelerating phase of viral replication (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). At this time point, SIRT2 was significantly down-regulated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Further, to investigate the role of SIRT2 in an <italic>in vivo</italic> system, we studied the brains of JEV-infected mice. Since JEV infection is spread through mosquito bites and causes encephalitis in young children<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, we infected 10 days old mice pups with 10<sup>5</sup> plaque-forming units (PFU) of JEV by foot-pad route to mimic natural infection. The infected mice were monitored for the display of clinical signs, paralysis, and survival every 24 hours post-infection. The standard clinical signs observed include fluffy coat, ruffled fur, reluctance to move, hunchback posture, circling and curling behaviour, ataxia, and tremors on the 6<sup>th</sup> day post-infection (dpi). By the 11th dpi, we observed that about 90 per cent of animals displayed clinical signs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). The mice infected with JEV started showing paralysis at the 8<sup>th</sup> dpi, which peaked by the 13<sup>th</sup> day (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). We observed mortality in JEV-infected mice 10<sup>th</sup> dpi onwards (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). The serum viral load was detectable 3<sup>rd</sup> dpi onwards and peaked on the 6<sup>th</sup> dpi, coinciding with the onset of clinical signs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1G</xref>). Interestingly, serum viral load started declining when the virus started multiplying in the mice’s brain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1H</xref>). The maximum rate of viral replication in the brain, primary target site of JEV, occurred between 7 and 9<sup>th</sup> dpi (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). Thus, 8<sup>th</sup> dpi was noted to be an early accelerating phase of viral replication in the brain of mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). Next, we measured the SIRT2 levels on 8<sup>th</sup> dpi. In line with our <italic>in vitro</italic> findings, SIRT2 levels were significantly downregulated at 8<sup>th</sup> dpi (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). Thus, significant SIRT2 downregulation coincides with the early accelerating phase of viral replication in both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> study systems.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>SIRT2 deficiency enhances JEV replication in both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models</title>
<p>Since SIRT2 is downregulated in JEV infection, we infected SIRT2-depleted neuro2a cells with 1 MOI JEV to study the role of SIRT2 in viral multiplication. We found that viral titre was significantly high in SIRT2 knockdown conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). In contrast, SIRT2 overexpression remarkably reduced viral titre in neuro2a cells (Figure S1A, S1B), thus suggesting a role for SIRT2 in JEV multiplication. To validate our findings in the <italic>in vivo</italic> model system, we infected SIRT2 knock-out (KO) mice with JEV through the footpad route (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). We observed that the viral PFU levels in serum reached a maximum in SIRT2-KO mice earlier than their WT counterparts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). Similarly, the viral load in the JEV-infected SIRT2-KO mice brain was much higher than in WT (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Likewise, clinical signs and paralysis appeared earlier in SIRT2-KO mice than WT mice. The SIRT2-KO group also showed an increased percentage of animals exhibiting clinical signs and paralysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2H</xref>). Further, all the SIRT2-KO mice infected with JEV died by the 14<sup>th</sup> dpi, with significantly reduced survival of JEV-infected SIRT2-KO mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). To ensure that the observed pathological signs are due to JEV infection in the brain rather than serum viral load, we employed the intracerebral route of JEV infection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>). In corroboration with our findings from the foot-pad route of viral inoculation, the intracerebral route of viral infection also rendered SIRT2-KO mice more susceptible to JEV pathogenesis as indicated by increased viral titre, earlier onset of clinical sign, paralysis, and reduced survival rate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2N</xref>). Thus, SIRT2 deficiency in the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models enhances JE virus replication thereby reducing the survival of JEV-infected mice, and SIRT2 overexpression helps curtail JEV titre <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

<title>Pharmacological inhibition of SIRT2 by AGK2 enhances JEV replication</title>
<p>Previous studies have shown that SIRT1-SIRT7 knockdown enhances a few RNA and DNA virus replication in cell culture models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>.

Conversely, our study suggests that SIRT2 depletion enhances viral replication in mouse models. We next asked if SIRT2 inhibition, using the small molecule inhibitor AGK2, can enhance JEV replication. We treated neuro2a cells with AGK2 and observed significantly increased viral titers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Further, we tested the effect of AGK2 in JEV infected mice. We found that JEV-infected mice, when treated with AGK2, showed early incidence and an increase in the percentage of clinical signs and paralysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). AGK2 treatment also reduced the survival rate in JEV-infected mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). We also observed an early appearance and increased serum viral load upon AGK2 treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Similarly, the viral load in mice brain was elevated upon AGK 2 treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3G</xref>). Consistently, in mice infected via the intracerebral route, AGK2 treatment resulted in an early onset of clinical signs and paralysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3I</xref>) and a reduction in survival rate compared to their mock infected counterparts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>).

<title>SIRT2 gene therapy protects against JEV infection in mice</title>
<p>Next, we were interested in exploring the therapeutic efficacy of SIRT2 gene therapy against JEV infection in mice. For this, we overexpressed SIRT2 in mock or JEV-infected mice brains using the Adeno-associated virus (AAV) system (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>).

<title>SIRT2 deficiency regulates NF-κB transcriptional factor activity to enhance the inflammatory response upon JEV infection in mice brains</title>
<p>To understand the pathways deregulated upon JEV infection, we performed global mRNA-sequencing of mock and virus-infected WT mice brains. Our global transcriptome analysis demonstrated that JEV infection led to the deregulation of several genes including those involved in immune response (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>; Figure S2A). We also analyzed the transcription factors associated with the differentially expressed genes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>; Figure S2B). According to our KEGG pathway analysis, cytokine and its receptor interaction was the most significantly upregulated pathway (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). The transcription factor corresponding to the most significantly upregulated genes was NF-κB (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). We also identified downregulated pathways and the associated transcription factors (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>-<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5F</xref>). Further, we analyzed transcriptomic data to determine the expression levels of approximately 400 genes regulated by NF-κB transcription factor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Our analysis revealed that several NF-κB target cytokines and chemokines were transcriptionally upregulated in JEV-infected mice brains (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref><bold>-</bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5H</xref>; Figure S3A, S3B). Further, a comparison of transcriptomic data between JEV-infected WT and SIRT2-KO mice brains revealed a significant increase in several NF-κB target inflammatory cytokines and chemokine genes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref><bold>-</bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5J</xref>; Figure S4A, S4B). Next, we validated the global transcriptomics results using quantitative PCR. We observed increased transcript levels of NF-κB target inflammatory cytokines and chemokine genes in JEV-infected mice brains. These transcripts were further increased in the JEV-infected SIRT2-KO mice brains (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5K</xref><bold>-</bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5N</xref>; Figure S5A-S5C). During JEV infection, neuronal damage occurs (i) directly by virus replication in neurons and (ii) directly by JEV-induced increased cytokines in the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Therefore, the increased susceptibility of SIRT2-KO mice to JEV infection could be attributed to both cytokine release due to hyperactivation of NF-κB and increased replication of the JEV in the brain.</p>

<title>SIRT2 mediated acetylation of NF-κB regulates JEV replication through NF-κB-Beclin1 axis of autophagy</title>
<p>Since our findings indicate that SIRT2 regulates JEV replication in neuro2a cells and mice brains (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref><bold>-</bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>; Figure S1A-S1B; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K</xref>; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>) with an increase in NF-κB target gene expression in JEV-infected SIRT2-KO mice brain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref><bold>-</bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5N</xref>; Figure S5A-S5C), we checked if SIRT2 directly interacts with the NF-κB and regulate its activity upon JEV infection. To investigate SIRT2-NF-κB protein-protein interaction, we immunoprecipitated NF-κB from mock or JEV-infected neuro2a cells. We identified SIRT2 interacts with NF-κB, and the interaction is reduced upon JEV infection (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Further, JEV infection increased acetylation levels of NF-κB (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Next, we performed a reporter assay to evaluate the transcriptional activity of NF-κB. In line with transcriptome analysis, we found that JEV infection increased NF-κB transcriptional activity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Interestingly, SIRT2 deficiency enhanced JEV-infection mediated NF-κB transcriptional activity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>) and increased the viral load in neuro2a cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Conversely, SIRT2 overexpression significantly reduced the JEV-infection-induced increase in NF-κB transcriptional activity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). It also reduced the viral load in neuro2a cells (Figure S1A, S1B). Taken together, these findings reveal that JEV infection negatively regulates SIRT2 levels, resulting in a concomitant increase in acetylated NF-κB mediated virus replication, and SIRT2 overexpression reverts this phenotype. Next, we attempted to identify the cellular signaling pathways related to NF-κB target genes that may be involved in JEV replication. We compared the transcriptome profiles of JEV-infected WT and SIRT2-KO mice brains and carried out gene network analysis. We observed that NF-κB mediated inflammation and autophagy were among the key axes that were deregulated in JEV-infected SIRT2-KO brains compared to JEV-infected WT mice brains (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). Notably, NF-κB is established to induce autophagy by transcriptional upregulation of beclin-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Our previous study has identified a crucial role for autophagy in JEV replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Therefore, we explored the possibility of the SIRT2-NF-κB-beclin-1 axis of autophagy in JEV infection. We observed that JEV infection significantly upregulated the transcript levels of beclin-1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>), in concordance with the increased NF-κB transcriptional activity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Additionally, SIRT2-KD also enhanced the transcript levels of beclin-1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>) and NF-κB transcriptional activity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Conversely, SIRT2-OE significantly reduced the transcript levels of beclin-1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>) and NF-κB transcriptional activity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>) and caused a reduction of viral load in neuro2a cells (Figure S1A-S1B). Further, we found that neuro2a cells infected with JEV showed increased autophagy as indicated by autophagy markers such as increased beclin-1, increased LC3II and reduced p62 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I</xref>; Figure S6A). In line with our <italic>in vitro</italic> findings, JEV-infected mice brains also showed increased autophagy through increased beclin-1, LC3II, and reduced p62 concomitant with reduced SIRT2 levels (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6J</xref>; Figure S6B). Further, we found that SIRT2 knockdown as well as chemical inhibition using AGK2 increased beclin-1 and autophagy in JEV-infected neuro2a cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6K</xref>; Figure S6C; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6L</xref>; Figure S6D) and mice brains (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3G</xref>). Moreover, JEV-infected SIRT2-KO mice showed increased beclin-1 and autophagy compared to their WT counterparts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6M</xref>; Figure S6E). In contrast, SIRT2 overexpression significantly reduced autophagy and inhibited viral multiplication in neuro2a cells (Figure S1A, S1B; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6N</xref>; Figure S6F). Moreover, we observed that AAV mediated SIRT2 gene therapy down-regulated the JEV-induced autophagy, which is critical for JEV replication, thereby exhibiting an antiviral role in the JEV-infected mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). These results indicate that SIRT2 regulates JEV replication through the NF-κB-beclin-1-autophagy axis.</p>

<title>SIRT2 deficiency promotes JEV replication in mice through NF-κB activity</title>
<p>Previous studies indicate that NF-κB activity is negatively regulated by NF-κB inhibitor, IκB, and this negative regulation is released by phosphorylation of IκB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Thus, we treated the JEV-infected neuro2a cells with Bay-11, an inhibitor of IκBα phosphorylation, and measured NF-κB activity using a luciferase activity-based reporter assay. We observed a significant reduction in JEV-induced NF-κB activity (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>) and a reduction in the viral load in neuro2a cells upon Bay-11 treatment (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>), indicating that IκBα phosphorylation-mediated activation of NF-κB activity is required for JEV replication. Moreover, Bay-11 further increased NF-κB activity and JEV load in SIRT2 depleted neuro2a cells as compared to controls (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7D</xref>).

<p>Subsequently, to determine whether SIRT2 regulates JEV replication in mice brains through NF-κB, JEV-infected (through foot pad route of infection) WT and SIRT2-KO mice were treated with BAY-11. Here, we observed that BAY-11 treatment in JEV-infected WT mice reduced the viral load in both serum and brain, thereby reducing the clinical outcomes including paralysis, and enhancing survival compared to vehicle-treated JEV-infected WT mice (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>-<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8E</xref>). Furthermore, to study the therapeutic potential of BAY-11, we administered BAY-11 to the JEV-infected mice after the onset of JEV clinical signs. Even when administered after the onset of JEV clinical signs in mice, BAY-11 significantly reduced paralysis (Figure S7A), improved the survival percentage of mice infected with JEV (Figure S7B), and reduced the JEV load in the mice brains (Figure S7C). These results indicate that IκBα phosphorylation mediated activation of NF-κB is required for JEV replication in mice brains. Besides this, BAY-11 treatment in JEV-infected SIRT2-KO mice rescues the exacerbated clinical signs, paralysis, and decline in survival rates observed in the JEV-infected SIRT2-KO mice (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>-<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8C</xref>). Additionally, BAY-11 treatment reduced the increased viral load observed in JEV-infected SIRT2-KO mice serum and brain (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref><bold>, 8E</bold>). Collectively, our results suggest that SIRT2 deficiency in mice exacerbates JEV induced clinical signs, paralysis, and causes decline in survival rates through the activation of the NF-κB transcription factor.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>While vaccines play an important role in preventing virus infection, antivirals are needed to complement the limitations of vaccines. Identifying host-directed antivirals is important as they reduce the resistance acquired by virus mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. This present study describes SIRT2 as a host-directed antiviral factor against JEV, a public health threat due to the lack of specific complement antivirals in clinical practice despite the availability of vaccines. Notably, the existing studies have shown that SIRT2 knockdown increases the replication of a few DNA and RNA viruses in cell culture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. The present study elucidates that SIRT2 genetic deficiency or SIRT2 chemical inhibitors enhance JEV replication in cell culture and mouse models, while SIRT2 overexpression displays antiviral characteristics. Moreover, the present study established that SIRT2 acts as a host-directed antiviral by inhibiting JEV-induced autophagy by regulating the NF-κB-Beclin-1-autophagy axis, thereby reducing virus replication.</p>
<p>SIRT2 is established to transcriptionally regulate several cellular signalling pathways through deacetylating transcriptional factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. In the case of DNA viruses that replicate in the nucleus, SIRT2 regulates transcriptional factors p53<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>, and deacetylates G3BP, thereby regulating cGAS-STING-IRF3 transcriptional activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Besides this, SIRT2 was reported to transcriptionally regulate autophagy by regulating transcriptional factors such as FoxO1 and TFEB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. The present study reveals that NF-κB deacetylation through SIRT2-NF-κB interaction inhibits virus-induced autophagy. Mechanistically, SIRT2-mediated deacetylation of NF-κB inhibits the transcriptional activity of the NF-κB, thereby inhibiting the transcription of Beclin-1 and subsequent downstream autophagy, which is crucial for virus replication. The NF-κB transcriptional activity regulates approximately 400 genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. On the other hand, Beclin-1 is reported to maintain the persistent activity of NF-κB in human T cell leukaemia virus type 1 transformed T lymphocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. Previous studies have reported that Beclin-1 regulates flavivirus-induced autophagy by viral non-structural protein 1 (NS1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup> and mosquito saliva-specific protein allergen-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>, indicating that Beclin-1 is needed for autophagy induction to favour flavivirus replication. Along these lines, our previous study has found that JEV infection enhances virus replication by inducing autophagy through the transcriptional factor PTEN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Our findings unveil that JEV infection downregulates SIRT2, which causes increased acetylation of NF-κB, leading to the activation of the NF-κB pathway.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we observed that the activated NF-κB pathway by JEV infection induces autophagy through Beclin-1, thereby enhancing virus replication. Previous studies suggest both pro- and anti-inflammatory roles for SIRT2 in different pathologies. SIRT2 inhibition with AGK2 conferred protection against NF-kB and MAPK activation mediated inflammatory response in the liver of mice model of thioacetamide-induced acute liver failure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. Similarly, in other studies, including the lethal septic model and LPS-induced renal inflammation, SIRT2 inhibition attenuated inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. On the other hand, the anti-inflammatory role of SIRT2 is reported in traumatic brain injury and neuropathic pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>. However, our findings show that SIRT2 depletion or chemical inhibition exacerbates inflammatory response and prognosis in mice models of JEV infection whereas SIRT2 gene therapy confers protection to mice against JEV infection. Previous findings suggest that the severity of JEV infection is largely manifested by inflammatory cytokine and chemokine hyperactivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>. In the current study, we observed that the exacerbated clinical outcome in JEV-infected SIRT2-KO mice was mediated by NF-κB transcriptional activity-dependent hyperactivation of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.</p>
<p>Our findings establish that SIRT2 negatively regulates NF-κB transcriptional activity and exhibits antiviral activity by restricting virus replication and reducing disease severity. We believe that SIRT2 gene therapy could be taken forward to the next level of clinical studies, which may improve the treatment of JEV infection. Our findings stress the potential therapeutic implications for RNA viral infections that utilize the evolutionarily conserved mechanism of the autophagy axis for favouring virus replication and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines hyperactivation for pathogenesis.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study explores the role of SIRT2 in regulating Japanese encephalitis virus replication and disease progression in rodent models. The findings presented are novel as sirtuins are known for their roles in aging, metabolism, and cell survival, but have not been studied in the context of viral infections until recently. The evidence supporting the claims is <bold>solid</bold>, although additional experiments to further characterize the clinical outcomes and directly test the link between acetylated NF-kB and SIRT2 expression would have strengthened the study. The work will be of interest to biologists studying viruses, sirtuins, and inflammation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Desingu et al. show that JEV infection reduces SIRT2 expression. Upon JEV infection, 10-day-old SIRT2 KO mice showed increased viral titer, more severe clinical outcomes, and reduced survival. Conversely, SIRT2 overexpression reduced viral titer, clinical outcomes, and improved survival. Transcriptional profiling shows dysregulation of NF-KB and expression of inflammatory cytokines. Pharmacological NF-KB inhibition reduced viral titer. The authors conclude that SIRT2 is a regulator of JEV infection.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This paper is novel because sirtuins have been primarily studied for aging, metabolism, stem cells/regeneration. Their role in infection has not been explored until recently. Indeed, Barthez et al. showed that SIRT2 protects aged mice from SARS-CoV-2 infection (Barthez, Cell Reports 2025). Therefore, this is a timely and novel research topic. Mechanistically, the authors showed that SIRT2 suppresses the NF-KB pathway. Interestingly, SIRT2 has also been shown recently to suppress other major inflammatory pathways, such as cGAS-STING (Barthez, Cell Reports 2025) and the NLRP3 inflammasome (He, Cell Metabolism 2020; Luo, Cell Reports 2019). Together, these findings support the emerging concept that SIRT2 is a master regulator of inflammation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Figures 2 and 3. Although SIRT2 KO mice showed increased viral titer, more severe clinical outcomes, and reduced survival upon JEV infection, the difference is modest because even WT mice exhibited very severe disease at this viral dose. The authors should perform the experiment using a sub-lethal viral dose for WT mice, to allow the assessment of increased clinical outcomes and reduced survival in KO mice.</p>
<p>(2) Figure 5K-N, the authors examined the expression of inflammatory cytokines in WT and SIRT2 KO cells upon JEV infection, in line with the dysregulation of NF-kB. It has been shown recently that SIRT2 also regulates the cGAS-STING pathway (Barthez, Cell Reports 2025) and the NLRP3 inflammasome (He, Cell Metabolism 2020; Luo, Cell Reports 2019). Do you also observe increased IFNb, IL1b, and IL18 in SIRT2 KO cells upon JEV infection? This may indicate that SIRT2 regulates systemic inflammatory responses and represents a potent protection upon viral infection. This is particularly important because in Figure 7F, the authors showed that SIRT2 overexpression reduced viral load even when NF-KB is inhibited, suggesting that NF-KB is not the only mediator of SIRT2 to suppress viral infection.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Desingu et al., explores the role of SIRT2 in regulating Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV) replication and disease progression in rodent models. Using both an in vitro and an in vivo approach, the authors demonstrate that JEV infection leads to decreased SIRT2 expression, which they hypothesize is exploited by JEV for viral replication. To test this hypothesis, the authors utilize SIRT2 inhibition (via AGK2 or genetic knockout) and demonstrate that it leads to increased viral load and worsens clinical outcomes in JEV-infected mice. Conversely, SIRT2 overexpression via an AAV delivery system reduces viral replication and improves survival among infected mice. The study proposes a mechanism in which SIRT2 suppresses JEV-induced autophagy and inflammation by deacetylating NF-κB, thereby reducing Beclin-1 expression (an NF-κB-dependent gene) and autophagy, which the authors consider a pathway that JEV exploits for replication. Transcriptomic analysis further supports that SIRT2 deficiency leads to NF-κB-driven cytokine hyperactivation. Additionally, pharmacological inhibition of NF-κB using Bay 11 (an IKK inhibitor) results in reduced viral load and improved clinical pathology in WT and SIRT2 KO mice. Overall, the findings from Desingu et al. are generally supported by the data and suggest that targeting SIRT2 may serve as a promising therapeutic approach for JEV infection and potentially other RNA viruses that SIRT2 helps control. However, the paper does fall short in some areas. Please see below for our comments to help improve the paper.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we acknowledge reviewers' comments that SIRT2 regulates systemic inflammatory responses and provides potent protection against viral infection. Additionally, NF-κB is not the only mediator of SIRT2's suppression of viral infection; other possible molecular mechanisms are also involved in this process.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for the valuable recommendation. We are willing to measure NF-kB acetylation in AdSIRT2 JEV-infected cells compared to WT-infected cells, to verify that the acetylation of NF-kB is truly linked to SIRT2 expression levels as per the reviewers' suggestion.</p>
<p>We are willing to conduct an experiment using a sub-lethal viral dose in wild-type (WT) mice to assess increased clinical outcomes and reduced survival in knockout (KO) mice, as recommended.</p>
<p>We are accepting the reviewer's suggestion that AGK2 can also inhibit other Sirtuins. Thus, to test the contribution of other Sirtuins, the experiment could be repeated using wild-type and Sirt2 KO mice. We are willing to conduct the AGK2 experiment using JEV-infected wild-type and Sirt2 knockout mice.</p>
