<title>Abstract</title><p>Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is an effective but not curative treatment for advanced and recurrent prostate cancer (PC). We investigated the mechanisms controlling the response to androgen-deprivation by surgical castration in genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMM) of PC, using high frequency ultrasound imaging to rigorously measure tumor volume. Castration initially causes almost all tumors to shrink in volume, but many tumors subsequently recur within 5-10 weeks. Blockade of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling a few days in advance of castration surgery, using a TNFR2 ligand trap, prevents regression in a PTEN-deficient GEMM. Following tumor regression, a basal stem cell-like population within the tumor increases along with TNF protein levels. Tumor cell lines in culture recapitulate these <italic>in vivo</italic> observations, suggesting that basal stem cells are the source of TNF. When TNF signaling blockade is administered immediately prior to castration, tumors regress but recurrence is prevented. This implies that a late wave of TNF secretion within the tumor – which coincides with the expression of NFκB regulated genes – drives recurrence. The inhibition of signaling downstream of an NFκB-regulated protein – chemokine C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2) – prevents post-castration tumor recurrence, phenocopying post-castration (late) TNF signaling blockade. CCL2 was originally identified as a macrophage chemoattractant and indeed at late times after castration gene sets related to chemotaxis and migration are up-regulated. Importantly, enhanced CCL2 signaling during the tumor recurrence phase coincides with an increase in pro-tumorigenic macrophages and a decrease in CD8 T cells, suggesting that recurrence is driven at least in part by tumor immunosuppression. In summary, we demonstrate that a therapy-induced switch in TNF signaling – a consequence of the increased stem cell-like character of the residual tumor cells surviving ADT – induces an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and concomitant tumor recurrence.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) via surgical castration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) and currently via medical therapy employing gonadotropin releasing hormone analogues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>), has been an effective treatment for advanced primary and recurrent prostate cancer (PC) for many decades. Within the past several years, the addition of either the microtubule toxin docetaxel or the androgen biosynthesis inhibitor abiraterone to ADT has improved the medical therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). However, these ADT-combination therapies have only marginally extended overall survival and the fundamental issue for patients with advanced primary and recurrent PC remains the same: ADT (or an ADT-combination) rarely cures PC and resistant tumors are eventually lethal. Thus, there is a need to develop additional therapies for PC, preferably by identifying molecular targets that are mechanistically linked to the development of ADT resistance. ADT is effective because the growth of almost every prostate cancer is dependent on a program of gene expression mediated by the androgen receptor and a set of critical co-regulators. The androgen receptor (AR) gene is activated by genetic alteration in only a small fraction of primary PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Instead, one or two alterations of a small group of other genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>) is sufficient to re-program the AR cistrome to transcribe a set of genes that promote immortalization and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Additional alterations in a second class of genes driving proliferation and growth – such as the PTEN tumor suppressor or the c-MYC oncogene – completes the process of transformation to prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>).</p>
<p>Tissue reconstitution studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>) have shown that androgen blockade can act indirectly via soluble factors derived from the tumor micro-environment (TME). Consistent with this paradigm, in which proteins are secreted into the TME and act on the cell of origin (autocrine) or on other cells within the TME (paracrine), we have previously investigated the response of prostate cancers to androgen deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>), using cell culture and murine models of human prostate cancer. A recurrent theme of this research has been the role of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) as a pleotropic signaling mediator within the PC TME. TNF binds and trimerizes its cognate receptor and signals via a complex network of intercellular protein-protein interactions to promote either an anti-tumor or pro-tumor fate, depending on the cellular context. In this report, we examine the role of TNF and TNF-regulated genes in the response to castration in a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of PC driven by deletion of the PTEN gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Castration induces regression and subsequent recurrence in this GEMM, resembling the onset of castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Both responses are dependent on TNF signaling and can be separately blocked by differentially timing the administration of a TNF ligand trap molecule. At late times post-castration, when the tumor is beginning to recur in a castration resistant form, TNF induces NFκB-mediated gene expression. Moreover, we demonstrate that the NFκB-induced gene CCL2 – which encodes a protein that is chemotactic for immune suppressive cells such as tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) – is necessary for recurrence in the PTEN-loss model as well as in a second GEMM of PC that is driven by MYC over-expression. Thus, a TNF signaling switch induces immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment to promote castration-resistant tumor recurrence.</p>

<title>Animals and tumor imaging</title>
<p>All animal studies were approved by the Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center (RPCCC) institutional animal care and use committee. Male Pb-Cre4; PTEN<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>) and Hi-MYC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) were breed in the RPCCC laboratory animal shared resource. Mice were housed in environmentally-controlled conditions on a 12-hour light/dark cycle with water and food. For both genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) we studied, male pups were genotyped and tumor volumes were monitored by three-dimensional high frequency ultrasound (HFUS) imaging, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). In brief, mice were anesthetized, the abdomen was depilated and B-mode image scans were acquired using a Vevo 2100 micro-ultrasound imaging system (Vevo LAZR; VisualSonics Inc., Toronto). Images were imported into Amira software (Visualization Sciences Group, Burlington, MA) for 3D tumor reconstruction and volume determination. Tumors developed in ∼100% of male animals for both GEMMs. The histology, lobular location and usual age to reach 300-500 mm<sup>3</sup> volume are provided for the two models in Supplementary Table S1. Mice with tumor volumes of 300-500 mm<sup>3</sup> were randomly enrolled into experimental groups, and surgically castrated (or sham-operated) via scrotal incision, under isoflurane anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). To systematically define the response of the GEMMs to castration, we applied a murine approximation of the human clinical RECIST (response evaluation criteria in solid tumors) criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Thus, we define regression as a volume decline of 16% or more post-castration and recurrence (of tumors that had met the regression standard) as at least two volume increases of 11% from the volume nadir. Etanercept (sTNFR2-Fc; Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA) was injected intra-peritoneally (4mg/kg) twice per week for up to 5 weeks following castration, based on our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). The CCR2 antagonist (CCR2a) BMS-741672 (Torcis Bioscience, Bristol, UK) was injected intraperitoneally (2 mg/kg) three times per week as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>), beginning one day prior to castration.</p>

<title>Tumor tissue collection and processing</title>
<p>After mice were sacrificed, individual prostate tumors were identified grossly, excised and cut in half. Typically, a portion was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in a liquid nitrogen freezer while a second portion was fixed in paraformaldehyde at room temperature overnight, washed in PBS, stored at 4°C and embedded in paraffin as required for the preparation of tissue sections. Mouse prostate tumor and normal tissues were dissociated for single cell RNA sequencing using the Tumor Dissociation kits from Miltenyi Biotec (cat. no. 130-096-730). Briefly, tissue was excised, washed with chilled 1x PBS, placed in a petri dish on ice, cut into 2-4 mm<sup>3</sup> pieces, transferred to a gentleMACS C tube (cat. no. 130-096-334) containing DMEM/enzyme mix and then attached to gentleMACS Octo Dissociator (cat. no. 130-096-427) with heating running the ‘37C_m_TDK_1’ (mouse) program. The suspension was filtered through a 40 µm cell strainer (Falcon). The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 400g for 10 min and resuspended in chilled 1X Red Blood Cell Removal Solution (Miltenyi Biotec, cat. no.130-094-183). Debris was then removed using the Debris Removal Solution (Miltenyi Biotec, cat. no. 130-109-398) following the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>

<title>Cell culture</title>
<p>The C4-2 cell line, from Jer-Tsong Hsieh, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, was used to model castration-resistant prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). C4-2 was periodically monitored by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for mycoplasma contamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>) and DNA fingerprinting was employed to authenticate this cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). C4-2 was cultured in RPMI-1640 media supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Enzalutamide was from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX).</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA)</title>
<p>In the case of prostate tumors, tissue powder was homogenized in NP-40 buffer using Sonic Dismembrator (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH) at power 7 for 30 sec. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation and stored at −80°C for subsequent analysis. In the case of cell culture, cells were seeded at a density of 0.8-1×10<sup>5</sup>/ml as mono-cultures and media stored at 4°C was used for subsequent analysis. TNF and CCL2 were quantitated by ELISA (eBioscience, San Diego, CA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Protein concentration was determined using bicinchoninic acid reagent (Pierce, ThermoFisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>

<title>Fluorescent activating cell sorting</title>
<p>Cells in culture were detached from cell culture plasticware using StemPro accutase (Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD), washed with PBS and incubated with 1% BSA in 1x PBS for 10 min at 4°C. Human cell lines were incubated with antibodies against CD166-FITC (3A6; Ancell, Stillwater, MN; 1:1250) and CD49f-Alexa Fluor<sup>®</sup> 647 (GoH3; Biolegend, San Diego, CA; 1:200) for 30 min at 4°C. Mouse prostates were disaggregated using 1mg/ml type I collagenase and 1mg/ml Dispase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in RPMI medium and filtered through 40 μm cell strainer. Cells were suspended in DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% L-glutamine, and then incubated with fluor-labeled antibodies for 30 min at 4°C. Mouse cells were incubated with antibodies against Sca-1-APC (D7; 1:500), CD49f-PE (GoH3; 1:333), and the ‘lineage’ markers (Ter119-FITC (TER-119; 1:250), CD31-FITC (390; 1:250) and CD45-FITC (30-F11; 1:250)). LSC FACS, first gating on lineage-negative (Lin<sup>-</sup>) cells and then CD49f and SCA-1 was performed as described by Witte and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). All anti-mouse antibodies were purchased from eBioscience (San Diego, CA). 7-AAD (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA; 1:1000) was used to determine dead cells. FACS analysis was performed using the BD LSR-II (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA) and analyzed by Winlist 3D (Version 8.0; Verity Software House, Topsham, ME, USA). Cell sorting was done by BD FACSAria-II (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA).</p>

<title>Colony formation assay</title>
<p>Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at densities of 0.5 × 10<sup>3</sup>, 1 × 10<sup>3</sup> and 1.5 × 10<sup>3</sup> cells per well and cultured for 21 days. The media was removed, wells were washed once with PBS, stained with 2% toluidine blue for 30 min and scanned with Epson Perfection 1240U (Suwa, Nagano Prefecture, Japan). Colonies were imaged and then enumerated using ImageJ.</p>

<sec id="s2g">
<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was performed on 5 μm sections of formalin fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) mouse prostate tumor tissue. Sections were incubated with monoclonal antibodies against F4/80 (BM8; Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA; 1:600), CD8alpha (D4W2Z; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA; 1:400), or CCL2 (2H5; Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA; 1:100), appropriate horse-radish peroxide secondary antibodies and reacted with 3,3-diaminobenzidine using an automated tissue processor. IHC and H&amp;E images were captured at 20x magnification using Olympus BX45 microscope and cellSens software (Olympus, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan). Ten random high powered (200X) fields were captured for each section and were blinded prior to quantitation of stained cells (F4/80<sup>+</sup> or CCL2<sup>+</sup> macrophages or CD8a<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes) using ImageJ.</p>

<sec id="s2h">
<title>RNA extraction, sequencing and analysis</title>
<p>RNA was extracted from liquid nitrogen frozen tumor samples by pulverizing tissue into a powder using a pre-cooled mortar and pestle. TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was then added by a ratio of 1 mL of TRIzol per 100 mg of tumor tissue, and RNA extraction completed as per manufacturer’s instructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Bulk RNA-seq data processing and analysis was performed as follows. FastQC v0.11.5 was used for quality control; STAR v2.6.0a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>) was employed to align the reads to the murine reference genome (GRCm38 M16) and gene expression was then quantified using RSEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). FastQC, RSEM, STAR were all performed in a local Linux/Unix computing environment. Subsequent analyses were performed using the following R-software packages from the Bioconductor website. Estimated gene counts from RSEM were filtered and the upper quartile was normalized using edgeR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Differential gene expression (DGE) was performed using Limma after Voom transformation followed by linear regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). The significance threshold was set to false discovery rate (FDR) / adjusted p-value of less than 0.05 with a fold change greater than 2 (FDR &lt; 0.05 and |log2 fold change| &gt; 1). Sets of genes with FDR&lt;0.05 and |log2FC| from the DGE analysis were subjected to Gene Ontology analysis of biological processes as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>), using the website tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pantherdb.org/index.jsp">http://pantherdb.org/index.jsp</ext-link>). Heatmaps were generated using the package Complexheatmap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Single cell gene expression libraries were generated using the 10X Genomics Chromium platform and sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina). Processing of scRNA-seq data was performed as follows. For QC, normalization, clustering and differential gene expression, the Cellranger v6.0.0 software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-geneexpression/software/">https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-geneexpression/software/</ext-link>) was used to align FASTQ sequencing reads to the mm10 (mouse) reference transcriptome, generating single cell feature counts for each sample. Count data from all cells were included in a ‘SingleCellExperiment’ (version 1.8.0) object (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). The ‘scater’ package (version 1.14.5) was used to filter cells and normalize counts per million (CPM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Transcripts from a given cell were removed from the analysis if the corresponding transcriptome met any of the following criteria: 20% or more reads aligned to mitochondrial genes, 1000 total counts per cell or less, or 300 genes per cell or less. The dimensionality of this transcriptomic data was reduced using the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). The ‘limma’ package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>) was used to identify differentially expressed genes to refine the assignment of clusters generated by the t-SNE algorithm.</p>

<title>Tumor recurrence following castration-induced regression in PTEN-deficient PC</title>
<p>Mice engineered to delete the PTEN gene in the prostate epithelium at puberty uniformly develop an intraductal form of prostate adenocarcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>) (Table S1). To investigate the response of prostate cancer to androgen deprivation therapies, we used high frequency ultrasound (HFUS) and three-dimension reconstruction software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>) to serially determine the volume of tumors in live animals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). As seen in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, the kinetics of tumor volume following castration is complex. Immediately following castration, tumor volume continues to increase similar to the non-castrated control. We recently demonstrated that this delay in tumor regression – which is not observed in the normal murine prostate – is driven by glucocorticoid receptor signaling transiently substituting for tumor-specific re-programmed AR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Following this delay, the tumors regressed as expected but within ∼5 weeks most began to increase in volume, implying tumor recurrence and mimicking the development of CRPC in men. Serial HFUS imaging of a large cohort castrated PTEN-deficient mice (including those in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) is summarized in Supplementary Table S2, demonstrating 40-80% recurrence dependent on the period of post-castration observation.</p>

<p>We measured TNF protein levels in tumor lysates, and found an increase at 5 weeks post-castration, when tumor recurrence is beginning (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Previously, we had observed an increase in <italic>Tnf</italic> mRNA at 8 hours post-castration in the stromal compartment of the normal prostate, suggesting a relatively direct effect of androgen-withdrawal on TNF expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). In the case of PTEN-deficient tumors, the increase in TNF protein at a late time post-castration suggests a more complex transcriptional and/or translational regulatory mechanism in response to androgen withdrawal. Alternately, the increase in TNF at late times post-castration might be due to the expansion of a population of TNF-expressing cells as the tumor evolves in response to androgen deprivation. We queried gene expression profiles in public databases from two previously published studies of men who had either hormone-naïve PC or CRPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>), to gain insight into this question. Increased <italic>TNF</italic> mRNA expression in CRPC, relative to castration-naive primary PC, correlated with elevated expression of stem cell-related genes in both datasets (Fig. S1).</p>

<title>Androgen-deprivation induced TNF secretion is due to increased basal cell stemness</title>
<p>To determine if we could detect a change in the stem cell-like tumor epithelial cell populations as the tumors began to increase in volume following castration-induced regression, we examined single cell preparations from tumors for cell surface expression of stem cell markers, using fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS). We observed an increase in Lin<sup>-</sup>/Sca1<sup>+</sup>/CD49f <sup>hi</sup> (LSC<sup>hi</sup>) cells at 25 days post-castration, relative to non-castrated tumors (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). These cells correspond to the cytokeratin-5<sup>+</sup>/p63<sup>+</sup> basal stem cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>), a multipotent stem cell population that is required for the post-natal development of the prostate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). Basal stem cells are distinct from Lin<sup>-</sup>/Sca1<sup>+</sup>/CD49f <sup>med</sup> (LSC<sup>med</sup>) luminal progenitor cells (identified in the lower right population in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>) that are the likely tumor initiating cell populations for most human prostate cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>).</p>
<p>The data in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref> and S1 suggest that the TNF secreted during the post-castration recurrence phase in the PTEN-deficient tumors might be derived from a basal stem cell population. To test this more thoroughly, we performed experiments using the C4-2 and LNCaP cell culture models of PC. First, we observed that long-term culture in the anti-androgen enzalutamide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>) significantly reduced the growth rate of C4-2 prostate cancer cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), as expected. Reduced growth was accompanied by an increase in the fraction of cells that resembled basal stem cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-C</xref>) and a coordinate increased in TNF levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). In the analyses for <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, we employed CD166 as a basal stemness biomarker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). We also performed the enzalutamide selection experiment on the LNCaP cell line, an isogenic parental line for C4-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>), which is more androgen-responsive (Fig S2A). We observed a similar correlation between stemness and TNF secretion (Fig. S2B-C). Finally, we replicated enzalutamide selection for both C4-2 and LNCaP cell lines, using immunofluorescence microscopy to identify CD49f<sup>hi</sup> and CD166<sup>hi</sup> cells (Fig. S3). Again, an increase in the fraction of cells scoring for these basal stemness markers correlated with increased TNF secretion. Stem cell marker enrichment &gt;10% was typically required to detect an increase in TNF in the media of enzalutamide-treated cultures. Next, we treated C4-2 cells with enzalutamide for 20 days and used preparative FACS to partially purified cells into CD166<sup>lo</sup> and CD166<sup>hi</sup> fractions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). TNF levels were higher in conditioned media from the CD166<sup>hi</sup> fraction relative to the CD166<sup>lo</sup> fraction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). We also demonstrated that the efficiency of colony formation – a functional marker of stemness – correlated with the level of expression of CD166 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p>

<title>Differentially-timed blockade of TNF signaling</title>
<p>We previously employed cell culture and mouse models of prostate cancer to demonstrate that TNF signaling mediates two distinct responses to ADT – an anti-tumorigenic apoptotic/regression phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>) and a pro-tumorigenic cell migration phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Given the observations in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, we hypothesized that TNF mediates both the regression and recurrence phases that occur after castration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). To test this, we treated tumor-bearing mice with etanercept – a sTNFR2-Fc fusion protein, which competitively binds TNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>) and prevents receptor binding – beginning at three distinct time points: three days prior, one day prior, and three days following castration. When etanercept is administered three days before castration (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, -3d), castration-induced regression is blocked, and tumor growth is similar to the sham group (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Etanercept given one day before castration does not affect regression but blocks recurrence (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, -1d). Finally, when etanercept was administered three days after castration there is no detectable effect on regression or recurrence (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, +3d). Instead, the result resembles castration alone (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>To gain insight into the nature of the different molecular processes occurring during regression and recurrence, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on RNA sequence data from bulk tumor mRNA. Specifically, we compared samples from sham castrated mice with those from either mice six days after castration (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, upper panel) or mice 35 days after castration (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, lower panel). Multiple gene sets related to TNF-induced transcription, most NFkB-related, were uniformly down-regulated at six days post-castration but up-regulated 5 weeks after castration, relative to the sham conditions. The switch in TNF-related gene sets from down-regulation to up-regulation is consistent with a switch from apoptosis signaling (low NFkB levels) to signaling that promotes transcription of NFkB-regulated genes (high NFkB levels).</p>

<title>CCL2 signaling is required for recurrence in murine prostate cancer models</title>
<p>CCL2 is a chemotactic cytokine (chemokine) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>) linked to prostate cancer pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). The CCL2-CCR2 signaling axis has multiple pro-tumorigenic functions, most notably the recruitment and polarization of tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Previously we demonstrated autocrine CCL2 secretion following enzalutamide induction of TNF in mono-cultures of C4-2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), consistent with CCL2 gene transcription via TNF induction of NFκB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). We returned to the enzalutamide selection experiments shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and Supplementary Figure S2 and found that the secretion of CCL2 protein increased over time, coordinately with TNF secretion, in enzalutamide treated C4-2 and LNCaP cells (Fig. S4A). To assess paracrine CCL2 production in response to androgen deprivation, we replicated these experiments using co-cultures of LNCaP or C4-2 plus the myofibroblast-like WPMY-1 cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>), grown in enzalutamide-containing media. Again, we observed coordinate secretion of TNF and CCL2 (Fig. S4B). Co-cultures produced 5- to 20-fold more CCL2 than the prostate cancer cell line mono-cultures. We also found that enzalutamide-treated co-cultures of C4-2 plus WPMY-1 produced conditioned media that induced migration of THP-1, a CCR2<sup>+</sup> macrophage-like leukemia cell line that is a model for TAMs.</p>
<p>These observations suggested that paracrine TNF induction of CCL2 in the prostate cancer TME might be responsible for tumor recurrence at late times post-castration, possibly by recruiting immunosuppressive TAMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Indeed, we found that in the samples from <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, CCL2 increased at 5 weeks (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>), coincident with the rise in TNF that accompanies tumor recurrence. Tissue sections corresponding to tumors 5 weeks post-castration showed an increase in stroma-localized macrophage-like cells expressing CCL2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Moreover, CCL2 expression was reduced in tumor tissue sections from castrated mice that received etanercept, consistent with CCL2 regulation by TNF (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). To determine if CCL2 signaling was necessary for post-castration tumor recurrence in prostate cancer mouse models, mice bearing PTEN-deficient prostate cancers received an antagonist of CCR2 prior to castration. Serial imaging revealed that none of the tumors met the criteria for recurrence (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>), indicating that CCL2-CCR2 signaling is indeed required for castration resistant recurrence in this model. Importantly, the tumor kinetics produced by CCR2 blockade phenocopies the effect of etanercept administered one-day prior to castration (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, -1d), consistent with TNF regulation of CCL2 gene transcription via NFkB. To confirm the role of CCL2 signaling we replicated the CCR2 inhibition studies in the Hi-MYC prostate cancer GEMM, which has a similar response to castration (regression delay, regression then recurrence) as the PTEN-deficient GEMM (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>, blue symbols; see also ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>)). We observed that CCR2a treatment prior to castration was comparably effective at inhibiting castration-resistant recurrence in Hi-MYC mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>, red symbols; Fig. S5).</p>

<title>An immunosuppressive cell profile is induced in the TME during recurrence</title>
<p>Taken together, the analyses in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> indicate that CCL2 might be functioning to recruit TAMs and drive the progression to, or recurrence as, castration resistant prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). Thus, to determine how TNF-CCL2 signaling effects the tumor immune microenvironment in the PTEN-deficient murine prostate cancer model, we used immunohistochemistry (IHC) to quantitate F4/80- and CD8- stained cells in tissue sections from the tumors. As seen in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>, F4/80-stained cells (presumptive TAMs) increase, most notably at 35 days post-castration, just as tumor re-growth in the recurrence phase is beginning and CCL2 levels are peaking (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). In addition, etanercept partially blocks this increase in TAMs and coordinately inhibits tumor recurrence. CD8 T cells (presumptive cytolytic T-lymphocytes; CTLs) decreased over time following castration and this was also partially reversed by etanercept administration to the mice bearing PTEN-deficient tumors. <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref> demonstrates that blocking CCL2 signaling with the CCR2 antagonist has the expected effect – it reduces F4/80-stained cells and increased CD8-stained cells, reversing the castration-induced immunosuppressive cell profile and coordinately preventing prostate cancer recurrence (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Integrating the data on F4/80-staining, CD8-staining and CCL2 ELISAs for tumors treated and harvested at various times post-castration reveals a demonstrates a high degree of correlation of the key immune components we examined. Specifically, there is positive correlation of macrophages and CCL2 secretion and a negative correlation of T cells with macrophage as well as with CCL2 section (Fig. S7). We also observed a more pronounced CD45+ cell infiltrate in the recurrent tumors, relative to non-recurrent tumors (Fig. S7B).</p>

<title>TNF signaling switch</title>
<p>Employing a HFUS-based imaging protocol to measure tumor volume in live mice, we are able to resolve the response of genetically-engineered murine prostate cancers to castration into multiple, mechanistically-distinct phases, as illustrated for the PTEN-deficient prostate cancer model in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> (the kinetics for the castration response in the Hi-MYC GEMM are similar). Immediately following castration, there is an increase in tumor volume in both prostate cancer GEMMs. We recently demonstrated that this seemingly paradoxical effect is dependent on glucocorticoid signaling transiently substituting for tumor-specific androgen receptor signals that are blocked by the androgen ablative effects of castration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). After 4-7 days of gradually increasing volume, the tumors begin to regress due to apoptotic cell death of the epithelial tumor cells in the cancerous glands, consistent with the classical morphological description of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). In addition to tumor epithelial cell apoptosis, there is a loss of vascular integrity within the tumor that contributes to the regression phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). Some tumors continue to regress for more than two months, but for the majority – up to 75% of individual tumors in the prostate cancer GEMMs we studied – recurrence begins 4-6 weeks after castration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref> and Supplementary Table S2b).</p>
<p>We sought to decipher the intra- and inter-cellular signaling events that occur within the tumor and the surrounding microenvironment in response to androgen deprivation (castration). Previously we had shown that TNF – but not other common death receptor ligands (FasL and TRAIL) – is necessary for apoptosis-driven regression of the normal murine prostate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). In addition, we also found that TNF is required for so-called vascular regression of murine prostate cancers, probably by triggering endothelial cell apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). The loss of vascular integrity leads to tumor hypoxia within a day following castration. While these events occur multiple days prior to the onset of a measurable reduction in prostate cancer volume, hypoxia may indirectly drive regression by inducing tumor epithelial cell apoptosis via TP53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). In the current studies, when we administered etanercept to PTEN-deficient mice three days prior to castration, regression was effectively inhibited (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> and Supplementary Table S2a). This observation is consistent with TNF-driven apoptosis of tumor epithelial and endothelial cells.</p>
<p>The increase in TNF protein 5 weeks post-castration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>) – at a point when most tumors have regressed – suggested a second role for TNF signaling in the response to androgen deprivation. Indeed, blockade of TNF signaling beginning one day prior to castration results in most tumors regressing, but no recurrence (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> and Supplementary Table S2a). Thus, TNF signaling switches from pro-apoptotic signaling that activates caspase-8 and drives regression to pro-tumorigenic signaling that activates the NFκB and/or PI3K/Akt pathways, promoting tumor cell survival and proliferation and tumor recurrence. The results of transcriptional analysis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>) support the switch to a pro-tumorigenic phenotype: we observed increased expression of NFκB-related gene sets in bulk mRNA recovered from tumor samples at 35 days, versus 6 days, post-castration. A key consequence of NFκB signaling during the recurrence phase is the induction of CCL2 protein levels 35 days post-castration (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Moreover, the administration of a CCR2 antagonist to tumor bearing mice prevented castration-induced recurrence (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>), phenocopying the effects of -1d TNF blockade by etanercept treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, -1d panel). This observation is consistent with CCL2 expression downstream of TNF-NFκB signaling. Similarly, the number of CCL2-staining cells in the TME was reduced in tumors from mice receiving etanercept to block TNF signaling (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p>

<title>Increased tumor cell stemness following androgen deprivation drives pro-tumor TNF signaling</title>
<p>While the pleotropic signaling effects of TNF are well-established, an important mechanistic question in the context of this report is whether changes in the tumor and surrounding TME are responsible for the post-castration switch in TNF signaling. Two potential determinants are the spatial and temporal pattern of TNF production/ secretion and the context of the cells that TNF signaling targets. Previously, we showed that in the normal rat prostate TNF mRNA and protein increased as early as 8 hours post-castration, with the most significant increase occurring within the stromal compartment of the prostate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). However, in PTEN-deficient murine tumors there is no discernable increase in TNF protein in the first 24 hours post-castration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Alternatively, death receptor driven apoptosis can be triggered by down-regulation of the CASP8 inhibitor CFLAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Indeed, we previously found castration reduced CFLAR expression within 12 hours post-castration in the normal rat prostate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Moreover, CFLAR protein is up-regulated in CRPC patient samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). To investigate the mechanism of the late (5 weeks post-castration) increase in TNF, we blocked AR action with enzalutamide in prostate cancer cell culture models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). After 3 weeks of culture in enzalutamide, TNF secretion and stemness were increased in both C42 and LNCaP cell lines (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref> and Supplementary Figs. S2-S3). Higher levels of TNF secretion occurred in cultures enriched for expression of one of the stem cell-like markers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The increased expression of stem cell-like genes following androgen deprivation probably reflects the death of luminal-like cells (low stemness) and selection for, or expansion of, basal-like cells (higher stemness) that have increased levels of NFκB and therefore secrete more TNF protein. We observed an increase in basal stem-like cells at 25 days post-castration in the PTEN-deficient tumor model (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), suggesting a similar phenomenon is occurring <italic>in vivo</italic>. It is also possible that the increase in stemness that we observe post-castration is due to lineage plasticity of pre-existing stem-like cells, rather than selection and expansion, as we propose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). Regardless, the increase in TNF secretion observed 5 weeks post-castration is a consequence of changes in cellular context rather than a promoter/enhancer-driven transcriptional response.</p>

<title>Immune suppression is a key consequence of increased tumor cell stemness</title>
<p>By investigating the switch in TNF signaling, we identified CCL2 secretion as a key TNF-NFκB-induced event required for the onset of tumor recurrence in the PTEN-deficient GEMM (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Moreover, CCL2 is also required for recurrence in the genetically distinct Hi-MYC GEMM, suggesting CCL2 may be a common driver for recurrence post-castration, at least in murine models of prostate cancer. Although CCL2 has multiple pro-tumorigenic immune-modulating functions in prostate and other cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>), the transcriptomic studies described in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> are consistent with TAM recruitment. Specifically, Gene Ontology analysis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A-B</xref>) indicates that CCL2 induces immune cell chemotaxis and migration at the time of recurrence, which is the behavior expected of TAMs as well as other myeloid immune suppressive cells, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC). The heat map in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref> showed up-regulation of TAM-related genes, while IHC analysis in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> (and Supplementary Fig. S7) demonstrated a coordinate increase in F4/80+ macrophages and CCL2 at the time of recurrence. The latter two observations support a critical role for TAMs, but do not rule out a role for MDSC. Identifying the precise tumor immune cell populations within the TME that modulate the response of cancers to therapy is the focus of considerable ongoing research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). TAMs are a heterogenous set of immune cells which are predominantly pro-tumorigenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>) and have been implicated in human and murine prostate cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>). Although an oversimplification of the immune response to cancer, a balance between anti-tumor cytolytic T cells and immunosuppressive myeloid cell populations may predict the success of emerging immunotherapies. Indeed, variants of the CTL/TAM ratio – similar to our observations in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> – are potential prognostic biomarkers in patients with melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>), breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>) and hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>).</p>

<title>A model for the development of CRPC</title>
<p>The models we employed are anatomically similar to non-metastatic CRPC (nmCRPC) in that the tumor is localized to the prostate, whereas in metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) the TME is derived from the metastatic site, such as bone. Most CRPC is discovered clinically as mCRPC and indeed nmCRPC is likely a transient state that progresses to mCRPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>). Castration of mice bearing PTEN-deficient or Hi-MYC prostate cancers induces regression and then recurrence – a pattern very similar to that seen in the development of human CRPC. Importantly, HFUS imaging provides real-time volume data to ensure that the complex kinetics of tumor volume changes can be used to accurately categorize the response of each tumor to androgen deprivation. We propose that the cellular response to androgen deprivation involves a mechanism (Supplementary Fig. 8) that harnesses TNF secretion into the TME, to first drive regression and subsequently to induce an immunosuppressive state that induces recurrence. The specific signal may vary depending on the TME context. For example, there is no evidence of TNF switching in the Hi-MYC GEMM, or in human prostate cancers while in some PTEN-deficient GEMMs, IL1ß triggers myeloid immune suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>). However, we propose that the cellular interactions within the TME are likely to be similar in human nmCRPC and mCRPC as well as GEMMs.</p>
<p>Although CCL2 was effective at preventing recurrence in our GEMMs, a monoclonal antibody which binds CCL2 failed in a phase 2 patient trial in mCRPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>). This may have been due to technical issues with the drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>), or possibly heterogeneity among human CRPCs. Indeed, Giancotti and colleagues identified three subtypes of CRPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>) and proposed that one of these – mesenchymal stem-like prostate cancer – might use CCL2 signaling to promote myeloid immune suppression. Thus, patients with this CRPC subtype may be candidates for anti-CCL2 therapies.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Sha K et al aimed at identifying the mechanism of response and resistance to castration in the Pten knockout GEM model. They found elevated levels of TNF overexpressed in castrated tumors associated with an expansion of basal-like stem cells during recurrence, which they show occurring in prostate cancer cells in culture upon enzalutamide treatment. Further, the authors carry on a timed dependent analysis of the role of TNF in regression and recurrence to show that TNF regulates both processes. Similarly, CCL2, which the authors had proposed as a chemokine secreted upon TNF induction following enzalutamide treatment, is also shown to be elevated during recurrence and associated with the remodeling of an immunosuppressive microenvironment through depletion of T cells and recruitment of TAMs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The paper exploits a well-established GEM model to interrogate mechanisms of response to standard-of-care treatment. This is of utmost importance since prostate cancer recurrence after ADT or ARSi marks the onset of an incurable disease stage for which limited treatments exist. The work is relevant in the confirmation that recurrent prostate cancer is mostly an immunologically &quot;cold&quot; tumor with an immunosuppressive immune microenvironment</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the data is consistent and the conclusions are mostly supported and justified, the findings overall are incremental and of limited novelty. The role of TNF and NF-kB signaling in tumor progression and the role of the CCL2-CCR2 in shaping the immunosuppressive microenvironment are well established.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is unclear why the authors decided to focus on the basal compartment when there is a wealth of literature suggesting that luminal cells are if not exclusively, surely one of the cells of origin of prostate cancer and responsible for recurrence upon antiandrogen treatment. As a result, most of the later shown data has to be taken with caution as it is not known if the same phenomena occur in the luminal compartment.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Sha and Zhang et al. reported that androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) induces a switch to a basal-stemness status, driven by the TNF-CCL2-CCR2 axis. Their results also reveal that enhanced CCL2 coincides with increased macrophages and decreased CD8 T cells, suggesting that ADT resistance may be related to the TNF/CCL2/CCR2-dependent immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Overall, this is a very interesting study with a significant amount of data.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strengths of the study include various clinically relevant models, cutting-edge technology (such as single-cell RNA-seq), translational potential (TNF and CCR2 inhibitors), and novel insights connecting stemness lineage switch to an immunosuppressive TME. Thus, I believe this work would be of significant interest to the field of prostate cancer and journal readership.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) One of the key conclusions/findings of this study is the ADT-induced basal-stemness lineage switch driving ADT resistance. However, most of the presented evidence supporting this conclusion only selects a couple of marker genes. What exacerbates this issue is that different basal-stemness markers were often selected with different results. For example, Figure S1A uses CD166/EZH2 as markers, while Figure S1B uses ITGb1/EZH2. In contrast, Figure 1D uses Sca1/CD49, and Figure 2B-C uses CD49/CD166. Since many basal-stemness lineage gene signatures have been previously established, the study should examine various basal-stemness gene signatures rather than a couple of selected markers. Moreover, why were none of the stemness/basal-gene signatures significantly changed in the GO enrichment analysis in Figure 6A/B?</p>
<p>(2) A related weakness is the lack of functional results supporting the stemness lineage switch. Although the authors present colony formation assay results, these could be influenced simply by promoted cell proliferation, which is not a convincing indicator of stemness. To support this key conclusion, widely accepted stemness assays, such as the prostasphere formation assay (in vitro) and Extreme Limiting Dilution Analysis (ELDA) xenograft assay (in vivo), should be carried out.</p>
<p>(3) Another significant concern is that this study uses concurrency to demonstrate a causal relationship in many key results, which is entirely different. For example, Figure S4A and S4B only show increased CCL2 and TNF secretion simultaneously, which cannot support that CCL2 is dependent on TNF. Similarly, Figure 5A only shows that CCL2 increased coincidently with a rise in TNF, which cannot support a causal relationship. To support the causal relationship of this conclusion, it is necessary to show that TNF-KO/KD would abolish the increased CCL2 secretion.</p>
<p>(4) Some of the selective data presentations are not explained and are difficult to understand. For example, why does CD49 staining in Figure S3A have data for all four time points, while CD166 in Figure S3D only has data for the last time point (day 21)? Similarly, although several TNF_UP gene signatures were highlighted in Figure 4B, several TNF_DN signatures were also enriched in the same table, such as RUAN_RESPONSE_TO_TNF_DN. What is the explanation for these contrasting results?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The current manuscript evaluates the role of TNF in promoting AR targeted therapy regression and subsequent resistance through CCL2 and TAMs. The current evidence supports a correlative role for TNF in promoting cancer cell progression following AR inhibition. Weaknesses include a lack of descriptive methodology of the pre-clinical GEM model experiments and it is not well-defined which cell types are impacted in this pre-clinical model which will be quite heterogenous with regards to cancer, normal, and microenvironment cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Appropriate use of pre-clinical models and GEM models to address the scientific questions.</p>
<p>(2) Novel finding of TNF and interplay of TAMs in promoting cancer cell progression following AR inhibition.</p>
<p>(3) Potential for developing novel therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance to AR blockade.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) There is a lack of description regarding the GEM model experiments - the age at which mice experiments are started.</p>
<p>(2) Tumor volume measurements are provided but in this context, there is no discussion on how the mixed cancer and normal epithelial and microenvironment is impacted by AR therapy which could lead to the subtle changes in tumor volume.</p>
<p>(3) There are no readouts for target inhibition across the therapeutic pre-clinical trials or dosing time courses.</p>
<p>(4) The terminology of regression and resistance appears arbitrary. The data seems to demonstrate a persistence of significant disease that progresses, rather than a robust response with minimal residual disease that recurs within the primary tumor.</p>
<p>(5) It is unclear if the increase in basal-like stem cells is from normal basal cells or cancer cells with a basal stem-like property.</p>
<p>1. In the Hi-MYC model, MYC expression is regulated by AR inhibition and is profoundly ARi responsive at early time points.</p>

<p>In this manuscript by Sha et al. the authors test the role of TNFa in modulating tumor regression/recurrence under therapeutic pressure from castration (or enzalutamide) in both in vitro and in vivo models of prostate cancer. Using the PTEN-null genetic mouse model, they compare the effect of a TNFα ligand trap, etanercept, at various points pre- and post-castration. Their most interesting findings from this experiment were that etanercept given 3 days prior to castration prevented tumor regression, which is a common phenotype seen in these models after castration, but etanercept given 1 day prior to castration prevented prostate cancer recurrence after castration. They go on to perform RNA sequencing on tumors isolated from either sham or castrate mice from two time points post-castration to study acute and delayed transcriptional responses to androgen deprivation. They found enrichment of gene sets containing TNF-targets which initially decrease post-castration but are elevated by 35 days, the time at which tumors recur. The authors conduct a similar set of experiments using human prostate cancer cell lines treated with the androgen receptor inhibitor enzalutamide and observe that drug treatment leads to cells with basal stem-like features that express high levels of TNF. They noticed that CCL2 levels correlate with changes in TNF levels raising the possibility that CCL2 might be a critical downstream effector for disease recurrence. To this end, they treated PTEN-null and hi-MYC castrated mice with a CCR2-antagonist (CCR2a) because CCR2 is one receptor of CCL2 and monitors tumor growth dynamics. Interestingly, upon treatment with CCR2a, tumors did not recur according to their measurements. They go on to demonstrate that the tumors pre-treated with CCR2a had reduced levels of putative TAMs and increased CTLs in the context of TNF or CCR2 inhibition providing a cellular context associated with disease regression. Lastly, they perform single-cell RNA sequencing to further characterize the tumor microenvironment post-castration and report that the ratio of CTLs to TAMs is lower in a recurrent tumor.</p>
<p>While the concepts behind the study have merit, the data are incomplete and do not fully support the authors' conclusions. The author's definition of recurrence is subjective given that the amount of disease regression after castration is both variable (Figure 8) and relatively limited, particularly in the PTEN loss model. Critical controls are missing. For example, both drug experiments were completed without treating non-castrate plus drug controls which raises the question of how specific these findings are to castration resistance. No validation was performed to ensure that either the TNF ligand trap or the CCR2 agonist was acting on target. The single-cell sequencing experiments were done without replicates which raises concern about its interpretation. At a conceptual level, the authors say that a major cause of disease recurrence in the immunosuppressive TME, but provide little functional data that macrophages and T cells are directly responsible for this phenotype. Statistical analyses were performed on only select experiments. In summary, further work is recommended to support the conclusions of this story.</p>
