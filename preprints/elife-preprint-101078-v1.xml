<title>Summary</title><p>A central question in adult stem cell biology is elucidating the signaling pathways regulating their dynamics and function in diverse physiological and age-related contexts. Muscle stem cells in adults (Satellite Cells; SCs) are generally quiescent but can activate and contribute to muscle repair and growth. Here we tested the role of the MuSK-BMP pathway in regulating adult SC quiescence by deletion of the BMP-binding MuSK Ig3 domain (‘ΔIg3-MuSK’). At 3 months of age SC and myonuclei numbers and myofiber size were comparable to WT. However, at 5 months of age SC density was decreased while myofiber size, myonuclear number and grip strength were increased - indicating that SCs had activated and productively fused into the myofibers over this interval. Transcriptomic analysis showed that SCs from uninjured ΔIg3-MuSK mice exhibit signatures of activation. Regeneration experiments showed that ΔIg3-MuSK SCs maintain full stem cell function. Expression of ΔIg3-MuSK in adult SCs was sufficient to break quiescence and increase myofiber size. We conclude that the MuSK-BMP pathway regulates SC quiescence and myofiber size in a cell autonomous, age-dependent manner. Targeting MuSK-BMP signaling in muscle stem cells thus emerges a therapeutic strategy for promoting muscle growth and function in the settings of injury, disease, and aging.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Adult muscle stem cells (Satellite Cells; SCs), are key arbiters of muscle growth, homeostasis and regeneration(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Keefe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Murach et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Pawlikowski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Sambasivan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Sousa-Victor et al., 2022</xref>). SC function is tailored to the state of the muscle as well as to age. For example, during the first weeks of life large scale SC proliferation and fusion are essential for achieving mature muscle size and myonuclear complement. In mice, SCs contribute to normal myofiber growth until ∼8 weeks of age(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bachman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bachman and Chakkalakal, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cramer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gattazzo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Pawlikowski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">White et al., 2010</xref>). After this age SCs in uninjured muscles are generally quiescent, but can activate to support muscle growth in response to load or exercise(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Egner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Goh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Goh and Millay, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Murach et al., 2021</xref>). SCs can also activate and proliferate following injury to effect muscle regeneration(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Murphy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Sambasivan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Zammit et al., 2002</xref>). Finally, dysregulation of SC function with aging is thought to contribute to sarcopenia(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Blau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brack et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Sousa-Victor et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>A key question in SC biology is elucidating the signaling pathways that regulate their dynamics, particularly in age-related contexts. Known pathways include Notch-Delta, Wnts, Collagens V and VI, Cadherin and BMPs(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">de Morree and Rando, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fuchs and Blau, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kann et al., 2021</xref>). Notch signaling controls both satellite cell quiescence and is necessary for SC self-renewal following activation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bjornson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gioftsidi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Muscle-derived Wnt4 maintains SC quiescence(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Eliazer et al., 2019</xref>). Members of the TGFß superfamily also play important roles. Myostatin (GDF8) is a potent regulator of SC dynamics during early postnatal development, with its absence resulting in massive increases in muscle size. However, myostatin does not regulate SC activation in adults(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lee, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Murphy et al., 2010</xref>). TGFß signaling is a negative regulator of myoblast fusion(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Girardi et al., 2021</xref>). Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), regulate cell proliferation and subsequent SC-mediated muscle growth in both development and during regeneration(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Gozo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Ono et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Stantzou et al., 2017</xref>). However, a role for BMP signaling in SC quiescence in adult muscle has not been described.</p>
<p>We recently reported that the transmembrane protein MuSK, in addition to its well-established role as an agrin-LRP4 receptor, is also a BMP co-receptor that shapes BMP-mediated transcriptional output in myogenic cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fish and Fallon, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Jaime et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yilmaz et al., 2016</xref>). MuSK binds to BMPs as well as to the type I BMP receptors BMPR1a and BMPR1b (also termed ALK3 and ALK6, respectively). Cultured myogenic cells expressing MuSK show enhanced pSmad1/5/8 signaling and express a distinct set of transcripts in response to BMP stimulation compared to MuSK<sup>-/-</sup> cells. MuSK-dependent BMP signaling is dependent on Type I BMP receptor activity, but MuSK tyrosine kinase activity is dispensable. Importantly, the Ig3 domain of MuSK is necessary for high affinity BMP binding, while this region is not required for agrin-LRP4 signaling (which is mediated by the Ig1 domain). The role of MuSK as a BMP co-receptor is thus structurally and functionally distinct from its function in agrin-LRP4 signaling. We recently created a germline knock-in mouse model lacking the MuSK Ig3 domain(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Jaime et al., 2024</xref>). These ‘ΔIg3-MuSK’ mice are viable and fertile and survive to at least 27 months of age. As predicted, myogenic cells isolated from these mice show reduced pSMAD and transcriptional responses to BMP, but normal agrin-LRP4-dependent activity. In that study we characterized these mice at 3 months of age and showed that the MuSK-BMP pathway maintains muscle size in the slow soleus muscle (but not in the fast TA) by regulating myofiber-intrinsic Akt-mTOR signaling.</p>
<p>Here we investigated the role of the MuSK-BMP pathway in SCs in both uninjured and regenerating fast TA and EDL muscles. We show that MuSK transcript and protein are expressed in WT and ΔIg3-MuSK SCs in uninjured muscle. At 3 months of age the ΔIg3-MuSK TA shows normal myofiber size and SC numbers. However, at 5 months SCs are activated and myonuclear number, myofiber size, muscle weight and grip strength are elevated. Notably, 5- month-old mutant muscles efficiently regenerate after injury and the SC pool and myofiber size is restored to WT levels, indicating that the ΔIg3-MuSK SCs maintain full stem cell function. Finally, conditional mutants established that the role of MuSK in regulating quiescence is SC-autonomous and is active in the adult. We conclude that MuSK expressed in SCs regulates quiescence and muscle growth in an age-dependent manner via its role as a BMP co-receptor.</p>

<title>MuSK is expressed in satellite cells</title>
<p>Previous transcriptomic analyses have detected MuSK mRNA in quiescent, activated and regenerating SCs(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Petrany et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Shcherbina et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Yue et al., 2020</xref>). We confirmed that MuSK transcripts are expressed in SCs isolated from uninjured and regenerating muscle from both 3- and 5- month old mice using gel-based PCR analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a-c</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supp. Fig 1a, b</xref>). This analysis also showed that all MuSK detected in WT SCs harbors the Ig3 domain (encoded by exons 6 and 7). For clarity we refer to the form containing the Ig3 domain as Full-Length (FL)-MuSK. We did not detect transcripts lacking the Ig3 domain (ΔIg3-MuSK) in isolated WT SCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). To detect MuSK protein in SCs we isolated myofibers from adult muscle and double labeled them with antibodies recognizing Pax7 and MuSK. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>, MuSK protein is expressed in SCs from both WT and ΔIg3-MuSK mice.</p>

<title>Myofiber diameter and SC numbers are comparable in 3-month-old WT and ΔIg3-MuSK TA muscle</title>
<p>As a first step towards assessing the role of the MuSK-BMP pathway in SC dynamics we compared both SC number and myofiber diameter in WT and ΔIg3-MuSK TA from 3-month-old mice. We chose this time point since adult SC number and myonuclear content are established by this age and SCs are in their adult quiescent state(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ancel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bachman and Chakkalakal, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cramer et al., 2020</xref>). Analysis of Pax7+ cells showed that their density was comparable in both genotypes at 3 months (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, c</xref>). TA myofiber diameter was also comparable in both genotypes at this age (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, b</xref>), which is in agreement with results in a related study(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Jaime et al., 2024</xref>). These results indicate that the MuSK-BMP pathway does not play a discernable role in the developmental and early postnatal events that establish myofiber size and SC pool numbers in fast muscle.</p>

<title>Myofiber diameter is increased while SC numbers are reduced in 5-month-old ΔIg3-MuSK TA muscle</title>
<p>To determine whether the MuSK-BMP pathway plays a role in SC quiescence in older mice, we next assessed SC number and myofiber diameter at 5 months of age. Both measures showed striking differences between genotypes at this age. SC density in the 5-month-old TA was reduced by almost half in ΔIg3-MuSK compared to WT mice (19±2.1 and 10.6±1.4mm<sup>2</sup> in WT vs ΔIg3-MuSK, respectively; n=9-10, p=0.004; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, c</xref>). On the other hand, myofiber diameter in ΔIg3-MuSK muscle was increased by ∼10% compared to WT (37 ±0.8µm and 41 ± 1.0µm in WT vs ΔIg3-MuSK, respectively; n=8, p=0.006; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, b</xref>).</p>

<title>Grip strength is increased in 5-month-old ΔIg3-MuSK mice</title>
<p>We next asked whether the increase in myofiber size observed in 5-month-old mice was associated with improved muscle function. We performed grip strength analysis of ΔIg3-MuSK male mice at 3- and 5- months of age. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, grip strength is comparable between ΔIg3-MuSK and WT mice at 3 months. In contrast, at 5 months, male ΔIg3-MuSK mice display increased grip strength performance (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). This increase in grip strength was observed in 3 cohorts of male mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supp. Fig. 2</xref>). We also tested grip strength in one cohort of female mice. Although the average grip strength was higher in 5 month old ΔIg3-MuSK females compared to controls, this effect did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supp. Fig. 2</xref>). Thus, muscle function is improved in 5- month-old male ΔIg3-MuSK animals.</p>

<title>Myonuclei numbers and myofiber lengths are increased in ΔIg3-MuSK EDL muscles at 5 months of age</title>
<p>The observation that SC numbers are decreased while myofiber diameter is increased in 5- month-old ΔIg3-MuSK TA muscle suggested that SCs in these adult muscles became activated and fused into the myofiber, thus contributing to its growth. To test this idea directly we counted the number of myonuclei in isolated myofibers from 5-month-old ΔIg3-MuSK and WT EDL muscles, an accessible and readily quantifiable model for such measurements. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a, b</xref>, the number of myonuclei/myofiber was increased in ΔIg3-MuSK EDL muscle. In addition, the ΔIg3-MuSK myofibers were also longer (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a, c</xref>). Importantly, the proportion of myonuclei per myofiber length is equivalent at both ages, suggesting that the size of the myonuclear domain is conserved (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). Taken together, these findings indicate that between 3 and 5 months of age in ΔIg3-MuSK muscle SCs become activated, divide, and fuse into the myofiber - resulting in increased length. Further, the conserved proportion of myonuclei/myofiber length indicates that this growth increase scales with the addition of the myonuclei to the myofiber.</p>

<title>Muscle regeneration and restoration of SC numbers following injury to ΔIg3-MuSK muscle</title>
<p>We next queried the role of ΔIg3-MuSK in muscle regeneration, a chief function of adult SCs. TA muscles from 5-month-old WT and ΔIg3-MuSK TA were injured on day 0 by BaCl<sub>2</sub> injection and muscles were harvested at 3-, 5-, 7-, 14-, 22-, and 29-days post-injury (dpi; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). We assessed muscle morphology, myofiber diameter, and SC density at each timepoint. The ΔIg3-MuSK muscle regenerated efficiently, with full restoration of muscle structure achieved by 22 dpi, which was comparable to WT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b, c, e</xref>). The regeneration rate was increased as judged by histoarchitecture (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b, c</xref>), increased Pax7+ density at 5 dpi (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>) and, in the male animals, increased myofiber diameter at 7 dpi (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). The increased Pax7+ cells at 5 dpi and the increased myofiber size at 7dpi indicate that the early stages of muscle regeneration are accelerated in ΔIg3-MuSK mice.</p>

<title>MuSK expressed in adult SCs governs quiescence and myofiber hypertrophy</title>
<p>The studies presented above utilized mice with constitutive (germline) knock-in of the ΔIg3-MuSK allele. However, MuSK is also highly expressed by neuromuscular junction (NMJ) myonuclei, and at lower levels in subsets of myonuclei and interstitial cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Jaime et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Petrany et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Zeng et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, there were two key questions outstanding: 1) Is the function of the MuSK-BMP pathway in SC dynamics cell autonomous; and 2) are there developmental events regulated by this pathway that might contribute to its role in adult SCs? To address both these points we utilized tamoxifen-inducible, conditional <italic>Pax7<sup>CreERT2</sup>;R26R<sup>LSL-</sup> <sup>tdTomato</sup>;MuSK-Ig3<sup>loxP/loxP</sup></italic> mice. These mice license the expression of ΔIg3-MuSK only in cells expressing Pax7 and at the age determined by the tamoxifen administration. In addition, it marks them with the TdTomato reporter. As a control, we used <italic>Pax7<sup>CreERT2</sup>;R26R<sup>LSL-tdTomato</sup></italic>, in which tamoxifen injection induces TdTomato expression in Pax7+ cells, but the MuSK allele is unaffected. We induced Cre-recombination using tamoxifen administered at 3 months of age and then harvested the TA muscles at 5 months of age (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). PCR analysis of RNA isolated from pre-fixed, FACS-sorted SCs confirmed that the Cre-recombination of the floxed Ig3 domain of MuSK was effective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supp. Fig. 3a, b</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, Cre-mediated expression of ΔIg3-MuSK in SCs at 3 months resulted in an ∼9% increase in both muscle weight and myofiber diameter when assessed at 5 months of age (0.035±0.0007 and 0.038±0.0007 g, n=5-8 mice/group, p=0.007; and 36.0±0.78 and 39.3±1.2 µ, n=5-7 mice/group, p=0.037 for weights and diameters, respectively; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Finally, we also counted the number of myonuclei per myofiber in EDL muscles from the same animals (see Methods). <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref> shows that there was an ∼22% increase in the myonuclear number in the <italic>Pax7<sup>CreERT2</sup>;R26R<sup>LSL-tdTomato</sup>;MuSK-Ig3<sup>loxP/loxP</sup></italic> compared to controls (<italic>Pax7<sup>CreERT2</sup>;R26R<sup>LSL-tdTomato</sup></italic>; 234.2±9.8 and 286. ±16.2, respectively, t-test, p=0.008; n=3 per genotype). The increased TA weight, myofiber size and myonuclear number observed in these experiments indicates that MuSK acts in a SC-autonomous manner and that the expression of MuSK in the adult SC is sufficient for this role.</p>

<title>SCs are activated in uninjured ΔIg3-MuSK muscle</title>
<p>The results presented above indicate that the MuSK-BMP pathway is important for maintaining SC quiescence in resting adult muscle, and that perturbation of this pathway leads to the activation of these stem cells. To provide direct evidence for such activation and to gain insight to the mechanistic basis of this state change we interrogated the gene expression of FACs-sorted SCs from uninjured 5-month-old WT and ΔIg3-MuSK muscle (n= 6 animals/genotype). To preclude artefactual activation during cell isolation, animals were perfusion-fixed prior to harvest. We then used the NanoString nCounter Stem Cell Characterization Panel to assess gene expression in WT and ΔIg3-MuSK SCs. This panel includes 770 genes involved in multiple stem cell types including stem-cell regulatory signaling pathways, epigenetics, metabolism, differentiation signaling, and lineage specification. Hierarchical clustering revealed significant changes (p &lt; 0.05) in the expression of 21 of the genes in this panel. Nineteen of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were upregulated including TBLX1, HDAC2, PPP2R2A, SMAD4, CAP2, CREBBP, MDH1, NCOR1, RRAGC and CUL1; while two genes, XIST and CACYBP, were downregulated (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a, b</xref>).</p>

<p>We next asked whether the set of DEG SC genes detected in uninjured ΔIg3-MuSK were characteristic of an activated state. We compared the hits in the ΔIg3-MuSK nCounter set to a published RNAseq dataset of SC DEGs from resting and injured (1 dpi) WT muscle from young (2-3 months) and aged (20-22 months) muscle (GSE121589; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Shcherbina et al., 2020</xref>).

As shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a, b,</xref> 17 of the 19 upregulated genes in uninjured ΔIg3-MuSK SCs are also upregulated in SCs from old and/or young activated WT SCs. XIST, one of the two genes downregulated in ΔIg3-MuSK SCs, was also reduced in both young and aged SCs from damaged WT muscle. This concordance of gene expression patterns indicates that ΔIg3-MuSK SCs in 5-month-old uninjured muscle are in a state of early activation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our results establish that the BMP co-receptor MuSK regulates SC quiescence in adult muscle in a cell-autonomous fashion. Importantly, perturbation of this pathway leads to SC activation, proliferation, and fusion - culminating in increased muscle weight and grip strength. Stemness is maintained (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Below we discuss these novel features of adult SC quiescence and MuSK function as well as their implications for therapeutic development for muscle wasting conditions.</p>

<p>MuSK regulates SC quiescence in a cell autonomous manner. MuSK transcript and protein are expressed in SCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). This finding is in accord with snRNAseq studies showing MuSK transcript in quiescent SCs(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Petrany et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Shcherbina et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Tabula Muris Consortium et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Zeng et al., 2022</xref>). Our results also show that quiescent SCs express ‘full length’ MuSK transcript encoding the Ig3 domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supp. Fig. 1</xref>). This point is noteworthy since the Ig3 domain can be endogenously spliced(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Garcia-Osta et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hesser et al., 1999</xref>). Finally, conditional expression of ΔIg3-MuSK in SCs at 3 months of age is sufficient to phenocopy the increase in myofiber size and myonuclear numbers observed in germ line mutants. Thus, MuSK containing its Ig3 domain is necessary for maintaining adult SC quiescence.</p>
<p>Several lines of evidence indicate that MuSK in SCs functions through its role as a BMP co-receptor, and not as an agrin-LRP4 receptor. Biochemical studies show that MuSK binds BMPs with high affinity in a manner requiring its Ig3 domain(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yilmaz et al., 2016</xref>). Quiescent SCs express BMP signaling machinery, including BMP4 as well as BMPR1a, which also binds to MuSK(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Petrany et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Shcherbina et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yilmaz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Zeng et al., 2022</xref>). Cultured ΔIg3-MuSK myoblasts have reduced BMP4 responses as assessed by pSMAD signaling and transcriptional output(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Jaime et al., 2024</xref>). In contrast, the data does not support a role for MuSK acting as an agrin-LRP4 receptor in SCs: 1) Agrin-induced AChR clustering, which is mediated by its interaction with LRP4, is comparable in ΔIg3-MuSK and WT myotubes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Jaime et al., 2024</xref>); 2) NMJ formation, maintenance, AChR density and cholinergic signaling is comparable in WT and ΔIg3-MuSK muscle. Interestingly, NaV1.4 density and muscle excitability is reduced, suggesting that the MuSK-BMP pathway plays distinct roles from agrin-LRP4 at the NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fish et al., 2023</xref>); ( 3) MuSK’s function as a BMP co-receptor requires neither its TK activity nor the juxtamembrane tyrosine critical for DOK7 binding – features necessary for agrin-LRP4 activity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Jaime et al., 2024</xref>). 4) The MuSK Ig3 domain is dispensable for agrin-LRP binding and signaling, which is mediated by its Ig1 domain(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hesser et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Stiegler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yilmaz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Zong et al., 2012</xref>). To our knowledge this is the first report implicating BMP signaling in adult SC quiescence. It will be of interest to test whether MuSK also plays a role in the BMP-mediated quiescence regulation in other settings, such as neural stems cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Díaz-Moreno et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Mira et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Tunc-Ozcan et al., 2021</xref>). Finally, the deployment of MuSK, which has a highly restricted cell type and tissue distribution, as a co-receptor could be an evolutionary solution to the general problem of conferring context selectivity to the near-universally expressed BMPs and their core signaling machinery(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Hogan, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Massagué, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Our results show that adult ΔIg3-MuSK satellite cells are activated in uninjured muscle. First, SCs density decreases by ∼50% from 3- to 5- months of age in the ΔIg3-MuSK TA. Second, transcriptomic analysis shows that the expression profile of SCs from uninjured adult muscle is remarkably similar to that observed in WT muscle 1 day post injury (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>;(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Shcherbina et al., 2020</xref>). Third, the accelerated muscle regeneration following injury observed in ΔIg3-MuSK mice mirrors that observed in other settings where SCs are activated, such as deletion of the myofiber-derived quiescence factor Wnt4 or injury to the contralateral muscle(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Eliazer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Rodgers et al., 2014</xref>). This accelerated regeneration likely reflects a more rapid re-entry into the cell cycle(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Siegel et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>MuSK plays a selective role in maintaining adult SC quiescence. SCs are highly dynamic and assume multiple critical states including, quiescence, activation, proliferation, fusion into myofibers, and re-entry into quiescence. Adult SCs expressing ΔIg3-MuSK SC break quiescence and become activated, but their ability to proliferate and fuse into myofibers is preserved. By 5- months of age the ΔIg3-MuSK EDL has increased length, adding an average of 40 myonuclei/myofiber compared to WT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a, c</xref>). As EDL myofibers contain only ∼7 SCs each, the activated SCs must undergo at least 3 rounds of cell division over this time span, followed by fusion into the myofiber. These traits distinguish the MuSK-BMP pathway from many other mechanisms mediating quiescence. For example, manipulation of Notch, Foxo3 or Pten signaling breaks quiescence, but the SC pool is depleted and self-renewal is impaired(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">García-Prat et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gioftsidi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Yue et al., 2017</xref>). Disruption of the M- and N- cadherins or Wnt4a from the myofiber results in expansion of the SC pool, but no fusion or changes in myofiber diameter were reported(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Eliazer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Goel et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, interfering with the ColV-Calcitonin receptor pathway in SCs leads to spontaneous differentiation and fusion, but SCs were fewer and myofibers smaller following damage(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baghdadi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that MuSK-BMP signaling restrains SC activation, but is dispensable for proliferation and productive fusion into uninjured myofibers. Notably, all three of these activities are critical for SCs to contribute to the muscle growth and improved strength such as observed here. Importantly, following injury myofiber size and SC complement are restored to WT levels, indicating that MuSK-BMP signaling is not required for regeneration, to maintain stemness, or for re-entry into the SC niche. Moreover, the normal fiber size and SC complement observed in germ line mutants at 3 months indicates that the MuSK-BMP pathway does not play a discernable role in SCs in developing and young mice, a conclusion supported by the results with conditional expression of ΔIg3-MuSK in SCs starting at 3 months (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Finally, the adult-selective role of the MuSK-BMP pathway is distinct from myostatin (GDF8), which has profound effects on SCs proliferation and hyperplasia during early postnatal development, but does not regulate SC quiescence in adult muscle(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lee, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Murphy et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The MuSK-BMP pathway represents an attractive therapeutic target to combat muscle wasting and promote regeneration. Muscle size and function are compromised in settings including muscular dystrophies, cancer cachexia, disuse atrophy, age-related sarcopenia, and GLP-1 agonist use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bikou et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chamberlain and Olwin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ham et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Shavlakadze et al., 2019</xref>). Muscle growth is limited by myonuclear complement(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cramer et al., 2020</xref>). SCs are present in these situations and represent a potential source of new myonuclei. However, the SCs in disease and aging are often in deep quiescence due to degradation of the niche and the accumulation of negative signals countering activation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Brunet et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cosgrove et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kimmel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, MuSK levels are increased in mouse models of denervation and Myasthenia Gravis as well as in aging humans, suggesting that full length MuSK may generate one such negative signal(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bowen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lehallier et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Mori et al., 2023</xref>). Targeting this pathway could also promote longevity and healthy aging. Reducing MuSK-BMP signaling to promote SC activation is an attractive, highly specific target given the restricted tissue distribution of MuSK(Tabula Muris Consortium et al., 2018), combined with the precise modulation of the Ig3 domain as demonstrated genetically in this report. Pharmacological targeting could be achieved, for example, by splice-modulating antisense oligonucleotides or antibodies directed against the MuSK Ig3 domain. The normal life span of mice with germ line expression of ΔIg3-MuSK suggests a favorable safety profile for such therapeutic interventions.</p>

<title>Myofiber cross sectional size</title>
<p>ΔIg3-MuSK mouse muscles used for myofiber cross sectional size analysis were from perfusion fixed animals and <italic>Pax7<sup>CreERT2</sup>;R26R<sup>LSL-tdTomato</sup>;MuSK-Ig3<sup>loxP/loxP</sup></italic> muscles used for myofiber cross sectional size analysis were from flash frozen muscle. Images of TA muscle sections immunostained with anti-laminin antibody (L9393, Sigma-Aldrich) and captured using a Nikon E800 fluorescent microscope or with a Zeiss LSM 800 Confocal Microscope with a 20X objective (images within the same experiment were captured using the same microscope). Images were processed using MyoVision software to determine minimum Feret diameter measurements for each myofiber(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Briguet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Wen et al., 2018</xref>). Output images were manually examined, and any misidentified fibers were excluded, 650-1800 fibers examined per mouse. Representative images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 800 Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope with a 20x objective. The average myofiber min Feret diameter for each mouse was used for statistical analysis using an unpaired t-test in GraphPad Prism 9. Analysis was done blinded.</p>

<title>Intact myofiber isolation</title>
<p>Extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle was dissected and enzymatically digested in 400-U/mL collagenase II (Worthington) at 37°C for 1.5 hours. Collagenase was inactivated by the addition of DMEM supplemented with 15% horse serum. Flame-polished Pasteur pipettes were used to agitate and separate individual myofibers, which were then immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes, followed by 3 washes of PBS prior to any immunostaining.</p>

<title>Intact myofiber myonuclei and length quantification</title>
<p>After immunostaining myofibers (see “Immunohistochemistry” methods), z-stacked tiled images were taken of whole myofibers with a Nikon Ti2-E Widefield Fluorescence Microscope using Zen software (blue edition, Zeiss). The automated measurement function was used to quantify all DAPI stained nuclei as well as total myofiber length.</p>

<sec id="s5h">
<title>Grip Strength</title>
<p>Grip strength analysis was done to assess front-limb muscle strength of WT and ΔIg3-MuSK male and female mice at 3 and 5.5 months of age. Mice were lifted by their tail and guided to use both front paws to grasp the pull-bar assembly connected to the grip strength meter (Columbus Instruments). The mouse was pulled away from the sensor until their grip on the bar was broken and the peak amount of force in kilograms per unit force (KGF) was recorded. Five trials were performed sequentially per animal and then averaged together and normalized to mouse weight. Analysis was done blinded to genotype.</p>

<title>Muscle injury &amp; EdU delivery</title>
<p>Briefly, 5-month-old mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (induced with 4% isoflurane, maintained at ∼1.5% isoflurane and 400 mL O2 per min) and placed on a temperature-controlled platform to maintain core body temperature between 35°C and 37°C. Injury to the left TA muscle was induced by first piercing the muscle with a 28-gauge needle ∼15 times followed by injection of 50<italic>μ</italic>L of 1.2% BaCl2 in PBS. To relieve pain, mice were treated with 0.5mg/mL of Buprenorphine Sustained-Release (Bup-SR) at the time of injury. For EdU labeling, mice received 50mg/kg 5- ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU, Thermo Fisher) in PBS by intraperitoneal injection 24 hr before harvest. Injured muscle was harvested at 3-, 5-, 7-, 14-, 22-, and 29-days post injury (dpi). Control muscle from uninjured mice was also collected.</p>

<title>Satellite cell isolation and FACS sorting</title>
<p>To prevent artificial activation of quiescent SCs during isolation, mice were perfusion fixed with 0.5% PFA and then muscle was digested with collagenase II (Worthington) as described(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Yue et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Yue and Cheung, 2020</xref>). Pooled hind limb muscles were used for analysis of SCs from resting muscle and pooled TA muscles were used for analysis of SCs from regenerating muscle 5 dpi. The resulting cell suspension was blocked with DMEM + 15% horse serum (Cytiva sh30074) for 10 min at 4°C with rocking. Cells were then incubated for 45 min at 4°C with rocking with 1:250 of each of the following antibodies: Negative selection markers: BV421 Rat anti-mouse anti-CD31 (562939, BD Biosciences), and BV421 Rat anti-mouse CD45 (563890, BD Biosciences), BV421 Rat anti-Mouse Ly-6aA/E (562729, BD Biosciences); positive selection marker: Mouse anti-integrin alpha 7 Alexa fluor 647 (FAB3518R, R&amp;D Systems). Cells were rinsed, resuspended in PBS and sorted using a BD FACSAria IIu cell sorter equipped with 355nm, 407nm, 488nm, 561nm, and 633nm lasers. The machine was optimized for purity and viability. UltaComp eBeads were used for calibration (01-222-41, Thermo Scientific). Total RNA was isolated from FACS-sorted SCs using a miRNeasy FFPE Kit (Qiagen) as described(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Yue and Cheung, 2020</xref>).</p>

<title>Nanostring nCounter assay</title>
<p>RNA from SCs of 5 - 5.5-month-old resting muscle (n=6/genotype) was isolated as outlined above and samples from all mice were kept separate. Gene expression was analyzed with a Nanostring nCounter Stem Cell Characterization panel (NanoString Technologies). Multiplex gene expression with 770 genes was performed by measurement of the abundance of each mRNA transcript of interest using multiplexed hybridization and digital readouts of fluorescent bar-coded probes that are hybridized to each transcript. Hybridization of samples was performed, and the obtained products were run according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Data were collected on the nCounter Sprint profiler and further analyzed by <sub>ROSA</sub>LIND® (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://rosalind.bio/">https://rosalind.bio/</ext-link>), with a HyperScale architecture developed by ROSALIND, Inc. (San Diego, CA). Read Distribution percentages, violin plots, identity heatmaps, and sample MDS plots were generated as part of the QC step.</p>
<p>ROSALIND® follows the nCounter® Advanced Analysis protocol of dividing counts within a lane by the geometric mean of the normalizer probes from the same lane. Housekeeping probes to be used for normalization are selected based on the geNorm algorithm as implemented in the NormqPCR R library(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Perkins et al., 2012</xref>). Fold changes and p values are calculated using the fast method as described in the nCounter® Advanced Analysis 2.0 User Manual. P-value adjustment is performed using the Benjamini-Hochberg method of estimating false discovery rates (FDR). Clustering of genes for the final heatmap of differentially expressed genes was done using the Partitioning Around Medoids method using the fpc R library(Hennig, n.d.) that takes into consideration the direction and type of all signals on a pathway, and the position, role and type of every gene. Hypergeometric distribution was used to analyze the enrichment of pathways, gene ontology, domain structure, and other ontologies. The topGO R library(Alexa and Rahnenfuhrer, n.d.) was used to determine local similarities and dependencies between GO terms in order to perform Elim pruning correction. Several database sources were referenced for enrichment analysis, including Interpro(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Mitchell et al., 2019</xref>), NCBI(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Geer et al., 2010</xref>), MsigDB(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Liberzon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>), REACTOME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fabregat et al., 2018</xref>), WikiPathways(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Slenter et al., 2018</xref>). Enrichment was calculated relative to a set of background genes relevant for the experiment. Gene expression data was exported and heat maps were generated in GraphPad prism 9.</p>

<title>RNA-sequencing analysis of SC dataset</title>
<p>An RNA-sequencing dataset (GSE121589) from NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus database was analyzed(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Shcherbina et al., 2020</xref>). This data set includes bulk RNA-seq of isolated SCs from young (2-3 mo. old) and aged (22-24 mo. old) muscle from uninjured and from regenerating muscle at 1, 3, 5, and 7 dpi. The raw data files were reprocessed by trimming adapters and low quality reads using TrimGalore! followed by alignment to the Ensembl GRCm38 mouse genome using HiSat2(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). StringTie was used to determine the transcripts per million (TPM) of genes in each sample and DESeq2 was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Love et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Pertea et al., 2016</xref>). Expression of DE genes identified with the nCounter panel were assessed. Highly regulated genes between quiescent SCs (day 0) and early-activated SCs (day 1 and 3 post injury) were indicated by significant (&lt;0.05) change in TPM.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study provides <bold>solid</bold> support for the participation of the BMP-binding domain of MuSK, a tyrosine kinase mostly known for its role at the neuromuscular junction, in the maintenance and activation of muscle stem cells (SCs). These mononucleated cells, located between the muscle fiber basal lamina and its plasma membrane, are normally quiescent, but following muscle damage, become activated, proliferate, and mediate muscle regeneration. These cells are known to respond to a variety of signaling pathways, but this study makes the case for BMP acting via binding to MuSK in maintaining the quiescent state.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Madigan et al. assembled an interesting study investigating the role of the MuSK-BMP signaling pathway in maintaining adult mouse muscle stem cell (MuSC) quiescence and muscle function before and after trauma. Using a full body and MuSC-specific genetic knockout system, they demonstrate that MuSK is expressed on MuSCs and that eliminating the BMP binding domain from the MuSK gene (i.e., MuSK-IgG KO) in mice at homeostasis leads to reduced PAX7+ cells, increased myonuclear number, and increase myofiber size, which may be due to a deficit in maintaining quiescence. Additionally, after BaCl2 injury, MuSK-IgG KO mice display accelerated repair after 7 days post-injury (dpi) in males only. Finally, RNA profiling using nCounter technology showed that MuSK-IgG KO MuSCs express genes that may be associated with the activated state.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, the biology regulating MuSC quiescence is still relatively unexplored, and thus, this work provides a new mechanism controlling this process. The experiments discussed in the paper are technically sound with great complementary mouse models (full body versus tissue-specific mouse KO) used to validate their hypothesis. Additionally, the paper is well written with all the necessary information in the legends, methods, and figures being reported.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the data largely supports the author's conclusions, I do have a few points to consider when reading this paper.</p>
<p>(1) For Figure 1, while I appreciate the author's confirming MuSK RNA and protein in MuSCs, I do think they should (a) quantify the RNA using qPCR and (b) determine the percentage of MuSCs expressing MuSK protein in their single fiber system in multiple biological replicates. This information will help us understand if MuSK is expressed in 1/10 or 10/10 PAX7-expressing MuSCs. Also, it will help place their phenotypes into the right context, especially when considering how much of the PAX7-pool is expressing MuSK from the beginning.</p>
<p>(2) Throughout the paper the argument is made that MuSK-IgG KO (full body and MuSC-specific KOs) are more activated and/or break quiescence more readily, but there is no attempt to test directly. Therefore, the authors should consider measuring the activation dynamics (i.e., break from quiescence) of MuSCs directly (EdU assays or live-cell imaging) in culture and/or in muscle in vivo (EdU assays) using their various genetic mouse models.</p>
<p>(3) For Figure 2, given that mice are considered adults by 3 months, it is really surprising how just two months later they are starting to see a phenotype (i.e., reduced PAX7-cells, increased number of myonuclei, and increased myofiber size)-which correlates with getting older. Given that aged MuSCs have activation defects (i.e., stuck somewhere in the quiescence cycle), a pending question is whether their phenotype gets stronger in aged mice, like 18-24 months. If yes, the argument that this pathway should be used in a therapeutic sense would be strengthened.</p>
<p>(4) For Figure 4, the same question as in point (2), the increase in fiber sizes by 7dpi in MuSK-IgG KO males is minimal (going from ~23 to 27 by eye) and no difference at a later time point when compared to WT mice. However, if older mice are used (18-24 months old) - which are known to have repair deficits-will the regenerative phenotype in MuSK-IgG KO mice be more substantial and longer lasting?</p>
<p>(5) For Figure 6, this gene set is not glaringly obvious as being markers of MuSC activation (i.e., no MyoD), so it's hard for the readers to know if this gene set is truly an activation signature. Also, the Shcherbina et al. data presented as a column with * being up or down (i.e. differentially expressed) is not helpful, since you don't know whether those mRNAs in that dataset are going up with the activation process. Addressing this point as well as my point (1) will further strengthen the author's conclusions about the MuSK-IgG KO MuSCs not being able to maintain quiescence as effectively.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The work by Madigan et al. provides evidence that the signaling of BMPs via the Ig3 domain of MuSK plays a role during muscle postnatal development and regeneration, ultimately resulting in enhanced contractile force generation in the absence of the MuSK Ig3 domain. They demonstrate that MuSK is expressed in satellite cells initially post-isolation of muscle single fibers both in WT and whole-body deletion of the BMP binding domain of MuSK (ΔIg3-MuSK). In mice, ΔIg3-MuSK results in increased muscle fiber size, a reduction in Pax7+ cells, and increased muscle contractile force in 5-month-old, but not 3-month-old, mice. These data are complemented by a model in which the kinetics of regeneration appear to be accelerated at early time points. Of note, the authors demonstrate muscle tibialis anterior (TA) weights and fiber feret are increased in a Pax7CreERT2;MuSK-Ig3loxp/loxp model in which satellite cells specifically lack the MuSK BMP binding domain. Finally, using Nanostring transcriptional the authors identified a short list of genes that differ between the WT and ΔIg3-MuSK SCs. These data provide the field with new evidence of signaling pathways that regulate satellite cell activation/quiescence in the context of skeletal muscle development and regeneration.</p>
<p>On the whole, the findings in this paper are well supported, however additional validation of key satellite cell markers and data analysis need to be conducted given the current claims.</p>
<p>(1) The Pax7CreERT2;MuSK-Ig3loxp/loxp model is the appropriate model to conduct studies to assess satellite cell involvement in MuSK/BMP regulation. Validation of changes to muscle force production is currently absent using this model, as is quantification of Pax7+ tdT+ cells in 5-month muscle. Given that MuSK is also expressed on mature myofibers at NMJs, these data would further inform the conclusions proposed in the paper.</p>
<p>(2) All Pax7 quantification in the paper would benefit from high magnification images including staining for laminin demonstrating the cells are under the basal lamina.</p>
<p>(3) The nanostring dataset could be further analyzed and clarified. In Figure 6b, it is not initially apparent what genes are upregulated or downregulated in young and aged SCs and how this compares with your data. Pathway analysis geared toward genes involved in the TGFb superfamily would be informative.</p>
<p>(4) Characterizing MuSK expression on perfusion-fixed EDL fibers would be more conclusive to determine if MuSK is expressed in quiescent SCs. Additional characterization using MyoD, MyoG, and Fos staining of SCs on EDL fibers would help inform on their state of activation/quiescent.</p>
<p>(5) Finally, the treatment of fibers in the presence or absence of recombinant BMP proteins would inform the claims of the paper.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Understanding the molecular regulation of muscle stem cell quiescence. The authors evaluated the role of the MuSK-BMP pathway in regulating adult SC quiescence by the deletion of the BMP-binding MuSK Ig3 domain ('ΔIg3-MuSK').</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A novel mouse model to interrogate muscle stem cell molecular regulators. The authors have developed a nice mouse model to interrogate the role of MuSK signaling in muscle stem cells and myofibers and have unique tools to do this.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Only minor technical questions remain and there is a need for additional data to support the conclusions.</p>
<p>(1) The authors claim that dIg3-MuSK satellite cells break quiescence and start fusing, based on the reduction of Pax7+ and increase of nuclei/fiber (Fig 2-3), and maybe the gene expression (Fig6). However, direct evidence is needed to support these findings such as quantifying quiescent (Pax7+Ki67-) or activated (Pax7+Ki67+) satellite cells (and maybe proliferating progenitors Pax7-Ki67+) in the dIg3-MuSK muscle.</p>
<p>(2) It is not clear if the MuSK-BMP pathway is required to maintain satellite cell quiescence, by the end of the regeneration (29dpi), how Pax7+ numbers are comparable to the WT (Fig4d). I would expect to have less Pax7+, as in uninjured muscle. Can the authors evaluate this in more detail?</p>
<p>(2) Figure 4 claims that regeneration is accelerated, but to claim this at a minimum they need to look at MYH3+ fibers, in addition to fiber size.</p>
<p>(3) The Pax7 specific dIg3-MuSK (Fig5) is very exciting. However, it will be important to quantify the Pax7+ number. Could the authors check the reduction of Pax7+ in this model since it would confirm the importance of MuSK in quiescence?</p>
<p>(3) Rescue of the BMP pathway in the model would be further supportive of the authors' findings.</p>
<p>(4) Is the stem cell pool maintained long term in the deleted dIg3-MuSK SCs? Or would they be lost with extended treatment since they are reduced at the 5-month experiments? This is an important point and should be considered/discussed relevant to thinking about these data therapeutically.</p>
<p>(5) Without the Pax7-specific targeting, when you target dIg3-MuSK in the entire muscle, what happens to the neuromuscular nuclei?</p>
<p>(6) Why were differences seen in males and not females? Is XIST downregulation occurring in both sexes? Could the authors explain these findings in more detail?</p>

<p>The quantification is a reasonable point; however, we don’t believe that this information is necessary for supporting the interpretation of the findings.</p>

<p>We agree that the potential role of the MuSK-BMP pathway in aged SCs is of import and could shed new light on SC dynamics in this context. However, we note that the activation observed between 3-5 months results in improved muscle quality (increased myofiber size and grip strength), which is opposite of what is observed with aging. We agree that activating the MuSK-BMP pathway in aged animals has the potential to activate SCs, promote muscle growth and counter sarcopenia.  Pharmacological and genetic approaches to test that question are underway, but given the time frame they are beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p>

In developing mice, ΔIg3-MuSK results in increased muscle fiber size, a reduction in Pax7+ cells, and increased muscle contractile force in 5-month-old, but not 3-month-old, mice. These data are complemented by a model in which the kinetics of regeneration appear to be accelerated at early time points.

</disp-quote>
<p>As reported in the manuscript, we observed increased myofiber size, length and TA weight in the conditional mutants at five months of age. We did not assess grip strength in those experiments.</p>
<p>We demonstrated highly efficient MuSK Ig3-domain recombination by PCR analysis of FACS-sorted SCs from these conditional mutants (Supplemental Fig. S3). However, while we checked for Pax7+ tdT+ cells in 5-month SCs, we did not quantify this finding.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) All Pax7 quantification in the paper would benefit from high magnification images including staining for laminin demonstrating the cells are under the basal lamina.</p>

<p>The point is reasonable, we observed that these Pax7+ cells were under the basal lamina, but we did not acquire images at higher magnification.</p>

Our current interpretation of the findings is that quiescence is broken in SCs in uninjured muscle, but that ‘stemness’ is preserved, allowing for efficient muscle regeneration and restoration of the SC pool. Whether such properties reflect SC heterogeneity (as suggested in the comments of the other reviewers) and/or different states along a continuum is of particular interest and will be the focus of future studies.</p>

<p>(2) Figure 4 claims that regeneration is accelerated, but to claim this at a minimum they need to look at MYH3+ fibers, in addition to fiber size.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did not examine MYH3+ fibers in this study. However, we did observe increased in Pax7+ cells at 5dpi (male and female) as well as larger myofiber size (Feret diameter) at 7dpi in the male animals.  In addition, the panels in Figure 4 b,c (H&amp;E and laminin, respectively) showing accelerated differentiation were selected to be representative of the experimental group.</p>

<p>(3) The Pax7 specific dIg3-MuSK (Fig5) is very exciting. However, it will be important to quantify the Pax7+ number. Could the authors check the reduction of Pax7+ in this model since it would confirm the importance of MuSK in quiescence?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In Figure 5c, we assessed the number of Pax7+ cells in the conditional mutant during the course of regeneration (at 3, 5, 7, 14, 22 and 29 dpi). As discussed above, these results confirmed the findings of the constitutive mutant (reduction of Pax7+ cells in uninjured 5-month-old muscle) as well as showing the increased number at 5dpi and return to WT levels at 29 dpi.</p>

<p>(3) Rescue of the BMP pathway in the model would be further supportive of the authors' findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This point is valid. In a parallel study examining the role of the MuSK-BMP pathway at the NMJ, we have observed that BMP+/- (hypomorphs) recapitulate key phenotypes observed in DIg3-MuSK  NMJs (Fish et al., bioRxiv, 2023). This point will be included in the Revision.</p>
<p>(4) Is the stem cell pool maintained long term in the deleted dIg3-MuSK SCs? Or would they be lost with extended treatment since they are reduced at the 5-month experiments? This is an important point and should be considered/discussed relevant to thinking about these data therapeutically.</p>
<p>We agree that this is an important point for future studies.</p>

<p>(5) Without the Pax7-specific targeting, when you target dIg3-MuSK in the entire muscle, what happens to the neuromuscular nuclei?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A manuscript describing the phenotype of the NMJ in DIg3-MuSK constitutive mice is in bioRxiv (Fish et al., 2024) and is in Revision at another journal.  We anticipate discussing the findings in the Revised version of the current manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Why were differences seen in males and not females? Is XIST downregulation occurring in both sexes? Could the authors explain these findings in more detail?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The male and female difference in myofiber size is of interest.  The nanostring experiments,  which showed the XIST reduction, were only performed in male mice.</p>
