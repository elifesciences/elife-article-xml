<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Although HIV-1 integration sites are considered to favor active transcription units in the human genome, high-resolution analysis of individual HIV-1 integration sites have shown that the virus can integrate in a variety of host genomic locations, including non-genic regions. The invisible infection by HIV-1 integrating into non-genic regions challenging the traditional understanding of HIV-1 integration site selection are rather more problematic as they are selected to preserve in the host genome during prolonged antiretroviral therapies. Here, we showed that HIV-1 targets R-loops, a genomic structure made up of DNA–RNA hybrids, for integration. HIV-1 initiates the formation of R-loops in both genic and non-genic regions of the host genome and preferentially integrates into R-loop-rich regions. Using a cell model that can independently control transcriptional activity and R-loop formation, we demonstrated that the formation of R-loops directs HIV-1 integration targeting sites. We also found that HIV-1 integrase proteins physically bind to the host genomic R-loops. These findings provide fundamental insights into the mechanisms of retroviral integration and the new strategies of antiretroviral therapy against HIV-1 latent infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Retroviruses cause permanent infection in the host by integrating their reverse-transcribed viral genome into the host genome. Retroviral integration considerably impacts a wide range of biological phenomena, including the persistence of fatal human diseases and the shaping of metazoan evolution (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></italic>). Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 is a representative retrovirus that underlies the global burden of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></italic>). The chromosomal landscape of HIV-1 integration plays a critical role in proviral gene expression, persistence of integrated proviruses, and prognosis of antiretroviral therapy (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></italic>). Integration into the host genome is not random and displays distinct preferences for gene-dense regions, where active transcription occurs (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></italic>), by interacting host factors such as transcription activators, epigenetic marker binding proteins and super enhancers (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></italic>). However, transcription activity is not the sole determinant of the HIV-1 integration site landscape (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></italic>). For instance, the most favored region of HIV-1 integration is an intergenic locus, and despite the lower probability of integration, HIV-1 proviruses are observed in non-genic regions in the genomes of infected individuals (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></italic>). This indicates the possibility of there being an undiscovered mechanism or determinant that composes the correct genomic environment for HIV-1 integration.</p>
<p>An R-loop is a three-stranded nucleic acid structure that comprises a DNA–RNA hybrid and displaced strand of DNA, and has long been considered a transcription byproduct (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></italic>). R-loops in cellular genomes are enriched in actively transcribed genes as they occur naturally during transcription (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></italic>), but R-loop formation is not limited to gene body regions and is widespread in the genome (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></italic>). As a result of <italic>in trans</italic> R-loop formation, R-loops are also abundant in non-genic regions, such as intergenic regions, repetitive sequences, including transposable elements, centromeres, or telomeres (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></italic>), independently of transcription activity of the genes harboring the R-loops. Although R-loops are identified as critical intermediates and regulators in a number of biological processes (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></italic>), the dynamics and the role played by cellular R-loops in pathological contexts remain unrevealed.</p>
<p>R-loops are important contributors molding the genomic environment and spatial organization of the cellular genome, and can potentially take a novel role in host-pathogen interaction. In the cellular genome, R-loops relieve superhelical stresses and are often associated with open chromatin marks and active enhancers (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></italic>), which are also distributed over HIV-1 integration sites (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></italic>). In the case of transcription-induced R-loop formation, a guanine-quadruplex (G4) structure can be generated in the non-template DNA strand of the R-loop (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></italic>). A recent study has shown that G4 DNA can influence both productive and latent HIV-1 integration (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></italic>). In addition, R-loops are prevalent non-canonical B-form DNA structures (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></italic>) and intermediates between B-form DNA and A-form RNA conformation (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></italic>), which have recently been disclosed to be the conformational characteristics of the target DNA during retroviral integration (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></italic>). The accumulated evidence implicates that host genomic R-loops are undiscovered host factor in HIV-1 integration site selection mechanism, which dynamically interact with the host genomic environment.</p>
<p>Here, we showed a notable role of R-loops in the interaction between HIV-1 and its host, specifically in HIV-1 integration. HIV-1-infection induces host cellular R-loop formation and the R-loop rich regions of the host genome are preferred by HIV-1 integration. HIV-1 integrase proteins showed considerable binding affinity to nucleic acid substrate comprising R-loop structures. Our results suggest that R-loops are an important composer of host genomic environment for HIV-1 integration site determination.</p>

<title>Host genomic R-loops accumulate by HIV-infection</title>
<p>To investigate the relationship between HIV-1 infection and host cellular R-loops, we first analyzed R-loop dynamics in different types of cells infected with HIV-1 at early post-infection time points using DNA–RNA immunoprecipitation followed by cDNA conversion coupled to high-throughput sequencing (DRIPc-seq) using a DNA–RNA hybrid-specific binding antibody, anti-S9.6 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></italic>). HeLa cells, primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from two individual donors and CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>-</sup> T cell lymphoma Jurkat cell line were infected with VSV-G-pseudotyped HIV-1-EGFP and harvested at 0, 3, 6, and 12 h post infection (hpi) for DRIPc-seq library construction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">S1A-C Fig</xref>.). Our DRIPc-seq analysis yielded loci specific R-loop signals at the referenced R-loop-positive loci (RPL13A and CALM3) and an R-loop-negative locus (SNRPN) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></italic>) that were both strand-specific and highly sensitive to pre-immunoprecipitation in vitro RNase H treatment, in HeLa cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> and Jurkat T cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Table S1</xref>-<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls3">3</xref>). Notably, the number of DRIPc-seq peaks mapped to the human reference genome increased remarkably during early post infection of HIV-1 (3 and 6 hpi for HeLa cells and 6 and 12 hpi for CD4<sup>+</sup> and Jurkat T cells; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Most of the peaks mapped in cells harvested at 0 hpi were commonly found in all other samples, but a significant numbers of unique peaks were observed after infection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>

<p>In addition to our DRIPc-seq data analysis, we used different biochemical approaches to examine R-loop accumulation after HIV-1 infection in HeLa cells. First, R-loop accumulation in HIV-1-infected cells was observed using DNA–RNA hybrid dot blots with the anti-S9.6 antibodies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). The dot intensity increased significantly upon HIV-1 infection at 6 hpi and the enhanced R-loop signals on dot blots of HIV-1-infected cells were highly sensitive to <italic>in vitro</italic> treatment with RNase H (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). This result was highly consistent with our DRIPc-seq data analysis results in HIV-1-infected HeLa cells.</p>
<p>Subsequently, we observed HIV-1-induced R-loops using an immunofluorescence assay by probing HIV-1-infected or non-infected control cells with S9.6 antibody at 6 hpi (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>, left). The nuclear fluorescence signal associated with the R-loops after subtracting the nucleolar signal was significantly enhanced in cells infected with HIV-1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>, right). We validated and quantified HIV-1-infection induced R-loop formation on the host genome in a genome-site specific manner by using DRIP followed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (DRIP-qPCR). In this experiment, the S9.6 signal was determined for three and two HIV-1-induced-R-loop-positive (P1, P2, and P3) and -negative regions (N1 and N2), respectively, where were defined by DRIPc-seq data analysis (S2A-E Fig.). We detected significantly increased R-loop signals that are highly sensitive to RNase H treatment of pre-immunoprecipitates in the P1, P2, and P3 regions of HIV-1-infected cells at 6 hpi compared to those in the cells harvested at 0 hpi (S3A Fig.). However, the HIV-1-induced R-loop-negative regions, N1 and N2, did not show significant R-loop accumulations (S3A Fig.).</p>
<p>Importantly, the R-loop signal was enriched even in cells infected with HIV-1 when the reverse transcription or integration of HIV-1 is blocked by enzyme inhibitors like Nevirapine (NVP) or Raltegravir (RAL), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">S3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">S3C Fig</xref>.). This result indicates that the enrichment of R-loop signals in cells are originated from the host genome but not by DNA-RNA hybrid formation during the viral life cycle or transcriptional burst from integrated HIV-1 proviruses. In addition, we confirmed that nearly 100% of DRIPc-seq reads from HIV-1-infected HeLa, CD4<sup>+</sup> and Jurkat T cells were aligned to the host cellular genome, but not on that of HIV-1 (S3D Fig.). Together, these data demonstrate that HIV-1 infection induced host genomic R-loop formation at early post-infection.</p>

<title>R-loops accumulation after HIV-1 infection are widely distributed in both genic and non-genic regions</title>
<p>To investigate the distribution of cellular genomic R-loops during HIV-1 infection, we conducted a genome-wide analysis of our DRIPc-seq data.

<p>This suggests that R-loops induced by HIV-1 infection occupy a genomic region larger than that of the R-loops presents without HIV-1 infection. We observed a significant accumulation of R-loops over diverse genomic compartments at the hpi of HIV-1-infection induced R-loop formation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). The presence of R-loops is often correlated with high transcriptional activity, and we found significantly high proportion of DRIPc-seq peaks enrichment upon HIV-1 infection in the gene body regions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). However, we also observed enrichment of HIV-1-infection induced DRIPc-seq peaks proportion mapped to intergenic or repeat regions, including short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs), long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), and long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons, where transcription is typically repressed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Although the expression of repetitive elements is mostly repressed during normal cellular activities, HIV-1 infection could activate endogenous retroviral promoters (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></italic>). To investigate the possibility that R-loop induction in gene-silent regions is associated with transcriptome changes during HIV-1 infection, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) for HIV-1-infected HeLa cells at 0, 3, 6, and 12 hpi. Consistent with previous reports, we observed an increase in the expression levels of repetitive elements at later time points post-infection (S4A Fig.; 12 hpi). In contrast, we found that the expression levels of SINEs, LINEs, and LTRs were even lower at both 3 and 6 hpi compared to 0 hpi while HIV-1-induced R-loops were significantly accumulated, compared to 0 hpi (S4A Fig.). We further examined the expression profile of genes containing R-loop in HeLa cells. The expression profile of genes harboring HIV-1-induced R-loops in their gene bodies showed very weak correlations with the signals of DRIPc-seq peaks at 3 hpi (Pearson’s r = 0.21, P = 1.08 × 10<sup>-84</sup>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) and at 6 hpi samples (Pearson’s r = −0.34, P = 2.40 × 10<sup>-228</sup>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), which implies that the unique R-loop peaks upon HIV-1 infection do not engage with transcriptional burst. In agreement with our DRIPc-seq and global RNA-seq data analysis, the expression level of the genes harboring HIV-1-infection induced R-loops, which were quantified by DRIP-qPCR (S3A Fig.), were not significantly affected by HIV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">S4B Fig</xref>. and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls4">Table S4</xref>). Together, our data demonstrate that host cellular R-loop accumulation upon HIV-1 infection are widely distributed in both genic and non-genic regions and are not necessarily correlate with the expression levels of the genes harboring the R-loops.</p>

<title>HIV-1 integration sites are enriched at systemically induced sequence-specific R-loop regions in cell model</title>
<p>HIV-1 completes its infection by integrating its viral genome into the host’s through dynamic interaction with the host genome (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></italic>). Besides, as HIV-1 infection induced R-loop accumulation at early post infection hours when HIV-1 genome are imported into nucleus and integration may initiate (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></italic>), we hypothesized that host genomic R-loops play a role in HIV-1 integration, and possibly in integration site selection. To systemically and directly assess the relationship between host genomic R-loops and HIV-1 integration in a genome-site-specific manner, we adapted and modified an elegantly designed episomal system that induces sequence specific R-loops through DOX-inducible promoters (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></italic>). To most closely mimic the presence R-loop in host cellular genome, we subcloned the R-loop-forming portion of the mouse gene encoding AIRN (mAIRN) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></italic>) or non-R-loop-forming ECFP sequence with a DOX-inducible promoter into the piggyBac transposon vector and co-expressed the piggyBac transposase in HeLa cells. These R-loop forming (mAIRN) or non-R-loop forming sequence (ECFP) are non-human sequences. Therefore, our cell model allows us to induce and quantify R-loop formation at designated genomic region and distinguish the R-loop formation from the endogenous R-loops on the cellular genome, which are not sequence-specific and impossible to control for induction. Moreover, by using this system we can quantify R-loop-dependent site-specific HIV-1 integration events at the designated regions, which can also be distinguished from HIV-1 integration event at endogenous host genomic loci. We designated the pool of cells with the R-loop forming sequence (mAIRN) inserted into its genome as “pgR-rich (piggyBac R-loop rich)” cell line and the pool of cells with the non-R-loop forming sequence (ECFP) inserted into its genome as “pgR-poor (piggyBac R-loop poor)” cell line (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>).</p>

<p>A similar number of the copies of piggyBac transposon was successfully delivered to the genome of each cell line (S5A Fig.), and DOX treatment strongly induced the transcriptional activity of mAIRN or ECFP without affecting the transcription of endogenous loci in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">S5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">S5C Fig</xref>.). Although the transcription of mAIRN or ECFP was strongly induced upon DOX treatment, the activity did not exceed that of endogenous loci in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">S5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">S5E Fig</xref>.). While two cell lines showed comparable level of DOX-inducible transcription activity at the designated sequences (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), only pgR-rich cells exhibited robust RNase H-sensitive stable R-loop formation upon DOX treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, mAIRN). By contrast, R-loops were weakly formed in the pgR-poor cells where non-R-loop forming sequence (ECFP) inserted into its genome (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, ECFP).</p>
<p>To examine whether the formation of ‘extra’ R-loops in the host genome influence HIV-1-infection to the host cells, we infected both cell lines with VSV-G-pseudotyped HIV-1-luciferase viruses and examined the luciferase activity. Interestingly, we found that pgR-rich cells showed significantly high luciferase activity only when R-loops were induced by DOX treatment, whereas pgR-poor cells showed comparable luciferase activity regardless of transcription activation by DOX treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). We conducted HIV-1 integration site sequencing in HIV-1-infected pgR-poor and pgR-rich cells to directly quantify site-specific integration events at sequence-specific R-loop regions. Remarkably, integration events were significantly higher in pgR-rich cells only when R-loops were induced by DOX treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). However, HIV-1 integration frequency within non-R-loop forming sequence in pgR-poor cells remained very low, even with transcription activation by DOX treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). HIV-1 integration frequency was enriched at the vicinity of R-loop forming regions in pgR-rich cell line upon DOX treatment, but the enrichment was not observed in pgR-poor cells that does not form stable R-loops even after transcription activation by DOX treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3F</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3G</xref>). This cell-based R-loop inducing system with independent control over transcription and R-loop formation enabled the direct measurement of HIV-1 integration events at the defined R-loop regions, and the results indicate that host genomic R-loops are targeted by HIV-1 integration. Moreover, our data suggest that transcription activity itself is not sufficient for HIV-1 integration site determination, but the formation of R-loops accounts for HIV-1 integration site selection.</p>

<title>Host genomic R-loops are targeted by HIV-1 integration</title>
<p>We attempted to further validate the relationship between R-loops and the HIV-1 integration site selection by global analysis of HIV-1 integration sites on endogenous genomic regions of HIV-1 infected host cells. We performed HIV-1 integration site sequencing in HIV-1 infected HeLa cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> and Jurkat T cells and analyzed the sequencing data combined with our DRIPc-seq data. We counted and compared the number of successfully integrated proviruses in the R-loop regions (the combined genomic regions within 30-kb windows centered on DRIPc-seq peaks from 0, 3, 6, and 12 hpi) to those in non-R-loop forming regions (the total genomic regions outside of the 30-kb windows centered on DRIPc-seq peaks). Notably, we found that approximately three to four times more integration were detected in the R-loop regions as in other genomic regions without R-loops in HeLa cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> and Jurkat T cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Interestingly, the HIV-1 integration sites preferred the center and nearby areas of the R-loops regions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). We observed biases for HIV-1 integration in HIV-1-induced R-loop-positive regions, P2 and P3, where gave highly induced R-loop signal upon HIV-1 infection in DRIPc-seq analysis and DRIP-qPCR (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). By contrast, HIV-1 integration sites were not detected in R-loop-negative regions, N1 and N2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Overall, our results from bioinformatics analysis using different types of naïve host cells infected with HIV-1 are consistent with the idea that the virus has a preference for targeting R-loops for integration (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), and our data suggest R-loops as an important composer of host genomic environment for HIV-1 integration site determination.</p>

<title>HIV-1 integrase physically interacts with R-loops on the host genome</title>
<p>HIV-1 intasome tether to the host genome for its viral cDNA integration. Intasomes consist of HIV-1 viral cDNA and HIV-1 coding protein, integrases. We observed that HIV-1 preferentially integrated into R-loops on the host genome, thus we hypothesized that the HIV-1 integrase protein could directly bind and be recruited to the genomic R-loops. To test this hypothesis, we first investigated whether HIV-1 integrase proteins have physical binding affinity to nucleic acid substrates possessing R-loop structure. Although HIV-1 integrases are DNA and RNA binding proteins (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></italic>), its binding ability towards such three-stranded nucleic acid structure that is composed with a DNA-RNA hybrid like R-loop has not been investigated.

<p>We validated the interaction between cellular genomic R-loops and HIV-1 integrase proteins by DNA–RNA hybrid immunoprecipitation using S9.6 antibodies in FLAG-tagged HIV-1 integrase-expressing HeLa cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Under our experimental conditions, R-loops were reproducibly immunoprecipitated (S6B Fig.) and HIV-1 integrase proteins co-immunoprecipitated with R-loops (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). DNA–RNA hybrids also co-immunoprecipitated with the positive control H3 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></italic>) but not with the negative control LaminA/C and Actin (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></italic>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). To verify the specificity of our co-immunoprecipitation results for R-loops and HIV-1 integrases, we performed DNA–RNA hybrid immunoprecipitation with RNase H treatment (S6C Fig.). The S9.6 signal of immunoprecipitated nucleic acids was highly sensitive to RNase H treatment of pre-immunoprecipitates (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). Accordingly, the blotting signal of the co-immunoprecipitated HIV-1 integrase and H3 proteins was significantly reduced upon RNase H treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). We performed reciprocal immunoprecipitation using an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody and detected immunoprecipitated R-loops using dot blot analysis with anti-S9.6. R-loops were immunoprecipitated by HIV-1 integrase, and the S9.6 signal of immunoprecipitated nucleic acids was highly sensitive to RNase H treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">S6D Fig</xref>.). Subsequently, we attempted to observe the interaction between the R-loops and HIV-1 integrase using a proximity-ligation assay (PLA), in HIV-1-infected cells. We used two antibodies: one that binds to R-loops (anti-S9.6) and another one that binds to GFP-tagged HIV-1 integrase. We detected PLA signals in cells infected with HIV-IN-EGFP virions and in non-infected control cells. PLA signals in non-infected cells were comparable to those in S9.6-alone and GFP-alone single antibody-negative controls; however, PLA signals significantly increased upon HIV-1 infection (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">S6E Fig</xref>.).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we found that HIV-1 preferentially integrates into regions rich in R-loops, suggesting that R-loops are a novel host factor governing HIV-1 integration site selection. In our bioinformatics analysis, host cellular R-loops were induced by HIV-1 infection and widespread over host genomic regions. Using our R-loop-inducible cell models, R-loop formation, not necessarily transcription activity itself, was found to be important for HIV-1 integration site determination. In addition, HIV-1 integrase proteins favored physical binding with R-loops <italic>in vitro</italic>, and they interacted with host genomic R-loops in HIV-1-infected cells. These results demonstrated that HIV-1 exploits and frequently targets the host genomic R-loops for successful integration and infection.</p>
<p>Our data show that HIV-1 targets host genomic R-loops for viral genome integration and its integrase proteins physically interact with genomic R-loops <italic>in vitro</italic> and in cells. This may because the R-loops own an unique nucleic acid conformation of B-form DNA and A-form RNA intermediates, which possess intrinsic preferential binding ability to retroviral intasome (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></italic>). Another possible explanation for why HIV-1 integration shows a preference towards host genomic R-loops is that R-loops perhaps take a collaborative role with host factors governing the HIV-1 integration site selection. Cellular R-loops are recognized and regulated by numerous cellular proteins (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></italic>). Besides, the correct genomic environment for HIV-1 integration site selection are composed by host proteins (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></italic>). LEDGF/p75 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></italic>) and CPSF6 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></italic>) are two decisive host factors that direct HIV-1 integration by interacting with integrase or trafficking viral preintegration complex towards nuclear interior (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></italic>). In fact, these host factors have recently been identified as potential R-loop binding proteins in DNA–RNA interactome analysis (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></italic>) and R-loop proximity proteomics (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></italic>), respectively. R-loops are tightly regulated by DNA damage response proteins (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></italic>) and DNA repair machineries take important roles in HIV-1 integration process (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></italic>). For example, the Fanconi anemia pathway (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></italic>), a well-known R-loop regulatory pathway, has been recently proposed as an HIV-1 integration regulatory factor exploited by HIV-1 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></italic>). Taking into account theses previous studies alongside our current findings, we propose R-loops as another pivotal host factor driving HIV-1 integration site determination and as a possible intermediate regulator of HIV-1 integration site selection by such host proteins.</p>
<p>Viruses often take advantage of various host factors, and targeting viral components that manipulate the host cellular environment can be an effective strategy for antiviral therapy. Our study has shown that host genomic R-loops accumulate significantly shortly after HIV-1 infection. Thus, it is possible that virion-associated HIV-1 proteins are responsible for inducing these R-loops. For instance, the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpr causes genomic damage (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></italic>) and transcriptomic changes during the early stages post infection(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></italic>), both of which can lead to <italic>in cis</italic> and <italic>in trans</italic> R-loop formation (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></italic>). Another HIV-1 accessory protein, Vif, counteracts the host antiviral factor, APOBEC3 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></italic>), which were recently found to regulates cellular R-loop levels (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></italic>). Identifying the HIV-1 components responsible for inducing host cellular R-loops, and elucidating the mechanism by which they induce genome-wide R-loop formation and contribute to successful viral integration into selective genomic regions, represents an area for further research.</p>
<p>Although most HIV-1 integration occurs in genic regions (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></italic>), HIV-1 proviruses are also found in non-genic regions (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></italic>) and understanding these “transcriptionally silent” proviruses is critical for developing strategies to completely eliminate HIV-1. In HIV-1 elite controllers, who suppress viral gene expression to undetectable levels, HIV-1 proviruses accumulate in heterochromatic regions (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></italic>). Moreover, proviruses with lower expression level can persist in the host genome even during antiretroviral therapy (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></italic>). However, the mechanism by which HIV-1 targets gene-silent regions for “invisible” integration remains unclear. Our study has revealed that R-loops are enriched in both genic and non-genic regions during HIV-1 infection, and that the virus preferentially targets these R-loops for integration. We propose that R-loops, particularly those enriched in non-genic regions, may represent the mechanism by which the virus achieves “invisible” and permanent infection.</p>

<title>DRIPc-seq library construction</title>
<p>DRIP followed by library preparation, next-generation sequencing, and peak calling were performed as described earlier (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></italic>). Briefly, the corresponding cells were harvested and their gDNA was extracted. The extracted nucleic acids were fragmented using a restriction enzyme cocktail with BsrB I (NEB, R0102S), HindIII (NEB, R0136L), Xba I (NEB, R0145L), and EcoRI (NEB, R3101L) overnight at 37°C. Half of the fragmented nucleic acids were digested with RNase H (New England Biolabs) overnight at 37°C to serve as a negative control. The digested nucleic acids were cleaned using standard phenol-chloroform extraction and resuspended in DNase/RNase-free water. DNA–RNA hybrids were immunoprecipitated from total nucleic acids using mouse anti-DNA–RNA hybrid S9.6 (Kerafast, ENH001) DRIP binding buffer and incubated overnight at 4°C. Dynabeads Protein A (Invitrogen, 10001D) was used to pull down the DNA-antibody complexes by incubation for 4 h at 4°C. The isolated complexes were washed twice with DRIP binding buffer before elution. For elution, the isolated complexes were incubated in an elution buffer containing proteinase K for 45 min at 55 °C. Subsequently, DNA was purified using the standard phenol-chloroform extract method and subjected to DNase I (Takara, 2270 B) treatment and reverse transcription for DRIPc-seq library construction. DRIPc-seq was performed in biological replicates. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls5">S5 Table</xref> shows details of the oligonucleotides used for DRIPc-seq library construction.

The slides were washed three times with 1× PBS and incubated with or without 60 U/mL RNase H (M0297S, NEB) at 37°C for 36 h or left untreated. The slides were subsequently briefly rinsed thrice with 2% BSA/0.05% Tween (in PBS) and incubated with mouse anti-DNA– RNA hybrid S9.6 (Kerafast, ENH001; 1:100) and rabbit anti-nucleolin (Abcam, ab22758; 1:300) in 2% BSA/0.05% Tween (in PBS) for 4 h at 4°C. The slides were then washed three times with 2% BSA/0.05% Tween (in PBS) and incubated with goat anti-rabbit AlexaFluor-488-conjugated (Invitrogen, A-11008) and goat anti-mouse AlexaFluor-568-conjugated (Molecular Probes, A11004) secondary antibodies (1:200) for 2 h at room temperature. The slides were then washed three times with 2% BSA/0.05% Tween (in PBS) and mounted using the ProLong Gold AntiFade reagent (Invitrogen). Images were obtained using an inverted microscope Nikon Eclipse Ti2, equipped with a 1.45 numerical aperture, plan apochromat lambda 100× oil objective, and an scientific complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor camera (Photometrics prime 95 B 25 mm). For each field of view, images were obtained with DAPI395, GFP488, and Alexa594 channels using the NIS-Elements software. For quantification analysis, binary masks of nuclei and nucleoli were generated using the ROI manager and auto local thresholding using the ImageJ software. The intensity of nuclear signals for DNA–RNA hybrids and nucleolin was then quantified. The final DNA–RNA hybrid signals in the nucleus were calculated by subtracting the nucleolin signals from the DNA–RNA hybrid signals.</p>

<p>Based on largely indirect evidence, this study proposes that genomic integration of HIV targets DNA/RNA hybrids called R-loops. The evidence is indirect because the authors do not use relevant models systems to show integration and because they artificially induce R-loops in the critical experiments. There are two interrelated findings: 1) VSVg-pseudotyped HIV-1 induces R-loops in various cell types, and 2) VSVg-pseudotyped HIV-1 targets R-loops for integration in an artificial Hela cell model in which R-loops are exogenously induced. The induction of R-loops by a pseudotyped HIV-1 is a potentially <bold>valuable</bold> finding. Critically, however, because of the caveats above, the evidence is <bold>inadequate</bold> to support the primary claims in the title, abstract, and manuscript. Furthermore, if these claims were true, the authors do not provide context for how they could be reconciled with well-established structural data showing that HIV-1 integrase catalyzes the integration of viral DNA into dsDNA as a substrate.</p>

<p>(1) Significance of findings and strength of evidence.</p>
<p>(a) The work presented in this manuscript is intended to support the authors' novel idea that HIV DNA integration strongly favors &quot;triple-stranded&quot; R-loops in DNA formed either during transcription of many, but not all, genes or by strand invasion of silent DNA by transcripts made elsewhere, and that HIV infection promotes R-loop formation mediated by incoming virions in the absence of reverse transcription. The authors were able to demonstrate a reverse transcription-independent increase in R-loop formation early during HIV infection, while also demonstrating increased integration into sequences that contain R-loop structures. Furthermore, this manuscript also identifies that R-loops are present in both transcriptionally active and silent regions of the genome and that HIV integrase interacts with R-loops. Although the work presented supports a correlation between R-loop formation and HIV DNA integration, it does not prove the authors' hypothesis that R-loops are directly targeted for integration. Direct experimentation, such as in vitro integration into defined DNA targets, will be required. Further, the authors provide no explanation as to how current sophisticated structural models of concerted retroviral DNA integration into both strands of double-stranded DNA targets can accommodate triple-stranded structures. Finally, there are serious technical concerns with the interpretation of the integration site analyses.</p>
<p>(2) Public review with guidance for readers around how to interpret the work, highlighting important findings but also mentioning caveats.</p>
<p>(a) Introduction: The authors provide an excellent introduction to R-loops but they base the rationale for this study on mis-citation of earlier studies regarding integration in transcriptionally silent regions of the genome. E &quot;most favored locus&quot; cited in the very old reference 6 comprises only 5 events and has not been reproduced in more recent, much larger datasets. For example, see the study of over 300.000 sites in freshly infected PBMC cited in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009141">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009141</ext-link>, which shows a 15-fold preference for integration in expressed genes and no evidence of clustering of sites (as seen in expressed genes) in non-expressed DNA. Further, as far as I can tell, they present no examples in the Results section of R-loops in non-expressed DNA serving as integration targets.</p>
<p>(b) Figure 1: Demonstrates models for HIV infections in both cell lines and primary human CD4+ T cells. R-loop formation was determined through a method called DRIPc-seq which utilizes an antibody specific for DNA-RNA hybrid structures and sequences these regions of the genome using RNaseH treatment to show that when RNA-DNA hybrids are absent then no R-loops are detected. In these models of in vitro and ex vivo infection, the authors show that R-Loop formation increases following HIV infection between 6 hour post-infection and 12 hours post-infection, depending on the cell model. However, these figures lack a mock-infected control for each cell model to assess R-loop formation at the same time points. They would also benefit from a control showing that virus entry is necessary, such as omitting the VSV G protein donor.</p>
<p>Additionally, they use intracellular staining to confirm DRIPc-Seq results, by demonstrating an increase in R-loop formation at 6 hours post-infection in HeLa cells. It would have been more relevant to use primary T cells for this assay, but HeLa cells probably provided easier and clearer imaging.</p>
<p>(c) Figure 2: This figure shows that cells infected with HIV show more R-loops as well as longer sequences containing R-loop structures. Panel B shows that these R-loops were distributed throughout different genomic features, such as both genic and intergenic regions of the genome. However, the data are presented in such a way that it is impossible to determine the proportion of R-loops in each type of genomic feature. The reader has no way to tell, for example, the proportion of R-loops in genic vs intergenic DNA and how this value changes with time. Furthermore, increased R-loop formation due to HIV infection showed poor correlation with gene expression, suggesting that R-loops were not forming due to transcriptional activation, although the difference between 0 and the remaining time points is not apparent, nor is the meaning of the absurd p values.</p>
<p>(d) Figure 3: This figure shows the use of cell lines carrying R-loop inducible (mAIRN) or non-inducible (ECFP) genes to model the association of HIV integration with R-loop structures. The authors demonstrate the functional validation of R-loop induction in the cell line model. Additionally, when R-loops are induced there is a significant increase in HIV integration in the R-loop forming vector sequence when R-loops are induced with doxycycline. This result shows a correlation between expression and integration that is much stronger in the R-loop forming gene than in the unreferenced ECFP gene but does not prove that integration directly targets R-loops. It is possible, for example, that some features of the DNA sequence, such as base composition affect both integration and R-loop formation independently. As described more fully below, there is also a serious concern regarding the method used to quantify the integration frequencies.</p>
<p>(e) Figure 4: This figure shows evidence of increased HIV integration within regions of the genome containing R-loops with an additional preference for integration within the R-loop and a decrease in frequency of integration further from the R-loop. Identifying a preference for R-loops is very intriguing but the authors do also demonstrate that integration does occur when R-loops are not present. Also Panel A, which shows that regions of cell DNA that form R-loops have a higher frequency of Integration sites than those that do not, should also be controlled for the level of gene expression of the two types of region.</p>
<p>(f) Figure 5: In this figure, the authors demonstrate that HIV integrase binds to R-loops through a number of protein assays, but does not show that this binding is associated with enzymatic activity. ESMA of integrase identified increased binding to DNA-RNA over dsDNA. Additionally, precipitation of RNA-DNA hybrids pulled down HIV integrase. A proximity ligation assay detecting R-loops and HIV-integrase showed co-localization within the nucleus of HeLa cells. HeLa cells were probably used due to their efficiency of transduction but are not physiologically relevant cell types.</p>
<p>(g) Discussion: In the discussion, the authors address how their work relates to previous evidence of HIV integration by association of LEDGF/p75 and CPSF6. They also cite that LEDGF/p75 has possible R-loop binding capabilities. They also discuss what possible mechanisms are driving increases in R-loop formation during HIV infection, pointing to possible HIV accessory proteins. They also state that how HIV integrates in transcriptionally silent regions is still unknown but do point out that they were able to show R-loops appear in many different regions of the genome but did not show that R-loops in transcriptional inactive regions are integration targets. More seriously, they failed to make a connection between their work and the current understanding of the biochemical and structural mechanism of the integration reaction.</p>

<p>Retroviral integration in general, and HIV integration in particular, takes place in dsDNA, not in R-loops. Although HIV integration can occur in vitro on naked dsDNA, there is good evidence that, in an infected cell, integration occurs on DNA that is associated with nucleosomes. This review will be presented in two parts. First, a summary will be provided giving some of the reasons to be confident that integration occurs on dsDNA on nucleosomes. The second part will point out some of the obvious problems with the experimental data that are presented in the manuscript.</p>
<p>(1) 2017 Dos Passos Science paper describes the structure of the HIV intasome. The structure makes it clear that the target for integration is dsDNA, not an R-loop, and there are very good reasons to think that structure is physiologically relevant. For example, there is data from the Cherepanov, Engelman, and Lyumkis labs to show that the HIV intasome is quite similar in its overall structure and organization to the structures of the intasomes of other retroviruses. Importantly, these structures explain the way integration creates a small duplication of the host sequences at the integration site. How do the authors propose that an R-loop can replace the dsDNA that was seen in these intasome structures?</p>
<p>(2) As noted above, concerted (two-ended) integration can occur in vitro on a naked dsDNA substrate. However, there is compelling evidence that, in cells, integration preferentially occurs on nucleosomes. Nucleosomes are not found in R loops. In an infected cell, the viral RNA genome of HIV is converted into DNA within the capsid/core which transits the nuclear pore before reverse transcription has been completed. Integration requires the uncoating of the capsid/core, which is linked to the completion of viral DNA synthesis in the nucleus. Two host factors are known to strongly influence integration site selection, CPSF6 and LEDGF. CPSF6 is involved in helping the capsid/core transit the nuclear pore and associate with nuclear speckles. LEDGF is involved in helping the preintegration complex (PIC) find an integration site after it has been released from the capsid/core, most commonly in the bodies of highly expressed genes. In the absence of an interaction of CPSF6 with the core, integration occurs primarily in the lamin-associated domains (LADs). Genes in LADs are usually not expressed or are expressed at low levels. Depending on the cell type, integration in the absence of CPSF6 can be less efficient than normal integration, but that could well be due to a lack of LEDGF (which is associated with expressed genes) in the LADs. In the absence of an interaction of IN with LEDGF (and in cells with low levels of HRP2) integration is less efficient and the obvious preference for integration in highly expressed genes is reduced. Importantly, LEDGF is known to bind histone marks, and will therefore be preferentially associated with nucleosomes, not R-loops. LEDGF fusions, in which the chromatin binding portion of the protein is replaced, can be used to redirect where HIV integrates, and that technique has been used to map the locations of proteins on chromatin. Importantly, LEDGF fusions in which the chromatin binding component of LEDGF is replaced with a module that recognizes specific histone marks direct integration to those marks, confirming integration occurs efficiently on nucleosomes in cells. It is worth noting that it is possible to redirect integration to portions of the host genome that are poorly expressed, which, when taken with the data on integration into LADs (integration in the absence of a CPSF6 interaction) shows that there are circumstances in which there is reasonably efficient integration of HIV DNA in portions of the genome in which there are few if any R-loops.</p>
<p>(3) Given that HIV DNA is known to preferentially integrate into expressed genes and that R-loops must necessarily involve expressed RNA, it is not surprising that there is a correlation between HIV integration and regions of the genome to which R loops have been mapped. However, it is important to remember that correlation does not necessarily imply causation.</p>
<p>If we consider some of the problems in the experiments that are described in the manuscript:</p>
<p>(1) In an infected individual, cells are almost always infected by a single virion and the infecting virion is not accompanied by large numbers of damaged or defective virions. This is a key consideration: the claim that infection by HIV affects R-loop formation in cells was done with a VSVg vector in experiments in which there appears to have been about 6000 virions per cell. Although most of the virions prepared in vitro are defective in some way, that does not mean that a large fraction of the defective virions cannot fuse with cells. In normal in vivo infections, HIV has evolved in ways that avoid signaling infected the cell of its presence. To cite an example, carrying out reverse transcription in the capsid/core prevents the host cell from detecting (free) viral DNA in the cytoplasm. The fact that the large effect on R-loop formation which the authors report still occurs in infections done in the absence of reverse transcription strengthens the probability that the effects are due to the massive amounts of virions present, and perhaps to the presence of VSVg, which is quite toxic. To have physiological relevance, the infections would need to be carried out with virions that contain HIV even under circumstances in which there is at most one virion per cell.</p>
<p>(2) Using the Sso7d version of HIV IN in the in vitro binding assays raises some questions, but that is not the real question/problem. The real problem is that the important question is not what/how HIV IN protein binds to, but where/how an intasome binds. An intasome is formed from a combination of IN bound to the ends of viral DNA. In the absence of viral DNA ends, IN does not have the same structure/organization as it has in an intasome. Moreover, HIV IN (even Sso7d, which was modified to improve its behavior) is notoriously sticky and hard to work with. If viral DNA had been included in the experiment, intasomes would need to be prepared and purified for a proper binding experiment. To make matters worse, there are multiple forms of multimeric HIV IN and it is not clear how many HIV INs are present in the PICs that actually carry out integration in an infected cell.</p>
<p>(3) As an extension of comment 2, the proper association of an HIV intasome/PIC with the host genome requires LEDGF and the appropriate nucleic acid targets need to be chromatinized.</p>
<p>(4) Expressing any form of IN, by itself, in cells to look for what IN associates with is not a valid experiment. A major factor that helps to determine both where integration takes place and the sites chosen for integration is the transport of the viral DNA and IN into the nucleus in the capsid core. However, even if we ignore that important part of the problem, the IN that the authors expressed in HeLa cells won't be bound to the viral DNA ends (see comment 2), even if the fusion protein would be able to form an intasome. As such, the IN that is expressed free in cells will not form a proper intasome/PIC and cannot be expected to bind where/how an intasome/PIC would bind.</p>
<p>(5) As in comment 1, for the PLA experiments presented in Figure 5 to work, the number of virions used per cell (which differs from the MOI measured by the number of cells that express a viral marker) must have a high, which is likely to have affected the cells and the results of the experiment. However, there is the additional question of whether the IN-GFP fusion is functional. The fact that the functional intasome is a complex multimer suggests that this could be a problem. There is an additional problem, even if IN-GFP is fully functional. During a normal infection, the capsid core will have delivered copies of IN (and, in the experiments reported here, the IN-GFP fusion) into the nucleus that is not part of the intasome. These &quot;free&quot; copies of IN (here IN-GFP) are not likely to go to the same sites as an intasome, making this experiment problematic (comment 4).</p>
<p>(6) In the Introduction, the authors state that the site of integration affects the probability that the resulting provirus will be expressed. Although this idea is widely believed in the field, the actual data supporting it are, at best, weak. See, for example, the data from the Bushman lab showing that the distribution of integration sites is the same in cells in which the integrated proviruses are, and are not, expressed. However, given what the authors claim in the introduction, they should be more careful in interpreting enzyme expression levels (luciferase) as a measure of integration efficiency in experiments in which they claim proviruses are integrated in different places.</p>
<p>(7) Using restriction enzymes to create an integration site library introduces biases that derive from the uneven distribution of the recognition sites for the restriction enzymes.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Park and colleagues describe a series of experiments that investigate the role of R-loops in HIV-1 genome integration. The authors show that during HIV-1 infection, R-loops levels on the host genome accumulate. Using a synthetic R-loop prone gene construct, they show that HIV-1 integration sites target sites with high R-loop levels. They further show that integration sites on the endogenous host genome are correlated with sites prone to R-loops. Using biochemical approaches, as well as in vivo co-IP and proximity ligation experiments, the authors show that HIV-1 integrase physically interacts with R-loop structures.</p>
<p>My primary concern with the paper is with the interpretations the authors make about their genome-wide analyses. I think that including some additional analyses of the genome-wide data, as well as some textual changes can help make these interpretations more congruent with what the data demonstrate. Here are a few specific comments and questions:</p>
<p>(1) I think Figure 1 makes a good case for the conclusion that R-loops are more easily detected HIV-1 infected cells by multiple approaches (all using the S9.6 antibody). The authors show that their signals are RNase H sensitive, which is a critical control. For the DRIPc-Seq, I think including an analysis of biological replicates would greatly strengthen the manuscript. The authors state in the methods that the DRIPc pulldown experiments were done in biological replicates for each condition. Are the increases in DRIPc peaks similar across biological replicates? Are genomic locations of HIV-1-dependent peaks similar across biological replicates? Measuring and reporting the biological variation between replicate experiments is crucial for making conclusions about increases in R-loop peak frequency. This is partially alleviated by the locus-specific data in Figure S3A. However, a better understanding of how the genome-wide data varies across biological replicates will greatly enhance the quality of Figure 1.</p>
<p>(2) I think that the conclusion that R-loops &quot;accumulate&quot; in infected cells is acceptable, given the data presented. However, in line 134 the authors state that &quot;HIV-1 infection induced host genomic R-loop formation&quot;. I suggest being very specific about the observation. Accumulation can happen by (a) inducing a higher frequency of the occurrence of individual R-loops and/or (b) stabilizing existing R-loops. I'm not convinced the authors present enough evidence to claim one over the other. It is altogether possible that HIV-1 infection stabilizes R-loops such that they are more persistent (perhaps by interactions with integrase?), and therefore more easily detected. I think rephrasing the conclusions to include this possibility would alleviate my concerns.</p>
<p>(3) A technical problem with using the S9.6 antibody for the detection of R-loops via microscopy is that it cross-reacts with double-stranded RNA. This has been addressed by the work of Chedin and colleagues (as well as others). It is absolutely essential to treat these samples with an RNA:RNA hybrid-specific RNase, which the authors did not include, as far as their methods section states. Therefore, it is difficult to interpret all of the immunofluorescence experiments that depend on S9.6 binding.</p>
<p>(4) Given that there is no clear correlation between expression levels and R-loop peak detection, combined with the data that show increased detection of R-loop frequency in non-genic regions, I think it will be important to show that the R-loop forming regions are indeed transcribed above background levels. This will help alleviate possible concerns that there are technical errors in R-loop peak detection.</p>
<p>(5) In Figures 4C and D the hashed lines are not defined. It is also interesting that the integration sites do not line up with R-loop peaks. This does not necessarily directly refute the conclusions (especially given the scale of the genomic region displayed), but should be addressed in the manuscript. Additionally, it would greatly improve Figure 4 to have some idea about the biological variation across replicates of the data presented 4A.</p>
<p>(6) The authors do not adequately describe the Integrase mutant that they use in their biochemical experiments in Figure 5A. Could this impact the activity of the protein in such a way that interferes with the interpretation of the experiment? The mutant is not used in subsequent experiments for Figure 5 and so even though the data are consistent with each other (and the conclusion that Integrase interacts with R-loops) a more thorough explanation of why that mutant was used and how it impacts the biochemical activity of the protein will help the interpretation of the data presented in Figure 5.</p>
