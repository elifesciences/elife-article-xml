<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Pericentromeric heterochromatin is highly enriched for repetitive sequences prone to aberrant recombination. Previous studies showed that homologous recombination (HR) repair is uniquely regulated in this domain to enable ‘safe’ repair while preventing aberrant recombination. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) relocalize to the nuclear periphery through nuclear actin-driven directed motions before recruiting the strand invasion protein Rad51 and completing HR repair. End-joining (EJ) repair also occurs with high frequency in heterochromatin of fly tissues, but how alternative EJ (alt-EJ) pathways operate in heterochromatin remains largely uncharacterized. Here, we induce DSBs in single euchromatic and heterochromatic sites using a new system that combines the DR-<italic>white</italic> reporter and I-SceI expression in spermatogonia of flies. Using this approach, we detect higher frequency of HR repair in heterochromatin, relative to euchromatin. Further, sequencing of mutagenic repair junctions reveals the preferential use of different EJ pathways across distinct euchromatic and heterochromatic sites. Interestingly, synthesis-dependent microhomology-mediated end joining (SD-MMEJ) appears differentially regulated in the two domains, with a preferential use of motifs close to the cut site in heterochromatin relative to euchromatin, resulting in smaller deletions. Together, these studies establish a new approach to study repair outcomes in fly tissues, and support the conclusion that heterochromatin uses more HR and less mutagenic EJ repair relative to euchromatin.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pericentromeric heterochromatin (hereby ‘heterochromatin’) occupies ∼6-90% of eukaryotic genomes, or ∼30% of the fly genome, and is mostly composed of highly repeated DNA sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> about half of these sequences are satellite repeats (mostly 5-bp sequences repeated in tandem for hundreds of kilobases to megabases), and the rest is transposons, other scrambled repeats, and only about 250 genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Given the abundance of repeated sequences, heterochromatin is prone to aberrant recombination during DSB repair (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]).</p>
<p>DSBs can be repaired through different pathways, mostly: HR, single-strand annealing (SSA), classical non-homologous end joining (cNHEJ), and alternative-EJ (alt-EJ) (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]). During HR, DSBs are resected to generate long stretches of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that invade homologous sequences on the sister chromatid or the homologous chromosome, which are used as templates for DNA synthesis and repair. HR is typically error-free in single copy sequences. In heterochromatin, however, the presence of thousands to millions of alternative donor sequences associated with different chromosomes can lead to strand invasion of non-allelic (ectopic) templates, resulting in aberrant recombination, chromosome rearrangements and genome instability.</p>
<p>Previous studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cultured cells showed that HR repair of heterochromatic DSBs occurs through a dedicated pathway that relocalizes repair sites to the nuclear periphery. Resection starts inside the heterochromatin domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], but the strand invasion protein Rad51 is recruited only after relocalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. This movement occurs by directed motion along a network of nuclear actin filaments (F-actin), and is mediated by nuclear myosins associated with the Smc5/6 complex at repair sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. F-actin-dependent relocalization of heterochromatic DSBs to outside the ‘chromocenters’ has also been detected in mouse cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], revealing conserved pathways. This mechanism likely promotes ‘safe’ repair by moving the damage away from the bulk of ectopic repeated sequences inside the heterochromatin domain, before promoting strand invasion with the homologous templates on the sister chromatid or the homologous chromosome (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]). In flies, homologous pairing occurs throughout interphase, thus the homologous chromosome is readily available as a template for HR repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Accordingly, both the sister chromatid and the homologous chromosome can be used as repair templates for HR in heterochromatin, although the sister chromatid is used at higher frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Studies in fly and human cultured cells suggest that HR is the preferred pathway used for heterochromatin repair when both HR and NHEJ are available, <italic>e.g.,</italic> in S and G2 phases of the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>].</p>
<p>In addition to HR, long-range resection can promote SSA when ssDNA unmasks identical sequences that can pair with each other, resulting in large deletions (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]). Despite the abundance of repeated sequences in heterochromatin, SSA seems rarely used in this domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>].</p>
<p>Alternatively, short-range resection and small regions of homology (1-8bp) can be used in pol theta (polθ)-dependent alt-EJ pathways: microhomology-mediated EJ (MMEJ) or synthesis-dependent MMEJ (SD-MMEJ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>] (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]). In MMEJ, the annealing of regions of homology available on the ssDNA after resection, is followed by flap removal, fill-in synthesis and ligation, resulting in small deletions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Conversely, SD-MMEJ is characterized by annealing followed by a synthesis step, dissociation, and a re-annealing using the nascent DNA before fill-in synthesis and ligation, frequently resulting in indels (deletions with insertions) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. Finally, cNHEJ simply rejoins the two ends of the DSB together through binding of Ku70/Ku80, processing by nucleases and polymerases, and ligation by a complex containing DNA Ligase 4 (Lig4) (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]). cNHEJ can be error-free or associated with small alterations at the junction (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]), with error-free outcomes prevailing in a context of ‘clean’ breaks (<italic>e.g.</italic>, those induced by endonucleases) (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]). Given the different mutagenic outcomes of these repair pathways, it is possible to detect their activity based on the sequence of the repair product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>].</p>
<p>A major determinant of EJ outcomes is the DNA sequence surrounding the DSB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>] (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]). Alt-EJ is promoted by the presence of small regions of homology around the cut site, with SD-MMEJ particularly facilitated by the establishment of secondary structures that promote the first synthesis step [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. In agreement, the binding of replication protein A (RPA) antagonizes alt-EJ by preventing ssDNA annealing and secondary structure formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. While much is known about the role of the DNA sequence in alt-EJ pathways, the contribution of the chromatin context remains poorly understood.</p>
<p>A recent study systematically looked at the balance between MMEJ and cNHEJ in different epigenetic environments using a sequencing-based reporter cut with Cas9 inserted in a large number of genomic locations of human cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. This study identified a higher ratio of MMEJ:cNHEJ usage in H3K9me2-enriched lamina-associated silenced regions, and in polycomb silenced regions (H3K27me3-enriched), relative to active chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. This appears to result from more efficient usage of cNHEJ in active chromatin, suggesting that silencing interferes with cNHEJ while enabling MMEJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. Thus, this study revealed that epigenetic environments can influence EJ repair outcomes, but it did not examine SD-MMEJ repair, nor did it investigate DSB repair in pericentromeric heterochromatin. This nuclear domain is unique in that it is not only enriched for H3K9me3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>], but is also mostly composed of repeated sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>], is phase separated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>], and is not typically associated with the nuclear periphery (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]).</p>
<p>A major advantage of using the same reporter inserted in different genomic locations is that repair outcomes are not affected by differences in the local DNA sequence, thus enabling a more direct focus on effects associated with chromatin composition and nuclear domains. Previous studies established the DR-<italic>white</italic> reporter as an excellent tool to study both HR and EJ pathways in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. <italic>Drosophila</italic> is also an ideal model system to study alt-EJ, given that this pathway is commonly used to repair DSBs even in the presence of a fully functional cNHEJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we use a DR-<italic>white</italic> reporter inserted in euchromatic and heterochromatic locations of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and we directly investigate repair outcomes in spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes as a model for mitotically dividing cells of adult flies. Contrary to previous conclusions, we detect higher frequency of HR repair in all heterochromatic insertions relative to euchromatin. In addition, different alt-EJ repair mechanisms prevail at distinct heterochromatic locations, with SD-MMEJ typically resulting in smaller deletions in heterochromatin relative to euchromatin. This is linked to a higher usage of repeat motifs closer to the cut site, suggesting that farther motifs are less accessible for secondary structure formation in heterochromatin and/ or that repair protein access is different in the two chromatin contexts. Together, this study establishes new tools to study heterochromatin repair in flies, reveals unique features of alt-EJ in heterochromatin, and suggests that alt-EJ is less mutagenic in this domain. Most surprisingly, this study supports a model where the chromatin context, not just the sequence composition, affects motif usage for SD-MMEJ repair.</p>

<title>A new approach to induce single DSBs in euchromatin or heterochromatin of spermatogonia</title>
<p>We generated new fly lines to examine repair outcomes with the DR-<italic>white</italic> reporter. This reporter is characterized by two non-functional repeats of the <italic>white</italic> gene (<italic>Sce.white</italic> and <italic>iwhite</italic>), the first of which contains a restriction site for I-SceI (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. Exposure to the I-SceI endonuclease results in DSB induction in <italic>Sce.white</italic>. Intra-chromosomal or inter-sister chromatid HR repair using the <italic>iwhite</italic> sequence as a template restores the <italic>wild-type white</italic> gene. SSA repair results in the loss of the DsRed fluorescent marker. Mutagenic EJ repair results in the loss of the I-SceI cut site and can be characterized through PCR amplification across the cut site, enzymatic digestion, and DNA sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>].</p>

<p>We induced I-SceI expression using the <italic>Bam</italic> promoter (BamP898-CFI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]), which is activated at the 2-cell cyst spermatogonia stage, peaks at the 8 cell-cyst stage, and is quickly suppressed in spermatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>] (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). In this transgenic construct, I-SceI protein levels are also suppressed at the translational level in spermatocytes through the Bam 3’ UTR. This confines I-SceI expression and DSB induction to male pre-meiotic germ cells. This is an important advancement from previous studies that expressed I-SceI broadly in the germ line or in somatic cells using a heat-shock (hs) or a ubiquitin (Ub) promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]. Targeted expression in spermatogonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>], enables damage induction and repair in a homogeneous population of mitotically dividing cells, reducing confounding effects from multiple cell types and stages of differentiation. In addition, inducing I-SceI via hs or Ub promoters that are active in the germinal stem cells can give rise to ‘jackpot’ events that populate the entire germ line, introducing significant bias in the frequency of repair outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]. These events are not induced by the <italic>Bam</italic> promoter, eliminating another major source of ‘noise’ in the system. With this approach, each individual of the progeny contains a unique repair product that can be scored for the acquisition of <italic>white+</italic> (red eyes) or DsRed-(red fluorescent eyes) phenotypes and further analyzed by sequencing.</p>
<p>We integrated DR-<italic>white</italic> in one euchromatic location (Eu) and four pericentromeric heterochromatic sites (Het1-4) of chromosome 2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C, D</xref>). The euchromatic site was previously studied with the DR-<italic>white</italic> cassette and its genomic location is characterized by a ‘gray’ chromatin state (or ‘state 9’) in the 9-state model of combinatorial chromatin patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>], which corresponds to regions deprived of active or silent histone marks and which are typically interspersed with active genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Consistently, very low levels of H3K9me3 were detected at this site (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>]. The <italic>yellow</italic>+ marker of the MiMIC line used to generate this insertion and the Ds-Red and <italic>white+</italic> marker of the DR-<italic>white</italic> reporter are fully expressed under the respective promoters, in agreement with the lack of silencing effects. Conversely, the heterochromatic sites are heavily silenced based on H3K9me3 levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>), and are characterized by a ‘blue’ chromatin state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>] (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), corresponding to silenced pericentromeric heterochromatin. These locations are also characterized by a high number of repeats surrounding the insertion site (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Importantly, the yellow marker of the MiMIC lines used to generate these insertions is nearly fully silenced resulting in a faint ‘mosaic’ phenotype, while the Ds-Red and the <italic>white+</italic> markers of the DR-<italic>white</italic> reporter are completely silenced. This indicates that silent histone marks spread across the cassette, creating a silenced epigenetic context at the cut site.</p>
<p>Given the silent state of the heterochromatic insertions, F1 males were crossed with females carrying a mutation in the heterochromatin silencing component HP1a (<italic>su(var)205+/-</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>] to unmask the presence of the reporter (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). HP1 heterozygosity in the F2 generation results in partial reactivation of DsRed and <italic>white</italic> markers carried by the reporter (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>), leading to a mosaic phenotype that can easily be scored to assess repair outcomes. Thus, with this system, DSB induction and repair occur in the spermatogonia of F1 males, and can be scored in the F2 progeny.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>HR repair occurs more frequently in heterochromatin</title>
<p>First, we investigated HR repair of adult F1 males containing DR-<italic>white</italic> and <italic>Bam</italic>-ISceI by quantifying the fraction of individuals with red eyes (w+, DsRed+) in the progeny (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>).</p>
<p>This analysis revealed that 3.6% (+/- 0.3%) of the flies repair DSBs using HR when DR-<italic>white</italic> is placed in euchromatin. This percentage remains remarkably consistent across replicates, in agreement with little experimental variability. This is a significantly lower frequency than observed in previous studies with I-SceI under a heat-shock promoter and DR-<italic>white</italic> in the same genomic location, where HR occurred at a frequency of ∼20% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. The lower HR frequency is consistent with <italic>Bam</italic> being active only in a subset of cells in the germline and thus inducing DSBs less frequently.</p>
<p>Next, we analyzed HR repair in the heterochromatic insertions of DR-<italic>white</italic> by scoring variegated red-eyed flies in the F2 generation. All heterochromatic insertions used HR at significantly higher frequency relative to the euchromatic insertion, ranging from 5.5% to 9.2% of the total DR-<italic>white</italic>-containing F2 progeny (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). This corresponds to ∼1.5-2.5 fold increase in HR frequency for heterochromatic DR-<italic>white</italic> insertions relative to the euchromatic insertion. Thus, we conclude that HR repair is more frequently used in heterochromatin relative to euchromatin.</p>

<title>Alt-EJ repair pathways operate with different frequencies at distinct DR-white insertions</title>
<p>We then focused on characterizing EJ events by analyzing repair products in white-eyed flies. White-eyed F2 individuals can derive from SSA (w-DsRed-) or mutagenic EJ repair (w-DsRed+), resulting in loss of the I-SceI cut site (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Alternatively, white-eyed flies can result from germ line cells where the I-SceI site was not cut, from perfect NHEJ repair, or from HR with the sister chromatid, and each of these outcomes retain a wild-type I-SceI site (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Mutagenic and non-mutagenic events were distinguished through PCR amplification across the cut site followed by digestion with I-SceI (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>
<p>Consistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>], this analysis showed that SSA is rarely used in euchromatin and heterochromatin (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 1A</xref>) and its frequency is not significantly different across DR-<italic>white</italic> insertions. Conversely, mutagenic EJ repair occurs with high frequency across all DR-<italic>white</italic> insertions, accounting for ∼20-50% of all the events (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>We also identified a large number of flies where the I-SceI site was still intact (∼40-60% of the white-eyed flies, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 1B</xref>), consistent with either low cut efficiency or non-mutagenic repair. The frequency of mutagenic and non-mutagenic events is similar across euchromatic and heterochromatic DR-<italic>white</italic> insertions, with the exception of Het4 where non-mutagenic outcomes are more frequent potentially reflecting lower cut efficiency at this site (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 1B</xref>). Of note, observing higher frequency of EJ relative to HR is consistent with other studies with the DR-<italic>white</italic> cassette [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. This likely reflects the inability of the DR-<italic>white</italic> to detect intersister HR resulting in perfect repair, which is the preferred mechanism for HR repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>].</p>
<p>We further characterized mutagenic EJ events by Sanger sequencing of the PCR product across the cut site of individual F2 flies, and subsequent analysis of the repair junction. MMEJ typically results from the annealing of direct repeats positioned on each side of the cut sites after resection, and deletion of the intervening sequence (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>]. SD-MMEJ requires the presence of two ‘repeat motifs’, each containing a ‘primer’ (P) and a nearby ‘microhomology’ (MH) sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>] (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Duplex unwinding or resection exposes the primer repeats that anneal to form loops or transient hairpins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. Primer annealing can occur between two direct repeats (‘loop-out’ mechanism) or two inverted repeats (‘snap-back’ mechanism) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. The 3′ end of the DNA in these structures then uses ssDNA as a template for DNA synthesis and repair. Unwinding of the secondary structure and re-annealing of the nascent DNA with a MH sequence on the other side of the break enables repair completion, typically resulting in deletions or indels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>).</p>

For the ‘loop-out’ mechanism, the DNA is unwinded before loop formation. For the ‘snap-back’ mechanism, resection occurs before hairpin formation. In both mechanisms, annealing of the break-proximal primer (P2) to the break-distal primer (P1), initiates DNA synthesis (red arrows) that creates new microhomology sequences (MH1) and that can create insertions. P1 and P2 are direct repeats for loop-out and inverted repeats for snap-back. Repair continues through secondary structure unwinding, annealing of the newly-synthesized microhomologies with MH2 sequences on the opposite side of the break, fill-in DNA synthesis, and ligation. When P2 and MH2 are not adjacent to the break site DNA flaps form and get trimmed, resulting in long deletions. When P1 and MH1 are adjacent to each other, insertions do not occur.

</fig>
<p>Analysis of repair products across different DR-<italic>white</italic> insertions revealed that repair junctions are mostly characterized by deletions of less than 23 bp (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 2</xref>). The mean deletion size for all five insertions is between 9 and 16 bp (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 2</xref>), consistent with frequent repair by polθ-mediated alt-EJ mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>].</p>
<p>To establish the frequency of different mutagenic EJ events, we used previously published scripts in Python and R that identify repeat motifs and primer and microhomology repeats likely used during SD-MMEJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. We classified repair products based on the presence of deletions or indels, which revealed that indels are rare for all DR-<italic>white</italic> insertions (less than 10% of all mutagenic EJ events) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). This is consistent with previous studies that used DR-<italic>white</italic> as a repair reporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. We further classified repair events as deletions with apparent blunt joins (ABJs) and deletions with microhomology joins (MHJs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. This showed that deletions with microhomologies are the most common (∼70% of all mutagenic EJ events) across all DR-<italic>white</italic> insertions, in agreement with frequent MMEJ or SD-MMEJ repair (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we established whether each repair event was consistent with SD-MMEJ mechanisms (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). To be classified as SD-MMEJ-consistent, the repair junction needs to satisfy the following requirements: i) the repeat motif needs to be at least 4 bp; ii) the primer repeat and the microhomology repeat within the repeat motif need to be at least 1 bp; and iii) the break-distal end of the repeat motif has to occur within 30 bp of the DSB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. MHJ repair events that are SD-MMEJ-inconsistent were identified as MMEJ. ABJ repair events or indels that are SD-MMEJ-inconsistent and result in a 1-4 bp deletion were classified as NHEJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. ‘Other’ outcomes are rare and typically correspond to ABJ events associated with longer (5 bp or more) deletions. Notably, while we cannot exclude a contribution of cNHEJ to small (1-4 bp) deletions classified as SD-MMEJ consistent by the above criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>], previous studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> showed that most SD-MMEJ-consistent deletions around the I-SceI cut site are Polθ-dependent and not Lig4-dependent, indicating a prevalent role of alt-EJ repair in this context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>].</p>
<p>This analysis reveals significant differences in the frequencies of usage of distinct mutagenic EJ pathways across the DR-<italic>white</italic> insertions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Specifically, Het3 is characterized by less SD-MMEJ-consistent and more MMEJ-consistent events relative to the euchromatic DR-<italic>white</italic> insertion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Within SD-MMEJ, loop-out deletions are significantly reduced in Het1 and Het2 relative to the euchromatic site, and loop-out indels are higher in Het1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). We conclude that there is variation in the frequency of use of distinct mutagenic EJ pathways across different DR-<italic>white</italic> insertions, without prevalence of a specific pathway in heterochromatin relative to euchromatin.</p>

<title>SD-MMEJ repair results in smaller deletions in heterochromatin</title>
<p>Interestingly, the analysis of repair deletion size revealed differences between euchromatic and heterochromatic DR-<italic>white</italic> insertions (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 2</xref>). Het2 and Het3 are characterized by a significantly lower deletion size relative to the euchromatic site.

<p>To understand these differences in greater detail, we first analyzed the position of the deletion boundaries associated with different repair mechanisms across all DR-<italic>white</italic> insertions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).

<p>Smaller deletions from SD-MMEJ repair could derive from the usage of repeat motifs positioned closer to the cut site in heterochromatin.

<graphic xlink:href="531058v3_fig7.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>To further understand these differences, we identified the most frequent changes in repeat motifs usage between euchromatin and heterochromatin, corresponding to ∼70% of all the events (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 3</xref>). Mapping repeat motifs and primers used in these events confirmed a clear tendency for heterochromatic DR-<italic>white</italic> insertions to use a primer P2 and a microhomology MH2 closer to the cut site relative to the euchromatic one (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>). The most common events in heterochromatin also rely on a Repeat Motif 1 located closer to the cut site than euchromatic events, although less common repair outcomes also use farther motifs. This suggests that polθ ability to probe for homology is also affected in heterochromatin, being constrained to shorter distances from the cut site, although polθ can occasionally find a Repeat Motif 1 at distances comparable with those found in euchromatin (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>). Together, these results suggest that the initial association of polθ with the DNA end, and to some extent also homology probing and annealing for MH1 synthesis, tend to be confined to the region proximal to the cut site in heterochromatin. In addition, polθ typically finds homology (MH2) closer to the cut site in heterochromatin relative to euchromatin.</p>
<p>Together, we conclude that alt-EJ repair relies on primers and microhomologies closer to the cut site to initiate and complete alt-EJ repair in heterochromatin, resulting in SD-MMEJ repair with smaller deletions.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Previous studies identified a clear role of the DNA sequence in affecting alt-EJ repair, but the role of the chromatin state in influencing alt-EJ remains poorly explored. Recent studies showed that lamin-associated silenced chromatin and H3K27me3-enriched chromatin interfere with cNHEJ while enabling MMEJ. However, no previous study directly addressed how alt-EJ repair operates in pericentromeric heterochromatin, a large region of the genome mostly composed of repeated DNA sequences, subject to epigenetic silencing by H3K9me2/3, characterized by phase separation, and mostly not associated with the nuclear periphery. There was also no clear understanding of whether chromatin states affect SD-MMEJ repair. To address these questions, here we use the DR-<italic>white</italic> repair reporter inserted in a euchromatic locus and several new locations in pericentromeric heterochromatin and investigate DSB repair responses in these contexts. We established an experimental system to induce damage in male spermatogonia, resulting in DSBs in a uniform population of actively dividing mitotic cells. With this setup, DNA sequence and cell cycle phases are the same for all the DR-<italic>white</italic> insertions analyzed, removing these factors as potential sources of variability in repair pathways. Our studies revealed a higher frequency of HR usage in heterochromatin relative to euchromatin. In addition, we identified a higher frequency of usage of microhomologies close to the cut site for SD-MMEJ repair in heterochromatin, resulting in smaller deletions. Together, these studies are consistent with the model that DSB repair is less mutagenic in heterochromatin than in euchromatin.</p>
<p>Detecting a higher frequency of HR repair in heterochromatin relative to euchromatin is in agreement with previous studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human cells that suggested a preferential usage of HR for heterochromatin repair, when both HR and NHEJ are available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. However, this result is not consistent with other studies in flies using the DR-<italic>white</italic> reporter, where a similar frequency of HR was detected between euchromatic and heterochromatic insertions of the cassette [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. A possible reason for this discrepancy lies in the amount of silencing present in the DR-<italic>white</italic> cassette across different insertions used in the two studies. All DR-<italic>white</italic> insertions used for the study described here were exceptionally silenced, as demonstrated by the fact that HR products (<italic>i.e.,</italic> red-eyes) could only be revealed by crossing the F1 progeny with <italic>su(var)205+/-</italic> flies. This was not the case for heterochromatic DR-<italic>white</italic> insertions used in the previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>], consistent with a higher level of expression of the cassette.</p>
<p>Additionally, the induction of DSBs in spermatogonia provides unique advantages to the study of HR repair. First, these cells are mitotically dividing, resulting in a high number of cells in S/G2 with active HR repair (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). In addition, having a uniform population of cells introduces less variability in the system, and the lack of ‘jackpot’ events further limits noise. In agreement, we found more consistency in the frequency of HR outcomes across different experiments relative to what was previously shown with a Ub promoter-driven I-SceI in the germline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>], which likely facilitates the identification of differences across distinct DR-<italic>white</italic> insertions.</p>
<p>What mechanisms promote HR repair in heterochromatin still needs to be defined. An interesting possibility is that high levels of HP1 promote resection in heterochromatin, similar to the role of transient HP1 deposition previously described in human euchromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>]. Consistent with this hypothesis, live imaging of cultured cells showed that ionizing-radiation (IR)-induced repair foci of the ssDNA/RPA-associated proteins ATRIP and TopBP1 form faster and appear brighter in heterochromatin relative to euchromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>].</p>
<p>Our analysis of mutagenic-EJ repair revealed a high frequency of SD-MMEJ-consistent events, in agreement with previous studies with the DR-<italic>white</italic> reporter and I-SceI expression in the germline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. However, we detected a much broader set of SD-MMEJ and MMEJ-consistent repair junctions than in previous studies with the same reporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>], suggesting that our experimental setup with <italic>Bam</italic>-dependent induction of I-SceI is particularly suitable for detecting microhomology-driven mutagenic EJ. This could be due to the frequent mitotic divisions occurring in spermatogonia, given that mutagenic EJ is a preferred pathway to repair DSBs remaining in the genome upon mitotic entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>], and that I-SceI induction in these cells induces continuous cuts until a mutagenic (terminal) event occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>].</p>
<p>Interestingly, we detected significant variability in the type of alt-EJ repair pathway prevailing at each heterochromatic site, with MMEJ prevailing at Het3 and snap-back SD-MMEJ prevailing at Het1 and Het2. This suggests that factors other than the epigenetic composition, sequence composition, cell cycle phase, and association with the heterochromatin domain and its phase separated state, might be important to balance the frequency of SD-MMEJ and MMEJ mechanisms.</p>
<p>Alternatively, transient epigenetic changes and/or transcription in spermatogonia might affect this balance. For example, Het1 is located in a lncRNAs, while Het4 is inserted in a natural transposable element (TE) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref> and <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Suppl. Table 1</xref>), and low levels of transcripts have been detected at these locations in testis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>] (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 4</xref>). Similarly, Het2 is associated with low levels of miRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>] (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 4</xref>). Thus, an interesting possibility is that temporary or partial opening of the DR-<italic>white</italic> insertions occurs at these sites, influencing repair outcomes. In this light, the completely silenced state of Het3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>] (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig 5</xref>) might be the reason why MMEJ is particularly efficient at this site, suggesting MMEJ as a predominant mutagenic-EJ pathway operating in highly repeated and highly silenced heterochromatin.</p>
<p>Despite these differences, we also uncovered a general preference for the use of repeat motifs closer to the cut site in heterochromatin relative to euchromatin, resulting in smaller deletions. The reasons for this distinctive behavior remains unknown. It is tempting to speculate that features linked to a more compact chromatin or the phase separated state of the heterochromatin domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>] affect end-processing and/or repair protein accessibility to facilitate the use of microhomologies close to the cut site for SD-MMEJ repair.</p>
<p>Polθ uses a scanning mechanism to identify microhomologies near DSB ends, binding to and moving bidirectionally from the 3’ end [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>]. Our data suggest that the initial binding of Polθ to the ssDNA is particularly affected in heterochromatin, resulting in the use of a primer sequence P2 closer to the cut site relative to euchromatin. The Polθ scanning process seems to be also affected although to a lesser extent, with identification of homologies (Repeat Motif 2) typically close to the cut site for the most frequent repair outcomes.</p>
<p>A possible explanation for the association of Polθ closer to the cut site is the availability of shorter stretches of ‘naked’ ssDNA, <italic>e.g.,</italic> as a result of less resection or less/weaker RPA association nearby the DSB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>]. We tend to favor the second hypothesis, given that heterochromatic DSBs also experience more frequent HR relative to euchromatin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), which relies on resection. In addition, resection typically initiates through the formation of a nick positioned ∼30 bp from the cut site, generated by the Mre11 endonuclease, and which is followed by Mre11-dependent 3’-5’ exonuclease activity to resect the DNA back toward the break [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>]. The amount of ssDNA generated through this ‘short-range’ resection is sufficient to explain most alt-EJ repair events detected in both euchromatin and heterochromatin, consistent with resection not playing a major role in the observed differences.</p>
<p>On the other hand, RPA-mediated coating of the ssDNA could differ between euchromatin and heterochromatin, resulting in shorter tracts of ssDNA available for the initial Polθ binding. RPA has also been shown to bind ssDNA in distinct conformations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>] (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>]), resulting in different coverage of the ssDNA and distinct strength of association with the DNA. Polθ is able to remove RPA to enable the scanning process for alt-EJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. Thus, in heterochromatin shorter tracts of naked DNA at the cut site, looser association of RPA close to the cut site, or tighter RPA association further away from the cut site, might constrain the initial binding of Polθ to the region nearby the DSB and result in the use of more proximal primer P2 sequences. RPA association in a more ‘loose’ conformation or longer ssDNA tracts could also facilitate Polθ-mediated displacement of RPA for secondary structure formation, homology identification and annealing, resulting in more proximal repeat motif 1 usage. Intriguingly, RPA positioning is also potentially influenced by the position of the initial nick generated during resection. Specifically, studies in yeast showed that the Mre11 nicking activity occurs at a more distal site in active regions relative to silenced regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>], which could affect RPA cooperative binding along the ssDNA and result in shorter tracts of ‘naked’ ssDNA close to the cut site in heterochromatin. In addition, the ATPase activity of Polθ is necessary for larger homology scanning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>], thus suppression of this activity could also account for less homology search in heterochromatin.</p>
<p>In this view, RPA association or Polθ activity could also be influenced by the selective permeability properties of the phase separated heterochromatin domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], and regulated by post-translational modifications which are also subject to selective filtering in phase separated structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>].</p>
<p>Finally, an alternative mode of resection through Mre11 exonuclease activity has been described in human G1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>], which generates ssDNA from the DSB end. Should this mode of resection be available in the experimental system and genomic locations described here, the compact chromatin state could delay resection in heterochromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref>], favoring the use of repair motifs closer to the cut site. In agreement, nucleosomes have been shown to interfere with resection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>] and the more compact chromatin could exacerbate this barrier in heterochromatin.</p>
<p>Regardless of the exact mechanism, our study highlights the preferential use of HR or of alt-EJ pathways relying on microhomologies close to the cut site in heterochromatin, both of which reduce the mutagenic potential of repair mechanisms in heterochromatin. This could be advantageous, because about half of fly heterochromatin is composed of repeated DNA sequences where mutagenic events can quickly spread across satellites through recombinational processes that result in homogenization of the repeats, and which affect large genomic domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref>]. In addition, given the short size of the repeated unit for most <italic>Drosophila</italic> satellites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref>], alt-EJ mechanisms using sequences close to the cut site could be particularly effective in this domain.</p>
<p>In sum, this study generated new experimental approaches to study repair responses to site-specific DSBs, and particularly alt-EJ repair, which are broadly applicable in the field. It also provides the first systematic characterization of alt-EJ pathways in euchromatin and heterochromatin, identifying distinctive outcomes in heterochromatin. Future studies are needed to establish which properties of the heterochromatin domain are responsible for these differences, how repair mechanisms are affected, how manipulations of the chromatin state can be applied to control repair mechanisms in gene editing applications, and how disease states (including cancer and aging) can affect these responses threatening genome stability.</p>

<title>Crosses and experimental setup for the DR-<italic>white</italic> repair assay</title>
<p>Homozygous females containing DR-<italic>white</italic> on chromosome 2 were crossed to males containing BamP898-CFI on chromosome 3, for 3 days (F0) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). Importantly, in BamP898-CFI the presence of the Bam 3’UTR enables tight suppression of protein synthesis in spermatocytes through post-transcriptional regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref>]. This regulation is in addition to the transcriptional induction of Bam promoter that is limited to spermatogonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>], resulting in a very tight I-SceI expression only in spermatogonia and not in spermatocytes. After enclosure, 0-1 day old males containing DR-<italic>white</italic> and <italic>Bam</italic>-I-SceI were individually crossed to Su(var)205<sup>[1545</sup>]/Cyo females (F1).

Only about 40% of the flies scored as DsRed- was confirmed to contain a SSA product by PCR, the rest was identified as an EJ product after sequencing. This indicates that DsRed is not fully penetrant or easy to score in the F2 progeny with our experimental setup. w-DsRed+ flies were used for the molecular analysis of EJ-products as follows. Individual F2 males were processed for DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and I-SceI digestion, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>].

<title>Analysis of mutagenic EJ events</title>
<p>Sequences were trimmed to common start and end positions, and mapped to the reference DR-<italic>white</italic> sequence using Clustal Multiple Sequence Alignment tool. This alignment revealed sequences with insertions and deletions. Deletion junctions were analyzed using a previously published Python script [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>], classified as apparent blunt joins (ABJ) or microhomology junctions (MHJ), and further analyzed for SD-MMEJ consistency. Next, SD-MMEJ-consistent junctions were analyzed to identify repeat motifs of 4 or more bp in the repair product, and the corresponding loop-out (for direct repeat motifs) or snap-back (for inverted repeat motifs) mechanisms associated with their usage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>] (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 4</xref> for examples of SNAP-back events). For deletion junctions characterized by several motif-deletion pairs that could result in the same repair outcome (examples are shown in <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 6</xref>), each motif-deletion pair was assigned a weight assuming each pair is used with the same probability, as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. Indel sequences (containing novel sequences not present in the original construct, with or without deletions) were analyzed using a previously described R script to determine SD-MMEJ consistency and identify motifs, primers, and microhomologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. Notably, some insertions can be generated by several rounds of annealing, synthesis, and dissociation prior to the final pairing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>], but the computational models applied here assume that all SD-MMEJ-consistent events are generated from a single templated synthesis and microhomology annealing event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>].

<p>This manuscript describes <bold>valuable</bold> new findings on the impact of chromatin context on the outcomes of microhomology-mediated end joining of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), specifically a preference for DSB-proximal microhomologies in repair within a heterochromatic compared to a euchromatic locus. The authors develop the Drosophila spermatogonia as a model for repair at induced DSBs in a mitotically-active tissue and leverage this system to provide <bold>convincing</bold> evidence that the local environment impacts the preference for repair mechanism and outcome. The work could be strengthened by the use of additional euchromatin insertion(s) to robustly validate the findings.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this study, the authors investigated the mechanisms to repair DSBs induced in euchromatic (Eu) or heterochromatic (Het) contexts in Drosophila. They used a previously described reporter construct that can be used to differentiate between HR, SSA, and mutagenic end joining in response to an I-SceI-induced DSB. Different sub-pathways of end joining (NHEJ, MMEJ, and SD-MMEJ) could be further distinguished by DNA sequence analysis. The main findings of the study are: (1) HR repair is more frequent in Het than in the Eu context; (2) mutagenic EJ repair is more frequent than HR in both contexts; (3) sub-pathways of mutagenic EJ are variable even within the same chromatin domain; and (4) SD-MMEJ repair is associated with larger deletions in the Eu than within the Het compartment.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Overall, the study is well designed and the use of the Bam promoter to drive I-SceI removes some of the variability observed in previous studies. Importantly, the observation of different repair outcomes using the same reporter integrated at different genomic sites suggests that repair is influenced by chromatin state in addition to local DNA sequence context.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The main concern I have is the use of only one Eu site versus four for the Het insertions. Given the variability observed between the Het insertions, analysis of a second Eu insertion would give more confidence that the differences observed are significant. One puzzling finding is that HR is increased when the reporter is inserted within the Het domain relative to the Eu domain, suggesting more end resection, yet deletions are smaller for the Het insertions. Bright Ddc2/ATRIP focus formation at DSBs induced in the Het domain is consistent with extensive end resection in this compartment. The authors speculate that this finding could indicate differences in the density of RPA loading or recruitment of Pol theta near ends. I recognize that measuring RPA density on single-stranded DNA would be extremely challenging, but is it known if Pol theta is recruited to DSBs within the Het domain before they move to the periphery?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors seek to vary the integration site of a double-strand break repair reporter and assess how the chromatin state of different reporter integration sites impacts the contribution of various DSB repair pathways.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
It addresses repair in vivo. The reporter improves assay reliability (relative to previous fly DSB repair substrates) by inducing I-SceI within a more narrow and well-defined expression window. The authors' characterization of the spectrum of a-EJ products by sequencing is largely rigorous and thorough, and this often difficult to communicate data is presented in a clear and easily digested manner.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The use of the single euchromatic site undercuts their ability to generalize the impact of chromatin state. This concern is minor when considering repair by HR, as repair efficiency appears to vary little when comparing repair across the 4 different heterochromatic sites. Still, it is possible the single euchromatic site they used is an outlier in its sparing use of HR. The assessment of repair by alt-EJ is more problematic, though, since the character of repair appears to vary as much across the different heterochromatic sites as it does comparing a given heterochromatic site vs. the euchromatic site. For example, focusing on their central argument (decreased deletion during SD-MMEJ at heterochromatic sites), the difference between Het2 and all other sites appears to be more dramatic than the difference between Het1 and the single euchromatic site (Figure 5A, Supp Fig 2).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this manuscript, Chiolo and colleagues adapt a Drosophila induced-DSB repair outcome assay to the spermatogonia. In order to compare the outcomes in H3K9me-rich centromeric heterochromatin with a euchromatic site they use a cross to a silencing mutant to reveal the sequence changes in the reporter, which otherwise are not expressed. The authors corroborate that homologous recombination (HR) is up-regulated in this chromatin context, consistent with prior studies. Applying sequencing to mutagenic products the authors reveal context-dependent preferences in mutagenic end joining pathways and mechanisms, although these seem less categorical in terms of hetero- and euchromatin and instead sensitive to more subtle aspects of the local chromatin landscape. One theme, however, is that the microhomologies used for synthesis-dependent end joining are nearer to the induced DSB in heterochromatin than seen for the euchromatic DSB.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
1. The use of the mitotically active spermatogonia and transient expression of the I-SceI to induce the DSB mitigates some caveats of prior experimental approaches including the fact that the cells are universally mitotically active. This approach also enables the outcomes to be assayed in the next generation, which is necessary for reporters expressed within heterochromatin. Thus, this is a technological tool that will be useful to other groups.</p>
<p>2. The observations suggest that MMEJ within heterochromatin (inferred to be Pol theta-dependent) prefers to use microhomologies close to the DSB. This suggests that either DSB end resection or RPA loading/removal is modulated by chromatin context, which is a new finding.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
1. The observation that HR is preferred in heterochromatin has been documented in many prior systems.</p>
<p>2. Although the conclusions of the authors are well-supported by the data, the study is somewhat limited in mechanistic detail and would be strengthened by additional use of the genetic tools in the model system, particularly with regard to whether the preference for using microhomologies near the DSB in heterochromatin arises due to modulation of resection or RPA loading stability (the latter is the preferred interpretation of the authors, but goes untested). Nucleosome stability, presence of HP1, etc. seem attractive.</p>
<p>3. Given the variability observed for EJ pathway usage at the four heterochromatic genomic sites probed in the manuscript there is some concern that a single euchromatic site may not be sufficient for rigorous comparisons. This is particularly true because there seems to be little transcription at the &quot;euchromatic&quot; region (Fig. S5). Given that we do not know what matters to dictate the outcomes (epigenetic modifications and/or transcriptional status), this is concerning.</p>
<p>4. (Minor) Some caution should be stated in comparing the HR frequency between this system (low single digits) and prior induction/tissue systems (~20%) because the time domain of cut and repair cycles is vastly different.</p>
<p>5. (Minor) While there are certainly strengths to using the spermatogonia system, one also wonders if it might not have some unique biology given the importance of maintaining genome integrity in this tissue (e.g. the piRNA pathways to repress transposon mobilization). A comment on this point would be welcomed.</p>
<p>6. (Minor) The authors argue that alt-EJ is less mutagenic as a consequence of the observed use of microhomologues closer to the DSB, but what they really mean perhaps is that less sequence is lost? A mutagenic outcome can be equally deleterious in other cases if 1, 5, or 20+ bps are lost, depending on the context.</p>
