<title>Abstract</title><p>Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph<sup>+</sup>) leukemia is a fatal hematological malignancy. Although standard treatments with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have achieved remarkable success in prolonging patient survival, intolerance, relapse and TKI resistance remain serious issues for patients with Ph<sup>+</sup> leukemia. Here, we report a new leukemogenic process in which RAPSYN and BCR-ABL co-occur in Ph<sup>+</sup> leukemia, and RAPSYN mediates the neddylation of BCR-ABL. Consequently, neddylated BCR-ABL enhances the stability by competing its c-CBL-mediated degradation. Furthermore, SRC phosphorylates RAPSYN to activate its NEDD8 E3 ligase activity, promoting BCR-ABL stabilization and disease progression. Moreover, in contrast to <italic>in vivo</italic> ineffectiveness of PROTAC-based degraders, depletion of RAPSYN expression or its ligase activity decreased BCR-ABL stability and, in turn, inhibited tumor formation and growth. Collectively, these findings represent an alternative to tyrosine kinase activity for the oncoprotein and leukemogenic cells and generate a rationale of targeting RAPSYN-mediated BCR-ABL neddylation for the treatment of Ph<sup>+</sup> leukemia.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph<sup>+</sup>) leukemia is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by the reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosome 9 and 22, t (9;22) (q34.1; q11.2) (de <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Klein et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Deininger et al., 2000</xref>). This cytogenetic abnormality results in a <italic>BCR-ABL</italic> fusion gene, which encodes the chimeric protein BCR-ABL with enhanced tyrosine kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cortes et al., 2021</xref>). Based on its oncogenic role in Ph<sup>+</sup> leukemia, BCR-ABL has been regarded as the most pivotal target for Ph<sup>+</sup> leukemia therapy, especially for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have been the main treatment option for Ph<sup>+</sup> leukemia, remarkably prolonging the patients’ life span and improving their quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hochhaus et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jabbour and Kantarjian, 2020</xref>). However, most patients develop TKI resistance and relapse after long-term treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Braun et al., 2020</xref>). It is worth noting that the increase of BCR-ABL expression can affect the sensitivity to TKIs and eventually determine the rate of TKI resistance in patients with Ph<sup>+</sup> leukemia in addition to the mutations in the kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Jabbour et al., 2007</xref>). Mutations in the kinase domain can change the conformation of BCR-ABL, thus interfering with the binding between TKIs and BCR-ABL and resulting in decreased therapeutic efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lussana et al., 2018</xref>). In parallel, the increase of BCR-ABL expression can affect the sensitivity to TKIs and eventually determine the rate of disease progression and TKI resistance in patients with Ph<sup>+</sup> leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barnes et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, effective degradation of BCR-ABL could address the issues on TKI resistance and leukemia-initiating cells (LICs), and PROTAC-based protein degradation strategy may represent a new therapeutic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bekes et al., 2022</xref>). Currently, based on different ubiquitin E3 ligases, including VHL, CRBN and IAP, PROTAC-based degraders at nM level have shown significant degradation of BCR-ABL in CML cell lines, cell lines carrying mutations in BCR-ABL as well as patient-derived primary cells containing multiple BCR-ABL mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Demizu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Shimokawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Burslem et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). Unfortunately, the excellent cellular activity by the PROTAC-based degraders has not been able to translate to <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy, even in rare examples of xenografted mouse models (Zhao, Ren et al., 2019; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jiang et al., 2021a</xref>), resulting in uncertain usefulness of these degraders. Nonetheless, the unsatisfactory results are not really surprising because the underlying mechanism of elevated BCR-ABL expression remains largely unclear.</p>
<p>Receptor-associated protein of the synapse (RAPSYN) has been identified as a classic synaptic adaptor protein that binds to the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and several cytoskeleton-associated proteins, contributing to AChR clustering and neuromuscular junction (NMJ) formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Huh and Fuhrer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Witzemann et al., 2013</xref>). Later, RAPSYN was found to exert NEDD8 E3 ligase activity to catalyze the neddylation for AChR aggregation.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Li et al., 2016</xref>) Despite the extensive studies of RAPSYN in muscular and neuronal cells and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Legay and Mei, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Li et al., 2018</xref>), with regard to its involvement in leukemogenesis, there is no available information thus far except for our previous finding. Previously, RAPSYN was found to be located in the cytosol of the typical Ph<sup>+</sup> leukemia cell line K562 when a small molecule was used to probe its binding proteins using a proteomics approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Because of its newly identified E3 ligase activity for neddylation and its occurrence in the Ph<sup>+</sup> leukemia cell line, we speculated that RAPSYN might contribute to Ph<sup>+</sup> leukemia development through its enzymatic activity instead of only serving as a scaffolding protein.</p>
<p>As a type of post-translational modification (PTM), neddylation is sequentially catalyzed by the neuronal precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated protein 8 (NEDD8)-activating enzyme E1 (NAE1), NEDD8-conjugating enzyme E2 (UBE2M/UBC12 or UBE2F), and a substrate-specific NEDD8 E3 ligase to complete the covalent conjugation of NEDD8 to a lysine residue of its substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">van der Veen and Ploegh, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Enchev et al., 2015</xref>). The neddylation of proteins can be reversed by deneddylases such as NEDP1. In the last two decades, accumulating evidence indicated the strong involvement of dysregulated neddylation in tumor progression, neurodegenerative and cardiac diseases, aberrant immunoregulation and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Ying et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Yao et al., 2020</xref>), which rationalizes the modulation of neddylation as a feasible therapeutic strategy.</p>
<p>In this study, we report that RAPSYN is highly expressed along with BCR-ABL in patients with Ph<sup>+</sup> leukemia and promotes disease progression, presumably by stabilizing the BCR-ABL fusion protein <italic>via</italic> neddylation. The neddylation of BCR-ABL by RAPSYN subsequently competes its ubiquitination-dependent degradation to increase the stability of BCR-ABL. Additionally, the NEDD8 E3 ligase activity of RAPSYN can be substantially increased by SRC-mediated phosphorylation, leading to enhanced stability and activity of RAPSYN.</p>

<title>High protein levels of RAPSYN promoted Ph<sup>+</sup> leukemia progression</title>
<p>Prior to investigating the biological roles of RAPSYN in the pathogenesis of Ph<sup>+</sup> leukemia, its expression at both mRNA and protein levels was analyzed. Neither a publicly available database nor our collection of patient samples and cell lines showed a significant increase in mRNA levels (Figure1-figure supplement 1A-C). The protein levels of RAPSYN were substantially elevated in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of Ph<sup>+</sup> CML (#8-11) and the bone marrow of ALL (#7) patient samples in comparison to that of healthy donors (#1-6), which was in a direct accordance with the expression of BCR-ABL (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). This co-expression of RAPSYN and BCR-ABL was also found in Ph<sup>+</sup> cell lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting that the function of RAPSYN in Ph<sup>+</sup> leukemia could be closely related to BCR-ABL.</p>

<p>To examine the relationship between RAPSYN and Ph<sup>+</sup> leukemia progression, we first performed knockdown of its expression by using shRNAs. Marked reduction of RAPSYN levels and notable cytotoxicity were observed in all tested Ph<sup>+</sup> leukemia cells transduced with RAPSN shRNAs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, Figure1-figure supplement 1D-F), indicating the dependence on the presence and expression level of BCR-ABL. Conversely, exogenous expression of RAPSN rescued Ph<sup>+</sup> leukemia cells from shRNA-generated toxicity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Knockdown of RAPSYN also changed the phenotypes of Ph<sup>+</sup> leukemia cells, including proliferation, G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E-G</xref>, Figure1-figure supplement 1G, H<bold>)</bold>.</p>
<p>Next, we subcutaneously implanted empty body transduced sh<italic>RAPSN</italic>#3 or K562 cells into NCG mice to establish a cell line derived xenotransplantation mouse model (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). Tumor growth was significantly inhibited by RAPSYN silencing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I, J</xref>, Figure1-figure supplement 1I). Meanwhile, immunoblotting of tumor samples showed a notable downregulation of RAPSYN expression, along with the reduction of BCR-ABL levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1K</xref>). After knockout of RAPSYN for remarkable depletion of BCR-ABL expression in K562 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1L</xref>, Figure1-figure supplement 1K), these cells along with the empty vector-transduced K562 cells were intravenously injected into NCG mice to establish the leukemogenic mouse model (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). Consequently, the survival of tumor-bearing mice was profoundly prolonged by the knockout of RAPSYN compared to the controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1M</xref>). Altogether, our findings indicate that RAPSYN is highly expressed at protein level with the accordance to BCR-ABL in Ph<sup>+</sup> leukemia and its depletion results in inhibiting the progression of Ph<sup>+</sup> leukemia.</p>

<title>RAPSYN directly neddylated BCR-ABL</title>
<p>Previous reports determined that both nicotinic AChR subunit α<sub>7</sub> and muscarinic AChR subtypes M<sub>2</sub>, M<sub>3</sub>, and M<sub>4</sub> were involved in the the cell proliferation of K562 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cabadak et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Önder Narin et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, RAPSYN was found to exert its NEDD8 E3 ligase activity toward AChR in neuronal systems (Li, Cao et al., 2016). To determine whether RAPSYN functioned in a similar manner in leukemogenic cells, we investigated whether RAPSYN promoted Ph<sup>+</sup> leukemia progression through neddylation of AChRs. Despite AChR subunits α<sub>7</sub>, M<sub>2</sub>, M<sub>3</sub>, and M<sub>4</sub> were expressed in all tested cells, no change in their neddylation was observed upon RAPSYN ablation (Figure2-figure supplement 2A, B). On the basis of the co-expression of RAPSYN and BCR-ABL, we postulated that RAPSYN could specifically mediate neddylation of BCR-ABL to promote Ph<sup>+</sup> leukemia development.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, reciprocal immunoprecipitation was performed to reveal a strong interaction between RAPSYN and BCR-ABL in Ph<sup>+</sup> leukemia cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, Figure2-figure supplement 2C). Similar results were obtained with exogenous expression in HEK293T cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), further confirming the specific interaction of RAPSYN with BCR-ABL. Furthermore, GST pull-down assay with purified proteins displayed specific binding of GST-tagged RAPSYN to His-tagged BCR-ABL (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), indicating that BCR-ABL is the primary target of RAPSYN-mediated neddylation. Domain mapping revealed that the Δ1 domain (1-927 aa) of BCR-ABL was responsible for the interaction with RAPSYN (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we studied whether RAPSYN could directly mediate BCR-ABL neddylation. Preeminent BCR-ABL neddylation was detected in all Ph<sup>+</sup> leukemia cell lines (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>, Figure2-figure supplement 2D). Treatment with the NAE1 inhibitor, MLN4924, significantly dampened the neddylation of BCR-ABL (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>, Figure2-figure supplement 2E). In addition, the mutation of two glycine residues at the C-terminus of NEDD8 required for its covalent conjugating ability, or the co-expression of NEDP1 (NEDD8-specific protease 1) essentially diminished the neddylation of BCR-ABL (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G, H</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>, we co-expressed either WT-RAPSYN or its C366A mutant along with BCR-ABL and NEDD8, revealing that mutation of Cys to Ala at the catalytic residue C366 significantly decreased the neddylation level of BCR-ABL. Additionally, knockout of RAPSYN abrogated BCR-ABL neddylation in the cells, and this effect was restored by transduction of <italic>RAPSN</italic> cDNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>). These results were further corroborated by <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, which showed that BCR-ABL could hardly be neddylated in the absence of RAPSYN (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K</xref>). Consistently, the amount of neddylated BCR-ABL was markedly reduced in tumors generated by K562 cells transfected with sh<italic>RAPSN</italic>#3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2L</xref>), indicating an essential role of the ligase activity of RAPSYN in BCR-ABL neddylation.</p>
<p>In addition, neither overall BCR-ABL expression nor its neddylation levels were affected after the knockdown of AChRs (Figure2-figure supplement 2F). Similarly, modulation of AChR activities and their downstream PKC-RAS-ERK and JAK2-AKT signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kawamata et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aydin et al., 2013</xref>) by either an agonist (carbachol) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jakubik et al., 2008</xref>) or antagonists (benzethonium and homatropine) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Durieux and Nietgen, 1997</xref>) did not alter the expression or neddylation status of BCR-ABL (Figure2-figure supplement 2G, H).</p>
<p>Subsequently, we tried to identified specific modification sites on BCR-ABL. The purified proteins were used for <italic>in vitro</italic> neddylation reactions, and the target bands were digested with trypsin for LC-MS/MS analyses. Eight lysine residues were found to be potential NEDD8 accepting sites in BCR-ABL (Figure2-figure supplement 3). To confirm these modification sites, a series of individual Lys-to-Arg mutants were generated. Except for K257, neddylation levels of BCR-ABL at other candidate sites were all significantly reduced, confirming the modification sites of these Lys residues (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2M</xref>).</p>

<title>RAPSYN attenuated c-CBL-mediated BCR-ABL ubiquitination and degradation</title>

<p>To clarify the molecular basis of the battle between BCR-ABL neddylation and its ubiquitination, we detected that whether RAPSYN competes for binding to BCR-ABL with c-CBL, a reported E3 ligase mediating BCR-ABL ubiquitin-proteasome degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mao et al., 2010</xref>). As a result, exogenous expression of RAPSYN interfered with the interactions between BCR-ABL and c-CBL, whereas RAPSYN ablation in K562 cells promoted c-CBL binding to BCR-ABL (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H, I</xref>). These data indicate that RAPSYN competes with c-CBL for binding to BCR-ABL, leading to subsequent BCR-ABL neddylation to enhance BCR-ABL stability by counteracting its proteasomal degradation.</p>

<title>SRC-mediated phosphorylation stabilized RAPSYN by repressing its proteasomal degradation</title>
<p>SRC-family protein tyrosine kinases are capable of phosphorylating RAPSYN in neuronal system, among which SRC exerts the strongest function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Mohamed and Swope, 1999</xref>). In addition, SRC has been shown to be highly expressed in primary CML cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). We then studied whether SRC acts as an upstream regulator to mediate RAPSYN. SRC inhibition with saracatinib or shRNA not only significantly downregulated phosphorylated (Tyr418) SRC, but also inhibited the phosphorylation of endogenous RAPSYN, resulting in a substantial decline in its protein level, whereas heterologous expression of <italic>SRC</italic> increased RAPSYN phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-C</xref>, Figure4-figure supplement 5A). Furthermore, <italic>in vitro</italic> incubation with recombinant RAPSYN, SRC, and ATP resulted in strong phosphorylation of RAPSYN, which could be fully abrogated by saracatinib treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). LC-MS/MS analyses indicated that Tyr residues at positions 59, 152, and 336 in RAPSYN are potential phosphorylation sites by SRC (Figure4-figure supplement 5B). Then, after mutagenesis of these sites from Tyr to Phe, Y336, an evolutionarily conserved Tyr residue, was confirmed to be the primary site of RAPSYN phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>, Figure4-figure supplement 5C). As SRC has no effect on <italic>RAPSN</italic> mRNA levels (Figure4-figure supplement 5D, E), implying that SRC-mediated phosphorylation also affects RAPSYN stability. In fact, Ph<sup>+</sup> leukemia cells were treated with saracatinib, SRC silencing or mutation of the key phosphorylation site significantly accelerated the diminishment of RAPSYN expression following CHX treatment, conversely, expressing exogenous SRC cDNA prolonged the half-life of RAPSYN (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F-I</xref>).</p>

<title>Phosphorylated RAPSYN potentiated its NEDD8 E3 ligase activity and promoted BCR-ABL stabilization</title>
<p>To dissect the role of SRC-mediated phosphorylation of RAPSYN, we tested whether phosphorylation of RAPSYN at Y336 affects its ligase activity.

<p>Balanced protein synthesis and degradation are pivotal for maintaining protein homeostasis and normal cellular function. Currently, a variety of degraders for BCR-ABL by PROTAC strategy have been reported (Demizu, Shibata et al., 2016; Lai, Toure et al., 2016; Shimokawa, Shibata et al., 2017; Zhao, Ren et al., 2019; Burslem, Schultz et al., 2019; Liu, Mi et al., 2022;), and this approach for the degradation of BCR-ABL has appeared to be effective on overcoming drug-resistance in various cell lines (Demizu, Shibata et al., 2016; Jiang, Wang et al., 2021a). However, very few reports with <italic>in vivo</italic> data in animal models have shown that the efficacy is way far from satisfactory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jiang et al., 2021a</xref>), due likely to the inherited limitations of the degraders, such as unfavored physiochemical properties, significant off-target effects, various safety issues and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Li and Song, 2020</xref>; Bekes, Langley et al., 2022). On the other hand, neddylation is a crucial type of PTM that modifies multiple Lys residues in BCR-ABL, competing with and shielding this oncoprotein from ubiquitination-mediated degradation, which provides a reasonable explanation on the poor <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy of PROTAC-based degraders for BCR-ABL. Meanwhile, accumulating evidence has shown that targeting the neddylation process could be an appealing strategy for anticancer therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Bhalla and Fiskus., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">McGrail et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Norton et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Xie et al., 2021</xref>). MLN4924, a NEDD8-activating E1 enzyme inhibitor, has been shown to inhibit the survival of both wild-type (WT) and T315I-BCR-ABL leukemia cells as well as leukemia-initiating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bahjat et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Guo et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, clinical trials of MLN4924 in combination with anticancer agents in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have progressed to phase II (NCT03745352 and PEVENAZA [NCT04266795]) and III (PANTHER[NCT03268954] and PEVOLAM[NCT04090736]). However, the neddylation system works in a substrate- and context-dependent manner, which essentially defines its role in tumorigenesis as anti or pro, particularly relying on the substrate specificity of the NEDD8 E3 ligase. Neddylation can either facilitate ubiquitination-dependent degradation of its substrates, such as EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Oved et al., 2006</xref>) and c-SRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lee et al., 2018</xref>), or enhance protein stability in the cases of HuR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Embade et al., 2012</xref>) and TGF-β type II receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Zuo et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the antitumor effects of MLN4924 are the integrative outcome of inhibiting more <italic>pro</italic>- than <italic>anti</italic>-tumorigenic neddylation activities in the reported tumor types. Recent studies uncovered that neddylation could also inhibit tumor progression and MLN4924 stimulates tumor sphere formation and wound healing as well as promotes glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>; Zhou, Jiang et al., 2019; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Zhou and Sun, 2019</xref>). Therefore, rather than suppressing the entire neddylation system to affect a wide range of proteins, targeted inhibition of substrate-specific NEDD8 E3 ligase, such as RAPSYN, might offer a potential therapeutic opportunity for more elegant anticancer intervention with fewer side effects.</p>
<p>Functional studies on RAPSYN have focused on its contribution to neuromuscular transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Xing et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Xing et al., 2020</xref>). To date, whether RAPSYN is involved in biological processes other than the formation and maintenance of NMJ remains poorly understood. In this study, we found that RAPSYN promoted disease progression by neddylating BCR-ABL for its resistance to c-CBL-mediated proteasomal degradation. Intriguingly, although AChRs, the primary substrates of RAPSYN E3 ligase activity in neural and muscle cells, were also found to be expressed in Ph<sup>+</sup> leukemia cells, they were not identified as substrates of RAPSYN for neddylation, suggesting highly orchestrated tissue-specificity of the RAPSYN enzymatic activity on its substrates.</p>
<p>It is well known that the generation of BCR-ABL fusion protein is a decisive characteristic of Ph<sup>+</sup> leukemia (de <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Klein et al., 1982</xref>). Aside from the occurrence of RAPSYN in patients with Ph<sup>+</sup> leukemia, the present study revealed a fascinating finding that BCR-ABL expression levels were correlated with those of RAPSYN, demonstrating the specificity of RAPSYN-mediated neddylation of BCR-ABL. Moreover, as a new type of PTM for BCR-ABL, RAPSYN-mediated neddylation was found to compete c-CBL-mediated ubiquitination, causing a reduction in BCR-ABL degradation. Given the fact that the increase of BCR-ABL expression can affect the sensitivity to TKIs and eventually determine the rate of TKI resistance and LIC population in patients with Ph<sup>+</sup> leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Issaad et al., 2000</xref>; Barnes, Palaiologou et al., 2005), effective degradation of BCR-ABL is an alternative opportunity for the treatment. Although recent studies have greatly advanced our understanding of the regulation of BCR-ABL degradation (Burslem, Schultz et al., 2019; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Shibata et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Jiang et al., 2021b</xref>), most reported modulatory proteins are not ideal for translation to clinical settings because of their pivotal roles in sustaining normal hematological functions. In contrast, RAPSYN was nearly unexpressed in the blood of healthy donors. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that the inhibition of RAPSYN expression could lead to cytotoxicity in Ph<sup>+</sup> leukemia with high specificity and marginal side effects. Furthermore, our present results showed that knockdown of RAPSYN significantly increased the sensitivity of leukemia cells to saracatinib, implying that a combination of RAPSYN inhibition and TKI treatment can effectively control mutations and LIC-derived TKI resistance in Ph<sup>+</sup> leukemia.</p>
<p>In summary, our work has uncovered the pivotal role that RAPSYN exerts its NEDD8 E3 ligase activity in neddylating and stabilizing BCR-ABL in the pathogenesis of Ph<sup>+</sup> leukemia and thus delineate it as a potential novel therapeutic target for the treatment of Ph<sup>+</sup> leukemia. More importantly, our results shed a light on future investigations that may help to extend to other cancer types for broadening our understanding of RAPSYN’s involvement in hematology and oncology.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Zhao et al describes the identification of RAPSYN, a NEDD8 E3 ligase previously studied for its role in acetylcholine receptor clustering and neuromuscular junction formation, as a factor promoting the stabilisation of the BCR-ABL oncogene in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) cells. The authors have identified that NEDDylation of BCR-ABL by RAPSYN antagonises its poly-ubiquitin and subsequent proteasome-based degradation. Knocking down RAPSYN with shRNA led to increased poly-ubiquitination and faster turnover of BCR-ABL. Furthermore, they describe that SRC-dependent phosphorylation of RAPSYN facilitates its NEDD8-ligase activity.</p>
<p>The authors' findings are primarily rooted in a series of well-conducted in vitro experiments using two CML cell lines, K562 and MEG-01. While the findings are interesting and novel, further work to corroborate these findings in primary CML samples would have greatly strengthened the potential real-world relevance of these discoveries. The authors appear to have some PBMCs from primary CML patients and a BM sample from a Ph+ ALL in which they performed western blot analyses (Fig 1). Couldn't these samples have been used to at least confirm some of the key discoveries? For example, the neddylation of BCR-ABL, or; sensitivity of primary leukemic cells to RAPSYN knockdown, and/or; phosphorylation of RAPSYN by SRC?</p>
<p>The authors initially interrogated a fairly dated (circa 2009) microarray-based primary dataset to show that the increase in RAPSYN is primarily a post-transcriptional event, as mRNA levels are not different between healthy and CML samples. It would be interesting to see whether differences might be more readily seen in more recent RNA-seq datasets from CML patients, given the well-known differences in sensitivity between the two platforms. Additionally, I wonder if there would be transcriptional signatures of increased NEDDylation (or RAPSYN-induced NEDDylation) that could be interrogated in primary samples? Furthermore, there are proteomics datasets of CML cells made resistant to TKIs (through in vitro selection experiments) that could be interrogated for independent validation of the authors' discoveries. For example: from K562 cells, PMID: 30730747 or PMID: 34922009).</p>

<p>In this study the authors aim to elucidate the role of RAPSYN in BCR-ABL-mediated leukemogenesis. RAPSYN is mainly known as a scaffolding protein for anchoring acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) to the cytoskeleton in muscle cells, facilitating AChR clustering through neddylation (Li et al., 2016). The authors demonstrate, through a broad and rigorous array of biochemical assays, that RAPSYN also plays a crucial role in the neddylation of BCR-ABL in leukemia cells. Their results indicate that this process shields BCR-ABL from ubiquitination and subsequent degradation, likely through a mechanism involving competition for binding with the BCR-ABL ubiquitin ligase c-CBL. In addition, the authors delve into the regulatory mechanisms underlying RAPSYN stability, demonstrating that it is enhanced through phosphorylation by SRC. This discovery further deepens our understanding of the complex dynamics of the molecular interactions that regulate BCR-ABL stability in leukemia.</p>
<p>To confirm the physiological significance of their findings, the authors effectively utilize cell viability assays and in vivo models. The integration of these approaches lends strength and validity to their conclusions.</p>
<p>The implications of the findings presented in this study are important, particularly in relation to our understanding of the pathogenesis and potential therapeutic strategies for Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemias. By illuminating the role of RAPSYN in the regulation of BCR-ABL stability, this research potentially uncovers avenues for the development of targeted therapies, making a significant contribution to the field.</p>
<p>Most of the conclusions drawn in this paper are well supported by data, but some aspects of the data need to be clarified and extended:</p>
<p>1. The authors propose that targeting RAPSYN in Ph+ leukemia could have a high therapeutic index, suggesting that inhibition of RAPSYN may lead to cytotoxicity in Ph+ leukemia with high specificity and minimal side effects. To substantiate this assertion, the authors should investigate the impact on cell viability upon RAPSYN knockdown in non-Ph leukemic cell lines or HS-5 cells (similar to Figure 1C), despite their lower RAPSYN protein levels.</p>
<p>2. The authors intriguingly show that the protein levels of RAPSYN are significantly enriched in Ph+ patient samples and cell lines (Figure 1A,B), even though the mRNA levels remain unchanged (Supplementary Figure 1 A-C). This observation merits a clear explanation in the context of the presented results. The data in the manuscript does imply a feedforward loop mechanism (Figure 7), where BCR-ABL activates SRC, which subsequently stabilizes RAPSYN, which in turn helps protect BCR-ABL from c-CBL-mediated degradation. If this is the working hypothesis, it would be beneficial for the reader to see supporting evidence.</p>
<p>3. The authors present compelling evidence to suggest that RAPSYN may possess direct NEDD8-ligase activity on BCR-ABL. To strengthen this claim, it may be valuable to conduct further assays involving a ligase-deficient mutant, such as C366A, beyond its use in Figure 2J. Incorporating this mutant into the in vitro assay illustrated in Figure 2K, for instance, could offer substantial validation for the claim. In addition, showing whether the ligase-deficient mutant is capable of phenocopying the phosphorylation-mutant Y336F, as showcased in Figures 5E, F, and 6D, F, would be beneficial.</p>
<p>4. The observations presented in Figures 6 C-G require additional clarification. Notably, there are discrepancies in relative cell viability effects in K562 cells, and to some extent in MEG-01 cells, under conditions that are indicated as being either identical or highly similar. For instance, this inconsistency is observable when comparing the left panels of Figure 6C and 6D in the case of NC overexpression + shSRC#2, and the left panels of Figure 6E and 6G with NC overexpression or shNC, respectively. Listing potential causes of these discrepancies would strengthen the overall validity of the findings and their subsequent interpretation.</p>
<p>5. Throughout the manuscript, immunoblots which showcase immunoprecipitations of BCR-ABL or His-BCR-ABL depict poly-neddylation (e.g. Figures 2E-M, 3D-G, and 5A-E) and poly-ubiquitination (e.g. Figures 3D-G) patterns/smears where these patterns seem to extend below the molecular weight of BCR-ABL. To enhance clarity, it would be valuable for the authors to provide an explanation in the text or the figure legend for this observation. Is it reflective of potential degradation of BCR-ABL or is there another explanation behind it?</p>
