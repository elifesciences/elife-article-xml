<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Sarcomeres are the basic contractile units within cardiac myocytes, and the collective shortening of sarcomeres aligned along myofibrils generates the force driving the heartbeat. The alignment of the individual sarcomeres is important for proper force generation, and misaligned sarcomeres are associated with diseases including cardiomyopathies and COVID-19. The actin bundling protein, α-actinin-2, localizes to the “Z-Bodies” of sarcomere precursors and the “Z-Lines” of sarcomeres, and has been used previously to assess sarcomere assembly and maintenance. Previous measurements of α-actinin-2 organization have been largely accomplished manually, which is time-consuming and has hampered research progress. Here, we introduce sarcApp, an image analysis tool that quantifies several components of the cardiac sarcomere and their alignment in muscle cells and tissue. We first developed sarcApp to utilize deep learning-based segmentation and real space quantification to measure α-actinin-2 structures and determine the organization of both precursors and sarcomeres/myofibrils. We then expanded sarcApp to analyze “M-Lines” using the localization of myomesin and a protein that connects the Z-Lines to the M-Line (titin). sarcApp produces 33 distinct measurements per cell and 24 per myofibril that allow for precise quantification of changes in sarcomeres, myofibrils, and their precursors. We validated this system with perturbations to sarcomere assembly. Surprisingly, we found perturbations that affected Z-Lines and M-Lines differently, suggesting that they may be regulated independently during sarcomere assembly.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The sarcomere is the fundamental unit of contraction in striated muscle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Sarcomeres individually contract to generate a force, and sarcomeres organize and align within myofibrils to augment that force. These forces enable skeletal muscle to coordinate organism-level locomotion and cardiac muscle to drive the heartbeat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Sarcomere structure and alignment is critical to muscle function, and dysfunctional sarcomeres and myofibrils have been implicated as causes of disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Since the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century, the question of how sarcomeres are assembled and subsequently organized into higher-order myofibrils has been a much-debated topic, with multiple separate lines of research emerging to support a small host of potential models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Generally, the models of sarcomere assembly that are backed by the most data posit that sarcomeres arise from either i) a “parts-wise” assembly, where precursors of unique sarcomeric regions (e.g., the thin (actin) or thick (myosin) filament) are first assembled separately, then “stitched” together to generate the final structure (i.e., Stitching Model) or ii) a more direct assembly, where a precursor forms that resembles a sarcomere but has a subset of non-sarcomeric proteins that are later replaced by sarcomeric proteins (i.e., Pre-myofibril Model)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Recently, our group has shown that sarcomeres descend directly from <underline>m</underline>uscle <underline>s</underline>tress <underline>f</underline>ibers (MSFs), with our data supporting a subset of predictions made by both models, but not necessarily favoring either model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. All models of sarcomere assembly are currently limited in their testability because the field lacks a tractable workflow for high throughput analysis.</p>
<p>Recently, our lab has shown that human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac myocytes (hiCMs) can be harnessed as a tractable model for routine imaging of sarcomere assembly in live CMs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. In our assay, hiCMs assemble sarcomeres de novo, and directly from MSFs, within 24 hours. Despite having powerful tools for imaging, our analysis workflow is still hampered by technical bottlenecks related to i) image binarization and ii) manual quantification. Binarization via classical methods relying on image pixel intensity (e.g., Otsu’s method) is often performed manually—slowly—and can become muddled by a multitude of factors, including i) high-intensity artifacts related to nonspecific localization of antibodies, ii) low-intensity staining due to high background levels/noise, and/or iii) multi-valent interactions by the target protein itself occluding the specific structure-of-interest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, we find that even well-binarized, high-resolution images can require several hours of manual quantification per image.</p>
<p>Deep learning has emerged as a powerful potential solution for rapid, accurate binarization of complex greyscale images. Deep learning-based binarization can be accomplished using a framework called a U-Net<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. A U-Net trains a deep learning model to convert images into only background (noise) and foreground (signal) by matching images to expert-annotated “ground truth” binaries – i.e., images manually annotated by the user. Compared to manually performed binarization, U-Net offers the advantages of superior accuracy and speed, but at a high upfront cost, since implementation of a U-Net requires a user with advanced background in mathematics, experience with machine learning, and proficiency in writing software code<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>While a sarcomere contains 100+ proteins, the field has often resorted to “proxying” sarcomere assembly by staining, often exclusively, for α-actinin-2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. α-actinin-2 marks the sarcomeric Z-Lines, which border the sarcomeric contractile machinery (i.e., the thin actin and thick myosin filaments)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. In the last decade, several methods for automatic quantification of Z-Lines have emerged, with the most widely used methods relying on calculations made in frequency space (i.e., by using a Fourier transformation of the image)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. While frequency space calculations can detect repeating patterns created by adjacent Z-Lines, current methods yield no information about Z-Lines in real space (e.g., number, size, spacing, or organization within myofibrils), about sarcomere precursors, or about any sarcomeric components other than Z-Lines. Moreover, it is not yet clear quite how the assembly of Z-Lines themselves relates either spatially or temporally to the assembly of other sarcomere components, or vice versa.</p>
<p>Here, we present a high throughput, automated, and non-biased quantification scheme for sarcomere assembly. Our approach is two-pronged and includes a unique method for both 1) rapid, accurate binarization of images that can consistently separate true signal from noise and structures-of-interest from those that are not-of-interest and 2) automated quantification of relevant sarcomeric and pre-sarcomeric structures within the binarized images. Towards 1), we have developed “yoU-Net”, a U-Net-based framework with a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) that enables a user with little to no experience to binarize images with the power and flexibility afforded by deep learning. We demonstrate that yoU-Net can accurately binarize images of CM sarcomeres and sarcomere precursors using multiple unique sarcomere stains. Towards 2), we have developed “sarcApp”, a software that automatically annotates and calculates 50+ unique descriptive outputs of sarcomeres and sarcomere precursors in real space using binarized images. Using yoU-Net and sarcApp, we demonstrate that some perturbations to sarcomere assembly preferentially affect specific sarcomere components (e.g., M-Lines) more than others (e.g., Z-Lines). Our data emphasize the need for more high throughput studies into sarcomere assembly that includes multiple sarcomere components, and altogether point to a disjointed or modular sarcomere assembly program within CMs that is more nuanced than was previously believed. The tools presented herein will facilitate future high throughput studies to develop a more mature and complex model of sarcomere assembly.</p>

<title>yoU-Net enables user-friendly binarization of dynamic grayscale images</title>
<p>Our overarching goal was to develop a method for fast and accurate quantification of sarcomeres within hiCMs using our sarcomere assembly assay. We faced two primary bottlenecks in our workflow, the first of which was a slow and cumbersome image binarization process. Binarization facilitates image quantification by converting the complex, raw image of a biological specimen into a far simpler image containing only background (non-relevant information) and signal (relevant information). A well-binarized image should retain high fidelity to the original image but contain only the relevant structures of interest superimposed over a blank background. Individual pixels within a binary image are stripped of dynamic information present within the raw image and are reassigned to represent only either background or signal – binary images are therefore often represented in black (background) and white (signal).</p>
<p>Traditional methods of binarization fall short for images of sarcomeres and sarcomere precursors in hiCMs due to the dynamic range of pixel intensities present within the raw images. In images of hiCMs 24 hours after plating, sarcomere precursors and sarcomeres are each stained by α-actinin-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), but the Z-Lines of the sarcomeres are markedly brighter than the Z-Bodies of the precursor structures (i.e., muscle stress fibers (MSFs)). Classical, intensity-based binarization methods force a user to make a choice in this scenario – specifically, whether to accurately binarize based on gray-levels of the sarcomere precursors or of the sarcomeres themselves (without the consistent option for both). Classical Otsu-based thresholding (using FIJI) of a representative cell in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> shows that binarizing this cell according to Z-Lines oversaturates Z-Bodies into an inseparable clump (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, arrowhead), leaving a user unable to accurately quantify both structures from this single binary.</p>

</fig>
<p>Our lab was well-positioned to approach this problem by constructing a deep-learningbased model called a U-Net<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. A U-Net enables a user to train a deep-learning model to automatically binarize images with high precision and speed. Model “training” involves matching raw images to user-annotated binaries – called “ground truth” binaries – using a complex set of mathematical convolution/downsampling and deconvolution/upsampling steps. The architectural layout of a U-Net is represented by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>.</p>
<p>We constructed our own U-Net and trained it using 1000 training steps (100 epochs/steps of 10 iterations each) of hiCMs stained for α-actinin-2. After training, our U-Net can reliably and automatically predict high fidelity binaries of hiCM α-actinin-2 stains that are resistant to artifacts related to differences in pixel intensity and can accurately separate individual Z-Bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, arrowhead). Recognizing that other labs would benefit from the flexibility and accuracy of U-Net, we also wrote software encoding for a graphical user interface (GUI) to accompany our U-Net in the hopes of making it more user-friendly and broadly accessible. Our U-Net and GUI together are known as “yoU-Net” and are available, open source with details in the Supplement (Figure S1). We used yoU-Net to binarize images throughout the remainder of this study.</p>

<title>sarcApp quantifies muscle stress fibers, sarcomeres, and myofibrils</title>
<p>The next bottleneck within our workflow was the issue of manual quantification, which in some cases can require several hours for a single CM. A meaningful quantitative output of sarcomere assembly would discriminate between sarcomeres and sarcomere precursors (muscle stress fibers (MSFs)), and produce readouts for each. Sarcomere assembly involves the formation MSFs near the cell edge that give rise to sarcomeres typically closer to the cell center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Within MSFs are punctate α-actinin-2-containing structures termed “Z-Bodies”, which gradually elongate/concatenate over time and eventually transition into the Z-Lines of sarcomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). While the Z-Body to Z-Line transition exists along a continuum, it was necessary for us to define a binary transition point on the basis of α-actinin-2 structure length when a Z-Body “becomes” a Z-Line. We tasked individual lab members with independently annotating 10 images each to determine which structures constituted a Z-Body and which were Z-Lines. Together, we defined a potential Z-Line to be any α-actinin-2-containing structure with a length &gt;1.4μm, with all other structures being potential Z-Bodies. Because many organisms have variable sarcomere spacing and structure, this variable along with all others discussed (lengths, minimum number of structures, etc.) are customizable and can be easily re-defined by the user for their unique model system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Using our predefined size criterion for Z-Lines and Z-Bodies, we next desired a method capable of automated detection, measurement, and descriptive output of both structures. Towards this goal, we developed sarcApp, a software-based code that classifies each α-actinin-2 structure within a binary image as a Z-Line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-B</xref>) or Z-Body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C-D</xref>) and further assigns each to either a myofibril (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) or MSF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). All structures identified as potential Z-Lines are paired to other potential Z-Lines in the cell based on shape, orientation, and location, then assigned to myofibril based on orientation to other Z-Lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-B</xref>). Z-Lines which belong to a myofibril are considered “confirmed”. This eliminates singular α-actinin-2-positive adhesions. Next, each potential Z-Body is paired to other Z-Bodies based on shape and location, then assigned to an MSF based on orientation to other nearby Z-Bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C-D</xref>). Like with Z-Lines, only Z-Bodies which belong to an MSF are considered “confirmed”. After detecting, annotating/assigning, and measuring all potential Z-Lines and Z-Bodies within a given cell, sarcApp automatically compiles and generates three spreadsheets summarizing the data on a per-cell, per-myofibril, and per-MSF basis. Cell spreadsheets generated include myofibrils per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), Z-Lines per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), Z-Line lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), myofibril persistence lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), MSFs per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), Z-Bodies per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>), Z-Body lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>), and MSF persistence lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). Myofibril spreadsheets include analysis of myofibril organization within the cell by calculating the angle of each myofibril relative to the nearest cell edge (Figure M-O), as well as number of Z-Lines, average Z-Line spacing, persistence length, absolute angle of the myofibril long axis (considering the image edges as the X and Y axes), average Z-Line length, distance from the center point of the myofibril to the nearest parallel cell edge, absolute angle of the nearest cell edge, and relative angle of the myofibril to the edge (a measure of parallelism); all on a per individual myofibril basis. MSF spreadsheets include number of Z-Bodies, average Z-Body spacing, and persistence length for each MSF (Figure S3).</p>

</fig>
<p>sarcApp must take certain liberties to parametrize and predict MSF/myofibrillar structures within CMs. For example, Z-Lines are assigned to individual myofibrils in part by inter-Z-Line distance (which we define as being &lt;3 μm apart using centroid-to-centroid distance) but also by Z-Line long-axis angle (which we define as being within 30 degrees, accounting for cell curvature). These measurements are customizable, as some species have varied inter-Z-Line distance or varied cell curvature. We increase the computational speed of sarcApp by measuring Z-Lines spacing using the distance between each Z-Line centroids as opposed to parallel spacing, which can produce slightly different results (Figure S2A). sarcApp defines a myofibril as a structure with a linear collection of 4 or more Z-Lines (i.e., 3 sarcomeres). Potential Z-Lines that are not assigned to a myofibril are not quantified, as they could represent adhesions, which are also α-actinin-2-positive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Any structure with a long axis &lt;1.4 μm is defined as a potential Z-Body. Z-Bodies are assigned to MSFs with the criteria that the Z-Bodies are 1) &lt;3 μm apart and 2) have centroids that form a line within 30 degrees parallel to the edge, indicative of a typical Z-Body organization with MSF actin filaments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>To validate the functionality and accuracy of sarcApp, we paired our lab’s sarcomere assembly assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> with a well-established inhibitor of sarcomere assembly: Blebbistatin, a pan-myosin II inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. In brief, we trypsinized and re-plated human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac myocytes (hiCMs). During this process, the hiCMs lose and re-form their sarcomeres, allowing us to monitor sarcomere assembly. Because this assembly begins at the cell edge and moves rearward toward the cell center, a snapshot of a hiCM after 24 hours of spreading (once sarcomeres have begun to form and myofibrils begin to align) contains information on early, mid, and late sarcomere formation at the leading edge, behind the edge in the lamella, and toward the center of the cell, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Blebbistatin inhibits myosin II-based contractility and Blebbistatin-treated hiCMs exhibit reduced Z-Line assembly in our assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, S3-5), consistent with other reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Platinum-replica electron microscopy (EM) shows that Blebbistatin-treated hiCMs do not appear to have well-defined Z-Lines and have a disordered overall orientation of MSFs/myofibrils compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). As measured by sarcApp, hiCMs treated with Blebbistatin exhibited fewer myofibrils per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), fewer Z-Lines per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), decreased myofibril persistence length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), decreased Z-Line length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), and decreased overall size of all α-actinin-2-positive puncta/structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). sarcApp also reported that, while the myofibrils of control hiCMs are oriented mostly ~parallel to the nearest cell edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>; similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M-O</xref>), the myofibrils of Blebbistatin-treated hiCMs are more randomly oriented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), suggesting a disorganized assembly process. Altogether, these data generated by sarcApp are consistent with a wide range of previous studies showing that Blebbistatin inhibits sarcomere assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>sarcApp quantifies titin in hiCMs</title>
<p>Our next goal was to introduce additional quantitative modes of analysis to sarcApp that could be used concurrently with α-actinin-2-based quantification of Z-line assembly. Our focus was on other core components of the sarcomere which, like α-actinin-2, are thought to play an active role in assembly and can be stained and visualized using commercially available antibodies. Our group has shown previously that the protein titin can be used as a spatiotemporal indicator of myofibril maturation status in hiCMs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Antibodies to the titin I-band localize to both MSFs and sarcomeres in hiCMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Titin forms ringlike structures around the Z-Bodies of MSFs that are closer to the apparent sarcomere transition point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> shows our current model for how titin is oriented around Z-bodies during earlier stages of sarcomere assembly, forming rings. Likely, due to both antibody localization to the titin I-Band region and the ability of titin to bind both actin and the α-actinin-2 N-terminus, titin is oriented with the N-terminus toward the center of the Z-Body and the C-terminus radially oriented outward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>.

<p>yoU-Net-generated binaries of titin stains after training with annotated ground-truth binaries accurately recapitulate titin rings (MSFs) and titin doublets (sarcomeres) in hiCMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, S1D). We parametrized each titin-based structure into a quantitative scheme and have outfitted sarcApp with a modality for measuring titin. To determine the minimum length required for a potential titin doublet to be considered as part of a sarcomere, we co-stained hiCMs with both titin and α-actinin-2, and found that on average, titin doublets are 0.3 μm longer than the Z-Lines with which they associate. Thus, we set a lower boundary of titin doublet length at 1.7 μm (Z-lines: 1.4 μm). Closer inspection of titin images revealed that, in several cases, the titin I-Band signal “wraps” around the radial tip of Z-Lines, reminiscent of titin rings around Z-Bodies.</p>
<p>sarcApp accurately distinguishes between titin doublets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) and titin rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) and produces readouts for number of myofibrils doublets per cell, myofibril persistence length, doublet length, number of rings, ring diameter, ring aspect ratio, distance of doublets from the edge, and distance of rings from the edge. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4C-F</xref>). sarcApp is additionally equipped to incorporate a cell edge co-stain (e.g., actin or non-muscle myosin IIA or IIB) alongside titin to measure myofibril orientation and myofibril distance from edge since titin stains do not label the edge (similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2 M-O</xref>).</p>

<title>Blebbistatin affects myofibril orientation and doublet length, but not the periodicity of titin structures</title>
<p>We wished to use our sarcomere formation assay in the presence of Blebbistatin to quantify titin structure alignment using sarcApp. As before, hiCMs were re-plated in the presence of Blebbistatin for 24 hours, then fixed and stained for titin as well as phalloidin (F-actin) to aid in the visualization of MSFs. While F-actin in Blebbistatin-treated hiCMs is mostly punctate, titin rings and doublets can still be observed by eye around punctate actin with some degree of organization and periodicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). sarcApp-dependent quantification of myofibrils using titin revealed no significant differences in the numbers of myofibrils in hiCMs replated in moderate (50 μM) or high (100 μM) Blebbistatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), but found fewer and shorter titin doublets in high Blebbistatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C+D</xref>). sarcApp-based quantification of titin precursor rings within MSFs revealed no difference in absolute number of rings per cell with Blebbistatin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) but rings that were detected were significantly more rounded as indicated by a decreased aspect ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). sarcApp also detected that myofibrils as quantified by titin were mostly parallel to the edge in control cells but became more randomly aligned relative to the edge in Blebbistatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), consistent with sarcApp-dependent quantification of a-actinin-2. In summary, Blebbistatin treatment results in disarrayed and shorter titin doublets that are still capable of aligning into periodic myofibrillar structures.</p>

<title>sarcApp quantifies myomesin, a component of the M-Line, in hiCMs</title>
<p>Having equipped sarcApp to quantify two structures associated with Z-Line assembly in hiCMs, our next goal was to introduce a modality for M-Line assembly. The M-Line lies at the midline of the stack of myosin II filaments in the sarcomere and demarcates the midpoint between two Z-Lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). M-Lines in hiCMs can be stained using antibodies to the protein myomesin. Myomesin stains closely resemble α-actinin-2 Z-Line stains although myomesin is apparently absent from Z-Bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

<p>We equipped sarcApp to detect and measure myomesin M-Lines from yoU-Net-generated binaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) based on a scheme that resembles the one designed for Z-Lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). For myomesin, the M-Line must &gt;1.4 μm and adjacent to at least two other M-lines to be considered part of a myofibril (i.e., at least three M-lines per myofibril, as it could be inferred that such a myofibril would have at least four Z-lines). sarcApp-defined readouts using myomesin include myofibrils per cell, M-Lines per cell, myofibril persistence length, and M-Line lengths. As with titin, sarcApp is additionally equipped to incorporate a cell edge co-stain (e.g., actin or non-muscle myosin IIA or IIB) alongside myomesin to measure myofibril orientation and myofibril distance from cell edge since myomesin antibodies do not stain the edge (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M-O</xref>). To validate sarcApp as a tool to measure M-Lines, we stained myomesin in hiCMs exposed to Blebbistatin. Representative images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> show that control hiCMs exhibit elongated M-Lines while Blebbistatin-treated M-Lines appear truncated and punctate-like. sarcApp quantification matched observations made by eye, detecting fewer myofibrils per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) and M-Lines per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>) in Blebbistatin-treated hiCMs, as well as shortened M-Line length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>).

<p>After 24 hours, we observed by eye that both the Z-Lines and M-Lines of hiCMs depleted of α myosin II (<italic>MYH6</italic>) appeared to largely resemble those of controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). sarcApp-dependent quantification of each stain determined that α myosin II knockdown did not alter length of α-actinin-2 Z-lines, titin doublets, or M-lines, though one of the two siRNAs did result in increased numbers of Z-lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D-G</xref>). As with α myosin II, stains of β myosin II-depleted hiCMs (<italic>MYH7</italic>) also appeared to resemble those of controls by eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H-I</xref>) – however, sarcApp-based quantification revealed that hiCMs depleted of β myosin II assembled more abundant, but shorter Z-lines than controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J-K</xref>). Further, while sarcApp detected no change in titin doublet lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7L</xref>), M-lines were detected as being significantly shorter than controls following β myosin II knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7M</xref>).

<p>After 24 hours, we observed by eye that both the α-actinin-2 and titin stains of myomesin-depleted hiCMs resemble those of controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). sarcApp-dependent quantification of α-actinin-2 detected no difference in Z-Lines per cell in myomesin-depleted hiCMs compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), suggesting Z-Lines assemble independently of myomesin – however, sarcApp did detect a decrease in Z-Line length for one myomesin-targeting siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, S14). Meanwhile sarcApp-dependent quantification of titin detected no significant change in the number of titin doublets or doublet lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E-F</xref>). Interestingly, upon myomesin knockdown, the number of titin precursor rings significantly increase, warranting future investigation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>).</p>
<p>We next wanted to assess the influence of myomesin knockdown on M-Line/A-band assembly. Because we were unable to visualize M-Lines in myomesin-depleted hiCMs (data not shown), we stained the A-band using antibodies to the β myosin II motor domain, observing that A-Bands in myomesin-depleted hiCMs appear to be less organized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>) with shorter β myosin II stacks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>). These data suggest that myomesin regulates A-band/M-Line assembly and myofibril maturation, but not Z-Line assembly. Altogether, these data in tandem with data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> suggest that the assembly of the sarcomere A-Band/M-Line and Z-Line are decoupled and/or are regulated by mechanisms that are at least partially exclusive to one another.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we introduce sarcApp and yoU-Net, two open-source software packages to binarize microscope images and quantify sarcomere components. We first demonstrate deep learningbased image binarization of three distinct sarcomeric proteins – α-actinin-2, titin, and myomesin – using models trained by a framework we developed called yoU-Net, based off the ubiquitously-used U-Net<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Each trained model is provided and will function as demonstrated herein based on the use of the antibodies as stated in the Methods. yoU-Net is designed and equipped to be functionally versatile which we hope other researchers can harness to generate additional trained models of proteins not studied here.</p>
<p>The high fidelity of yoU-Net-generated binaries allowed us to quantify several geometric features of the sarcomere in real space as opposed to frequency space. Automatic quantification of sarcomere/myofibril structure with sarcApp offers multiple advantages over traditional, manual quantification including speed, objectivity, and consistency. sarcApp is capable of quantifying 33 measurements per cell and 24 measurements per myofibril at a rate that is orders of magnitude faster than manual quantification, which besides being slower also requires complete attention from the user. sarcApp also removes the potential for user bias/error from quantification and can detect quantitative differences in cells that are not readily apparent by eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>) -we expect this will drive discovery of novel mechanisms in cells that would have remained otherwise undetectable. sarcApp as an automatic tool must operate within a rigid quantitative framework and functions optimally when structures-of-interest have shapes that are consistent and definable by simple geometric measurements, however, to increase usability we have enabled users to self-define parameters using an easy-to-navigate GUI.</p>
<p>Other than basic structural readouts for sarcomere/myofibril precursors (Z-Bodies, titin rings, etc.) and sarcomeres/myofibrils (Z-Lines, titin doublets, M-Lines, etc.), sarcApp is also equipped to proxy sarcomere/myofibril organization. Myofibril organization correlates with function <italic>in vivo</italic> and poor organization (disarray) is often cited as causative for myocardial disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. sarcApp reports organization using a novel metric reported here known as myofibril orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2 M-O</xref>). Orientation is reported relative to the cell membrane by comparing the angle of the myofibril long axis to the nearest cell edge; such a metric was chosen because we routinely observe hiCMs assemble myofibrils with a long axis that is ~parallel (i.e., 0 degrees) to the cell edge <italic>in vitro</italic> and also because tissue sections of myocytes <italic>in vivo</italic> show myofibrillar arrays parallel to the long axis of the membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. We generated this measure of orientation to be more transparent and informative than what is currently available in the hopes of reaching a broader audience<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Previous work from our lab and others have included as many cells as reasonably possible in analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, requiring technical expertise in (at minimum) plating cells, sample preparation, microscopy, and image analysis. While microscopy has historically been the rate-limiting step in such analyses, modern microscopes can now rapidly image hundreds to thousands of cells at high resolution. The true bottleneck towards understanding sarcomere assembly now lies for our lab in image analysis/quantification. We summed the quantified cell totals of two recent landmark papers in the field and found the reported totals to be 385<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> and 785<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. sarcApp has allowed us to present in this paper multi-dimensional outputs from 3,452 single cells with outputs that we feel represent the data clearly at both basic glance and upon close inspection. Much like yoU-net, we have encoded sarcApp into a graphical user interface (GUI) equipped with a user manual that details the steps one needs to use sarcApp, irrespective of coding expertise.</p>
<p>We validated sarcApp using the pan-myosin II inhibitor Blebbistatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Blebbistatin exposure results in predictable, dose-dependent inhibition of sarcomere assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. sarcApp-generated measurements of α-actinin-2 in the presence or absence of Blebbistatin were consistent with observations made by previous groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Meanwhile, several other outputs related to titin and myomesin first reported here by sarcApp suggest that periodic, pseudomyofibrillar structures characteristic to both the Z-Line and M-Line can at least partially selfassemble in the absence of myosin II motor-based contractility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). These data indicate other mechanisms beyond myosin II-based motor-based contractility may independently contribute to the assembly and ordered arrangement of myofibrils in hiCMs. Specifically with titin, we also observe the phenomenon that Blebbistatin disrupts the higher-order organization of titin-based structures with respect to the cell membrane but does not affect titin periodicity within the structure. These data suggest that unique mechanistic tiers of organization exist within the cell at the sub- and super-structural level that become uncoupled upon relieving the cell of myosin II-dependent contractility.</p>
<p>We find that neither α nor β cardiac myosin II knockdown had any measurable impact on the assembly of Z-Lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Attempts to determine if Z-Lines assemble in the simultaneous absence of both myosins were unsuccessful in our hands. Such an experiment, in addition to the Blebbistatin experiments reported herein and elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, could resolve whether myosin II-dependent contractility alone is sufficient to explain the role of myosin II in Z-Line assembly. Meanwhile, β cardiac myosin II knockdown did result in hiCMs with shorter M-Lines, indicating that either contractility or scaffolding by β, but not α myosin II, is required for M-Line maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G, M</xref>). Knockdown of myomesin similarly did not impact Z-Line assembly but did result in shortening of the thick filament A-band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H-I</xref>). Our ability to perturb the M-Line/A-band but not the Z-Line suggests that Z- and M-Line assembly are regulated at least in part by distinct mechanistic axes, as previously hypothesized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. It should be noted here that solely using Z-Lines as a proxy for sarcomere status would have led us to errantly conclude that β cardiac myosin II and myomesin both play no or at least minor roles in sarcomere assembly. Future studies examining assembly should therefore consider Z-Line assembly to be distinct from, or at least not wholly representative of, assembly of other sarcomere components.</p>
<p>Here we used exclusively fixed-cell immunofluorescence for high-throughput quantification of sarcomere assembly. We eliminated as much bias as possible by selecting cells for quantification solely using a nuclear DAPI stain and are therefore confident that data presented herein fully captures the true biological variability present within whole hiCM cultures. A future goal of the lab is to further adapt sarcApp for live cell quantification. Tracking specific structures across time would be a necessity for a “live” version of sarcApp, a hurdle the lab is currently working to overcome. We also designed this initial version of sarcApp to quantify in 2D rather than in 3D space. As we have published previously, sarcomeres/myofibrils assemble on the dorsal (top) surface of an hiCM plated on glass for up to 48 hours after plating, and we consider them within that timeframe to exist largely within a two-dimensional plane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Breaking into three dimensions will require more complex mathematics and produce more convoluted outputs, which could limit adoption by other researchers, but is a long-term goal of the lab nonetheless.</p>
<p>In summary, sarcApp and yoU-Net provide frameworks for automatic binarization, segmentation, and quantitative analysis of sarcomeric proteins in striated muscle cells. We anticipate these software packages will be useful for lower-throughput single-cell analyses of sarcomere structure and/or assembly as well as for high-throughput screens to analyze several hundreds to thousands of cells at a time. In this way we hope to facilitate the entry of more researchers into the field of cardiac cell biology and we continue to introduce novel quantification metrics and additional sarcomere proteins in the future through continued maintenance and management of sarcApp as an open-source community project.</p>

<title>Cell Culture and Authentication</title>
<p>Human iPSC-derived cardiac myocytes (CMM-100-012-000.5, Cellular Dynamics, Madison, WI) were cultured as per manufacturer’s instructions in proprietary manufacturer-provided cardiac myocyte maintenance medium in polystyrene 96-well cell culture plates. Cells were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. For re-plating hiCMs onto glass substrates, cells were washed 2 times with 100 μL 1x PBS with no Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup> (PBS*, 70011044, Gibco, Grand Island, NY). PBS* was completely removed from hiCMs and 40 μL 0.1% Trypsin-EDTA with no phenol red (15400054, Gibco, Grand Island, NY) was added to hiCMs and incubated at 37°C for 2 minutes. Following incubation, the cells were washed 3 times with trypsin, the plate rotated 180 degrees, and washed another 3 times. Trypsinization was then quenched by adding 120 μL of culture media and total cell mixture was pipetted into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Cells were centrifuged at 200xg for 3 minutes, and the supernatant was aspirated. The cell pellet was re-suspended in 200 μL of culture media and plated on 35 mm dishes with a 10 mm glass bottom (D35-10-1.5-N; CellVis, Sunnydale, CA) pre-coated with 10 μg/mL fibronectin (354008, Corning) for 1 hr at 37°C.</p>

<title>Platinum Replica Transmission EM of Live Cell Extracted Cells</title>
<p>Adherent plasma membranes from cultured cardimyocytes grown on glass coverslips were detergent extracted. Cells were treated with extraction buffer (2 mL stock buffer (5X Stock Buffer: 500 mM 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid, 25 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid, 25 mM MgCl2, pH’d and kept at 4C), 4 mL 10% PEG (35,000 MW), 4 mL milliQ H2O, 100 uL of TritonX-100, 10 uM nocodazole, and 10 uM phalloidin) for 30 min, followed by a 1 min wash with wash buffer (2 mL stock buffer, 8 mL milliQ H2O, 10 uM nocodazole, 10 uM phalloidin), followed by fixation (2% PFA, 2% glutaraldehyde) for 20 min. Extracted cells were further sequentially treated with 0.5% OsO4, 1% tannic acid, and 1% uranyl acetate before graded ethanol dehydration and hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) substitution (LFG Distribution, France). Dried samples were then rotary shadowed with 2 nm of platinum (sputtering) and 4-6 nm of carbon (carbon thread evaporation) using an ACE600 metal coater (Leica Microsystems, Germany). The resultant platinum replica was floated off the glass with hydrofluoric acid (5%), washed several times on distilled water, and picked up on 200 mesh formvar/carbon-coated EM grids. The grids were mounted in a eucentric side-entry goniometer stage of a transmission electron microscope operated at 120 kV (JEOL, Japan), and images were recorded with a Xarosa digital camera (EM-SIS, Germany).

<p>This manuscript by Neininger-Castro and colleagues presents a novel automatic image analysis method for assessing sarcomeres, the basic units of myofibrils and validates this tool in a couple of experimental approaches that interfere with sarcomere assembly in iPSC-cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CM).</p>
<p>Automatic quantification of sarcomeres is definitely something that is useful to the field. I am surprised that there is no reference in the manuscript to SarcTrack, published by Toepfer and colleagues in 2019 (PMID 30700234), which has exactly the same purpose. The advantage of the image analysis software presented in the current manuscript appears to me to be that it can cover both mature sarcomeres and nascent sarcomeres in premyofibrils effectively.</p>
<p>When going through the manuscript there were a few issues that should be addressed in a revised version of the manuscript:</p>
<p>1. I am a bit puzzled that they took 1.4 um length as a cutoff length for a mature A-band in their quantifications, since the consensus in the field for thick filament length seems to be 1.6 um?</p>
<p>2. When doing the knockdown for alpha and beta-myosin heavy chain, respectively, why did they not also do a Western blot for the &quot;other&quot; isoform as well (Figure 7)? We know that iPSC-CM express a mixture, so the relatively mild phenotype that they observe in single knockdown experiments may well be due to concomitant upregulation of the expression of the other isoform. In my point of view this should be checked.</p>
<p>3. There seems to be a disconnect between the images for myomesin knockdown shown in Figure 8H and the quantification shown in Figure 8I, which makes me wonder whether the image shown in H middle (MYOM1 (1) KD), where the beta-myosin doublets do not seem to be much affected is really representative?</p>

<p>Neininger-Castro et al report on their original study entitled &quot;Independent regulation of Z-lines and M-lines during sarcomere assembly in cardiac myocytes revealed by the automatic image analysis software sarcApp&quot;, In this study, the research team developed two software, yoU-Net and sarcApp, that provide new binarization and sarcomere quantification methods. The authors further utilized human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiCMs) as their model to verify their software by staining multiple sarcomeric components with and without the treatment of Blebbistatin, a known myosin II activity inhibitor. With the treatment of different Blebbistatin concentrations, the morphology of sarcomeric proteins was disturbed. These disrupted sarcomeric structures were further quantified using sarcApp and the quantification data supported the phenotype. The authors further investigated the roles of muscle myosins in sarcomere assembly by knocking down MYH6, MYH7, or MYOM in hiCMs. The knockdown of these genes did not affect Z-line assembly yet the knockdown of MYOM affected M-line assembly. The authors demonstrated that different muscle myosins participate in sarcomere assembly in different manners.</p>

<p>Neininger-Castro and colleagues developed software tools for the quantification of sarcomeres and sarcomere-precursor features in immunostained human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac myocytes (hiCMs). In the first part they used a deep-learning- based model called a U-Net to construct and train a network for binarization of immunostained cardiomyocyte images. They also wrote graphical user interface (GUI) software that will assist other labs in using this approach and made it publicly available. They did not compare their approach to existing ones, but an example from one image suggests their binarization tool outperforms Otsu thresholding binarization.</p>
<p>In the second part they developed a software tool called sarcApp that classifies sarcomere structures in the binarized image as a Z-Line or Z-Body and assigns each to either a myofibril or to stress fibers. The tools can then automatically count and measure multiple features (33 per cell and 24 per myofibril) and report them on a per-cell, per-myofibril, and per- stress fiber basis.</p>
<p>To test the tools they used Blebbistatin to inhibit sarcomere assembly and showed that the sarcApp tool could capture changes in multiple features such as fewer myofibrils, fewer Z-Lines, decreased myofibril persistence, decreased Z-Line length and altered myofibril orientation in the Blebbistatin treated cells. With some changes the tool was also shown to quantify sarcomeres in titin and myomesin stained cardiomyocytes.</p>
<p>Finally they used sarcApp to quantify the changes in sarcomere assembly after siRNA mediated knockout of MYH7, MYH7, or MYOM. The analysis indicates that neither MYH6 nor MYH7 knockdown perturbed the assembly of Z- or M-lines, and that knockdown of MYOM perturbed the A-band/M-Line but not the Z-Line assembly according to features captured by the sarcApp tool.</p>
<p>Overall the authors developed and made publicly available an excellent software tool that will be very useful for labs that are interested in studying sarcomere assembly. Multiple features that are difficult to measure or count manually can be automatically measured by the software quickly and accurately.</p>
<p>There are however some remaining questions about these tools:</p>
<p>
1. The binarization tool which is tailored to sarcomere image binarization appears promising but was not systematically compared with existing approaches.</p>
<p>
2. How robust is the tool? The tool was tested on images from one type of cardiomyocytes (hiCMs) taken from one lab using Nikon Spinning Disk confocal microscope equipped with Apo TIRF Oil 100X 1.49 NA objective or instant Structured Illumination Microscopy (iSIM), using deconvolution (Microvolution software) and in a specific magnification. It remains to be seen whether the tool would be equally effective with images taken with other microscopy systems, with other cardiomyocytes (chick or neonatal rat), with different magnifications, live imaging, etc.</p>

3. The tool was developed for evaluation of sarcomere assembly. The authors show that for this application it can detect the perturbation by Blebbistatin, or knockdown of sarcomeric genes. It remains to be seen if this tool is also useful for assessment of sarcomere structure for other questions beside sarcomere assembly and in other sarcomere pathologies.</p>
