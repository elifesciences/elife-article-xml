<title>Abstract</title>
<p>In humans, new-born infants can regenerate their heart during early life. This is modelled in the mouse, where regenerative capacity is maintained for the first week after birth but lost thereafter. Reactivation of this process holds great therapeutic potential; however, the molecular pathways that might be targeted to extend neonatal regeneration remain elusive. Here, we explored a role for hypoxia and HIF signalling on the regulation of epicardial activity in the developing mouse heart and in modulating the response to injury. Hypoxic regions were found in the epicardium from mid-gestation, associating with HIF-1α and HIF-2α, and expression of the epicardial master regulator Wilms’ tumour 1 (WT1). Epicardial deletion of <italic>Hif1a</italic> reduced WT1 levels, leading to impaired coronary vasculature. Targeting of the HIF degradation enzyme PHD, through pharmacological inhibition with a clinically approved drug or epicardial-specific deletion, stabilised HIF and promoted WT1 activity <italic>ex vivo.</italic> Finally, a combination of genetic and pharmacological stabilisation of HIF during neonatal heart injury led to prolonged epicardial activation, preservation of myocardium, augmented infarct resolution and preserved function beyond the 7-day regenerative window. These findings suggest modulation of HIF signalling extends epicardial activation to maintain myocardial survival beyond the neonatal regenerative window and may represent a viable strategy for treating ischaemic heart disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Unlike the adult mammalian heart, the neonatal mouse heart exhibits a remarkable regenerative capacity after myocardial infarction (MI) up to 7 days after birth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> A similar regenerative capacity was shown in new-born humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. This regenerative potential is linked to the epicardium, a mesothelial layer covering the outer surface of the heart. During development, a subset of epicardial cells undergo epithelial to mesenchyme transition (EMT), generating epicardium-derived cells (EPDCs) that contribute to coronary vessel formation and cardiomyocyte proliferation and compaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> A number of transcription factors are expressed in the developing epicardium, including Wilms’ tumour 1 (WT1), which is instrumental in the regulation of EMT. Loss of WT 1 impairs the ability of EPDCs to migrate into the underlying sub-epicardial region and mutant embryos die between E14.5–E16.5 due to cardiovascular failure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. EPDC plasticity gradually decreases during embryogenesis and after birth the epicardium becomes quiescent. Embryonic genes, such as <italic>Wt1</italic>, are downregulated and EMT ceases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Following injury, the epicardium reactivates, resembling an embryonic-like state. Epicardial cells re-express WT1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, proliferate, undergo EMT, and differentiate into fibroblasts to stimulate tissue repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Thymosin β4 (Tβ4) pre-treatment results in EPDC-mediated neovascularization after injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> and induces limited <italic>de novo</italic> cardiomyocyte formation by differentiation from a progenitor population of epicardial origin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Hypoxia, or low oxygen levels, has been linked to tissue regeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, and hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) play a central role in cellular responses to hypoxia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. HIFs are heterodimeric transcription factors, consisting of α and β subunits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, with the latter being constitutively expressed, whereas expression of the α subunit is oxygen-dependent (reviewed in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>). Under well-oxygenated conditions (i.e. normoxia), prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins (PHD1-3) hydroxylate specific conserved proline residues on the α subunit, tagging it for proteasomal degradation. When oxygen levels drop, PHD activity is inhibited, enabling the α subunit to translocate to the nucleus and bind to hypoxia response elements (HRE) regulating transcription of a plethora of target genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. In human, mouse and rat there are three isoforms of the α subunit, but the best characterized are HIF-1α and HIF-2α activating distinct, although partially overlapping, sets of genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Hypoxia and HIF activation are evident throughout the developing heart<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> and disruption of oxygen sensing pathways during development results in a wide range of cardiac abnormalities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Notably, WT1 expression is upregulated in the heart and kidneys of rats exposed to hypoxia and an HRE binding site for HIF-1α has been identified within the <italic>Wt1</italic> promoter <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> suggesting a link between hypoxia, HIF signaling and epicardial activation. In this context, the role of epicardial HIF signaling in heart development and regeneration remains unclear. Studies have shown that stabilizing HIF-1α inhibits EPDC migration in avian embryos <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> but promotes their differentiation into vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Endothelium-specific depletion of <italic>Egln1</italic> and <italic>Eglin3</italic> (encoding PHD2 and PHD3, respectively) promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation and prevents left ventricular failure in a model of MI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, and exposure to hypoxia following MI induces a regenerative response in adult mice by metabolic reprogramming of cardiomyocytes leading to cell cycle re-entry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The epicardium and subepicardial space are identified as hypoxic niches, housing a unique progenitor cell population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Given that hypoxia has been implicated in regenerative responses post-MI, and epicardial WT1 expression is HIF dependent, we hypothesised that HIF signalling contributes to epicardial cell activation during heart development and following injury and as such might represent a therapeutic target for extending the regenerative window<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Here, we demonstrate that the developing epicardium is hypoxic and epicardial-specific deletion of <italic>Hif1a</italic> disrupts epicardial EMT and heart vascularisation. In mice, we observe a gradual and concurrent decrease in WT1 expression and HIF-mediated signalling over the first week of life. Stabilisation of HIF signalling was sufficient to maintain activation of the epicardium beyond postnatal day (P) 7, improve cardiac remodelling and preserve function post-MI. These findings provide novel insight into the molecular mechanism regulating epicardial activation in the mouse heart and suggest that modulation of HIF signalling in the dormant epicardium may enhance cardiac repair and regeneration, representing a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of ischaemic heart disease and heart failure.</p>

<title>The epicardium is hypoxic during development</title>
<p>To study the role of low oxygen tension in the developing heart, we initially investigated the physiological levels of hypoxia <italic>in situ</italic> from mid- to late gestation stages, when the epicardium forms and epicardial EMT takes place. Following <italic>in utero</italic> treatment with the marker Pimonidazole-HCl (Hypoxyprobe-1, HP1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, we probed embryonic hearts at various developmental time points, ranging from E12.5 to E18.5 using an anti-pimonidazole fluorescence-conjugated monoclonal antibody (HP1), alongside immunostaining for the spatiotemporal expression of HIF-1α and HIF-2α.</p>
<p>At E12.5, characterized by a well-established epicardial layer amidst highly trabeculated myocardium, we observed extensive regions of hypoxia, mostly in areas of dense myocardium, such as the compact wall of the atrioventricular (AV) groove (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Notably, HP1 staining co-localized with the epicardial marker WT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), and both HIF-1α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 1-figure supplement 1a</xref>) and HIF-2α at the apex of the heart. Additionally, strong HIF-1α signals were noted at the base of the heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), while HIF-2α expression extended into the myocardial compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 1-figure supplement 2a</xref>).</p>

<p>By E14.5, extensive HP1 staining persisted in areas of thicker compact myocardium, such as the interventricular septum (IVS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Co-localization with WT1 and HIF-1α was observed predominantly in the epicardium, notably in the apex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 1-figure supplement 1b</xref>), and base regions. While HIF-2α co-localization with HP1 was present, it was primarily within the myocardium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Supplementary Figure 2b</xref>).</p>
<p>Analysis of hearts at E16.5 and E18.5 revealed a progressive decrease in HP1 signal, becoming largely confined to WT1-expressing epicardial cells at later stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c, d</xref>). Similarly, HIF-1α localization was restricted in discrete regions of the outermost layer of the heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 1-figure supplement 1c, d</xref>), whereas HIF-2α expression transitioned from the epicardium (notably at the apex of the heart) to some sporadic expression in underlying cardiomyocytes by E18.5. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 1-figure supplement 2c-d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c-d</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that WT1 + cells making up the epicardial layer of the developing heart become hypoxic from mid-gestation onwards, preferentially expressing HIF-1α whereas HIF-2α expression predominantly occurs within the forming myocardium.</p>

<title>HIF-1α epicardial deletion reduces the number of Wt1+ cells and alters coronary vessel development in E16.5 embryos</title>
<p>Given that the epicardium is hypoxic during mid-late gestation, and we observed expression of HIF-1α by WT1<sup>+</sup> cells within the epicardium, we next determined the functional implications of HIF-1α on epicardial development.

Immunostaining for WT1 and the epicardial marker podoplanin (PDPN) revealed a marked reduction in the number of WT1+ cells in <italic>Wt1<sup>CreERT2/+</sup></italic>;<italic>Hif1α</italic><sup>fl</sup>/<sup>fl</sup> mutant (KO) hearts as compared to littermate controls (CTR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a-b</xref>), affecting both the epicardial layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>; CTR: 0.72 ± 0.11; KO: 0.32 ± 0.010; p=0.0268) and the myocardium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>; CTR: 3.96± 1.01; KO: 0.98 ± 0.25; p= 0.0461). Reduction in the number of Wt1+ cells in the myocardial compartment suggested an impairment in epicardial EMT. Hearts were also probed for the endothelial marker endomucin (EMCN), which also marks the endocardium and the outline of myocardial trabeculae. No significant alterations were observed in myocardial compaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>), myocardial trabeculation as assessed by fractal analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>), or the proliferation rate of WT1<sup>+</sup> cells between mutants and controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 2-figure supplement 1c-d</xref>).</p>

<p>Given the essential role of the epicardium in coronary vessel development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> we assessed coronary vessel formation using whole-mount immunofluorescence staining for EMCN associated with AngioTool<sup>™</sup> software quantification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Mutant hearts exhibited significantly impaired coronary vasculature, as evidenced by decreased total vessel length (microns) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>, CTR: 129229 ± 5509; KO: 81073 ± 10915; p= 0.0170), number of junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>, Mean ± SEM; CTR: 2505 ± 63.74; KO: 1457 ± 282.1; p= 0.0223) and vessel end points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2j</xref>, Mean ± SEM; CTR: 3422 ± 249.5; KO: 2429 ± 218.6; p= 0.0402).</p>
<p>During development, EPDCs undergo EMT and migrate into the sub-epicardial space to support coronary vessel formation. Thus, we sought to investigate whether the vascular impairment observed in the <italic>Wt1<sup>CreERT2/+</sup></italic>;<italic>Hif1α</italic><sup>fl</sup>/<sup>fl</sup> mutant embryos was due to compromised epicardial EMT. Epicardial explants from <italic>Wt1<sup>CreERT2/+</sup></italic>;<italic>Hif1α</italic><sup>fl</sup>/<sup>fl</sup> embryos treated with tamoxifen showed a reduced HIF-1α expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 2-figure supplement 2b</xref>; CTR: 0.99 ± 0.16; KO: 0.46 ± 0.12; p= 0.0397) without affecting HIF-2α levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 2-figure supplement 2c</xref>; CTR: 2505 ± 63.74; KO: 1457 ± 282.1; p= 0.223). Tamoxifen-treated epicardial explants from <italic>Wt1<sup>CreERT2/+</sup></italic>;<italic>Hif1α</italic><sup>fl</sup>/<sup>fl</sup> hearts revealed an increased epithelial and reduced mesenchymal phenotype. This was evident by reduced stress fibre formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2k</xref>), reduced alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2l</xref>), and altered sub-cellular localisation of the EMT marker and structural component of cell-cell adhesion complexes zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2m</xref>) compared to controls. Specifically, mutant explants showed a predominant membrane a-SMA staining, demarcating their epithelial cell shape, whereas control cells displayed a more intense cytoplasmic labelling of the filamentous actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2l</xref>). Similarly, in control cells the localisation ZO-1 protein was predominantly cytoplasmic and/or nuclear, whereas in mutant cells ZO-1 staining was membranous, indicating a lesser migratory and more epithelial-like phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2m</xref>). Consistent with our <italic>in vivo</italic> findings, explants derived from <italic>Wt1<sup>CreERT2/+</sup></italic>;<italic>Hif1α</italic><sup>fl</sup>/<sup>fl</sup> embryos exhibited decreased WT1 expression, indicating impaired epicardial EMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2n-o</xref>; CTR: 725.7 ± 86.93; KO: 490.9 ± 37.65; p= 0.0479).</p>
<p>To elucidate the direct regulation of WT1 by HIF-1α, we interrogated a publicly available dataset of chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with next generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) generated in the renal adenocarcinoma 786-O cell line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>.

<p>In summary, epicardial-specific deletion of <italic>Hif1a in vivo</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> significantly reduced the number of WT1+ cells, both in the epicardium and underlying myocardium, arising through EMT affecting coronary vessel development at E16.5.

<p>To complement our genetic studies, we undertook a more therapeutically relevant approach by using a pharmacological PHD inhibitor to stabilise HIF signalling. Epicardial explants were generated from C57BL/6 wildtype embryos and treated with DMSO control (CTR) or Molidustat (BAY 85-3934, Mol) a specific PHD inhibitor, used in clinical trials for renal anaemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Immunostaining for HIF-1α and HIF-2α confirmed the stabilisation of HIF signaling upon PHD inhibitor treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 3-figure supplement 1d-g</xref>). Staining with phalloidin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>) and α-SMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>) showed an enhanced mesenchymal morphology with increased stress fibres in inhibitor-treated explants, suggestive of EMT induction. Furthermore, immunostaining demonstrated a significant increase in WT1 expression in treated explants as compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g-h</xref>; CTR: 1039 ± 134.9; Mol: 2500 ± 503.7; p = 0.03).

<title>Reduced HIF signalling is associated with epicardial quiescence in the neonatal heart</title>
<p>To gain unbiased insight into hypoxia and HIF-related molecular pathways which are differentially regulated in intact P1 versus P7 mouse hearts, we performed single cell RNA-seq analysis using the 10x Genomics Chromium platform and next generation sequencing. Cell clusters were visualised through uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). An epicardial cell cluster (Epi) was identified based on previously described specific epicardial gene expression signatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). As expected, a cardiomyocyte cell cluster (CM) was underrepresented due to both low survival and size incompatibility with the FACS cell sorting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>.

<title>Activation of HIF signalling improves the response to injury in non-regenerative P7 hearts</title>
<p>To establish a causative role in the regulation of epicardial WT1 activity, we extended HIF signaling beyond P7 using a genetic gain-of-function approach. Neonatal <italic>Wt1<sup>CreERT2/+</sup></italic>;<italic>Phd2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> pups received a single dose of tamoxifen at P2 to induce Cre-mediated loss of Phd2. MI was then induced by permanent ligation of the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery in P7 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>), a time-point when the heart’s regenerative capacity is lost. Hearts were collected at 21 dpi.

<p>To further investigate our hypothesis that prolonged maintenance of HIF signalling has a beneficial effect on the epicardium and response to MI in the postnatal heart, we explored a complementary pharmacological approach recapitulating our gain of HIF-function studies using epicardial explants. We induced MI by LAD ligation in P7 mice and administered Molidustat or DMSO control (vehicle) by intraperitoneal injection, immediately after surgery and one week later, to stabilise HIF signalling in the postnatal heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Treatment with PHD inhibitor effectively stabilized HIF-1α and HIF-2α, as observed by immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 6-figure supplement 1a-b</xref>) in hearts collected at 9-days post-MI (9dpi). Moreover, this pharmacological approach revealed a significant increase in epicardial WT1 expression in both the infarct and remote zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>) in Molidustat-treated hearts (MI T) compared to controls (CTR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c-d</xref>, infarct zone: MI CTR 0.34 ± 0.08, MI T 0.50 ± 0.06, remote zone: CTR 0.075 ± 0.02, MI T 0.25 ± 0.05, p &lt; 0.05).

<p>To analyse the long-term histological effects of HIF-stabilisation after MI, we collected hearts at 21dpi. Co-immunostaining and quantification of CD31 and α-SMA revealed no difference in the number of vessels between controls and the treatment group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g-h</xref>). Cine-MRI analysis showed a marked reduction in left ventricular systolic function following MI in the vehicle-treated group (MI CTR) as compared to uninjured hearts (Sh) and, more importantly, a significant improvement in systolic function in the PHD inhibitor treated-groups (MI T). EF and EDV were significantly improved in the drug-treated groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6i-j</xref>; EF: Sh 78.10 ± 3.22, MI CTR 67.70 ± 4.31, MI T 77.61 ± 1.76, p &lt; 0.05; EDV: Sh 27.53 ± 3.10, MI CTR 36.11 ± 2.49 MI T 26.44 ± 0.93; p&lt; 0.05). Histological analysis by Masson’s trichrome staining revealed the presence of a fibrotic scar in drug-treated animals, albeit this was reduced relative to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6k-l</xref>) and the at-risk myocardium was comparatively thicker with minimal dilatation or thinning of the left ventricle. The thickened myocardium was not due to an effect on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, as determined by WGA staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 6-figure supplement 1f-h</xref>) nor an effect on cardiomyocyte proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 6-figure supplement 1e, g</xref>) suggesting potential cardio-protection and improved preservation of survived heart muscle.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we characterised the levels of hypoxia in the heart during mid-to-late gestation when the epicardium is fully formed. At E12.5, hypoxia was mainly observed in areas of compact myocardium, most significantly in the atrioventricular (AV) groove, close to where the coronary plexus first develops<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. By E14.5, hypoxic regions localised to the interventricular septum (IVS), which is perfused later than the muscle of the free wall<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Finally, by E16.5 and E18.5, when the heart is adequately perfused by the coronary vessels, hypoxia was primarily restricted to the epicardium. We further analysed the expression and distribution analysis of HIF-1 isoforms, finding a predominance of the HIF-1α isoform in WT1<sup>+</sup> cells, whereas HIF-2α was more localized in the myocardium. Given hypoxia’s known role in promoting EMT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> we confirmed a functional role for HIF-1α in promoting morphological changes associated with EMT by direct regulation of <italic>Wt1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). Moreover, epicardial-specific deletion of <italic>Hif1a</italic> significantly reduced the number of WT1 expressing cells in both epicardial and myocardial compartments, along with impaired coronary vessel development in E16.5 embryos. Collectively, this suggests that HIF-1α induces epicardial EMT and plays an essential role in coronary vessel formation during development. While Cre-mediated deletion of HIF-1α, induced at E9.5 and E10.5, predominantly targeted epicardial cells, it is worth noting that expression of WT1 in the coronary endothelium has been reported as early as E1 1.5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, although the biological significance of endothelial WT1 remains elusive. Thus, aberrant HIF signalling in WT1+ endothelial cells cannot be completely excluded as contributing to the observed defects on the expansion of the coronary vasculature. However, stabilisation of HIF signalling in epicardial explant cultures, under physiological oxygen levels, either via genetic ablation of <italic>Phd2</italic>, or chemical inhibition of PHD enzymes with Molidustat, resulted in enhanced EMT and WT1 expression, further confirming a role for HIF signalling in epicardial activation.</p>
<p>To gain insight into the post-natal molecular pathways regulating the epicardium, we performed single cell RNA sequencing analysis comparing P1 and P7 stages, focusing on the specific gene expression signature of the epicardial cell cluster. GO terms analysis showed an enrichment of hypoxia-related pathways in P1 hearts, consistent with the expression of well-known HIF target genes. Importantly, <italic>Phd2</italic> expression was enriched in P7 hearts, potentially contributing to epicardial quiescence during the first week of life, concurrent with a decrease in HIF signalling. Complete regeneration following MI requires both the replacement of lost cardiomyocytes and the formation of new blood vessels. Given the role of the epicardium during development in promoting coronary vessel formation and myocardial growth, the observed epicardial quiescence after birth likely contributes to the loss of regenerative capacity. Genetic and pharmacological stabilisation of HIF signalling beyond P7 proved to be effective in extending the regenerative window after LAD surgery, resulting in reduced pathological remodelling and preserved cardiac function against a background of fibrotic repair. Interestingly, genetic stabilisation of HIF signalling specifically in WT1-expressing cells significantly reduced scar size post-injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Reduced fibrosis was also observed in PHD-inhibitor treated P7 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This is important since necrotic cardiomyocytes can trigger the activation of fibroblasts and promote fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. The epicardium is a key source of mitogens in the embryonic heart<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> and provides paracrine signals targeting cardiomyocytes during regeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. In our study, we did not observe any change in either cardiomyocyte proliferation or hypertrophy, strengthening the hypothesis of an epicardium-mediated role in cardiomyocyte protection from apoptosis via paracrine signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that despite persistent scarring (albeit reduced) following either genetic or pharmacological perturbation of PHDs, significant functional improvements were observed, in contrast to the prevailing view that fibrotic repair after MI is a barrier to effective tissue regeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Previous studies have suggested the involvement of HIF-1α in myocardial remodelling after injury. Mice with constitutive overexpression of HIF-1α in the myocardium showed enhanced angiogenesis, attenuation of infarct size, and improved cardiac performance after MI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Furthermore, cardiac-specific PHD2 inactivation and consequent HIF activation play a causal role in the pathogenesis of ischemic cardiomyopathy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. In our study, we focused on the stabilisation of HIF signaling as a therapeutic approach to improve outcomes after heart injury. The mean half-life of Molidustat ranges from 4 to 10 hours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> ensuring prolonged stabilisation of HIF signaling to enable therapeutic benefit. Molidustat is an orally administered small molecule used for the treatment of anaemia in patients with non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> and could potentially be repurposed to treat ischemic heart disease.</p>
<p>In summary, we show that the epicardium is hypoxic at later stages of development, with HIF-1α playing a crucial role in epicardial activation and EMT, necessary for supporting coronary vessel development. The epicardium becomes quiescent after birth, coinciding with decreased HIF-signalling. However, maintaining HIF signaling after birth can extend epicardial activation, leading to a significant improvement in cardiac remodelling and function after injury, thus representing a potential novel therapeutic target to improve cardiac regeneration following MI.</p>

Genetically modified mouse lines used were kept in a pure C57BL/6 background. Both males and females were used in the study. For timed-mating experiments, 8-12-week-old mice were set up overnight and females checked for vaginal plugs the following morning; the date of a vaginal plug was set as embryonic day (E) 0.5. For tamoxifen-dependent gene activation, 2 doses of 40 mg/kg of body weight of tamoxifen (Sigma) were administered to pregnant dams by oral gavage, at embryonic stages E9.5 and E10.5. For neonate studies, pups were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with a single 10 µl dose of 20 mg/ml tamoxifen, at postnatal day (P)2, using a 25-gauge needle. 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU, Thermofisher) was intraperitoneally injected at a dose of 50mg/kg at the day of surgery (P7) and every other day. Hearts were collected at 9 dpi and the assay was carried out according to manufacturer’s protocol.</p>

Animals were euthanized according to the UK Home Office designated schedule 1 method of cervical dislocation. Myocardial infarction (MI) was induced by permanent ligation of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery in wild type mice at postnatal day (P) 7, as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. All surgery was performed under isoflurane anaesthesia, and every effort was made to minimise suffering. Neonates cannot be sexed during the first week of life so mixed male and female cohorts were used throughout the protocol. Mice were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane for 1 minute and then transferred to an ice box for up to 6 minutes. Mice were recovered under 0.5% isoflurane. Animals received intraperitoneal injections of BAY 85-3934 (Molidustat, Selleck) (10 mg /kg) or vehicle (DMSO), upon recovery (day 0) and 7 days later. Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation for tissue collection at 4-, 9- and 21-days following ligation.

<p>Sterile 12-well plates (Fisher Scientific), containing sterile 13-mm diameter coverslips were coated with 0.1% gelatin (Millipore) and allowed to stand for 20 minutes. The gelatin was then replaced by Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Sigma) containing 10% FBS (Sigma), 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (Sigma). Hearts were isolated from E11.5 embryos and the outflow tract and atria were removed. Each ventricle was then cut in half and placed epicardial side down on the coverslip. Explants were kept at 37°C/5% CO<sub>2</sub>. 24 hours later, 1 µM of tamoxifen was added to explants. After 48 hours of culture, the explant tissue was carefully peeled off, leaving only the epicardial sheet remaining on the coverslip. For explants prepared from C57BL/6 embryos, 50 µM of BAY 85-3934 (Molidustat, Selleck) or vehicle (DMSO) was added. After a total of 72 hours in culture, the media was removed, coverslips were washed briefly in ice-cold PBS and then fixed in 4% PFA at room temperature for 15 minutes. The MEC.1 cell line identity was authenticated by qPCR and immunostaining for known epicardial markers and tested negative for mycoplasma contamination.

FACS sorted cardiac cells viability and concentration were assessed by using an automated cell counter and 1.5×10<sup>4</sup> cells per sample were loaded onto the 10X Chromium system (10X Genomics) to obtain a target cell recovery of ~6000 cells. Single cell RNA-seq libraries were generated using Single Cell 3 Prime Reagent Kits v1.3 (10x Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 System operated by the Oxford Genomics Centre at the Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics. Raw sequence reads were aligned against the mouse mm10/GRCm38 reference transcriptome using the Cell Ranger 3.1.0 pipeline (10x Genomics) and processed further using the scRNA-seq analysis R package Seurat (v.3.2.3). Initial filtering removed cells expressing less than 200 genes and genes that were expressed in less than 3 cells. To exclude low quality cells and doublets we filtered out cells with a very high mitochondrial genes content and cells that expressed more than 8000 genes. Based on these criteria, 19211 genes across 5308 and 8734 cells for P1 and P7 samples respectively remained for downstream analysis. Data from the two samples were combined and scaled by regressing out the nUMIs, percentage of mitochondrial gene expression and cell cycle. To correct for batch effect, samples were integrated using the Harmony package (v.1.0). Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) was performed on the scRNAseq harmonised cell embeddings and unbiased clustering was obtained using the FindCluster function of the Seurat pipeline. Cluster cell types were annotated using a combination of differentially expressed markers, identified using the Seurat FindAllMarkers function and the expression of selected canonical markers for specific cell types. The Epicardial cell cluster was then identified and subset into a new Seurat object with raw reads counts. The standard Seurat pipeline described above was performed and the Model-based Analysis of Single-cell Transcriptomics test (MAST v. 1.14.0) was used to analyse the differential gene expression between the P1 and P7 groups in the epicardial cells. Finally, differentially expressed genes were ranked based on both the fold change and p value (avg_logFC * −log10 of the p_val) and the ranked list was submitted to the Metascape platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.metascape.org">www.metascape.org</ext-link>) to identify enriched pathways in the P1 or P7 group, respectively.</p>

<title>Cardiac cine-MRI</title>
<p>Cardiac cine-MRI was performed at 7T using a Varian DDR system. Briefly, mice were anaesthetised with 2% isoflurane in O2 and positioned supine in a custom animal handling system with homeothermic control. Prospectively gated proton cardiac images were acquired with a partial Fourier accelerated spoiled gradient echo CINE sequence (TR 5.9 ms, TE 2.2 ms, 30 kHz bandwidth, 25° FA, approximately 20-30 frames gated to the R wave with a 4 ms post-label delay; 20% partial acquisition; 4 averages) with a 72 mm volume transmit/4 channel surface receive coil (Rapid Biomedical GmbH) in order to acquire two and four chamber long-axis views and a short axis stack for functional quantification (128×128 matrix; 25.6 mm<sup>2</sup> FOV; 0.7 mm slice thickness, 0.2 mm resolution in-plane). Non-acquired partial Fourier data was reconstructed via the method of projection onto convex sets prior to a simple, cartesian, DFT. Blinded image analysis was performed in ImageJ as described previously. Mice with either excessive or minimal infarct sizes were excluded from further analyses by MRI scanning at day 1 post-MI.</p>

<title>Wound healing/scratch assay</title>
<p>2 × 10<sup>4</sup> MEC.1 cells were seeded on a 2 well Culture insert (Ibidi, Germany). The day after, the insert was removed and 50 µM of BAY 85-3934 (Molidustat, Selleck) or vehicle (DMSO) was added to the culture. Cells were imaged every 2 hours up to 6 hours. The cell-free space area was determined by using the ImageJ software (NIH, Rockville, USA).</p>

<title>Image Analysis</title>
<p>For quantification of immunofluorescence of cryosections, images were captured on an Olympus FluoView 3000 confocal microscope and analysed with Fiji (NIH) and AngioTool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. To quantify nuclear fluorescence, a macro was written to identify all DAPI-stained nuclei and to analyse nuclear fluorescence based on the DAPI mask. To localise WT1+ cells in the epicardium and myocardium, cells were manually counted. To quantify the cell size, three independent samples per group with six different fields and positions, two from left and right ventricles, and septum were captured at 40× magnification. ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) was used to quantify the size of each cell.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>All data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) or as median, inter-quartile range (IQR) and upper and lower limits. Statistical analysis was performed on GraphPad Prism 8 software. The statistical significance between two groups was determined using an unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test, these included an F-test to confirm the two groups had equal variances. Among three or more groups, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed up by Dunnett’s or Tukey’s multiple comparison tests were used. A value of p ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Gamen et al. analyzed the functional role of HIF signaling in the epicardium providing evidence that stabilization of the hypoxia signaling pathway might contribute to neonatal heart regeneration. By generating different conditionally mouse mutants and performing pharmacological interventions, the authors demonstrate that stabilizing HIF signaling enhances cardiac regeneration after MI in P7 neonatal hearts.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study presents convincing genetic and pharmacological approaches on the role of hypoxia signaling enhance the regenerative potential of the epicardium</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The major weakness remains the lack of convincing evidence demonstrating the role of hypoxia signaling in EMT modulation in the epicardial cells. The authors claimed that EMT assays adopted in this study are based on similar previous studies. Surprisingly, two of the references provided correspond to their own research group (PMID: 17108969, PMID: 19235142), limiting the credit for such claims, and the other two (PMID: 27023710, PMID: 12297106) assessment of cell migration but not EMT is reported. Thus, EMT remains to be convincingly demonstrated.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Gamen et al. investigated the roles of hypoxia and HIF1a signaling in regulating epicardial function during cardiac development and neonatal heart regeneration. The authors identified hypoxic regions in the epicardium during development and demonstrated that genetic and pharmacological stabilization of HIF1a during neonatal heart injury prolonged epicardial activation, preserved myocardium, enhanced infarct resolution, and maintained cardiac function beyond the normal postnatal regenerative window.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>HIF1a signaling was manipulated in an epicardium-specific manner using appropriate genetic tools.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Some conclusions still need clarification.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>(1) The authors' comment on the partial overlap of HP1 and HIF1a IF signals (HIF1a is highly unstable ... broader regions of hypoxia) is reasonable and would help readers interpret the data if included in the text describing Fig. 1.</p>
<p>(2) The conclusion regarding WT1+ cells in Fig. 2a and b remains unclear. Both panels display larger and smaller magenta cells, and when all are taken into account, the overall number does not appear substantially different. Additional clarification is needed on how the quantification was performed.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding Figure 6-figure supplement 1c, it seems difficult to conclude the endothelial identity of WT1+ cells based on EMCN staining, as the markers do not overlap. The authors note that WT1 is upregulated in endothelial cells, but this has been reported in the context of injury, which differs from the context of the present study involving Molidustat.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The author's research here was to understand the role of hypoxia and hypoxia-induced transcription factors Hif-1a in the epicardium. The authors noted that hypoxia was prevalent in the embryonic heart and this persisted into neonatal stages until post natal day 7 (P7). Hypoxic regions in the heart were noted in the outer layer of the heart and expression of Hif-1a coincided with the epicardial gene WT1. It has been documented that at P7, the mouse heart cannot regenerate after myocardial infarction and the authors speculated that the change in epicardial hypoxic conditions could play a role in regeneration. The authors then used genetic and pharmacological tools to increase the activity of Hif genes in the heart and noted that there was a significant improvement in cardiac function when Hif-1a was active in the epicardium. The authors speculated that the presence of Hif-1a improved cell survival.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A focus on hypoxia and its effects on the epicardium in development and after myocardial infraction. This study outlines a potential to extend the regenerative time window in neonatal mammalian hearts.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the observations of improved cardiac function is clear, the exact mechanism of how increased Hif-1a activity causes these effects is not completely revealed. The authors mention improved myocardium survival, but do not include studies to demonstrate this.</p>
<p>There is an indication that fibrosis is decreased in hearts where Hif activity is prolonged, but there are no studies to link hypoxia and fibrosis.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>In the manuscript revision, the authors address my comments. They outline differences between genetic disruption of Phd2 and chemical inactivation could be due to dosing and drug half-life of Molidustat. The other comments are addressed by explaining that they have analyzed enough heart sections and hearts to come to their conclusions. The authors also state they cannot generate more numbers for this study, therefore I accept their conclusions as stated.</p>

<p>This valuable study investigates the role of HIF1a signalling in epicardial activation and neonatal heart regeneration in mice. Through a combination of genetic and pharmacological approaches, the authors show that stabilization of HIF1a enhances epicardial activation and extends the regenerative capacity of the heart beyond the typical neonatal window following myocardial infarction (MI). However, several aspects of the study remain incomplete and would benefit from further clarification and additional experimental support to solidify the conclusions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We reveal herein prolonged epicardial activation following myocardial infarction (MI) beyond post-natal days 1-7 (P1-P7) by genetic or pharmacological stabilisation of HIF-signalling. This extends the so-called “regenerative window” during an adult-like response to injury, leading to enhanced survived myocardium and functional improvement of the heart, even against a backdrop of persistent, albeit reduced, fibrosis. The epicardium is known to enhance cardiomyocyte proliferation and myocardial growth during heart development via trophic growth factor (for example, IGF-1, FGF, VEGF, TGFβ and BMP) signalling (reviewed in PMID:29592950) and epicardium-derived cell-conditioned medium reduces infarct size and improves heart function (PMID: 21505261). Further experiments, outside of the scope of the current study, are required to determine whether activated neonatal epicardium elicits similar paracrine support to sustain the myocardium and heart function after injury beyond P7 into adulthood.</p>

<p>We respectfully disagree that we have not convincingly demonstrated a role for HIF-signalling in promoting epicardial EMT. We adopt epicardial explant assays utilising a well characterised ex vivo protocol previously described for studying EMT in embryonic, neonatal and adult epicardium (PMID: 27023710, PMID: 12297106; PMID: 17108969, PMID: 19235142). These assays demonstrate in  WT1<sup>CreERT2</sup>;Phd2<sup>fl/fl</sup> explants enhanced cobblestone to spindle-like change in cell morphology, increased cell migration, appearance of stress fibres and an up-regulation of the mesenchymal marker alpha-smooth muscle actin (αSMA); all parameters associated with EMT. In addition, our in vivo analyses of Wt1<sup>CreERT2</sup>;Phd2<sup>fl/fl</sup> hearts, in response to neonatal injury, reveal elevated numbers of WT1+ epicardial cells within the sub-epicardial region and underlying myocardium as is associated with active EMT and subsequent migration from the epicardium.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Gamen et al. investigated the roles of hypoxia and HIF1a signaling in regulating epicardial function during cardiac development and neonatal heart regeneration. They found that WT1<sup>+</sup> epicardial cells become hypoxic and begin expressing HIF1a from mid-gestation onward. During development, epicardial HIF1a signaling regulates WT1 expression and promotes coronary vasculature formation. In the postnatal heart, genetic and pharmacological upregulation of HIF1a sustained epicardial activation and improved regenerative outcomes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>HIF1a signaling was manipulated in an epicardium-specific manner using appropriate genetic tools.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There appears to be a discrepancy between some of the conclusions and the provided histological data. Additionally, the study does not offer mechanistic insight into the functional recovery observed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We respectfully disagree with the comment that our histological data does not support our conclusions and expand on this in the response to specific reviewer comments. We agree that further mechanistic experiments outside of the scope of the current study are required to identify precisely how activated neonatal epicardium results in increased healthy myocardium after injury beyond post-natal day 7 (P7).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors' research here was to understand the role of hypoxia and hypoxia-induced transcription factor Hif-1a in the epicardium. The authors noted that hypoxia was prevalent in the embryonic heart, and this persisted into neonatal stages until postnatal day 7 (P7). Hypoxic regions in the heart were noted in the outer layer of the heart, and expression of Hif-1a coincided with the epicardial gene WT1. It has been documented that at P7, the mouse heart cannot regenerate after myocardial infarction, and the authors speculated that the change in epicardial hypoxic conditions could play a role in regeneration. The authors then used genetic and pharmacological tools to increase the activity of Hif genes in the heart and noted that there was a significant improvement in cardiac function when Hif-1a was active in the epicardium. The authors speculated that the presence of Hif-1a improved cell survival.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A focus on hypoxia and its effects on the epicardium in development and after myocardial infarction. This study outlines the potential to extend the regenerative time window in neonatal mammalian hearts.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this positive endorsement and recognition of the importance of mechanistic insight into how to extend the window of neonatal heart regeneration.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the observations of improved cardiac function are clear, the exact mechanism of how increased Hif-1a activity causes these effects is not completely revealed. The authors mention improved myocardium survival, but do not include studies to demonstrate this.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We report an increase in healthy myocardium arising from prolonged activation of the epicardium during the neonatal window and following injury at post-natal day 7 (P7). We speculate this recapitulates the role of the epicardium during heart development which is known to be a source of trophic growth factors that can enhance myocardial growth. Further experiments are required, out-of-scope of this study, to define a mechanistic link between HIF-signalling, epicardial activation and myocardial survival in the setting of prolonged neonatal heart regeneration.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>There is an indication that fibrosis is decreased in hearts where Hif activity is prolonged, but there are no studies to link hypoxia and fibrosis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We believe the decreased fibrosis is a natural consequence of the increase in survived myocardium arising from the activated epicardium. There is strong precedent here following injury at post-natal day 1 (P1) in which fibrosis is evident early-on but is resolved over time with growth of the myocardium in the regenerating heart (PMID: 23248315).</p>

<p>We respectfully disagree that epicardial explants are not a valid assay for assessing EMT. As noted under responses to reviewers, such primary explants have been widely described elsewhere (PMID: 27023710, PMID: 12297106; PMID: 17108969, PMID: 19235142) and enable documentation of multiple parameters that are associated with active EMT, including an assessment of the extent of cell migration, cobblestone (epithelial) to spindle-like (mesenchymal) cell morphologies, stress fibre formation and expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin as a mesenchymal marker. We support our findings in explants by revealing reduced WT1+ epicardium-derived cells (EPDCs) in the sub-epicardial region and underlying myocardium of  WT1<sup>CreERT2/+</sup>;Hif1a<sup>fl/fl</sup> embryonic hearts (data in Figure 2) indicative of impaired epicardial EMT and migration of EPDCs and in vivo following neonatal MI with pharmacological inhibition of PHD2, where we observe the reciprocal phenotype of increased numbers of epicardium-derived cells emerging from the outer epicardial layer (data in Figure 6).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>The manuscript by Gamen et al. analyzed the functional role of HIF signaling in the epicardium, providing evidence that stabilization of the hypoxia signaling pathway might contribute to neonatal heart regeneration. By generating different conditionally mouse mutants and performing pharmacological interventions, the authors demonstrate that stabilizing HIF signaling enhances cardiac regeneration after MI in P7 neonatal hearts. The study is potentially interesting, but it presents several major caveats.</p>
<p>(1) One of the critical points reported in the early stages of this study is the early co-localization of Wt1, the hypoxic report (HP1), and HIF signaling pathways master regulators (i.e., HIF1a and HIF1b) during embryonic development. Figure 1 is meant to report such findings. However, unfortunately, I hardly see any co-localization at all in the Wt1+ epicardial cells for HP1, with some colocalization is seen for HIF1 and 2 alpha, although none of these data are quantified. Thus, it is hard to believe such co-localization.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We respectfully disagree with this comment. We highlight cells in Figure 1 that are co-stained for WT1+ and HP1. In addition, we identify HIF1-α and HIF2- α positive cells which either reside within the epicardium, as the outer cell layer, or within the underlying sub-epicardial region, respectfully.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors claimed that they have analyzed the expression of the hypoxic report, as well as Wt1 and the HIF signaling pathways master regulators (i.e., HIF1a and HIF1b) in the AV groove, as compared to the apex, in embryonic heart ranging from E12.5 to E18.5 (Figure 1). Unfortunately, all images provided that are tagged as AV groove are rather misleading. They do not represent the AV groove but part of the right ventricular free wall. If the authors want to refer to the AV groove, AV cushions should be visible underneath.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have removed specific reference to the AV groove and refer to the highlighted regions as the “Base” of the heart.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors analyzed the hypoxic condition of the developing heart from E12.5 to E18.5. However, it remains unclear why the authors only explored the hypoxic conditions from E12.5 onwards, since epicardial EMT mainly occurs earlier than this time point, i.e., E10.5 onwards. Therefore, it would be needed to explore it already at this earlier time point.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We respectfully disagree with the reviewer and refer to the comment above regarding the fact that E12.5 marks the onset of epicardial EMT and E13.5 is the stage with the most significant mobilisation of epicardium-derived cells (EPDCs) into the sub-epicardial region and underlying myocardium (PMID: 32359445).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors reported a conditional mouse model of HIF1alpha deletion by using the Wt1CreERT2 driver. Curiously, Wt1 is dependent on hypoxia signaling (i.e., HIF1a). Therefore, it is unclear whether there is a negative feedback loop between the deletion of Hif1alpha and the activation of the Cre driver might have functional consequences. Convincing evidence should be provided that such crosstalk does not interfere with Hif1alpha inactivation, and therefore, appropriate controls should be run in parallel.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We discount a negative feedback loop in this instance based on the fact we have utilised heterozygous mice for the  WT1<sup>CreERT2/+</sup> line and observe a consistent and reproducible phenotype for the developing hearts on a  Wt1<sup>CreERT2/+</sup>;Hif1a<sup>fl/fl</sup> background and following injury in  Wt1<sup>CreERT2/+</sup>;Phd2<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice. Collectively this indicates that the WT1-CreERT2 driver is active in the context of diminishing HIF-1α and Phd2, respectively. In addition, have carried out parallel experiments using epicardial explants derived from R26R-CreERT2;Phd2<sup>fl/fl</sup> (Figure 3) to circumvent any potential confounding issues; the results of which are consistent with increased epicardial EMT in support of our overall hypothesis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) On Figure 2a-f the authors reported that epicardial cells are diminished in Wt1CreERT2Hif1alpha mice as compared to controls. I am very sorry, but I do not see any difference. Furthermore, it is unclear to me how the authors quantified such differences, i.e., what marker signal did they use and how it was performed (Figure 2c and d)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We respectfully disagree with the reviewer and draw attention to the single channel panels of WT1+ staining in Figure 2, which show clear differences between numbers of epicardial cells in the mutant mice compared to controls (comparing magenta cells in panels a) versus b). Quantification was carried out for numbers of WT1+ cells residing within the PDPN-positive epicardium (and underlying PDPN-negative myocardium) across multiple images from multiple sections and multiple hearts.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) On Figure 2g, the authors reported differences in total vessel length. Are they referring to impaired microvasculature development? Or is this analysis also including major coronary vessels? What about the major coronary vessels and trees, is there any affection?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This analysis refers to the microvasculature and not the major coronary arteries or coronary trees.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) The authors reported that there might be some differences in EMT markers, but unfortunately, all of them are analyzed on 2D cultures, where no substrate for EMT is present, i.e., an underlying ECM bed. Thus, the authors cannot claim that EMT is altered. Additional experiments using either collagen substrate and/or Matrigel are required to fully demonstrate that EMT is impaired. Furthermore, quantitative analyses of such differences should be provided.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The 2D cultures are epicardial explants from mutant versus wild type hearts and represent a widely adopted previously published ex-vivo assay for investigating epicardial EMT across embryonic to adult stages (PMID: 27023710, PMID: 12297106; PMID: 17108969, PMID: 19235142); including an assessment of the extent of migration and cobblestone (epithelial) to spindle-like (mesenchymal) cell morphologies, stress fibre formation and expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin as a mesenchymal marker. We do not understand the comment regarding an “underlying ECM bed” as the cells exhibit EMT routinely on tissue culture plastic and will deposit their own ECM during the culture time course and in response to EMT/cell migration. In terms of quantification this was carried out for scratch assay experiments, as a proxy for EMT and emergent mesenchymal cell migration, as presented in Figure 3i, j with significant enhanced scratch closure and cell migration following Molidustat treatment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) The description of data provided on Supplementary Figure 5 is spurious and should be removed. A note in the discussion might be sufficient.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We respectfully disagree. The ChIP-seq data, in what is now Figure 2- figure supplement 3, highlights a HIF-1 α binding site within the <italic>Wt1</italic> locus suggesting putative upstream regulation of WT1 by HIF-1α. Thus this provides a potential explanation as to how HIF-1α may activate the epicardium through up-regulation of <italic>Wt1</italic>/WT1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) On Figure 3, the authors further illustrate the change of EMT markers using ex vivo cardiac explants. They reported increased expression of Snai2 that, although statistically significant, is most likely of no biological relevance (increase of only 20% at transcript level). What about Snai1, Prrx1, and other EMT promoters? Are they also induced? As previously stated, these 2D cultures do not provide supporting evidence that EMT is occurring, thus 3D gel assays should be performed in which Z-axis analyses will provide evidence on the different migratory behaviour of those cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We respectfully suggest that a 20% change in snai2 expression is biologically meaningful with respect to EMT. This in-turn is supported by associated cell migration, reduced ZO-1 expression, increased stress fibres and increased alpha-SMA as a mesenchymal marker; all properties associated with active EMT. Other suggested markers have not been validated as formally required for EMT, for example Snai1 (PMID: 23097346). The migratory capacity of targeted versus epicardial cells was assessed by combined explant and scratch assay experiments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) The description of single-cell analyses is very incomplete. Which mice were used for these analyses, wildtype control, or hypoxic mice? Please provide a clearer description of the samples used. Additionally, the entire rationale of these analyses is dubious. Doing single-cell analyses to analyze a couple or three markers in a very small cell population is rather ridiculous. qPCR might be far more appropriate and convincing, or a bulk RNAseq analysis of isolated epicardial cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The single-cell analyses represent an unbiased assessment of different pathways in epicardial cells (identified bioinformatically) between intact P1 and P7 stages in wild type (control) hearts, with a focus on hypoxia-related gene expression and HIF-dependent pathways. It was not designed to analyse a small number of genes, rather global differences in the hypoxic states between P1 and P7 hearts. Selected genes (Vegfa, Pdk3, Egln 1 (Phd2)) were analysed to highlight the key differences in hypoxic signalling across the regenerative window. The fact the hearts were uninjured/intact is clarified in the text and legends for Figure 4 and now Figure 4-figure supplement 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(11) The analyses provided in Figure 5 are very interesting and their findings are very relevant. However, I would think that the complementary experimental approach should also be done, i.e, MI followed by activation with tamoxifen, since that situation would be more realistic in the clinical setting.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Tamoxifen causes respiratory failure in neonates with MI, so the two cannot be combined at the same time or soon after surgery. Moreover, tamoxifen takes significant time to take effect on targeted gene down-regulation which may negate sufficient activation of the epicardium following injury.</p>
<p>The experiments in Figure 5 were designed to demonstrate that prolonged heart regeneration could be elicited in a cell-specific (epicardial-specific) manner via a genetic approach. The pharmacological experiments in Figure 6 are complementary in this regard by demonstrating equivalent effects with drug (Molidustat) delivery to reduce PHD2 and stabilise HIF post-MI.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(12) In Figure 6, expression of Wt1 is highly prominent in P7 controls, mainly restricted to the epicardial lining while in the experimental setting, such Wt1 expression is broadly distributed on the subepicardial space, nicely demonstrating epicardial activation. However, it is very surprising to see such Wt1 expression in controls, something that is not expected, as compared to the data reported in Figure 4g. Could the authors please reconcile these findings?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figure 6 represents the injury setting and Figure 4g the intact setting (as clarified above, in the text and revised figure legends). Hence in the latter WT1 expression is significantly reduced in the P7 heart, as anticipated. With injury at P7 we anticipate activation of WT1 in control hearts, albeit restricted to the epicardial layer (as occurs in adult hearts, PMID: 21505261). In contrast, following Molidustat-treatment of P7 hearts post-MI we observe extensive epicardial expansion into the sub-epicardial region and EPDC migration into the underlying myocardium (Figure 6b).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>The role of hypoxia and HIF1a signaling in epicardial activation is an important topic, and the genetic approaches employed in this study are appropriate. However, several aspects of the study remain unclear and would benefit from further clarification or explanation by the authors:</p>
<p>(1) The authors detected hypoxic regions using an anti-pimonidazole fluorescence-conjugated monoclonal antibody (HP1). The data would become more compelling if negative and positive controls were provided.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We believe the HP1 staining is compelling in the images shown and is consistent with hypoxic regions of the developing heart. We reveal HP1 staining at cellular resolution with neighbouring cells positive and negative for the HP1 signal in the apex of the heart and within the epicardium and sub-epicardial regions at E12.5 (Figure 1a) and diminished/altered hypoxic/HP1 regional signal through subsequent developmental stages at E14.5-18.5 (Figure 1a-d).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Many HIF1a-positive cells in the AV groove region do not appear to overlap with HP1 staining (Figure 1a). Providing a low-magnification image of HIF1α expression would be helpful to better assess the extent of overlap with HP1 staining</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>HIF-1 is highly unstable and hence detection of HIF-1+ cells will likely only sample of cells compared to HP1 which is a surrogate for broader regions of hypoxia.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Although the authors conclude that epicardial HIF1a deletion results in a significant reduction of WT1⁺ cells in both the epicardium and myocardium (Figure 2a-d), the provided images are not sufficiently clear to fully support this interpretation. Providing additional evidence to support this conclusion would be helpful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We respectfully disagree with the reviewer and draw attention to the single channel panels of WT1+ staining which show clear differences between numbers of epicardial cells in the mutant mice compared to controls (Figure 2a versus 2b; magenta WT1+ staining).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Similar to the point raised above, the authors' conclusion regarding the increased expression of WT1 following Molidustat treatment does not appear to be fully supported by the provided images (Figure 6b-f). Immunofluorescence staining for WT1 does not clearly demonstrate epicardial expression in the remote zone of either the control or Molidustat-treated hearts. In addition, while an increase of WT1<sup>+</sup> cells is observed in the infarct zone of the Molidustat-treated heart, it is somewhat unexpected that such expansion is not evident in the corresponding region of the control heart, given that epicardial cells typically expand near the infarct area. Clarification on these points would be helpful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figure 6b reveals WT1 expression in controls (upper panel set) that is reactivated proximal to the infarct region, given WT1 is not expressed in adult epicardium but restricted to the epicardial layer (as occurs in injured adult mouse hearts PMID: 21505261). This contrasts with what is observed in the Molidustat-treated P7 hearts post-MI, where we observe epicardial expansion and migration of WT1+ cells into the underlying myocardium (Figure 6b, lower panel set, infarct zone).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The authors conclude that WT1<sup>+</sup> cells in the myocardial tissue exhibit endothelial identity based on the colocalization of WT1 and EMCN signals (Supplementary Figure 9c). However, this interpretation is difficult to assess, as WT1 is a nuclear marker and EMCN is a membrane protein, which makes precise colocalization challenging to confirm with confidence. Additional supporting evidence may be necessary to substantiate this conclusion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>WT1 is known to be up regulated in endothelial cells in response to injury as shown previously in several studies (for example, PMID: 25681586). Here we show clear co-localisation of nuclear WT1 and cytoplasmic Endomucin (EMCN) in what is now Figure 6- figure supplement 1c and would encourage the reviewer and readers to magnify the image by zooming-in on the relevant co-stained panel.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The authors conclude that activation of epicardial HIF1a signaling has no effect on neovascularization in postnatal MI hearts (Figure 5c). However, the abstract states: &quot;Finally, a combination of genetic and pharmacological stabilisation of HIF ... increased vascularisation, augmented infarct resolution and preserved function beyond the 7-day regenerative window&quot; (Lines 38-41). Clarification regarding this apparent discrepancy would be appreciated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The abstract has been altered to remove the statement of increased vascularisation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) The study appears somewhat incomplete, as it lacks mechanistic insight into the functional recovery observed following epicardial Phd2 deletion and Molidustat treatment in postnatal MI hearts. Although the authors suggest a potential paracrine role of the epicardium in protecting cardiomyocytes from apoptosis, this hypothesis has not been experimentally addressed. Incorporating such analysis would help to reinforce the study's conclusions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Further experiments are required, which are out-of-scope of this study, to define a mechanistic link between the genetic or pharmacological stabilisation of HIF-signalling, epicardial activation and myocardial survival in the setting of prolonged neonatal heart regeneration.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>There are several areas where the manuscript can be improved, such that its conclusions can be solidified.</p>
<p>(1) The authors highlight a point where blocking Phd2 can enhance survival of cardiac tissue, but did not report on survival markers. They surmised that apoptosis could be decreased in Phd2 mutant or Molidustat treatment but did not show this. The authors should determine if apoptosis is decreased in the myocardium and epicardium.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We show evidence of increased levels of healthy myocardium in the genetic and pharmacological models of stabilised HIF-signalling. We exclude increased cardiac hypertrophy or increased cardiomyocyte proliferation as causative, so suggest as a reasonable alternative enhanced survival, albeit this need not necessarily be via an apoptotic pathway given the incidence of necrotic cell death during MI. We are unable to generate new surgeries and mutant/treated heart samples to analyse for apoptotic markers at this stage.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) There appears to be no difference in cardiomyocyte proliferation in Molidustat-treated animals, but the experiment was only performed on 2 to 3 animals. This is too small a sample size to conclude from these results. The authors should increase the sample size to make this assertion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We respectfully disagree that we are unable to conclude no effect on cardiomyocyte proliferation. We analysed multiple heart regions per section, for EdU+/cTnT+ colocalised signals across several sections per heart, set against a consistency of effect on other parameters in hearts treated with Molidustat. We are unable to generate more P7 heart surgeries +/- Molidustat and +/- EdU at this stage.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) It is curious as to how, after myocardial infarction, the fibrotic scar tissue is decreased in the Phd2 deletion but not as profound in Molidustat-treated mice at d21. Can the authors speculate why the difference exists and how this decrease arises? For example, are there decreased pro-inflammatory signals in Phd2 deleted mice? Is there decreased collagen deposition and ECM gene expression? Do macrophage recruitment into the infarct zone differ between mutant/treated vs WT?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The representative images in Figure 6k reveal a trend towards reduced fibrosis with Molidistat treatment (Figure 6l), but across all hearts analysed this was not as significant as observed in the epicardial-specific deletion injured hearts (Figure 5g, h). This may be due to the relatively short half-life of Molidustat (approximately 4-10 hours, PMID: 32248614), the dosing regimen for the drug and/or the fact that it was not specifically delivered/targeted to the epicardium.</p>

<p>(4) The magnified images in Figure 1 do not match the boxes in the whole heart images. It is unclear what the white boxes signify.</p>
