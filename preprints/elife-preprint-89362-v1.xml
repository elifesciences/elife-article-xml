<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Innate and goal-directed movements require a high-degree of trunk and appendicular muscle coordination to preserve body stability while ensuring the correct execution of the motor action. The spinal neural circuits underlying motor execution and postural stability are finely modulated by propriospinal, sensory and descending feedback, yet how distinct spinal neuron populations cooperate to control body stability and limb coordination remains unclear. Here, we identified a spinal microcircuit composed of V2 lineage-derived excitatory (V2a) and inhibitory (V2b) neurons that together coordinate ipsilateral body movements during locomotion. Inactivation of the entire V2 neuron lineage does not impair intralimb coordination but destabilizes body balance and ipsilateral limb coupling, causing mice to adopt a compensatory festinating gait and be unable to execute skilled locomotor tasks. Taken together our data suggest that during locomotion the excitatory V2a and inhibitory V2b neurons act antagonistically to control intralimb coordination, and synergistically to coordinate forelimb and hindlimb movements. Thus, we suggest a new circuit architecture, by which neurons with distinct neurotransmitter identities employ a dual-mode of operation, exerting either synergistic or opposing functions to control different facets of the same motor behavior.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Walking in terrestrial vertebrates is generated by the hierarchical interaction of supraspinal, sensory and spinal circuits that stabilizes posture and ensures the fluid execution of locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Grillner and El Manira, 2020</xref>). The dynamic interplay among these three systems preserves balance as the body locomotes forward, via the active coordination of trunk and appendicular muscles across the whole body. Thus, the nervous system not only encodes the dynamics of individual joints, but also harmonizes motion across joints and limbs to avoid postural instability. Successful coordination of all four limbs during locomotion needs to flexibly account for multiple parameters of limb movement in order to maintain body stability: a) the forward distance covered by each step (stride), b) the stride frequency (cadence), c) the time spent supporting the body (stance), and d) the time spent propelling it forward (swing). Limb movements are coordinated across left and right sides of the body (bilateral coupling) and between forelimbs and hindlimbs (ipsilateral and diagonal coupling) <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>)</bold>. Interlimb coupling is flexibly phased during locomotion to accommodate changes in gait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bellardita and Kiehn, 2015</xref>), with for example bilateral limbs transitioning from alternation during trot to synchrony during bound <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>)</bold> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bellardita and Kiehn, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">English and Lennard, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Grillner and El Manira, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Lemieux et al., 2016</xref>). These interlimb patterns are evolutionary conserved mechanisms observed also in bipedal species. Synchronized arm and leg movements in humans facilitate faster running paces and stabilize the center of gravity (Catavitello et al., 2018; Dietz, 2002). Nevertheless, the neuronal substrates coordinating movement between forelimbs and hindlimbs remain largely unknown.</p>

<p>Rhythmic movements of individual limbs are controlled by dedicated premotor locomotor networks, the half-center modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Grillner, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Kiehn, 2006</xref>). Each half-center module contains the microcircuit for the coordination of flexor and extensor muscles that secures stance and swing alternation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Brown, 1911</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Grillner and El Manira, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Krouchev et al., 2006</xref>). Half-center modules are connected by local commissural axons, which ensure the appropriate bilateral coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kiehn, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Lanuza et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Talpalar et al., 2013</xref>). Commissural and ipsilateral propriospinal projections between the cervical and lumbar spinal cord facilitate the diagonal and ipsilateral coordination of forelimbs and hindlimbs, respectively <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>)</bold> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Pocratsky et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Ruder et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). This modular and multi-layered organization provides a flexible infrastructure for the dynamic spatiotemporal coordination of the limbs, preventing mid-air collisions, paw trampling and postural instability.</p>
<p>Although the major spinal cell types composing the premotor network that regulates locomotor coordination have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Goulding, 2009</xref>), the neuronal substrates and propriospinal pathways that couple and coordinate movement across all four limbs remain largely unknown. The premotor locomotor network, also known as central pattern generator (CPG), comprises six cardinal neuron populations: V1, V2a, V2b, V3, V0, dI6 neurons that are distinct in their genetic origin, connectivity and neurotransmitter expression <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>)</bold> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Goulding, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Grillner and Jessell, 2009</xref>). The ipsilaterally projecting inhibitory V1 and V2b neurons cooperate to regulate flexion and extension alternation and the timing of stance and swing phasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Bourane et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), thus functioning as integral parts of the half-center modules. The commissural V0 neurons, the ipsilateral V2a neurons and the dual-projecting V3 neurons coordinate limb-coupling and the transition to faster gaits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bellardita and Kiehn, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Crone et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Lanuza et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Talpalar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). For example, when the activity of V0, V2 or V3 neurons is disrupted, mice adopt markedly altered or unstable gaits as locomotor speed increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bellardita and Kiehn, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Crone et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Lanuza et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Talpalar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Nevertheless, these disruptions do not alter interlimb coordination during self-paced locomotion, suggesting that this facet of motor control might be regulated by more complex neural dynamics involving multiple cardinal classes.</p>
<p>Here, we analyzed the combinatorial function of excitatory (V2a) and inhibitory (V2b) neurons that derive from the common spinal V2 progenitor domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alaynick et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Goulding, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kiehn, 2016</xref>). We leveraged the transient and restricted expression of <italic>Hes2</italic> in V2 progenitors to generate a new genetic tool (<italic>Hes2<sup>iCre</sup></italic>) and assess the contribution that the spinal V2 lineage neurons make to intra-and interlimb coordination during locomotion. Developmental silencing of the Hes2 neurons in mice dramatically changed the walking gait without affecting intralimb coordination. Inactivation of Hes2 neurons caused an adaptive gait, with increased cadence and reduced stride length, to compensate the postural instability induced by the malfunction of these neurons. This postural instability is illustrated by the increased time that Hes2 neuron-silenced mice spent with all four limbs in stance phase during stepping and the inability of the ipsilateral hindlimb to execute forward targeting movements during swing. Furthermore, when executing more challenging motor tasks, such as narrow beam and uneven ladder, mice with inactivation of Hes2 neurons were more prone to slips, reinforcing a key role for these neurons in ensuring body balance. Using an intersectional genetic approach, we further demonstrated that these altered coordination dynamics were primarily due to the disrupted function of V2a and V2b neurons within the spinal cord. In summary, our analyses showed that the simultaneous inactivation of V2a and V2b neurons rescued the hindlimb hyper-extension observed in V2b neuron-ablated mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Britz et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that these two neuron populations act antagonistically to pattern flexor and extensor alternation. Intriguingly, our findings also revealed that spinal excitatory V2a and inhibitory V2b neurons act synergistically to modulate interlimb spatiotemporal dynamics, forming a specialized hub for ipsilateral body coordination. Thus, we identified a microcircuit of spinal excitatory and inhibitory neurons that by functioning in antagonism and synergy can control distinct facets of locomotor coordination.</p>

<title>Identification of a novel marker of the V2 neuron lineage</title>
<p>The embryonic V2 spinal progenitor domain differentiates into excitatory V2a and inhibitory V2b neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alaynick et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Goulding, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kiehn, 2016</xref>), via the Delta-Notch signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Del Barrio et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Kimura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Peng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Yang et al., 2006</xref>). These two neuronal populations share key anatomical features, including their soma positions in the ventral gray matter and ipsilateral axonal projection patterns, with subsets of V2a and V2b neurons differentiating as propriospinal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Flynn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Ruder et al., 2016</xref>). Ipsilaterally projecting V2 propriospinal neurons likely play key roles in coordinating motor activity between forelimbs and hindlimbs. Thus, we set out to identify a novel genetic handle to target the entire V2 neuron lineage and analyze its role during locomotion. The Hes family of transcription factors is expressed in a variety of spinal progenitor domains as they undergo cell fate specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kageyama and Nakanishi, 1997</xref>), often acting as downstream effector of the Delta-Notch signaling cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Iso et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, we performed a targeted analysis of the clusters of developing cell types in the spinal cord identified by the Briscoe lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Delile et al., 2019</xref>), and found <italic>Hes2</italic> as specifically expressed in the Lhx3-marked V2 progenitor domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alaynick et al., 2011</xref>) (<bold>Figure S1A</bold>).</p>
<p><italic>Hes2</italic> mRNA was first detected at embryonic stage 10.5 (E10.5), peaked between E11.5 and E12.5, and was extinguished by E13.5 <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>)</bold>. Transient expression was confined to a cluster of ventromedial cells <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>)</bold>, in the region where V2 progenitor cells reside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Al-Mosawie et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Briscoe et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Karunaratne et al., 2002</xref>). At E11.5-E12.5 <italic>Hes2</italic> was detected in cells near the ventricular zone, but not in the lateral mantle zone where more mature neurons reside <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>)</bold>. This <italic>Hes2+</italic> cluster was positioned dorsal to the differentiating motoneurons that are marked by the expression of Hb9 <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>)</bold>, <italic>Isl1,</italic> and <italic>Olig2</italic> (<bold>Figure S1B</bold> and <bold>S1C</bold>). <italic>Hes2</italic> detection preceded the expression of Chx10, a marker of post-mitotic excitatory V2a neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ericson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hayashi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Peng et al., 2007</xref>) <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>)</bold>. In addition, <italic>Hes2</italic> was present in cells lacking Chx10 <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>)</bold>, suggesting it might be also expressed in differentiating V2b neurons. Together our observations indicate that <italic>Hes2</italic> is transiently and specifically expressed in the V2 progenitor domain.</p>

To better characterize the cell types labeled by <italic>Hes2<sup>iCre</sup></italic>and confirm that it encompassed both V2a and V2b neurons, we used a fluorescent nuclear GFP reporter, <italic>R26<sup>LSL-Sun1-GFP</sup></italic> to trace the entire Hes2 lineage, and a Î²-gal reporter (<italic>Gata3<sup>nlsLacZ</sup></italic>) to mark V2b neurons <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>)</bold>. At E12.5 â¼48% of the GFP-expressing neurons (Hes2+) co-expressed Chx10 (V2a neurons) and â¼48% Gata3 (V2b neurons), with the remaining â¼4% negative for both markers <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>)</bold>. This small population of Hes2 lineage cells lacking expression of Chx10 and Gata3 were found near the ventricular zone, suggesting they are likely to be immature progenitor or precursor cells that are yet to differentiate. Almost all Chx10+ (98%) and Gata3+ (95%) neurons were targeted by the <italic>Hes2<sup>iCre</sup></italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref></bold>). The missing 5% of Gata3+ neurons are the late born PKDL1+ neurons that surround the central canal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Di Bella et al., 2019</xref>), and do not express Hes2. The equal number of V2a (Chx10+) and V2b (Gata3+) neurons captured by the <italic>Hes2<sup>iCre</sup></italic> <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>)</bold> and the time course of <italic>Hes2</italic> expression <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>)</bold> confirmed that this mouse line faithfully and specifically captures the entire spinal V2 neuron lineage. As <italic>Hes2<sup>iCre</sup></italic> also captured some hindbrain cells at E11.5 <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>)</bold>, we further characterized its expression in supraspinal structures, using a tdTomato fluorescent reporter line (<italic>R26<sup>Ai14-LSL-tdTomato</sup></italic>). In sections from juvenile brains we observed neurons labeled in the PAG, the pons, the superior olivary complex, and the medullary reticular nucleus (<bold>Figure S2C</bold>). No labeled cells were, however, detected in motor control-associated areas, such as the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR), the motor cortex and the striatum.</p>

<p>Next, we verified that the insertion of the <italic>iCre</italic> allele in the <italic>Hes2</italic> locus, which eliminates the Hes2 DNA binding domain (<bold>Figure S2A</bold>), did not disrupt spinal cord development. Heterozygous and homozygous (<italic>Hes2</italic> knockout) mice were generated in Mendelian ratio (<bold>Figure S2D</bold>), and <italic>Hes2</italic> knockout mice were fertile and did not display obvious behavioral deficits (data not shown).

<title>Developmental silencing of Hes2 neurons induces festination</title>
<p>Forward locomotion requires four layers of coordination: a) intralimb flexor/extensor alternation, b) intralimb coordination of proximal/distal muscles, c) left and right alternation, and d) forelimb and hindlimb coupling. In prior studies, where either excitatory V2a neurons or inhibitory V2b neurons were selectively inactivated, each population was observed to regulate a distinct facet of limb coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Britz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Crone et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). V2a neurons control forelimb reaching and bilateral limb coordination during speed-dependent gait transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Azim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Crone et al., 2009</xref>), while V2b neurons contribute to regulate hindlimb flexor and extensor alternation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Britz et al., 2015</xref>), in concert with V1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). However, given their common developmental provenance, it is not clear whether V2a and V2b populations contribute to different functions as indicated by the individual inactivation analyses or if they also act collectively to regulate other aspects of motor coordination.</p>
<p>To examine the collective functions of V2a and V2b neurons, we developmentally silenced the synaptic output of Hes2 neurons by crossing <italic>Hes2<sup>iCre</sup></italic> mice with the Cre-dependent Tetanus Toxin (TeNT) effector, <italic>R26<sup>LSL-TeNT</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). This manipulation silenced the entire spinal V2 lineage as well as the supraspinal neurons targeted by the <italic>Hes2<sup>iCre</sup></italic>. Littermates lacking the <italic>Cre</italic>allele were used as controls. Mice with inactivation of the Hes2 neurons displayed normal performance on the rotarod (<bold>Figure S3A</bold> and <bold>S3B</bold>), and normal grip strength (<bold>Figure S3C</bold>). However, these mice adopted an altered locomotor gait <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, Videos S1</bold> and <bold>S2</bold>), characterized by an increased cadence of shorter strides (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>â<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref></bold>). Both hindlimbs and forelimbs in Hes2 neuron-silenced mice displayed a shorter step cycle, in which both stance and swing phases were reduced compared to littermate controls (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>â<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4K</xref></bold> and <bold>S3E-S3I</bold>). These changes in the walking pattern closely resemble the festinating gait observed in Parkinson patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Giladi et al., 2001</xref>), characterized by the tendency to increase the frequency of stepping during locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Yang et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<p>Notably, the stance and swing ratio within each step cycle was not altered in Hes2 neuron-silenced mice, demonstrating correct flexor and extensor coordination and intact functioning of the half-center modules <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4L</xref>)</bold>. This was confirmed by performing additional behavioral tests and electromyographic (EMG) recordings in freely moving animals. Silencing the Hes2 neurons did not alter flexor and extensor muscle alternation, as indicated by the mutually exclusive firing patterns of tibialis anterior (flexor) and gastrocnemius (extensor) muscles during locomotion (<bold>Figure S3J</bold> and <bold>S3K</bold>), and the unchanged latency between antagonist muscle firing (<bold>Figure S3L</bold>). The correct execution of sensory-evoked behaviors (pinprick- and heat-induced withdrawal reflex) as sequence of flexion (lift-up the paw) and extension (placement of paw back to the ground) further confirmed our hypothesis that the Hes2 neurons are dispensable for intralimb coordination (<bold>Figure S3M</bold> and <bold>S3N</bold>).</p>
<p>In summary, developmental silencing of the Hes2 neurons, which include the spinal V2 neuron lineage, leads to festination. Animals with Hes2 neuron inactivation walk with increased cadence of stepping and shortened strides, but preserve flexor and extensor muscle alternation and intralimb coordination.</p>

<title>Silencing Hes2 neurons modifies the spatial and temporal dynamics of interlimb coordination</title>
<p>The short strides and increased cadence observed in ParkinsoÅs patients are thought to develop as an adaptive mechanism to maintain a stable center of gravity, as the affected individuals begin to walk with their trunk involuntarily leaning forward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Giladi et al., 2001</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that the festination-like gait in mice with Hes2 neuron silencing might function to compensate for postural instability during locomotion. To further assess the causes for the shorter strides in Hes2 neuron-silenced animals, we examined in more detail the spatial <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>)</bold> and temporal (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref></bold>) dynamics of the bilateral, diagonal and ipsilateral limb coordination. Footprint analysis during self-paced locomotion revealed that Hes2 neuron-silenced mice keep their hindlimbs closer to the body (<bold>Figure S4B</bold>), and their forelimbs and hindlimbs closer on the diagonal axis (<bold>Figure S4C</bold>). The increased distance observed between the ipsilateral forelimbs and hindlimbs following Hes2 neuron silencing (<bold>Figure S4D</bold>) is consistent with the shortened stride length of the individual limbs (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4E</xref></bold>). In control mice, the hindlimb typically moves forward to occupy the position previously occupied by the ipsilateral forelimb, however, in Hes2 neuron-silenced mice the hindlimb was seen to land short of the forelimb spot (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref></bold> and <bold>5F-5G</bold>). Taken together, these changes in interlimb coordination are consistent with mice keeping the limbs closer to the body, limiting forward movements in the attempt to preserve body stability. Next, we examined whether the changes in limb spatial positioning were also paralleled by modifications in the temporal dynamics of interlimb coordination. We reasoned that if silencing of the Hes2 neurons caused postural instability, mice should spend more time with all four paws on the ground during locomotion. As predicted, we observed that mice with Hes2 neuron inactivation walked with frequent intervals, in which all four limbs were contemporaneously in their stance (support) phase, while littermate controls locomoted predominantly keeping only three paws on the ground (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>â<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref></bold>). This increase in time spent on four-paw support confirms our hypothesis that Hes2 neuron-silenced mice alter their gait to optimize their postural stability.</p>

</fig>
<p>We then analyzed how the dynamics of swing initiation across leg pairs are modified to enable these four-paw support phases in mice with Hes2 neuron inactivation. Bilateral and ipsilateral limbs alternate their swing initiation, but swing initiates simultaneously in diagonal limbs <bold>(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>)</bold>. In Hes2 neuron-silenced mice we observed no changes in the timing of swing initiation between bilateral (<bold>Figure S4E</bold> and <bold>S4F</bold>) or diagonal limbs <bold>(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>)</bold>, but we saw a delay in the initiation of swing between ipsilateral limbs <bold>(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>)</bold>. Consistent with these observations, we recorded an altered temporal pattern of contraction of ipsilateral forelimb and hindlimb muscles (<bold>Figure S4G-S4I</bold>). In control mice the bursting of the tibialis anterior (hindlimb flexor, marking initiation of swing) is followed by the bursting of the ipsilateral triceps brachii (forelimb extensor, marking initiation of stance). In contrast, Hes2 neuron-silenced mice have a longer latency between the contraction of the tibialis and the triceps muscles (<bold>Figure S4G-S4I</bold>). Taken together, these results suggest that the increased ipsilateral latency may be the driver for the increased time mice spend in the four-paw support phase.</p>
<p>Next, we investigated how these new ipsilateral spatiotemporal dynamics affect the kinematics of hindlimb movement following the silencing of Hes2 neurons. We tracked the position of foot, ankle and knee in Hes2 neuron-silenced mice compared to littermate controls (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>â<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5I</xref></bold>). After normalizing the step cycle length, we observed that inactivation of Hes2 neurons caused a significant shift in the foot and ankle trajectories during the swing and stance phase, respectively. Controls propelled the paw forward (targeting phase) mid-swing until the foot approached the forelimb position, whereas Hes2 neuron-silenced mice rapidly placed the paw back to the ground, failing to execute the targeting phase and prematurely terminating the swing phase (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>â<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5I</xref></bold>). This premature termination also determined an earlier upward movement of the ankle at the beginning of stance (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>â<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5I</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Taken together, our observations show that silencing Hes2 neurons is sufficient to modify the temporal and spatial dynamics of ipsilateral forelimb and hindlimb coordination. Mice adopt a new way of walking that generates compensatory four-paw support intervals and suppresses the balance-challenging muscle synergies, such as the hindlimb targeting phase during mid-swing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Hes2 neurons ensure the correct execution of challenging motor tasks</title>
<p>We reasoned that the impaired ability of Hes2 neuron-silenced mice to coordinate ipsilateral limbs should alter their performance during more complex motor tasks that require balance and precise paw placement. This was assessed by setting-up three behavioral tasks, in which mice have to navigate increasingly challenging tasks and rapidly correct the ongoing movements to prevent slips and maintain balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gatto et al., 2021</xref>). First, we let mice, which were not previously trained on the task, cross an uneven ladder and measured the number of slips of their forelimbs or hindlimbs. While control mice navigated the asymmetric ladder by correctly placing their paws on the rungs, Hes2 neuron-silenced mice displayed an increased number of slips <bold>(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref>)</bold>.</p>
<p>Next, we tested the coordination of mice in an additional task that requires both balance and precision of foot placement, namely crossing a rectangular narrow beam. Hes2 neuron-silenced animals navigated the larger beam with almost no errors, similar to controls. However, when challenged with a narrower beam, they displayed an increased number of slips while performing the task <bold>(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5K</xref>)</bold>. Finally, mice were challenged with a circular narrow beam, which provided an additional level of difficulty due to the inability of mice to grasp the edge of the beam for better stability. Once again, Hes2 neuron-silenced mice displayed an even higher number of slips (<bold>Figure S4J</bold>), and were less adept at correcting their gait to smoothly perform this task.</p>
<p>Taken together, these findings show that the Hes2 neurons, which include the spinal V2 neuron population, are necessary for ensuring the coordination needed to perform challenging motor tasks that require the rapid integration of sensory feedback to appropriately adjust body coordination.</p>

<p>Importantly, the selective ablation of the spinal V2 neurons in adult mice recapitulated the festination phenotype observed in Hes2 neuron-silenced mice <bold>(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B-F</xref>, Videos S3</bold> and <bold>S4</bold>). Specifically, ablating the spinal V2 neurons shortened the stride and increased the cadence of both hindlimb and forelimb (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>â<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref></bold>). Sway length, contrary to what observed in mice with developmentally silenced Hes2 neurons, was not altered following spinal V2 neuron ablation in adult animals (<bold>Figure S5B</bold>). Nevertheless, as previously observed for the Hes2 neuron silencing, ablation of the spinal V2 neurons caused an increase in the ipsilateral limb distance <bold>(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>)</bold> and a decreased distance between diagonal limbs (<bold>Figure S5C</bold>). Thus, the inactivation of the spinal V2 neurons is sufficient to phenocopy the gait phenotype observed in Hes2 neuron-silenced mice. Next, we analyzed how spinal V2 neuron ablation affects intra- and interlimb temporal dynamics <bold>(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>)</bold>. Spinal V2 neuron ablation recapitulated the hindlimb phenotypes, with reduced duration of the step cycle, swing and stance but normal stance/swing ratio <bold>(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I</xref>, S5D-S5F</bold>), however in forelimbs only caused a shortening of the swing phase (<bold>Figure S5G-S5I</bold>). Consistent with the developmental silencing results, spinal V2 neuron-ablated mice walked with more intervals of four-paw support (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6J</xref></bold>), similarly due to changes in the temporal dynamics of ipsilateral limb coupling <bold>(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6K</xref>)</bold>. Contrary to what observed in Hes2 neuron-silenced mice, following spinal V2 ablation, forelimbs are only partially affected, thus causing an additional aberrant bilateral and diagonal limb phasing <bold>(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6L</xref></bold> and <bold>S5J-K</bold>).</p>
<p>We then assessed whether the ablation of spinal V2 neurons phenocopied the lack of hindlimb targeting phase as observed following Hes2 neuron-silencing. We reconstructed the kinematics of foot and ankle movements during a normalized step cycle, observing that spinal V2-ablated mice prematurely terminated hindlimb swing without executing the targeting phase (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6M</xref></bold> and <bold>S5L-M</bold>). Taken together our data suggest that spinal V2 neurons are needed for the hindlimb targeting phase occurring mid-swing.</p>
<p>Finally, we also confirmed that ablation of the spinal V2 neurons was sufficient to impair the smooth execution of challenging motor tasks, as ablated mice displayed increased numbers of slips when crossing the asymmetric ladder <bold>(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6N</xref>)</bold>, and the narrow <bold>(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6O</xref>)</bold> and circular narrow beams <bold>(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6P</xref>)</bold>.</p>
<p>Taken together, these data show that an intact spinal V2 microcircuit is essential for normal ipsilateral forelimb and hindlimb coordination. Moreover, these findings demonstrate that the gait alterations observed following the developmental silencing of Hes2 neurons are caused by the malfunction of spinal V2 neurons, and are unlikely due to adaptation mechanisms or inactivation of Hes2 neurons in supraspinal centers. Finally, our intersectional genetic approach demonstrates that spinal excitatory V2a and inhibitory V2b neurons function synergistically to secure ipsilateral interlimb coordination and body stability during locomotion.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study reveals how excitatory and inhibitory neurons derived from a common spinal progenitor domain, the V2 lineage, cooperate to regulate the diverse motor coordination layers underlying locomotion. Our in-depth analyses of intra-and interlimb coordination demonstrate that excitatory V2a and inhibitory V2b neurons display a dual-mode of operation by exerting opposing actions in controlling flexor/extensor alternation but functioning synergistically to coordinate ipsilateral body movements. Simultaneous disruption of spinal V2a and V2b neuron activity impairs the coordination of forelimb and hindlimb muscles resulting in body instability that, although compensated during self-paced locomotion by the adoption of a festinating gait, hinders the performance in skilled locomotor tasks, such as crossing a narrow beam.</p>

<title>Contribution of supraspinal vs spinal circuits to ipsilateral body coordination</title>
<p>In restricting Hes2 inactivation to the spinal cord, we were able to phenocopy the major aspects of motor impairment observed in Hes2 neuron-silenced mice, namely the festination-like gait, the increased four-paw support, the lack of hindlimb forward targeting, and the inability to execute skilled locomotor tasks. Some motor deficits, however, were not fully recapitulated by our spinal ablation, suggesting a) the functional contribution of supraspinal neuron populations targeted by <italic>Hes2<sup>iCre</sup></italic>, b) compensatory changes in the spinal circuitry following Hes2-neuron developmental silencing, or c) incomplete intersectional recombination at upper cervical levels, which results in residual V2a and V2b neuron functionality. Previously we found that the <italic>hCdx2::FlpO</italic> allele targets the caudal spinal cord, with recombination of forelimb motor circuits occurring with a salt and pepper pattern between C2 and C3 segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Britz et al., 2015</xref>). This is consistent with spinal V2-neuron ablation, compared to Hes2 neuron silencing, causing a less severe motor deficit in forelimbs (<bold>Figure S5G-S5I</bold>), affecting only the swing duration, (<bold>Figure S3G-S3I</bold>), but fully recapitulating the hindlimb phenotype <bold>(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I</xref>, S5D-S5F)</bold>. The reduced base of support (hindlimb sway) in Hes2-neuron silenced mice (<bold>Figure S4B</bold>) but not in spinal V2-neuron ablated mice (<bold>Figure S5B</bold>) is also suggestive of residual functionality at cervical level, as reported in spinal contusion models, where reductions in hindlimb sway are scaled to the severity of cervical damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Beare et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The contribution, if any, to interlimb coordination of the ventral PAG, the pons, and the superior olive captured by <italic>Hes2<sup>iCre</sup></italic>(<bold>Figure S2G</bold>) is not well understood. However, we speculate that <italic>Hes2<sup>iCre</sup></italic>targeting of neurons in the medullary reticular nucleus, which contains spinally projecting V2a neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Bouvier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Cregg et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Usseglio et al., 2020</xref>), might also account for the partial deficits in the forelimbs of spinal V2 neuron-ablated mice.</p>
<p>In summary, our results identify a key spinal microcircuit that synchronizes ipsilateral body movements, thereby confirming prior lesion studies ascribing the control of interlimb coordination to the spinal circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Miller et al., 1975</xref>), with supraspinal circuits exerting phase-dependent modulatory effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Rossignol et al., 1993</xref>).</p>

<title>Distinct cooperation dynamics of excitatory V2a and inhibitory V2b neurons underlie different facets of limb coordination</title>
<p>Previous studies suggest the net balance of excitatory and inhibitory input dictates the firing pattern of motoneurons, and the consequent contraction of muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Petersen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">RamÃ­rez-JarquÃ­n and Tapia, 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, it remains largely unclear how this input is distributed across motoneuron types, e.g. flexor and extensor, and how is coordinated within and across spinal segments. Spinal half-center modules are organized in reciprocally coupled flexor and extensor units, with V1 and V2b neurons preferentially innervating flexor and extensor motoneurons, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Britz et al., 2015</xref>). While inactivation of V2b neurons induces hyper-extension of the hindlimb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Britz et al., 2015</xref>), inactivating excitatory V2a neurons does not alter flexor/extensor patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Crone et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, the concomitant inactivation of excitatory V2a and inhibitory V2b neurons rescues the hyper-extension phenotype (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>â<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5I</xref>, S3J-S3L</bold>) observed in V2b neuron-ablated mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Britz et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that these populations act with opposing effects on the recruitment of extensor muscles. Clonally related V2a and V2b neurons predominantly synapse onto distinct target neurons in zebrafish, providing a cellular logic for the segregated circuit integrations of V2a and V2b neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bello-Rojas and Bagnall, 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>The coordination of hindlimb and forelimb seems to involve a different cooperation dynamic compared to the flexor/extensor alternation, whereby the simultaneous inactivation of V2a and V2b neurons introduces a new motor deficit, the aberrant ipsilateral body coordination (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></bold>), not observed when these populations are individually ablated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Britz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Crone et al., 2009</xref>). This raises the question of how this synergistic interaction is encoded at a circuit level. The forelimb and hindlimb CPGs for walking are connected by propriospinal ascending and descending neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Grillner and El Manira, 2020</xref>). These propriospinal pathways include excitatory and inhibitory neurons, which elicit both EPSP and IPSP in the post-synaptic premotor neurons or motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Jankowska et al., 1973</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Lloyd and McIntrye, 1948</xref>). As both V2a and V2b comprise subsets of propriospinal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Flynn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Ruder et al., 2016</xref>), it is intriguing to speculate that these neurons regulate interlimb coordination by acting as stop and go signals to harmonize the initiation and termination of motoneuron firing across segments.</p>
<p>The differential effects that the simultaneously inactivation of V2a and V2b neurons has on flexor/extensor (intralimb) <italic>vs</italic> forelimb/hindlimb (ipsilateral) coordination suggest a unique duality of synergistic and balanced interactions. An intriguing hypothesis to explain this duality of function is that specialized subsets within the V2a and V2b neuronal populations underlie local vs segmental motoneuron coordination. V2a and V2b neurons comprise two subtypes labeled by Nfib, NeuroD2, and Prox1 (N-type) and Zfhx3, Zfhx4, and FoxP2 (Z-type), which mark local vs projection neurons, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Osseward et al., 2021</xref>). Functionally targeting these subtypes will be key to untangle the circuits underlying flexor/extensor and ipsilateral limb coordination, as well as their distinct dynamics of operation.</p>

<title>Circuits for limb coordination and postural stability</title>
<p>The emergence of a festination-like gait is the most prominent deficit that occurs upon inactivating or ablating Hes2 neurons in the spinal cord. Festination is characterized by a combined increase in the cadence of stepping and reduction in stride length (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A</xref>â<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref></bold> and <bold>6B-6F</bold>), and it is remarkably similar to the abnormal gait adopted in ParkinsoÅs patients. Strikingly, the deficits in hindlimb targeting observed in mice with spinal V2 neuron inactivation mirror the reduced forward limb propulsion reported in ParkinsoÅs patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Knutsson, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Morris et al., 1999</xref>) (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5F</xref>â<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5I</xref>, 6M</bold> and <bold>S5L-S5M</bold>). Parkinsonâs patients typically increase the double support phase during stepping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Arippa et al., 2022</xref>), which is also comparable to the prolonged four-paw support phase we observe following spinal V2 neuron silencing or ablation (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5B</xref>â<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref></bold> and <bold>6H,6J</bold>). Furthermore, the absence of forelimb and hindlimb coordination in V2 neuron-inactivated mice (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></bold>) mimics the reduction in arm swinging observed in Parkinsonâs patients, especially during challenging motor tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Baron et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Siragy et al., 2021</xref>). Finally, ParkinsoÅs patients are at high risk of falling or losing balance, especially during turning or dual-tasking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Mirelman et al., 2019</xref>), which is remarkably similar to the increase in foot slips observed in V2 neuron-inactivated mice during skilled locomotor tasks (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5K</xref>, S4J</bold> and <bold>6N-6P</bold>).</p>
<p>While the primary cause of the movement deficit in Parkinsonâs patients is closely tied to the degeneration of the basal ganglia circuitry, the Hes2 neuron inactivation-induced festination arises from disrupting the spinal cord circuitry. Deficits in dopamine signaling in the basal ganglia may have a direct effect on V2 neurons, which lie downstream of the cortico-basal ganglia network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Leiras et al., 2022</xref>). Alternatively, the festination motor phenotype might arise as a compensatory mechanism to maintain balance while walking, with the common motif across Parkinson and V2 neuron inactivation being the emergence of postural instability. Interestingly, Parkinsonâs patients develop an abnormal forward flexion of the trunk, which destabilizes their center of mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Morris et al., 1999</xref>). The underlying nature of postural instability in V2 neuron-ablated mice is less obvious, in part, because they are quadrupeds. An intriguing possibility is that propriospinal pathways coordinate motor activity across multiple spinal segments to stabilize body balance, and inactivation of these pathways leads to an unstable posture. Propriospinal pathway are critical to relay sensory and supraspinal feedback across segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alstermark et al., 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Brockett et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Ruder et al., 2016</xref>), making it appealing to speculate that these neurons sense limb stability, and following integration of mechanoreceptive and proprioceptive feedback, direct the ipsilateral limb to initiate/end the swing phase. Consistently, in mice and insects it has been shown that the posterior limb is guided forward by the position of the anterior ipsilateral limb via proprioceptive feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Brunn and Dean, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Mayer and Akay, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Theunissen et al., 2014</xref>). V2a and V2b neurons receive extensive sensory input from proprioceptive and mechanoreceptive afferents (Di Costanzo, Stam, Goulding unpublished data), and therefore the way they integrate and relay these sensory inputs might be at the core of their contribution to postural stability.</p>
<p>In summary, our findings show that the collective inactivation of spinal V2 neurons destabilizes ipsilateral movements and leads to similar compensatory mechanisms as what observed in Parkinsonâs patients. These similarities might be due to V2 neurons acting downstream of the basal ganglia or by the occurrence of similar postural unbalance in these two conditions. ParkinsoÅs patients display an array of motor impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Mirelman et al., 2019</xref>), responsive to a different degree to the treatment with dopamine agonist. While freezing of gait can be ameliorated by levodopa treatment, the increased cadence and shortened stride, although present from the initial stages of the disease, are often non-responsive to this treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Galna et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, spinal V2 neurons could be a new therapeutic target, as their pharmacological or electrical stimulation might widen the spectrum of treatable motor symptoms, by providing alternative strategies to replace the lost descending inputs or to steady the body posture.</p>

<p>This is a well-written manuscript addressing a fundamental question regarding the functional organization of spinal circuits controlling the execution of locomotor movements. The authors take advantage of the power of mouse genetics to exploit the expression of Hes2 to study the function of the whole population of V2 interneurons. Previous studies could only focus on either the excitatory V2a or inhibitory V2b subpopulations. Here, by combining two different genetic manipulations based on either silencing or acute ablation of V2 interneurons with rigorous functional analysis the authors showed that V2 interneurons can act together to control interlimb coordination and antagonistically to regulate joint movements. The data are convincing and properly analyzed, the conclusions are in line with the results, and the limitations of the study are appropriately addressed. The discussion nicely frames the work in a conceptual framework that takes into account the current literature on the mode of operation of spinal motor circuits. There are a few weaknesses that should be addressed and would further improve what is already a very nice study.</p>
<p>1. While previous work from the authors has consistently shown the validity and reliability of these neuronal silencing and ablation approaches, the study presents no data showing the efficiency and specificity of these genetic manipulations. These are critical parameters for interpreting the results and should be presented, especially considering that the strategies employed are susceptible to the limitations of a lineage-tracing approach. These data would also be important for the discussion section to interpret the differences between the two genetic models and could address some of the options proposed by the authors, as well as the possibility of incomplete and/or unexpected recombination.</p>
<p>2. The authors suggest that the changes in interlimb coordination are &quot;consistent with mice keeping the limbs closer to the body, limiting forward movements in the attempt to preserve body stability&quot;. A common reaction to body instability in quadrupeds is a widening of the limbs to lower the center of gravity: limbs are positioned further away from the body. Not quite sure whether I would be so certain of the interpretation that the observed phenotypes are due to body/postural instability. It is possible that the changes in gait are just a direct consequence of the inactivation of V2 interneurons. To clarify this issue, it could be useful to test whether other features of postural control are affected by perturbation of V2 neurons, for example, swimming and rearing analyses would provide interesting insights.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Hayashi et al provides the characterization of a new mouse line that targets V2 neurons and demonstrates the locomotor consequences of manipulating the large V2 population. Prior work has examined the effects of silencing and/or ablation of the excitatory V2a and inhibitory V2b neuronal populations independently. Since the two populations are derived from the same V2 lineage but have opposite transmitter phenotypes, one may expect some common synaptic targets and/or similar or complementary functional roles that require excitatory/inhibitory balance. Overall, the value and importance of the study is that comparison of prior manipulations of the V2a and V2b populations (individually in prior studies) with the more global V2 manipulation (here) provides additional insights into spinal locomotor circuitry.</p>
<p>The authors successfully generate a new Hes2cre mouse line that targets the V2 population with high accuracy. The characterizations as far as the specificity and efficiency of the line are compelling. This line is then used to examine the locomotor effects of, first, synaptically silencing all Hes2 neurons throughout the neuroaxis beginning in early development and, then, ablating spinal Hes2 neurons in the adult. The phenotypes of both groups of mice are quite similar, with some small exceptions. The most obvious disturbance in both is the shortened steps, faster step cycle, and more steps required to travel the same distance. As the authors point out, much of the phenotype may be due to a disruption in balance. Interestingly, the hyperextension that is characteristic of V2b neuronal ablation is lost when the function of V2a neurons is compromised as well, suggesting antagonistic functions of these populations in intralimb coordination.</p>
<p>The experiments are rigorous and the data are clearly presented. The findings are interesting to consider in context with prior work. Some comparisons are difficult since gait is not considered and one of the major roles of spinal V2a neurons has been demonstrated to be speed/gait-dependent. The ipsilateral deficits are a major conclusion but some of the supporting data are not clearly derived (or there was an error in the figure?). The use of spinal restricted manipulation removes many of the potential confounds of the full Hes2 silencing. It is still, however, not possible to disentangle the local spinal circuit effects from altered proprioceptive input pathways or ascending information from the lumbar cord to the cervical regions or the brainstem. Although of value to inform future experiments, this impacts the strength of the conclusions that can be drawn.</p>

<p>Hayashi et al., investigate the role of spinal neurons derived from the V2 progenitor domain. They identify a molecular marker, Hes2, specific to the V2 lineage in the spinal cord. The authors use this result to generate a new mouse line allowing specific access to the Hes2 lineage and show that this lineage is composed of excitatory V2a and inhibitory V2b spinal interneurons plus some populations of supraspinal neurons. Taking advantage of this new tool, they demonstrate that the developmental silencing of the Hes2 lineage leads to a disruption of mouse locomotor gait characterized by shorter strides and an increased cadence with no alteration of the alternation between flexion and extension. In addition, the authors show that the silencing of the Hes2 lineage also leads to an alteration of the interlimb coordination and a decreased capacity of the mice to achieve complex motor tasks. Using an intersectional genetic approach, the authors further demonstrate that the selective ablation of spinal V2 neurons in adult mice recapitulates the festination phenotype as well as the altered execution of complex motor tasks.</p>
<p>By identifying a novel marker of the V2 lineage in the spinal cord and using this finding to generate a new mouse line Hayashi and colleagues suggest an intriguing interplay between excitatory and inhibitory V2 spinal neurons modulating differentially, multiple facets of motor behavior.</p>
<p>The conclusions of this study are for the vast majority well supported by data. However, a few additional validations of the mouse model that is used and clarification about the methods of statistical analysis would improve the quality of this manuscript.</p>
<p>1. Additional validations of the Hes2iCre mouse line generated and used in this study would improve the quality of the manuscript as well as shed light on the potential value of the use of the Hes2iCre mouse line for future investigations.</p>
<p>- When reporting the cell population labeled by GFP in Hes2iCre; R26LSL-Sun1-GFP the authors need to report the number of animals on which these quantifications were performed to strengthen their conclusions (Figure 3C-E). Similarly, when showing the number of Hes2+, Chx10+ (V2a) and GATA3+ (V2b) neurons in Hes2iCre heterozygous vs homozygous the number of animals should be reported (Figure 3G; Figure S2E-F).</p>
<p>- The numbers of Hes2+, Chx10+ (V2a) and GATA3+ (V2b) neurons in Hes2iCre heterozygous vs homozygous is reported. However, it would improve the validation of the mouse line, if the authors could provide a quantification of the numbers of Chx10+ and GATA3+ cells in heterogygous Hes2WT/iCre animals versus littermates lacking the Cre.</p>
<p>- Although the study focus on spinal V2 neurons and the intersectional approach used in the last part of the paper is compelling, a better description of the supraspinal neurons that are part of the Hes2 lineage would give a better insight into the potential contribution of supraspinal Hes2 lineage to the motor phenotype described in Hes2-silenced mouse. In particular, an experiment showing if V2 (especially Chx10+ V2a) neurons from the medullary reticular nucleus are part of the Hes2 lineage would allow us to get a better grasp on the potential supraspinal effect of Hes2 neurons silencing.</p>
<p>1. Adding a part in the methods explaining the statistical analysis applied is needed. In this part, the choices of the statistical analysis performed should be clearly explained and the assumptions stated. Although the intersectional genetic approach is challenging and does not allow for obtaining numerous animals, the use of parametric Student's t-tests on groups with only 4 animals is discussable and at least needs to be justified in the methods (results presented in Figure 6 and Figure S5). When the number of statistical units allows it, the normality of the distributions and the homoscedasticity should be tested prior to the use a parametric test. In some instances, tests taking into account the hierarchical structure of the data could be used. Furthermore, running statistical analysis on what seems to be a group of n=2 statistical units (Figure S3L) is not appropriate.</p>
<p>2. Although this decision belongs to the authors, the use of the term &quot;synergy&quot; in the title and abstract might be misleading and might lead to confusion regarding the important outcome of this study. The authors show compelling evidence that the spinal ablation of the V2 lineage leads to a disruption of the ipsilateral coordination of body movements. However, as well explained by the authors, prior studies ablating individual V2a and V2b populations did not show any abnormal ipsilateral body coordination. This rather suggests a redundant or complementary function of inhibitory and excitatory V2 spinal neurons in spinal circuits, with the possibility for one individual population to compensate for the effect on the ipsilateral coordination following the ablation of the other population. Alternatively, &quot;synergy&quot; may suggest a simultaneous activity of V2a and V2b neurons that is not in the scope of this work.</p>
