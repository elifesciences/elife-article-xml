<title>Abstract</title><p>Endotherms increase the rate of metabolism in metabolic organs as one strategy to cope with a decline in temperature of the external environment. However, an additional major contributor to maintenance of body temperature in a cold environment is contraction-based thermogenesis in skeletal muscle. Here we show that impairment of hind limb muscle contraction by cast immobilization suppresses skeletal muscle thermogenesis and activates brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis as a compensatory mechanism. BAT utilizes free branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) derived from skeletal muscle as an energy substrate for thermogenesis, and interleukin-6 released by skeletal muscle stimulates BCAA production in muscle for support of BAT thermogenesis. Our findings suggest that BAT and skeletal muscle cooperate to maintain body temperature in endotherms.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Endotherms rely on the regulation of heat generation by metabolism in tissues of the body to maintain a stable core body temperature in the face of a fluctuating temperature of the external environment and thereby to ensure optimal physiological function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> Small mammals adjust their metabolic rate to cope with temperature fluctuations and to support their survival during seasonal acclimation. Some mammalian species are able to lower their metabolic rate and enter a state of torpor or hibernation in order to conserve energy and ensure survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> However, small mammals that do not hibernate must increase their rate of metabolism, including obligatory thermogenesis in metabolic organs such as the liver and skeletal muscle as well as regulatory thermogenesis (shivering or nonshivering thermogenesis) in skeletal muscle and brown adipose tissue (BAT), in order to maintain thermal homeostasis in a cold environment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Under normothermic conditions, core body temperature is determined by basal metabolic organs such as the brain, heart, liver, and skeletal muscle. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> Skeletal muscle is the largest weight-bearing organ in humans and consumes a substantial amount of energy, even at rest. Shivering is the major source of heat production in acute cold exposure before sufficient amount of UCP1 (uncoupling protein 1) can be recruited in BAT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Shivering is gradually replaced by UCP1 dependent thermogenesis and nonshivering thermogenesis is necessary for long-term adaptation to a cold environment. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> Skeletal muscle and BAT thermogenesis can compensate in part each other to maintain core body temperature is widely recognaized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, and recent study suggests that suppression of BAT thermogenesis has been found to promote thermogenesis in skeletal muscle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>While skeletal muscle is the critical metabolic organ, it also stores an abundance of amino acids as energy substrates in the form of muscle proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> Skeletal muscle also has the plasticity for adapting to environmental conditions and shows metabolic flexibility in response to the substrate requirements of other organs and thereby contributes to the maintenance of energy balance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> Activation of BAT themogenesis is associated with increased lipid and glucose catabolism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> Succinate and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) have also been found to support BAT thermogenesis, however.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> Although succinate may be provided by muscle contraction,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> the primary source of BCAAs for BAT thermogenesis has remained unclear. Indeed, mitochondrial BCAA catabolism in brown adipocytes promotes systemic BCAA clearance. Skeletal muscle may therefore also respond to the energy demands of BAT. Whereas body temperature and energy metabolism in metabolic organs are closely related, how they are regulated in a coordinated manner is poorly understood. Several endocrine factors alter metabolism in abdominal organs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> In particular, interleukin (IL)–6 is an endocrine factor that plays multiple roles in the response of the body to infection, exercise, and stress as well as in inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> IL-6 induces various fever responses, including nonshivering thermogenesis in BAT, by promoting prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis in central vascular endothelial cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> On the other hand, IL-6 directly affects energy metabolism in various organs, including skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> These multiple roles suggest that IL-6 is a key molecule linking thermogenesis and energy metabolism.</p>
<p>Here we show that suppression of skeletal muscle thermogenesis by cast immobilization in mice activates a compensatory thermoregulatory system dependent on BAT thermogenesis. We also show that free BCAAs derived from skeletal muscle support BAT thermogenesis, and we identify IL-6 as a key regulator of this system. Our findings reveal the importance of skeletal muscle as a source of amino acids and uncover a previously unrecognized thermoregulatory system mediated by BAT and skeletal muscle metabolism.</p>

<title>Cast immobilization suppresses muscle thermogenesis and activates a compensatory thermoregulatory system</title>
<p>We first examined the role of skeletal muscle in endothermic homeostasis by performing an acute cold tolerance test at 4°C for 4 h in mice with both hind limbs immobilized in casts. We confirmed that ∼50% of systemic skeletal muscle was immobilized (Table S1), and that the immobilization induced skeletal muscle atrophy within 3 to 5 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1_figure supplement 1A–1C</xref>). Consistent with previous findings,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> we found that gene expression for the ubiquitin ligases Atrogin-1 and MuRF-1 was increased during the early phase (days 1–3) of cast immobilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1_figure supplement 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">1E</xref>). We also found that expression of the <italic>Ppargc1a</italic> (PGC-1α), a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism, was decreased from 10 h after cast immobilization and the amount of <italic>Tfam</italic> (transcription factor A, mitochondrial) mRNA was subsequently decreased in immobilized muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1_figure supplement 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">1G</xref>). Metabolomic profiling of the immobilized muscle revealed decreases in the amounts of fumaric acid and malic acid within 1 day of cast immobilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1_fugure supplement 1H</xref>). Mice with both hind limbs immobilized for 7 days showed a significantly lower core body temperature after cold exposure compared with control mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Cast immobilization for 24 h also induced cold intolerance with preservation of muscle mass (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1_figure supplement 1A-1C</xref>). To investigate whether cold intolerance depends on the immobilized muscle mass, we examined the change in core body temperature in mice with unilateral immobilization. Systemic locomotor activity during cold exposure was similar for mice with unilateral or bilateral immobilization and for control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1_figure supplement 1I</xref>). However, the decrease in body temperature induced by cold exposure in mice with unilateral immobilization was attenuated compared with that in mice subjected to bilateral immobilization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). These findings suggested that immobilization of skeletal muscle suppresses thermogenesis in this organ and it may negatively affects the maintenance of body temperature under cold environments independently of locomotor activity.</p>

<p>Mice subjected to cast immobilization showed cold intolerance (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">B</xref>), but the core body temperature of cast-immobilized mice and control mice were little different under room temperature (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). We then examined the effects of such immobilization on interscapular BAT (iBAT) to investigate the mechanism underlying the maintenance of core body temperature in mice with cast immobilization. Expression of UCP1 at the mRNA and protein levels as well as the abundance of PGC-1α, a transcriptional cofactor that promotes the expression of thermogenesis-related genes, showed transient increases in iBAT after cast immobilization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1E</xref>–<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1H</xref>). Expression of <italic>Ucp1</italic> mRNA in iBAT was significantly increased after cold exposure compared to control mice at room temperature, whereas those expression were not induced by cole exposure in cast immobilized mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1_figure supplement 1J</xref>). Small and multilocular lipid droplets were apparent in adipocytes of iBAT within 24 h of cast immobilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1_figure supplement 1K</xref>). However, mice subjected to cast immobilization showed no increase in food consumption or activity levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1_figure supplement 1L– 1N</xref>). These results indicated that the suppression of muscle thermogenesis by cast immobilization induces BAT thermogenesis without an increase in food consumption or activity levels. On the other hand, the amount of <italic>Sln</italic> (sarcolipin) and <italic>Camk2a</italic> (Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II) mRNA were not affected in immobilized muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1_figure supplement 1O</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">1P</xref>). These findings thus suggested that nonshivering thermogenesis was induced minimally in cast-immobilized skeletal muscle. Cast immobilization thus preferentially activated nonshivering thermogenesis in BAT, not in skeletal muscle.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Cast immobilization promotes BAT thermogenesis via sympathetic activation</title>
<p>We next explored the mechanism underlying the activation of BAT thermogenesis by cast immobilization. We first focused on the sympathetic nervous system, a general inducer of BAT thermogenesis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> and found that the norepinephrine concentration in iBAT was tended to increased after 24 h of cast immobilization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). We then subjected mice to sympathetic denervation of iBAT. Expression of <italic>Ucp1</italic> mRNA in iBAT was significantly attenuated by such denervation in mice with or without subsequent cast immobilization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>). Whereas adipocytes of iBAT showed small and multilocular lipid droplets after 7 days of cast immobilization in sham-operated mice, iBAT of mice subjected to surgical denervation was hypertrophied and did not show such lipid droplets (Figure 2_figure supplement 2A). Moreover, mice with denervated iBAT manifested a lower core body temperature compared with sham-operated mice after cold exposure at 4°C for 1 h, and cast immobilization further increased the extent of hypothermia in the denervated mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1K</xref>). These results suggested that BAT thermogenesis is activated via sympathetic nerves to maintain core body temperature in cast-immobilized mice.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Cast immobilization alters systemic metabolic dynamics associated with BAT thermogenesis</title>
<p>We next examined the metabolic dynamics of iBAT as well as systemic metabolic changes in mice subjected to cast immobilization. Metabolomics analysis revealed increases in the amounts of carbohydrate metabolites and amino acids in iBAT that were apparent as early as 24 h after cast immobilization, and that such increases were not apparent in mice with iBAT denervation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Brown adipocytes incorporate fatty acids and various other energy substrates to initiate thermogenesis and contribute to the maintenance of core body temperature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> We found that expression of the genes for fatty acid (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>) and succinate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>) transporters in iBAT was induced by cast immobilization and that such induction was prevented by iBAT denervation. The concentration of succinate was also increased in iBAT of cast-immobilized mice in a manner sensitive to iBAT denervation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Consistent with these changes in metabolite levels, oxygen consumption and systemic lipid utilization were increased by cast immobilization in intact mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2F</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>) but not in those subjected to iBAT denervation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">1B</xref>).</p>

<p>The weight of epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) and hepatic glycogen content were reduced by cast immobilization (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2H</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2I</xref>). Expression of the genes for glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) in the liver increased gradually after cast immobilization, peaking at day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2_figure supplement 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">1D</xref>), suggesting that gluconeogenesis was slowly activated in the cast-immobilized mice. Metabolomic profiling of the liver revealed marked increases in the amounts of 3-phosphoglyceric acid and 2-phosphoglyceric acid within 1 day of cast immobilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2_figure supplement 1E</xref>), suggesting that glycerol influx was also enhanced in the liver. Together, these results thus indicated that cast immobilization affects metabolic dynamics in the liver and WAT, and that these changes might occur after the activation of BAT thermogenesis.</p>
<p>The serum concentration of norepinephrine was increased within 1 day of cast immobilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2_figure supplement 1F</xref>), but these metabolic changes induced by cast immobilization were not associated with by an increase in the serum concentration of corticosterone or in expression of the gene for corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) in the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2_figure supplement 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">1H</xref>). These results suggest that cast immobilization may activates BAT thermogenesis and systemic metabolic changes through lower body temperature resulting from suppression of muscle thermogenesis rather than stress.</p>

As shown above, amino acid concentrations in iBAT were increased by cast immobilization in a manner sensitive to denervation of iBAT (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). The amounts of free amino acids were also increased in both soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles of cast-immobilized mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), whereas those in serum and the liver were not increased by cast immobilization (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). We then examined gene expression profiles for solute carrier (SLC) transporters that mediate the transport of amino acids across cell membranes as well as for mitochondrial BCAA catabolic enzymes (BCAT2, branched-chain aminotransferase 2; BCKDHA, branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase E1 subunit α) in iBAT, liver, and soleus. The expression of these genes in iBAT was increased after cast immobilization for 10 to 24 h, whereas that in the liver was increased after 5 to 7 days (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). In particular, expression of the genes for SLC1A5 (a sodium-dependent glutamate transporter) and SLC38A2 (a sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter) was significantly increased in iBAT after cast immobilization for 10 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3_figure supplement 1A–1F</xref>).

<title>Cast immobilization upregulates IL-6 gene expression in BAT and skeletal muscle</title>
<p>We next set out to identify regulatory molecules that might contribute to the maintenance of body temperature and to the systemic metabolic changes in cast-immobilized mice.

<p>Metabolomics analysis revealed that the amounts of carbohydrate metabolites including glucose 1-phosphate, glucose 6-phosphate, and phosphoenolpyruvic acid in iBAT were higher for IL-6 KO mice than for WT mice, and were not increased substantially by cast immobilization in the mutant mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>).

<title>Skeletal muscle–derived IL-6 increases BCAA concentrations in skeletal muscle for BAT thermogenesis</title>
<p>Given that our data suggested that an elevated blood concentration of IL-6 contributes to maintenance of body temperature in cast-immobilized mice in a manner dependent on the sympathetic nervous system (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6E</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref>), we sought to determine the main source of circulating IL-6 in cast-immobilized mice. We first focused on the acute expression of the IL-6 gene apparent in iBAT after cast immobilization (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), and we subjected mice to surgical removal of iBAT. The serum IL-6 concentration of such mice was not increased after cast immobilization (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). We also found that the reduction in eWAT mass after cast immobilization in C57BL/6J mice was suppressed by surgical removal of iBAT (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>). These results suggested that BAT-derived IL-6 induces lipolysis in WAT.</p>
<p>We further investigated the effects of BAT-derived IL-6 on skeletal muscle. Whereas the serum concentration of IL-6 in mice depleted of iBAT was not affected by cast immobilization (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>), the concentrations of BCAAs in soleus were increased after cast immobilization in such mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6I</xref>–<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6K</xref>). The amount of <italic>Slc43a1</italic> mRNA in soleus of mice depleted of iBAT was significantly increased by cast immobilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6_figure supplement 2A</xref>). Gene expression for other amino acid transporters (such as SLC1A5 and SLC7A5) and for BCAA catabolic enzymes (BCAT2 and BCKDHA) in soleus also showed a similar pattern of changes after cast immobilization in iBAT-depleted mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6_figure supplement 2B–2E</xref>) as in intact mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3_figure supplement Fig. 1L, 1M, 1P</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">1Q</xref>). Moreover, cast immobilization for 7 days induced similar losses of both soleus and gastrocnemius mass in mice with or without removal of iBAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6_figure supplement 2F</xref> and Table S2). These data thus suggested that IL-6 secretion in an autocrine or paracrine manner may regulate BCAA metabolism in skeletal muscle independently of IL-6 derived from iBAT.</p>

<p>Finally, we investigated whether the thermoregulatory system through amino acid metabolism in the interaction between BAT and skeletal muscle also plays an important role in other conditions besides cast immobilization. Acute cold exposure also increased expression of <italic>Il6</italic> only in iBAT and skeletal muscle in mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6L</xref>). Expression of <italic>Saa3</italic> and <italic>Socs3</italic> were increased in soleus (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6M</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6N</xref>), and both soleus and gastrocnemius mass were decreased by cold exposure at 4°C for 4 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6_figure supplement 2O</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2P</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have here shown that cast immobilization suppressed skeletal muscle thermogenesis, resulting in failure to maintain core body temperature in a cold environment. Cast immobilization also activated BAT thermogenesis via the sympathetic nervous system and triggered systemic changes in energy metabolism associated with BAT thermogenesis. In addition, we found that free BCAAs derived from skeletal muscle serve as substrates for energy metabolism in BAT, and that skeletal muscle–derived IL-6 promotes this provision of BAT with amino acids from muscle.</p>
<p>Exercise-induced muscle contraction generates large amounts of heat which dependents on hydrolysis of ATP, and skeletal muscle, as the first organ to be recruited for thermogenesis, plays an important role in maintenance of body temperature in endotherms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> Muscle thermogenesis can account for up to 90% of systemic oxygen consumption during periods of maximal recruitment of muscle contraction, such as during exercise or an intense bout of shivering.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> We found that cast immobilization suppressed mitochondria related genes expression and metabolites of TCA cycle from early stage of immobilization, suggesting that metabolic rate is rapidly decreased in immobilized muscle. Thus our results of cast immobilization leading cold intolerance in mice show that metabolic thermogenesis in skeletal muscle plays a key role in mammals even in BAT-enriched mammals such as rodents.</p>
<p>Thermoregulatory system in endotherms cannot be explained by thermogenesis based on muscle contraction alone, with nonshivering thermogenesis being required as a component of the ability to tolerate cold temperatures in the long term<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Our results now show that expression of the gene for sarcolipin, a key regulator of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase (SERCA) and an important mediator of muscle nonshivering thermogenesis, was not increased in muscle after cast immobilization. On the other hand, BAT thermogenesis was activated via the sympathetic nervous system even when skeletal muscle was immobilized. It is a well-recognized fact that BAT and skeletal muscle function in an orchestrated manner to maintain core body temperature in endotherms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. A bit surprisingly, BAT capacity itself was not sufficient to maintain stable body temperature under acute cold exposure, whereas compensatory BAT recruitment protected cast immobilized mice from hypothermia at room temperature.</p>
<p>We also found that changes in systemic energy metabolism induced by cast immobilization were associated with the activation of BAT thermogenesis. Activation of BAT results in the tissue becoming a high consumer of a variety of energy substrates including lipids, glucose, BCAAs, succinate, and lactate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> In addition, our results suggest that skeletal muscle is a source of free amino acids for BAT thermogenesis or hepatic gluconeogenesis. In response to metabolic demands imposed by starvation, exercise, or cold exposure, for example, skeletal muscle manifests metabolic flexibility in order to meet the demands of other organs and is an important determinant of metabolic homeostasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> In contrast, the reduction in metabolic rate may contribute to protein conservation and maintain skeletal muscle mass under hibernation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> Our findings now provide new insight into the importance of skeletal muscle as a source of amino acids, with a recent study also suggesting that a highly active proteolysis system in the heart provides substantial amounts of amino acids for distribution to other organs via the bloodstream.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> The heart may therefore be another source of free BCAAs for BAT thermogenesis in cast-immobilized mice.</p>
<p>We found that muscle-derived IL-6 directly increased the abundance of BCAAs in skeletal muscle after cast immobilization. Previous studies have shown that excessive IL-6 induces amino acid catabolism in skeletal muscle,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> and that IL-6 is one of the factors responsible for the induction of muscle atrophy in cast-immobilized mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> IL-6 is a secreted factor induced by several mechanisms including muscle contraction, intracellular calcium signaling, and inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> However, inflammation associated with macrophage infiltration is not thought to be induced in the early stages of muscle atrophy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, and thus inflammation-induced IL-6 expression may therefore not contribute to the changes in amino acid metabolism in cast-immobilized muscle. In addition, whereas intracellular calcium concentrations may increase after muscle immobilization for 2 weeks,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> they appear to decrease in response to short-term cast immobilization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> Cast immobilization–induced <italic>Il6</italic> expression may therefore also not be regulated by calcium signaling. Upregulation of IL-6 expression by cast immobilization was previously shown to be mediated by a Piezo1-KLF15 axis, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> whereas our observation that <italic>Il6</italic> expression were increased in non immobilized fore limb muscles. Furthermore, acute cold exposure tended to increase <italic>Il6</italic> expression in skeletal muscle, suggesting that muscle-derived IL-6 for thermoregulatory system may also be regulated by the central nervous system. A recent study showed that motor circuits modulate the production of neutrophil-induced chemokines in skeletal muscle after acute stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> The regulation of IL-6 production in muscle by the central nervous system warrants further investigation.</p>
<p>The central nervous system tightly controls core body temperature through integrates information about external temperature, humidity, and thermal sensation to induce an adaptive response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> Disappointingly, our study was inconclusive as to whether the trigger for BAT thermogenesis after cast immobilization was hypothermia associated with supression of muscle thermogenesis or stress. However, we found that acute cold exposure also recruits substrate supply from skeletal muscle for BAT thermogenesis. Possibly, thermoregulatory system through amino acid metabolism in skeletal muscle and BAT may also be an important metabolic strategy even in the case of fever responce induced by stress or infection. Furthermore, inflammation, infection, and acute stress trigger rapid increases in the circulating IL-6 concentration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> and induce a fever response by promoting PGE2 synthesis. Mitochondrial BCAA oxidation in BAT was recently shown to be increased to support thermogenesis induced by PGE2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> We found that BAT-derived IL-6 increased blood IL-6 levels after cast immobilization and administration of exogenous IL-6 ameliorated cold intolerance in cast-immobilized IL-6 KO mice via the sympathetic nervous system. It may modulate thermal and energy homeostasis through the fever response and metabolic regulation in multiple organs.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have shown that cast immobilization induced thermogenesis in BAT that was dependent on the utilization of free amino acids derived from skeletal muscle, and that muscle-derived IL-6 stimulated BCAA metabolism in skeletal muscle. Our findings may provide new insights into the significance of skeletal muscle as a large reservoir of amino acids in the regulation of body temperature. In addition, given that circulating levels of IL-6 or BCAAs are associated with obesity and diabetes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> IL-6–mediated BCAA metabolism in skeletal muscle and BAT may also be associated with muscle atrophy in metabolic diseases. Further investigation of IL-6–dependent amino acid metabolism in BAT and skeletal muscle may inform the development of preventive or therapeutic interventions for some forms of muscle atrophy. Limitations of the study</p>
<p>Given that rodents are BAT-enriched mammals, whether BAT thermogenesis is similarly activated in humans after skeletal muscle immobilization remains to be investigated. Our study also did not determine the mechanism underlying the induction of <italic>Il6</italic> expression in skeletal muscle by cast immobilization. In addition, whereas muscle-derived IL-6 may stimulate protein catabolism in immobilized muscle, the mechanism by which IL-6 increases BCAA concentrations in skeletal muscle requires further investigation.</p>

<title>Mice</title>
<p>All experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Tokushima University and were conducted in accordance with the guidelines for the care and use of animals approved by the Council of the Physiological Society of Japana and ARRIVE guidelenies. Every effort was made to minimize animal suffering and to reduce the number of animals used in the experiments. All mice were housed at a constant room temperature of 23° ± 1°C and with a 12-h-light/12-h-dark cycle (lights on at 8.00 a.m.). They were fed standard nonpurified chow (Oriental Yeast) and had free access to both food and water. Our study examined male mice because male animals exhibited less variability in phenotype. Male mice at 9 to 13 weeks of age were studied. The mice were randomly assigned to experimental groups at the time of purchase or weaning.

<p>This is a <bold>useful</bold> paper regarding the roles of brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscle in thermogenesis in mice, with potential significance for the field. The overall approach is innovative but on balance the evidence for the claim is <bold>incomplete</bold>, as cast immobilization, while innovative, is likely stressful, may impact muscle and BAT directly, and imposes an energetic cost of motion on the animal that is not accounted for. Further experiments are also needed to directly assess the role of adipose-derived BCAAs in thermogenesis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Heat production mechanisms are flexible, depending on a wide variety of genetic, dietary, and environmental factors. The physiology associated with each mechanism is important to understand since loss of flexibility is associated with metabolic decline and disease.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of compensatory heat production has been described in some detail in publications and reviews, notably by modifying BAT-dependent thermogenesis (for example by deleting UCP1 or impairing lipolysis, cited in this paper).</p>
<p>These authors chose to eliminate exercise as an alternative means of maintaining body temperature. To do this, they cast either one or both mouse hindlimbs.</p>
<p>This paper is set up as an evaluation of a loss of function of muscle on the functionality of BAT.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study is supported by a variety of modern techniques and procedures.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors show that cast immobilization (CI) does not work as a (passive) loss of function, instead, this procedure produces a dramatic gain of function, putting the animal under considerable stress, inducing b-adrenergic effectors, increased oxygen consumption, and IL6 expression in a variety of tissues, together with commensurate cachectic effects on muscle and fat. The BAT is put under considerable stress, super-induced but relatively poor functioning.</p>
<p>Thus within hours and days of CI, there is massive muscle loss (leading to high circulating BCAAs), and loss of lipid reserves in adipose and liver. The lipid cycle that maintains BAT thermogenesis is depleted and the mouse is unable to maintain body temperature.</p>
<p>I cannot agree with these statements in the Discussion:</p>
<p>&quot;We have here shown that cast immobilization suppressed skeletal muscle thermogenesis, resulting in failure to maintain core body temperature in a cold environment.&quot;</p>
<p>
• This result could also be attributed to high stress and decreased calorie reserves. Note also: CI suppresses 50% of locomotor activity, but the actual work done by the mouse carrying bilateral casts is not taken into account.</p>
<p>&quot;Thermoregulatory system in endotherms cannot be explained by thermogenesis based on muscle contraction alone, with nonshivering thermogenesis being required as a component of the ability to tolerate cold temperatures in the long term.&quot;</p>
<p>
• This statement is correct, and it clearly showcases how difficult it is to interpret results using this CI strategy. The question to the author is- which components of muscle thermogenesis are actually inhibited by CI, and what is the relative heat contribution?</p>
<p>This conclusion is overinterpreted:</p>
<p>&quot;In conclusion, we have shown that cast immobilization induced thermogenesis in BAT that was dependent on the utilization of free amino acids derived from skeletal muscle, and that muscle-derived IL-6 stimulated BCAA metabolism in skeletal muscle. Our findings may provide new insights into the significance of skeletal muscle as a large reservoir of amino acids in the regulation of body temperature&quot;.</p>
<p>In terms of the production of the article - the data shown in the heat maps has oddly obscure log10 dimensions. The changes are minimal, approx. 1.5x increase/decrease and therefore significance would be key to reporting these data. Fig.3C heatmap is not suitable. What are the 6 lanes to each condition? Overall, this has little/no information.</p>
<p>Rather than cherry-picking for a few genes, the results could be made more rigorous using RNA-seq profiling of BAT and muscle tissues.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors identified a previously unrecognized organ interaction where limb immobilization induces thermogenesis in BAT. They showed that limb immobilization by cast fixation enhances the expression of UCP1 as well as amino acid transporters in BAT, and amino acids are supplied from skeletal muscle to BAT during this process, likely contributing to increased thermogenesis in BAT. Furthermore, the experiments with IL-6 knockout mice and IL-6 administration to these mice suggest that this cytokine is likely involved in the supply of amino acids from skeletal muscle to BAT during limb immobilization.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The function of BAT plays a crucial role in the regulation of an individual's energy and body weight. Therefore, identifying new interventions that can control BAT function is not only scientifically significant but also holds substantial promise for medical applications. The authors have thoroughly and comprehensively examined the changes in skeletal muscle and BAT under these conditions, convincingly demonstrating the significance of this organ interaction.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Through considerable effort, the authors have demonstrated that limb-immobilized mice exhibit changes in thermogenesis and energy metabolism dynamics at their steady state. However, The impact of immobilization on the function of skeletal muscle and BAT during cold exposure has not been thoroughly analyzed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors show that impairment of hind limb muscle contraction by cast immobilization suppresses skeletal muscle thermogenesis and activates thermogenesis in brown fat. They also propose that free BCAAs derived from skeletal muscle are used for BAT thermogenesis, and identify IL-6 as a potential regulator.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The data support the conclusions for the most part.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The data provided in this manuscript are largely descriptive. It is therefore difficult to assess the potential significance of the work. Moreover, many of the described effects are modest in magnitude, questioning the overall functional relevance of this pathway. There are no experiments that directly test whether BCAAs derived from adipose tissue are used for thermogenesis, which would require more robust tracing experiments. In addition, the rigor of the work should be improved. It is also recommended to put the current work in the context of the literature.</p>
