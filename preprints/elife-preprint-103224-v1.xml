<title>Abstract</title><p>Urination, a vital and conserved process of emptying urine from the urinary bladder in mammals, requires precise coordination between the bladder and external urethra sphincter (EUS) that is tightly controlled by a complex neural network. However, the specific subpopulation of neurons that accounts for such coordination remains unidentified, limiting the development of target-specific therapies for certain urination disorders, e.g. detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia. Here, we find that cells expressing estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1<sup>+</sup>) in the pontine micturition center (PMC) initiate voiding when activated and suspend ongoing voiding when suppressed, each at 100% reliability, respectively. Transection of either the pelvic or the pudendal nerve does not impair PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> control of the downstream target through the other nerve at all. Anatomically, PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cells possess two subpopulations projecting to either the pelvic or pudendal nerve and a third, dual-projecting subpopulation, locking in the coordination of bladder contraction and sphincter relaxation in a rigid temporal order. We identify a cell type in the brainstem that controls the bladder-urethra coordination for urination.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Urination is a basic life-maintaining function involving the coordinated control of two functional units of the lower urinary tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Andersson and K.-E., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fowler et al., 2008</xref>), namely the bladder detrusor and external urethral sphincter (EUS). The coordination between the bladder and urethra sphincter for initiating or suspending voiding whenever needed should be executed at 100% reliability in healthy subjects. By contrast, impairment of such coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cho et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Taweel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Griffiths et al., 2005</xref>), at any rate, leads to various lower urinary tract dysfunctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sakakibara and Ryuji, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Drake et al., 2014</xref>), significantly degrading the quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Milsom et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Aoki et al., 2017</xref>). While individual neural control pathways to either the bladder detrusor or the urethral sphincter have been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Xiao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lee et al., 2021</xref>), little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying their coordination, which impedes progress in developing target-specific therapies for certain urination disorders, such as detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia (DSD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Stoffel, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Seseke et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Individual neural pathways are present at different levels of the brain for the control of either the bladder or the EUS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Malykhina, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Jin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Mukhopadhyay and Stowers, 2020</xref>). For example, at the cortical level, a subset of motor cortex neurons has been found to drive bladder contraction through the projection to the brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Yao et al., 2018</xref>). At the brainstem level, the pontine micturition center (PMC; also referred to as Barringtonâs nucleus) has long been considered a command hub region for urination control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Benarroch, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Morrison, 2008</xref>). More recent studies have demonstrated that neurons expressing corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) in the PMC (PMC<sup>CRH+</sup>) control bladder contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ito et al., 2020</xref>), and neurons expressing estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) in the PMC (PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup>) relax the sphincter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Keller et al., 2018</xref>), respectively. In addition, other subcortical regions, including the periaqueductal gray (PAG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Rao et al., 2022</xref>), lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Verstegen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hyun et al., 2021</xref>), and medial preoptic area (MPOA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hou et al., 2016</xref>), have been suggested to play a potential role in urination control by sending direct projections to the PMC. However, which brain areas coordinate both the bladder and urethra sphincter remains unclear.</p>
<p>The most likely candidate region for coordinated control is the PMC. Neural tracing experiments demonstrate that the PMC directly sends two bundles of glutamatergic axonal projections, one to the sacral parasympathetic nucleus (SPN), where parasympathetic bladder motoneurons are located, which send axons through the pelvic nerves for bladder control; and the other one to the lumbosacral dorsal gray commissure (DGC) interneurons, which inhibit the sphincter motoneurons in the dorsolateral nucleus (DL) for sphincter control via the pudendal nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kawatani et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Jin et al., 2020</xref>). Early studies show that microinjection of drugs into the PMC or electrical stimulation in the PMC causes bladder contraction, sphincter relaxation, and urination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mallory, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Noto et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Sugaya and De Groat, 1994</xref>). However, the PMC consists of molecularly disparate cell subtypes characterized by the expression of different marker genes, e.g. CRH positive cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ito et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Van Batavia et al., 2021</xref>), ESR1 positive cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Vanderhorst et al., 2005</xref>), vesicular glutamate transporter (Vglut2) and vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) positive cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Verstegen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hou et al., 2016</xref>). What remains unknown to date is which exact neuronal subpopulation in the PMC accounts for such coordination of the bladder and urethra sphincter. As previous anatomical results have shown that PMC<sup>CRH+</sup> neurons mainly project to the SPN in the spinal cord, whereas PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> neurons project to both the SPN and DGC in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Keller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kawatani et al., 2021</xref>), we hypothesize that PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cells could be a candidate for the coordination control and began our investigation.</p>

<title>Voiding tightly correlates with PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cell activity</title>
<p>We performed fiber photometry monitoring of neuronal population Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Rao et al., 2022</xref>) (fluorescence indicator: GCaMP6f) in the PMC of awake, unrestrained ESR1-Cre mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">B</xref>, see Methods for detail). Each detected voiding event tightly correlated with a detected Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient (Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient preceding voiding by 0.7\0.3-0.9 s, median\25%-75% percentile, same notation hereinafter; n = 260 voiding events from 9 mice; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">D</xref>), as verified by both an analysis of temporally shuffled data (peak Îf/f value, data: 31.8%\26.7%-33.2%; shuffled: 5.4%\3.7%-6.0%, n = 260 events of 9 mice, <italic>p</italic> = 3.9e-3, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>) and a blank control with an expression of inert fluorescence indicator, EYFP (Enhanced Yellow Fluorescent Protein), in PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cells (detected voiding-associated fluorescence signal events: 100%\100% â 100%, n = 9 mice in test group; 0%\0% â 0%, n = 9 mice in control group, <italic>p</italic> = 4.1e-5, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Figure 1F-figure supplement 1). To further test single-neuron correlates of voiding, we performed an âopto-taggingâ experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Qin et al., 2022</xref>) with a tetrode-fiber bundle implanted in the PMC of ESR1-Cre mice injected with AAV2/8-DIO-ChR2-mCherry (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>; see Methods for detail). Single PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> units were sorted and tagged by detecting reliable spikes to brief optical stimulation (e.g., latency: 4.04\3.02-4.6 ms, success rate: 97.5%\91.5%-100%; <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure supplement 2</xref>). The baseline-corrected firing rate of PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> units significantly exceeded that of non-PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> units in the temporal association window with voiding (PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> units: âbeforeâ, 0.04\-0.5-0.5 Hz, âvoidingâ, 1.4\-2.5e-11-3.8 Hz, n = 28 cells, <italic>p</italic> = 0.004; non-PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> units: âbeforeâ, 0.8\0.2-1.5 Hz, âvoidingâ, 1\-0.9-1.9 Hz, n = 51 cells, <italic>p</italic> = 0.6; Wilcoxon signed-rank test; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">I</xref>). These results suggest that PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cellsâ firing activities are tightly associated with voiding.</p>

<p>Additionally, we performed a set of combined physiological monitoring experiments, integrating fiber photometry, cystometry, and electromyography (EMG) of external urethral sphincter (EUS) simultaneously in urethane-anesthetized mice (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure supplement 3A</xref>, see methods for detail). For quantitative measurement, we applied cystometry by continuously infusing saline into the bladder through a microcatheter (30-50 Î¼l/min) to induce regular reflective voiding. A triple correlation of events was routinely observed, i.e., PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> neuronal activity, bladder pressure elevation, and the bursting pattern of EUS-EMG driving sphincter relaxation (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure supplement 3B</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). This result was further validated by shuffled data analysis (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure supplement 3D</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">E</xref>), demonstrating the robustness and time-locking precision of the triple correlation events. However, it is important to note that the association between PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cell activity and voiding in the other way around was not always 100%, i.e., for each detected Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient, there could be either a voiding contraction (VC) or occasionally a non-voiding contraction (NVC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Biallosterski et al., 2011</xref>) (27.1% of all detected events were in such case; <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure supplement 4A-C</xref>). Nevertheless, not only was the peak of bladder pressure lower, but also the amplitude of the photometry Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient, which is known as a reliable report of collective neuronal population activity level, was significantly lower in NVC events than in VC events (NVCs: 8.8%\6.6%-14.7%, n = 62 events from 3 mice; VC: 15.01%\10.3%-26.4%, n = 167 events from 3 mice, <italic>p</italic> = 6.8e-9, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">figure supplement 4D</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">E</xref>), suggesting that not only the timing but also the strength of PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cell activities were tightly correlated with successful voiding.</p>

<title>PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cells bidirectionally operate the bladder and sphincter to initiate or suspend voiding</title>
<p>With the tight correlation established, we moved on to test the causal relation between PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cell activity and voiding. We started with a âloss-of-functionâ test in awake mice, i.e., acute photoinhibition of PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cells in a closed-loop to trigger the photoinhibition light as soon as the first patch of urine visualized (Figure 2A-figure supplement 5A; see Methods for detail). This test was also accompanied by a blank control in which all experimental conditions were the same except that the inhibitory opsin GtACR1 was absent. In photoinhibition events but not in the blank control events, the urine spot area was significantly reduced (âPreâ: 34.1\27.1-40.4 cm<sup>2</sup>; âOnâ: 9.9\7.9-11.1 cm<sup>2</sup>, n = 12 mice in test group, <italic>p</italic> = 4.9e-4; âPreâ: 35.2\27.9-43.9 cm<sup>2</sup>; âOnâ: 38.9\29.98-43.6 cm<sup>2</sup>, n = 8 mice in control group, <italic>p</italic> = 0.3; Wilcoxon signed-rank test; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">C</xref>), and the urination duration was significantly reduced as well (âPreâ: 5.6\5.1-6.6 s; âOnâ: 1.38\1.19-1.42 s, <italic>p</italic> = 4.9e-4, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). Effectively, the ongoing urination was fully suspended after a latency of 0.3 Â± 0.1 sec from the onset of photoinhibition (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure supplement 5B</xref>). To understand the physiological process during photoinhibition of PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cells, we performed a simultaneous recording by measuring both the bladder pressure and the electromyograph of the external urethral sphincter (EUS-EMG) under urethane anesthesia (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>; see Methods for detail). This experiment also involved a closed-loop operation to trigger the light when observing the onset of the phasic bursting activity of the EUS-EMG that is known to be directly associated with successful voiding in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kadekawa et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Langdale and Grill, 2016</xref>). The maximum relative change in bladder pressure (ÎPressure) upon voiding event was significantly reduced during photoinhibition compared to pre-inhibition baseline events (âPreâ: 11.6\10.4-15.4 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, âOnâ: 8.1\5.9-9.4 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, n = 8 mice, <italic>p</italic> = 7.8e-3, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), but no such reduction was observed in the blank control group (âPreâ: 10.7\6.9-12.03 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, âOnâ: 10.5\7.2-13.4 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, n = 7 mice, <italic>p</italic> = 0.2, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">H</xref>). In the meanwhile, photoinhibition of the PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cells also halted the voiding-associated, phasic bursting activity of EMG, effectively reducing the sphincter bursting duration (âPreâ: 4.1\3.2-4.9 s, âOnâ: 0.98\0.9-1.2 s, <italic>p</italic> = 7.8e-3, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">I</xref>) at a latency of 0.1 Â± 0.02 sec (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure supplement 5C</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">D</xref>), but no such effect was observed in the blank control group (âPreâ: 3.3\2.9-4.8 s, âOnâ: 3.4\2.96-5.4 s, <italic>p</italic> = 0.8, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Furthermore, the immediate suspension of an ongoing voiding event by photoinhibition of PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cells resulted in an expected side effect that the threshold of bladder pressure to initiate the next voiding event (post-photoinhibition) became higher (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">figure supplement 5E</xref>). A control test for the above set of âloss-of-functionâ experiments was to test whether shorter durations of photoinhibition also had the same urination suspension effect. To address this, we performed additional sets of control experiments in which a shorter duration of photoinhibition (5 s light-on, instead of 60 s) resulted in the same, 100% suspension effect (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure supplement 6</xref>). These data together reveal that the acute photoinhibition of PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cells halted both bladder contraction and sphincter relaxation, thereby leading to a full suspension of the ongoing voiding process.</p>

<p>Then, we performed a âgain-of-functionâ test in awake mice, i.e., acute photoactivation of PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cells that expressed the excitatory opsin channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), in a semi-closed loop to trigger the light on when the bladder was filled to a level that was lower than the threshold required for spontaneous voiding reflex (light on at 3.1 Â± 0.03 min after the previous voiding; inter-voiding interval under control condition: 6.6 Â± 0.5 min; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>; see Methods for detail). This test was also accompanied by a blank control in the absence of ChR2. Light stimulation initiated voiding event at 100% reliability (100%\100%-100%, n = 172 trials of 8 mice; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">C</xref>) in the test group (response latency, 0.7\0.6-0.8 s; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>), but almost 0% (0%\0%-1.25%, n = 166 trials of 8 mice) in the blank control group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). Accordingly, we also performed simultaneous cystometry with the EUS-EMG experiment under urethane anesthesia (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>; see Methods for detail). Light stimulation induced a prominent upstroke of bladder pressure in the test group and did not affect bladder pressure at all in the control group (ÎP: 5.6\4.5-8.2 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, n = 9 mice in the test group, -0.1\-0.2-0.1 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, n = 6 mice in the control group, <italic>p</italic> = 4e-4, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F-H</xref>). Meanwhile, light stimulation triggered the phasic bursting activity of EUS-EMG, at a success rate of 100% in the test group and nearly 0% in the control group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F-H</xref>). An additional set of control experiments by using regular inter-stimulation intervals (5 s light-on per every 30 s) instead of the threshold-adaptive interval, yielded the same 100% success rate of both bladder pressure and EUS-EMG responses (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure supplement 7</xref>). Thus, photoactivation of PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cells resulted in initiating the voiding process through both contracting the bladder and relaxing the sphincter. These sets of âloss-of-functionâ and âgain-of-functionâ experiments together demonstrate that PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cells perform as a 100% reliable âmaster switchâ for either initiate or suspend voiding, provided that all downstream targets are directly controlled and operational, which will be tested next.</p>

<title>Transection of either the pudendal or pelvic nerve does not impair PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> neuronal control of the other</title>
<p>To further confirm whether the effect of PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cells on the bladder can occur independently of sphincter relaxation, we designed a new set of simultaneous cystometry and EUS-EMG experiments with PMC<sup>ESR1-ChR2</sup> mice subjected to first a pudendal nerve transection (PDNx, disrupting the pathway from the PMC to the EUS) and then additionally a pelvic nerve transection (PLNx, disrupting the pathway from the PMC to the bladder) in the same mice under urethane anesthesia (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>; see Methods for detail). Under PDNx condition, PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cell photoactivation could not elicit EUS-EMG response at all, but robustly elicited bladder pressure upstroke which was then fully abolished after PLNx (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B-E</xref>). Notably, the photoactivation-induced bladder pressure upstroke under the PDNx condition was nearly the same as that in the pre-transection control condition (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>), suggesting that the PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cell control of the bladder was fully operational even when the pudendal nerve to sphincter was severed.</p>

<p>Given that reflex signals from bladder afferents can indirectly influence the urethral sphincter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chang et al., 2007</xref>), we next investigated whether activation of PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cells directly induces the bursting pattern of EUS in the absence of bladder contraction. To this end, the sequential nerve transection test was performed again with another group of PMC<sup>ESR1-ChR2</sup> mice in a different order, i.e., first PLNx to disrupt the bladder nerve and then PDNx to additionally disrupt the urethral sphincter nerve (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>; see Methods for detail). Interestingly, under the PLNx condition with a filled bladder, PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cell photoactivation did not induce a bladder pressure upstroke (Îpressure: 3.2\0.96-4.9 cm H<sub>2</sub>O in pre-transection control condition, -1.2\-1.4- -0.8 cm H<sub>2</sub>O in PLNx condition, n = 8 mice, <italic>p</italic> = 7.8e-3, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), but the EUS-EMG activity remained responsive, leading to urine leakage which consistently reduced bladder pressure (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B-E</xref>). Both the inversed bladder response and the EUS-EMG response were then fully abolished after the second transection, PDNx (Figure 5B-E-figure supplement 8). Consistently, under the PLNx condition with an unfilled bladder, the EUS-EMG response was present, and the bladder pressure did not change upon PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cell photoactivation (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figure supplement 8</xref>). Collectively, these data together indicate that PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cell control of the urethra sphincter was operational even when the pelvic nerve to the bladder was severed.</p>

<p>Lastly, despite that the PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cell photoactivation consistently elicited EUS-EMG bursting in 100% of cases, a refined analysis revealed that the key parameters of the sphincter were slightly degraded under PLNx condition (EMG bursting AUC area: 0.21\0.20-0.22 mV*s in pre-transection, 0.17\0.15-0.19 mV*s in PLNx; EMG bursting duration: 4.9\4.8-5.03 s in pre-transection, 4.5\4.1-4.6 s in PLNx, n = 8 mice, <italic>p</italic> = 7.8e-3; Wilcoxon signed-rank test; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>), which implies a potential reduction in effective voiding volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Langdale and Grill, 2016</xref>). To further explore this, we conducted experiments on awake, unrestrained mice under the PLNx condition (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, see Methods for detail). Compared to the pre-transection control condition (âbaselineâ), PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cell photoactivation still triggered voiding in 100% of trials (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). However, in PLNx mice, the voiding events were characterized by significantly smaller urine spots and a longer latency to voiding onset than the control events before transection, a difference not observed in the sham surgery group (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). These findings could be interpreted as that while the PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup>-EUS pathway is sufficient to drive voiding, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Keller et al., 2018</xref>), however, without an intact bladder reflex pathway involved, an efficient urine flow cannot be performed. Piecing these data of the combined transection-optogenetics experiments together, we reveal a more complete picture that PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cells can operate the bladder (through the pelvic nerve) and the sphincter (through the pudendal nerve) independently of each other. Such refined knowledge could not have been obtained from simpler tests using optogenetics alone as shown above (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), or from other experiments in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Keller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ito et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

<title>PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cells coordinate bladder contraction and sphincter relaxation to initiate urination</title>
<p>The above data showing that PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cells can operate through both the bladder and urethral sphincter independently of each other implies that there should be two distinct anatomical projections from PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cells downstream to innervate these targets. Indeed, our anterograde labeling experiment in ESR1-Cre mice (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Figure supplement 9</xref>; see Methods for detail) showed that the mGFP-labelled axonal terminals of the PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cell population were found in both the DGC and the SPN region of the lumbosacral spinal cord, which further send axons via the pudendal and pelvic nerves to innervate urethral sphincter and bladder, respectively. To further test this hypothesis, we performed retrograde labeling experiments in ESR1-Cre mice and, as a control, in CRH-Cre mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">E</xref>; see Methods for detail). Analysis of CRH-Cre mice showed that 82.4% (80.1%\78.7%-86.7%) of PMC<sup>CRH+</sup> cells were SPN-projecting only (expressing mCherry), and 1.8% (1.4%\1.1%-2.2%) were DGC-projecting only (expressing EGFP), whereas the remaining 15.8% (16.8%\11.4%-19.1%) were dual-projecting (altogether n = 1416 cells pooled from 79 slices obtained from 3 mice; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B-D</xref>). This result is consistent with the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Valentino et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ito et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Keller et al., 2018</xref>) that PMC<sup>CRH+</sup> cells primarily project to the SPN in the spinal cord and modulate bladder contraction. By contrast, analysis of the ESR1-Cre mice showed that 19.2% (24.1%\13.9%-24.2%) of PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cells were SPN-projecting only, 53.3% (50.9%\41.2%-55.2%) were DGC-projecting only, and 27.5% (26.8%\25%-30.9%) cells were dual-projecting (n = 1417 cells pooled from 82 slices obtained from 5 mice; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F-H</xref>). These data suggest that PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cells innervate either SPN or DGC in a more balanced manner and include a significant fraction of dual-innervating cells, in contrast to PMC<sup>CRH+</sup> cells that primarily innervate the SPN.</p>

<p>The functional and anatomical data above together suggest that PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cells can function as a 100% reliable âmaster switchâ either to initiate or to suspend voiding through independently operating the bladder (via SPN to the pelvic nerve) and the sphincter (via DGC to the pudendal nerve). We now come to the final question as to whether PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cells can implement the coordination between the bladder and urethra sphincter, i.e., operate them in a rigid temporal order. We took advantage of the simultaneous recording of cystometry and EUS-EMG condition (e.g. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) in which the beginning/ending timepoint of bladder pressure upstroke (a significant rapid, transient increase in bladder pressure preceding voiding, denoting threshold pressure of bladder contraction) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rana et al., 2024</xref>) and the stereotypic voiding-associated firing pattern of EUS-EMG (denoting sphincter relaxation) could be precisely determined. In the photometry recording experiments when voiding events spontaneously occurred, the bladder pressure upstroke timepoint always preceded the beginning timepoint of the EUS-EMG firing pattern (bladder pressure upstroke onset: 0.6\0.3-1.2 s, EMG bursting onset: 2.3\1.5-3.2 s, relative to the onset of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals; n = 46 events pooled from 8 mice; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). Accordingly, in the photoactivation experiments, the bladder pressure upstroke timepoint also preceded the EMG bursting pattern begin timepoint, albeit both were slightly earlier than those in âpassiveâ spontaneous photometry recordings (bladder pressure upstroke onset: 0.4\0.4-0.5 s, EMG bursting onset: 0.8\0.7-1.0 s; n = 50 events pooled from 10 mice; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). Despite that the photoactivation of the PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cells could have been artificially strong and did not necessarily mimic the naturalistic firing pattern of PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cells (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G-I</xref>), the same temporal order as bladder contraction preceded sphincter relaxation suggests that the downstream circuity was instructed to execute in the same temporal order. Intriguingly, in photoinhibition experiments, the EMG pattern almost instantaneously ended, while the bladder pressure upstroke end timepoint occurred later (EMG bursting end: 0.1\0.1-0.2 s; bladder pressure upstroke end: 0.8\0.8-0.9 s, n = 44 events pooled from 8 mice; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>). These timing results can be interpreted from a broader perspective by considering the lower spinal reflex circuit together with PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> projections from the brainstem (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>). Since the lower spinal reflex circuit is the forefront agent that can send a feedforward reflex signal from the bladder to the sphincter unidirectionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lee et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">de Groat et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abud et al., 2015</xref>), the brainstem coordination signal descending in two parallel paths from PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cells would result in the initiation of voiding with the same forwarding order but in the suspension of ongoing voiding with the reversed order.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A prominent aspect of our data is that voiding events 100% correlated with PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> neuronal activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), and both photoactivation and photoinhibition of PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cells yielded a 100% success rate in initiating and suspending the process of voiding, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Whilst there are many other factors from both the lower spinal circuit and the higher cortical/subcortical circuits together to determine in what condition to void (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Yao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">de Groat et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Sartori et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">de Groat, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Zderic, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Mukhopadhyay and Stowers, 2020</xref>), the instantaneous execution to efficiently initiate or suspend a voiding process involves a significant contribution of PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cells in the brainstem as demonstrated here in this study. The bidirectional control, i.e., in the one way to initiate voiding whenever needed and suitable (which is a basic life need) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Mukhopadhyay and Stowers, 2020</xref>), and in the other way to suspend an ongoing voiding when needed (e.g., to release only a small volume of urine for landmarking) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Keller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hyun et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Desjardins et al., 1973</xref>), can be executed at 100% reliability by PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cells given that all downstream nerves and muscles are intact and operational.</p>
<p>Moreover, the anatomical data also revealed a significant fraction of dual-projecting PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref>) which we consider to play a significant role in the coordination of the bladder and sphincter. Because these two projections originate from the same cells, the âonâ and âoffâ commands for bladder contraction sent from these cells would always align with the âonâ and âoffâ commands for sphincter relaxation, respectively. As such, the brainstem can serve the upstream higher brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Yao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zare et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Manohar et al., 2017</xref>) (e.g., the neocortex) with a 100% reliable âmaster switchâ to urinate a desired volume whenever in physiological or social needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Mukhopadhyay and Stowers, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Malykhina, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kaur et al., 2014</xref>), e.g., to mark territories with small urine spots as an animal, or to urinate into a small sample tube for a health check as a human.</p>
<p>The fact that PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cells can execute dynamic, real-time control of voiding at 100% reliability does not imply that other cell types in the PMC are not required to achieve the same goal of perfect urination control. On the contrary, we suggest that a proper baseline control of bladder pressure is also mandatory, e.g., by CRH<sup>+</sup> cells which are the majority of cells in PMC that primarily operate the bladder through the pelvic nerve and can be modulated by various contextual factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Vincent and Satoh, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wood et al., 2009</xref>). After all, it is not the cell type domain marker ESR1 (which by itself abundantly expressed in many other regions of the brain and is involved in many other physiological and cognitive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Karigo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fang et al., 2018</xref>)), but rather the topology of innervation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>) that directly enables such a role of urination coordination, i.e., a cell of whichever marker that locates in this particular brainstem nucleus (PMC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kawatani et al., 2021</xref>) and possesses dual innervations towards both the bladder and sphincter is a potent contributor to urination coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Griffiths, 2015</xref>). Nevertheless, our pinpointing of PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cells performing a 100% reliable role in bladder-sphincter coordination enlightens the future development of precise therapies for treating urination coordination disorders.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In summary, we have identified the essential role of PMC<sup>ESR1</sup> neurons in coordinating urination through co-innervation of both the bladder and urethra sphincter. Our findings offer new insights into the anatomical and physiological basis and research paradigms for the coordinated engagement of parasympathetic and somatic functions of urination control. PMC<sup>ESR1</sup> neurons may serve as a key focal point for advancing our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying urination, both in physiological contexts and pathological conditions such as brain injuries, spinal cord injuries, and peripheral nerve damages.</p>

<p>The experiment procedures were approved by the Third Military Medical University Animal Care and Use Committee and were conducted strictly in adherence to established guidelines. This study utilized ESR1-IRES-Cre (Jackson Laboratory, stock #017911) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lee et al., 2014</xref>) and CRH-IRES-Cre (Jackson Laboratory, stock #012704) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baram et al., 2015</xref>) mice. These mice were group-housed in an environment-controlled room at 23-25â and 50% humidity, with 4-5 mice per cage, on a 12-hour light/dark cycle, and with free access to food and water. Mice implanted with optical fibers were housed individually. Both male and female mice, aged 8-20 weeks, were randomly assigned to various experiments.

<title>Virus vectors and CTB</title>
<p>The study utilized the following viruses and cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) for various experiments: For fiber photometry recording experiments, AAV2/9-DIO-GCaMP6f (titer: 0.5 Ã 10<sup>12</sup> vg/ml) was unilaterally injected into the PMC. For optogenetic manipulation experiments, AAV2/9-hsyn-DIO-hGtACR1-mCherry (titer: 1.43 Ã 10<sup>13</sup> vg/ml) and AAV2/8-DIO-ChR2-mCherry (titer: 1.33 Ã 10<sup>13</sup> vg/ml) were bilaterally delivered into the PMC for photoinhibition and photoactivation, respectively.

<title>Stereotaxic injections and optical fiber implant</title>
<p>To target PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> neurons, ESR1-Cre mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (3% for induction and 1.5â2% for maintenance) and head-fixed in a stereotaxic frame (RWD Life Science Co., Ltd.; Shenzhen, China). Body temperature was maintained at 36Â°C throughout the surgery using a heating pad. Local anesthesia (lidocaine, 6 mg/kg, subcutaneous injection) was administered at the incision site before making the incision. A small cranial hole above the PMC was created using a dental drill. Approximately 80 nl of the viral solution was delivered to the injection site at a controlled rate of 20 nl/min, either unilaterally or bilaterally, using a micro-syringe pump connected to a glass pipette. The coordinates for PMC injections were: anteroposterior (AP) is -5.45 mm, mediolateral (ML) is Â± 0.70 mm, and dorsoventral (DV) is -3.14 mm from the dura. The pipette was then slowly withdrawn over 5 min to prevent virus overflow. The incision was closed with sutures, and the mice received antibiotics and analgesics post-surgery. A heating pad was used for the mice to aid recovery from anesthesia. The mice were then group-housed in their home cages for 3-4 weeks to allow for viral expression.</p>
<p>For optic fiber implantation, the optic fiber (NA: 0.48, diameter: 200 Î¼m, Doric lenses, Quebec City, QC, Canada) was fixed into a metal cannula and positioned 50 Î¼m above the PMC injection site. The fiber was implanted unilaterally for photometry experiments and bilaterally for optogenetics experiments. Dental cement was used to affix the optical fiber to the skull. Mice were housed individually and given 3-5 days to recover before recording or stimulation sessions. After the experiments, the placement of the virus and optical fiber was confirmed by histology in each mouse.</p>

<title>Targeted spinal cord injections</title>
<p>For spinal cord injection surgery, the method previously described was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, mice were anesthetized under isoflurane (1.5-2% oxygen) and positioned on a heating pad. After shaving the hair, a midline skin incision (1-2 cm) was performed over the lumbar segments following local anesthesia (lidocaine, 6 mg/kg, subcutaneous injection) at the incision site. The tissue and muscle connected to the dorsal spine were dissected to expose the T12-L2 vertebrae. The spine was affixed to a stereotactic frame using a spinal adapter (68094, RWD), and the spinal cord between L1 and L2 was exposed by removing the ligamentous and epidural membranes. Using the central vein as a reference, a total of 80 nL of virus solution was injected at two different locations, each injection (40 nL) was administered through a micro-syringe pump connected to a glass pipette, targeting DGC (+ 0.12 mm lateral to the central vein, 0.52 mm deep from the dorsal surface at a 10-degrees angle) and SPNs (- 0.12 mm lateral to the central vein, 0.52 mm deep from the dorsal surface at a 30-degrees angle). The pipette remained in position for a minimum of 5 min before being slowly removed to prevent any leakage. The injection sites were sealed with tissue glue (Vetbond, 3M Animal Care Products), followed by suturing of the skin. Mice received antibiotics and analgesics post-surgery. Approximately 3-4 weeks after the injections, the brain and spinal cords were extracted for histological validation. In ESR1-Cre or CRH-Cre mice, PMC cells projecting to the SPN (labeled with mCherry) and DGC (labeled with EGFP) regions of the spinal cord were manually quantified using Image J.</p>

<title>Pudendal nerve and pelvic nerve transection</title>
<p>Pudendal nerve transection was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Khorramirouz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Peh et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (1.5-2% oxygen) and positioned on a heating pad. A midline skin incision was made along the back from L4 to the coccyx, followed by paraspinal incisions through the gluteal muscles and fascia to expose the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve was gently retracted to expose the pudendal nerve. Using microsurgical scissors, the bilateral pudendal nerves, along with the anastomotic branch, were carefully dissected and excised.</p>
<p>For pelvic nerve transection, modifications to the established method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chang et al., 2018</xref>) were made to minimize surgical trauma. Mice were positioned laterally, and bilateral paraspinal incisions were extended upward. The sciatic and pudendal nerves were gently retracted laterally to expose the pelvic nerve, which was identified (originating from the sacral segments of the spinal cord and connecting to the major pelvic ganglion) and severed. For pelvic nerve transection experiments in freely moving mice, the muscles and skin were sutured, and antibiotics and analgesics were administered. In the sham injury group, the same procedures were followed, except for the transection of the pelvic nerve.</p>

<title>Fiber photometry recording and analysis in freely behaving mice</title>
<p>The Ca<sup>2+</sup> recordings of PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> neurons were conducted using a fiber photometry setup, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Yao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Rao et al., 2022</xref>). Fluorescence at the fiber tip was excited by blue light (0.22 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>). Mice with implanted fibers were injected intraperitoneally with diuretics (furosemide, 40 mg/kg) and acclimated in a testing chamber equipped with a bottom camera (1,280 Ã 720 pixels) for 20 min before recording. Signals from PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> neurons and voiding behavior were simultaneously recorded for approximately 40 min. Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were sampled at 2000 Hz using NI LabVIEW software (National Instruments, USA), while behavioral video was captured at 30 Hz. Fiber photometry data and video were synchronized via event markers. For data analysis, all signals were processed with a Savitzky-Golay filter (third-order polynomial, 50 side points) for low-pass filtering. Îf/f = (f - f<sub>baseline</sub>)/f<sub>baseline</sub> was calculated to assess photometry signals during voiding, where f<sub>baseline</sub> represents the minimum fluorescence recorded. Results were presented as heatmaps using MATLAB. Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal data were shuffled by dividing the original dataset into 10 segments and randomly associating them with voiding events. Positive signals were defined as Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal amplitudes exceeding three times the noise band (the standard deviation). This procedure was also applied to control mice to correct for movement artifacts.</p>

<title>Single-unit with optrode recording and analysis</title>
<p>To identify the single-unit activity of PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> neurons, optrode recordings were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Qin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Qin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Yang et al., 2023</xref>). Briefly, the optrode consisted of a 200 Âµm optical fiber and four tetrode assemblies aligned in a line, spaced 100 Âµm apart. The optical fiber was secured to the electrodes, positioned 500 Âµm above their tips, and connected to an LED. Each electrode assembly comprised four twisted tungsten wires (25 Âµm, California Fine Wire), allowing vertical movement via micromanipulators. Optrode implantation surgery was performed in ESR1-Cre mice expressing ChR2 in the PMC, with the electrode tips aligned and implanted 2.80 mm below the brain dura. After a recovery period of 5-7 days, the tetrodes were slowly inserted to a target depth of -2.95 mm and recording began. Single-unit signals from PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> neurons in freely behaving mice were recorded using an RHD2000 USB board (C3100, Intan Technology) at 20 kHz, while behavioral video was captured simultaneously. Units with short spike latencies (&lt; 7 ms) in response to light pulses of varying intensities (5 mW, 10 mW, 15 mW, and 20 mW) and high responsiveness (&gt; 70 %) were identified as PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> cells. To confirm recording locations, electro-lesions were performed by applying a current (10 Î¼A, 12 s) through the tetrodes.</p>
<p>The raw recorded data were preprocessed using established methods to extract peaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Qin et al., 2018</xref>). All events exceeding the amplitude threshold (set at four standard deviations above the background) were kept for further analysis. The average firing rate of each cell was calculated within a sliding time bin of 20 seconds around voiding (0.1 s intervals), divided by the total number of trails, and adjusted by subtracting the baseline value (the median firing rate during the -10 to -5 s before voiding). The results were visualized as a heatmap (logarithmic analysis) in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. Statistical analysis of the average firing rates over a 2-second interval before voiding (from -10 s to -8 s) and around voiding (from -1 s to 1 s) was conducted for PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> neurons and non-PMC<sup>ESR1+</sup> neurons, respectively.</p>

<title>Optogenetic experiments in freely behaving mice</title>
<p>Before optogenetic stimulation, mice underwent the same procedures as for fiber photometry: they received a diuretic with the intraperitoneal injection to increase urination events and were acclimated to the testing chamber for at least 20 min. For optogenetic inhibition experiments, bilateral stimulation (1 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> at fiber tips, 50 Hz frequency, 20 ms pulses) was delivered using 473 nm blue light. To assess the effect of light inhibition on urination, mice were placed in a glass chamber (28 cm Ã 16 cm Ã 30 cm) with a 0.19 mm filter paper (14.6 cm Ã 27 cm, BWD) underneath. Urination was observed at three stages: pre-photoinhibition (light-off), during the 5 s or 60 s of photoinhibition (light-on), and post-photoinhibition (light-off). The photoinhibition parameters (frequency and duration) were controlled via the NI LabVIEW platform (National Instruments, USA). Real-time urination behavior was monitored simultaneously using two cameras positioned above and below the glass chamber (Chongqing NewLight Co., Ltd; see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.newlightxhr.com">www.newlightxhr.com</ext-link>). The laser was manually triggered at the onset of urination (within 4 s), and experiments where the trigger exceeded 4 s were excluded. Urination cessation was defined as the initiation of movement after urination. The void area, total void duration, and latency were analyzed from the video and are presented in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figures supplement 5</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>.</p>
<p>For optogenetic activation experiments, bilaterally fiber-implanted mice were connected to two 473-nm blue laser generators (5 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> at fiber tips, 25 Hz frequency, 15 ms pulses) via optic fibers. During testing, blue light was delivered for 5 s with approximately 3-min intervals between trials, over a 30-45 min session. This light stimulation was repeated over two days with a one-day interval. Mouse behavior was monitored and recorded simultaneously. The stimulation was performed before and after transection for photoactivation experiments in freely behaving mice with pelvic nerve transection using the same procedures. Note that the photostimulation experiments for pelvic nerve transactions were conducted one day after the surgery.

<title>Simultaneous cystometry and electromyography in anesthetized mice</title>
<p>Bladder catheter and urethral sphincter electrode implantation were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Verstegen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Keller et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, adult fiber-implanted ESR1-Cre mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and placed on a heating pad. A lower mid-abdomen incision exposed the bladder and urethral sphincter. PE-10 tubing was inserted through the bladder dome and secured with a 6-0 Ethicon suture. For electromyography (EMG) recording, two 160 Î¼m silver-plated copper wire electrodes (P/N B34-1000, USA) with 2 mm exposed tips were inserted into the external urethral sphincter (EUS) on both sides using a 30-gauge needle, positioned between the urethra and pubic symphysis, and spaced at least 2 mm apart. A ground wire with 4 mm exposed tips was inserted subcutaneously near the sternal notch to minimize signal interference. The ends of the bladder catheter tubing and wire electrodes were exteriorized through an incision on the skin at the back of the neck, and both abdominal and neck incisions were closed. For measuring intravesical pressure, the bladder tubing was connected to a pressure transducer (YPJ01H; Chengdu Instrument Factory, China) and a syringe pump (RWD404; RWD Technology Corp., Ltd., China) via three-way stopcocks. Bladder pressure and EUS-EMG data were recorded through a multi-channel physiological recording device (RM6240; Chengdu Instrument Factory, China) sampled at 8 kHz. After surgery, mice were permitted to recover from anesthesia and resume walking.</p>
<p>For simultaneous recording, all fiber-implanted mice were anesthetized with urethane (1.2 g/kg, i.p.) and continuously infused with room-temperature physiological saline at 30-50 Âµl/min via the bladder catheter for at least 45 min. Recording or stimulation was performed once regular bladder pressure cycles associated with natural urination events were established. âFilling bladderâ was defined as continuous saline infusion, while ânon-filling bladderâ was defined as no infusion. Cystometry and EUS-EMG data were captured via commercial acquisition software, alongside monitoring of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and mouse behavior. For cross-correlation analysis, cystometric data, EMG data, and photometry data were first downsampled to 40 Hz and standardized using z-scored. The original EMG data were processed to extract their envelope using MATLABâs âenvelopeâ function. The original data were merged, and divided into 10 segments, and segments of photometry data were randomly matched with segments of cystometry or envelope EMG data to create shuffled datasets. Cross-correlations of cystometric and photometry data, or EMG and photometry data were calculated using MATLABâs âxcorrâ function, and the peak values of cross-corrections were reported, as shown in Supplementary Figure 3.</p>
<p>For photoactivation experiments performed simultaneously with cystometry and electromyography recording, blue light pulses were delivered periodically (every 30 s) at 25 Hz for 15 ms, lasting 5 s, or randomly at intervals between 20 s and 40 s, with each condition repeated at least 15 times. For photoactivation experiments performed simultaneously with cystometry and urethral electromyography recording under pelvic or pudendal nerve transection conditions, the surgical procedures and pre-recording preparations were the same as those described above, with the following changes: Mice underwent three stages of randomized photostimulation (consisted of 25 Hz, 15 ms, 5-s durations, with intervals between 30 s and 60 s) in sequence under urethane anesthesia (1.2 g/kg, i.p.): an intact nerve period, a pudendal nerve or pelvic nerve transection period, and a period with both pudendal nerve and pelvic nerve transection. All trials were pooled to assess the impact of nerve transection on bladder and sphincter function for each mouse. Cystometric data, including ÎP = P<sub>5 sec</sub> -P<sub>0 sec</sub> (where P<sub>0 sec</sub> is the pressure at the onset of laser stimulation and P<sub>5 sec</sub> is the pressure at the end of laser stimulation) and the pressure ratio P<sub>ratio</sub> = P<sub>max (0-5)sec</sub> / P<sub>mean (-5-0)sec</sub> (where P<sub>max (0-5)sec</sub> is the maximum pressure from laser onset to cessation, and P<sub>mean (-5-0)sec</sub> is the average pressure during the 5 seconds preceding laser onset), were calculated using MATLAB. The EUS-EMG data (burst duration and area under the curve) were analyzed using multi-channel physiological recording software. The spectrogram was generated using envelope EMG data around photostimulation in MATLAB, as shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, and <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Figure supplement 8</xref>. The onset time of bladder pressure upstroke was identified by finding the maximum of the second derivative of cystometry curves around pressure peaks using a MATLAB script. The onset time of EMG bursting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kadekawa et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cheng, 2004</xref>) was manually defined as the points at which bursting activity begins. The results are shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>.</p>
<p>For photoinhibition experiments performed simultaneously with cystometry and electromyography recording, the light was manually triggered at the onset of EMG bursts and delivered in 20 ms pulses at 50 Hz for either 5 s or 60 s. Cystometric data, including Îpressure = P<sub>peak</sub> â P<sub>min</sub> (where P<sub>peak</sub> is the peak pressure and P<sub>min</sub> is the minimum pressure after the peak) and threshold pressure (bladder pressure upstroke), were analyzed manually using the multi-channel physiological recording software. The EUS-EMG data (burst duration, area under the curve, and latency of termination) was analyzed using the multi-channel physiological recording software. The latency of bursting termination is defined as the interval from laser onset to the end of EUS-EMG bursting. The end time of bladder pressure upstroke (termination of the rapid increase in bladder pressure before the end of voiding, denoting bladder relaxation) was identified by finding the minimum of the second derivative of cystometry curves around pressure peaks using a MATLAB script. The end time of EMG bursting was manually defined as the points at which the onset of tonic activity after bursting. The results are shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>.</p>

<title>Histology and immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Following the completion of all experiments, histological verification of fiber implantation or virus injection positions was conducted. Mice were deeply anesthetized with 1% sodium pentobarbital (10 ml/kg), followed by transcardial perfusion with cold 0.9% saline and 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The brain or spinal cord (in some experiments) was then extracted and post-fixed overnight at 4 Â°C in ice-cold 4% PFA. Coronal brain sections (40 Âµm) and the thoracolumbar and lumbosacral segments of spinal cord sections (70 Âµm) were cut using a freezing microtome. For TH immunohistochemistry, free-floating sections were initially incubated in 1% PBST (1% Triton X-100 in PBS, Sigma) for 60 min. The sections were blocked with 10% donkey serum (Sigma) in 0.1% PBST for 2 hours at room temperature. Following blocking, then incubated at 4Â°C for 24 hours with anti-TH antibodies (1:200 dilution, rabbit, Sigma-Aldrich). After extensive washing with PBS, sections were incubated with a secondary antibody (1:300, Alexa Fluor 488 or 594 donkey anti-rabbit, Invitrogen) at room temperature for 2 hours. Finally, all sections, including the target segments of the spinal cord, were incubated with DAPI (1:1000, Beyotime) for 15 min. Images were acquired using a confocal microscope (TCS SP5, Leica) equipped with Ã 4, Ã 10, and Ã 20 oil objectives, utilizing 405 nm, 488 nm, and 552 nm lasers, or with an Olympus microscope.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>All data were processed and statistically analyzed using Prism 8 GraphPad, MATLAB, and SPSS 22 software. For unpaired group comparisons, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used, and for paired groups, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was applied, as described in the figure legends. Analysis was performed by investigators blinded to the experiments. The n value reflects the final number of animals in each experiment group, with animals excluded if histological verification of gene expression showed poor or absent. Data are represented as median with 25%-75% percentiles, and statistical significance was defined as *&lt; 0.05, **&lt; 0.01, ***&lt; 0.001; ns, no significant difference.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Urination requires precise coordination between the bladder and external urethral sphincter (EUS), while the neural substrates controlling this coordination remain poorly understood. In this study, Li et al. identify estrogen receptor 1-expressing neurons (ESR1+) in Barrington's nucleus as key regulators that faithfully initiate or suspend urination. Results from peripheral nerve lesions suggest that BarEsr1 neurons play independent roles in controlling bladder contraction and relaxation of the EUS. Finally, the authors performed region-specific retrograde tracing, claiming that distinct populations of BarEsr1 neurons target specific spinal nuclei involved in regulating the bladder and EUS, respectively.</p>
<p>Strength:</p>
<p>Overall, the work is of high quality. The authors integrate several cutting-edge technologies and sophisticated, thorough analyses, including opto-tagged single unit recordings, combined optogenetics, and urodynamics, particularly those following distinct peripheral nerve lesions.</p>
<p>Weakness:</p>
<p>(1) My major concern is the novelty of this study. Keller et al. 2018 have shown that BarEsr1 neurons are active during urination and play an essential role in relaxing the external urethral sphincter (EUS). Minimally, substantial content that merely confirms previous findings (e.g. Figures 1A-E; Figures 3A-E) should be move to the supplementary datasets.</p>
<p>(2) I also have concerns regarding the results showing that the inactivation of BarEsr1 neurons led to the cessation of EUS muscle firing (Figures 2G and S5C). As shown in the cartoon illustration of Figure 8, spinal projections of BarEsr1 neurons contact interneurons (presumably inhibitory) that innervate motor neurons, which in turn excite the EUS. I would therefore expect that the inactivation of BarEsr1 should shift the EUS firing pattern from phasic (as relaxation) to tonic (removal of relaxation), rather than stopping their firing entirely. Could the authors comment on this and provide potential reasons or mechanisms for this finding?</p>
<p>(3) Current evidence is insufficient to support the claim that the majority of BarEsr1 neurons innervate the SPN but not DGC. The current spinal images are uninformative, as the fluorescence reflects the distribution of Esr1- or Crh-expressing neurons in the spinal cord, along with descending BarEsr1 or BarCrh axons. Given the close anatomical proximity of these two nuclei, a more thorough histological analysis is required to demonstrate that the spinal injections were accurately confined to either the SPN or the DGC.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors have performed a rigorous study to assess the role of ESR1+ neurons in the PMC to control the coordination of bladder and sphincter muscles during urination. This is an important extension of previous work defining the role of these brainstem neurons, and convincingly adds to the understanding of their role as master regulators of urination. This is a thorough, well-done study that clarifies how the Pontine micturition center coordinates different muscle groups for efficient urination, but there are some questions and considerations that remain.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>These data are thorough and convincing in showing that ESR1+ PMC neurons exert coordinated control over both the bladder and sphincter activity, which is essential for efficient urination. The anatomical distinctions in pelvic versus pudendal control are clear, and it's an advance to understand how this coordination occurs. This work offers a clearer picture of how micturition is driven.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The dynamics of how this population of ESR1+ neurons is engaged in natural urination events remains unclear. Not all ESR1+neurons are always engaged, and it is not measured whether this is simply variation in population activity, or if more neurons are engaged during more intense starting bladder pressures, for instance. In particular, the response dynamics of single and doubly-projecting neurons are not defined. Additionally, the model for how these neurons coordinate with CRH+ neuron activity in the PMC is not addressed, although these cell types seem to be engaged at the same time. Lastly, it would be interesting to know how sensory input can likely modulate the activity of these neurons, but this is perhaps a future direction.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The paper by Li et al explored the role of Estrogen receptor 1 (Esr1) expressing neurons in the pontine micturition center (PMC), a brainstem region also known as Barrington's nucleus (Hou et al 2016, Keller et al 2018). First, the author conducted bulk Ca2+ imaging/unit recording from PMCESR1 to investigate the correlations of PMCESR1 neural activity to voiding behavior in conscious mice and bladder pressure/external urethral muscle activity in urethane anesthetized mice. Next, the authors conducted optogenetics inactivation/activation of PMCESR1 to confirm the contribution to the voiding behavior also conducted peripheral nerve transection together with optogenetics activation to confirm the independent control of bladder pressure and urethral sphincter muscle.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The study demonstrates that pelvic nerve transection reduces urinary volume triggered by PMCESR1+ cell photoactivation in freely moving mice. Could the role of pudendal nerve transection also be examined in awake mice to provide a more comprehensive understanding of neural involvement?</p>
<p>(2) While the paper primarily focuses on PMCESR1+ cells in bladder-sphincter coordination, the analysis of PMCESR1+-DGC/SPN neural circuits - given their distinct anatomical projections in the sacral spinal cord - feels underexplored. How do these circuits influence bladder and sphincter function when activated or inhibited? Also, do you have any tracing data to confirm whether bladder-sphincter innervation comes from distinct spinal nuclei?</p>
<p>(3) Although the paper successfully identifies the physiological role of PMCESR1+ cells in bladder-sphincter coordination, the study falls short in examining the electrophysiological properties of PMCESR1+-DGC/SPN cells. A deeper investigation here would strengthen the findings.</p>
<p>(4) The parameters for photoactivation (blue light pulses delivered at 25 Hz for 15 ms, every 30 s) and photoinhibition (pulses at 50 Hz for 20 ms) vary. What drove the selection of these specific parameters? Moreover, for photoactivation experiments, the change in pressure (ÎP = P5 sec - P0 sec) is calculated differently from photoinhibition (Îpressure = Ppeak - Pmin). Can you clarify the reasoning behind these differing approaches?</p>
<p>(5) The discussion could further emphasize how PMCESR1+ cells coordinate bladder contraction and sphincter relaxation to control urination, highlighting their central role in the initiation and suspension of this process.</p>
<p>(6) In Figure 8, The authors analyze the temporal sequence of bladder pressure and EUS bursting during natural voiding and PMC activation-induced voiding. It would be acceptable to consider the existence of a lower spinal reflex circuit, however, the interpretation of the data contains speculation. Bladder pressure measurement is hard to say reflecting efferent pelvic nerve activity in real time. (As a biological system, bladder contraction is mediated by smooth muscle, and does not reflect real-time efferent pelvic nerve activity. As an experimental set-up, bladder pressure measurement has some delays to reflect bladder pressure because of tubing, but EUS bursting has no delay.) Especially for the inactivation experiment, these factors would contribute to the interpretation of data. This reviewer recommends a rewrite of the section considering these limitations. Most of the section is suitable for the results.</p>

I would therefore expect that the inactivation of BarEsr1 should shift the EUS firing pattern from phasic (as relaxation) to tonic (removal of relaxation), rather than stopping their firing entirely. Could the authors comment on this and provide potential reasons or mechanisms for this finding?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with this point. We meant that the EUSâ phasic bursting pattern was rapidly stopped upon BarEsr1 photoinhibition, but not all the firing stopped instantaneously. According to the previous studies (Chang et al., 2007, de Groat, 2009, de Groat and Yoshimura, 2015, Kadekawa et al., 2016), the voiding physiology of rodents is probably different from that of humans, such that for rodents the urine is step-wise pumped out in the gap time between multiple consecutive EUS phasic bursting epochs, and for humans the urine is continuously pumped out once the EUS firing is almost fully inhibition during a period of time. Namely, for mice, the EUS display sustained tonic activity following phasic bursting, while, in contrast, for humans the EUS keeps tonic firing until the moment of voiding onset (complete inhibition, muscle relaxed). Despite the prominent differences in the basic physiological properties, our assumption is that the logic of circuits from the brainstem to the urethra in this pathway is evolutionally conserved for both species; thus the logic of brainstem coordination of voiding could also be the same for both species, which is the main interest of our study (of using an animal model to address concerns of human health). Thus, to interpret our data for a broader audience we made a simplified and inaccurate expression. We apologize for the inaccuracy and we will correct our previous inaccurate description in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(3) Current evidence is insufficient to support the claim that the majority of BarEsr1 neurons innervate the SPN but not DGC. The current spinal images are uninformative, as the fluorescence reflects the distribution of Esr1- or Crh-expressing neurons in the spinal cord, along with descending BarEsr1 or BarCrh axons. Given the close anatomical proximity of these two nuclei, a more thorough histological analysis is required to demonstrate that the spinal injections were accurately confined to either the SPN or the DGC.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that current evidence is insufficient to support the current claim. To address this concern and strengthen our claim, we will repeat the retrograde viral tracing experiments, combined with CTB647 injections to label the injection site, to validate specific targeting of SPN or DGC populations. We will also add higher-magnification imaging to distinguish BarESR1 axonal projections targeting SPN versus DGC. Results from these ongoing experiments will be incorporated into the revised manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors have performed a rigorous study to assess the role of ESR1+ neurons in the PMC to control the coordination of bladder and sphincter muscles during urination. This is an important extension of previous work defining the role of these brainstem neurons, and convincingly adds to the understanding of their role as master regulators of urination. This is a thorough, well-done study that clarifies how the Pontine micturition center coordinates different muscle groups for efficient urination, but there are some questions and considerations that remain.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>These data are thorough and convincing in showing that ESR1+PMC neurons exert coordinated control over both the bladder and sphincter activity, which is essential for efficient urination. The anatomical distinctions in pelvic versus pudendal control are clear, and it's an advance to understand how this coordination occurs. This work offers a clearer picture of how micturition is driven.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The dynamics of how this population of ESR1+ neurons is engaged in natural urination events remains unclear. Not all ESR1+neurons are always engaged, and it is not measured whether this is simply variation in population activity, or if more neurons are engaged during more intense starting bladder pressures, for instance. In particular, the response dynamics of single and doubly-projecting neurons are not defined. Additionally, the model for how these neurons coordinate with CRH+ neuron activity in the PMC is not addressed, although these cell types seem to be engaged at the same time. Lastly, it would be interesting to know how sensory input can likely modulate the activity of these neurons, but this is perhaps a future direction.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In response to the reviewerâs comments, we will attempt perform the following revisions for this round:</p>
<p>(1) Engagement of ESR1+ neurons in natural urination events:</p>
<p>We agree that probably not all ESR1+ neurons are consistently engaged during urination. To address this, we will perform a detailed analysis of the opto-tagged single unit recordings data.</p>
<p>(2) Response dynamics of single- and doubly-projecting neurons:</p>
<p>(a) We will use retrograde labelling combined with Ca2+ photometry recordings to differentiate the response dynamics of SPN- and DGC-projecting neurons during urination.</p>
<p>(b) We will perform functional validations to assess the specific roles of single- and doubly-projecting neurons in coordinating bladder and EUS activity.</p>
<p>(3) Coordination with CRH+ neurons in the PMC:</p>
<p>
We appreciate the suggestion to include CRH+ neurons in our model. We will expand our model to incorporate CRH+ neurons and their potential interactions with ESR1+ neurons.</p>
<p>(4) Sensory modulation of ESR1+ neurons:</p>
<p>
The reviewer raises an excellent point regarding sensory input modulation of ESR1+ neuron activity. Although this is beyond the scope of our current study, we recognize its importance and propose to include this as a future direction.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The paper by Li et al explored the role of Estrogen receptor 1 (Esr1) expressing neurons in the pontine micturition center (PMC), a brainstem region also known as Barrington's nucleus (Hou et al 2016, Keller et al 2018). First, the author conducted bulk Ca2+ imaging/unit recording from PMCESR1 to investigate the correlations of PMCESR1 neural activity to voiding behavior in conscious mice and bladder pressure/external urethral muscle activity in urethane anesthetized mice. Next, the authors conducted optogenetics inactivation/activation of PMCESR1 to confirm the contribution to the voiding behavior also conducted peripheral nerve transection together with optogenetics activation to confirm the independent control of bladder pressure and urethral sphincter muscle.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The study demonstrates that pelvic nerve transection reduces urinary volume triggered by PMCESR1+ cell photoactivation in freely moving mice. Could the role of pudendal nerve transection also be examined in awake mice to provide a more comprehensive understanding of neural involvement?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the suggestion, the pudendal nerve transection in awake mice is indeed a challenging experiment that has been missed. We will try it for the revision.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) While the paper primarily focuses on PMCESR1+ cells in bladder-sphincter coordination, the analysis of PMCESR1+-DGC/SPN neural circuits - given their distinct anatomical projections in the sacral spinal cord - feels underexplored. How do these circuits influence bladder and sphincter function when activated or inhibited? Also, do you have any tracing data to confirm whether bladder-sphincter innervation comes from distinct spinal nuclei?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this great comment. The projection-specific neuronal function analysis is, as also suggested by Reviewer 2 in a similar comment (#8), missing in our first submission. These are so challenging experiments that we have missed in the first round of tests, but we decide to pursuit this goal again. Namely, we will perform photometry recordings of PMC neurons projecting to the DGC/SPN during measuring bladder pressure and urethral sphincter EMG activity. Additionally, while our study does not include direct tracing data to confirm distinct spinal nuclei for bladder and sphincter innervation, this has been well-documented in classic literature (Yao et al., 2018, Karnup and De Groat, 2020, Karnup, 2021). Specifically, anatomical studies have shown that SPN primarily innervates the bladder, while the DGC is associated with the innervation of the urethral sphincter. We will cite these references to provide context and support for our interpretations.</p>
<p>(3) Although the paper successfully identifies the physiological role of PMCESR1+ cells in bladder-sphincter coordination, the study falls short in examining the electrophysiological properties of PMCESR1+-DGC/SPN cells. A deeper investigation here would strengthen the findings.</p>
<p>While our study primarily focuses on the functional role of PMCESR1+ neurons in bladder-sphincter coordination, we acknowledge that understanding their intrinsic electrophysiological characteristics could further strengthen our findings. However, this aspect falls beyond the scope of the current study. Nevertheless, we recognize the significance of this direction and are excited to pursue it in future research. We appreciate the reviewerâs suggestion, as it highlights an important avenue for expanding upon our current findings.</p>

<p>(4) The parameters for photoactivation (blue light pulses delivered at 25 Hz for 15 ms, every 30 s) and photoinhibition (pulses at 50 Hz for 20 ms) vary. What drove the selection of these specific parameters? Moreover, for photoactivation experiments, the change in pressure (ÎP = P5 sec - P0 sec) is calculated differently from photoinhibition (Îpressure = Ppeak - Pmin). Can you clarify the reasoning behind these differing approaches?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for raising these important points and for the opportunity to clarify our experimental design and data analysis methods.</p>
<p>Photoactivation versus photoinhibition parameters: The differences in photoactivation (25 Hz, 15 ms pulses) and photoinhibition (50 Hz, 20 ms pulses) protocols are based on the distinct physiological and technical requirements for activating versus inhibiting PMCESR1+ neurons. For photoactivation, 25 Hz stimulation aligns with the natural firing patterns of central neurons, allowing for intermittent activation without exceeding the neuronal refractory period. The shorter pulse duration (15 ms) minimizes phototoxicity and avoids overstimulation, as performed in previous studies (Keller et al., 2018). In contrast, photoinhibition requires sustained suppression of neuronal activity, achieved through higher frequencies (50 Hz) and longer pulses (20 ms) to ensure continuous coverage of neuronal activity.</p>
<p>Calculation of pressure changes (ÎP) for photoactivation and photoinhibition: The differing methods for calculating pressure changes reflect the distinct physiological effects we aimed to capture. In photoactivation experiments (ÎP = P5 sec - P0 sec), the pressures before (P0 sec) and 5 seconds after (P5 sec) light delivery were compared to capture the immediate effect of light activation on bladder pressure, focusing on the onset and early dynamics of activation. In contrast, photoinhibition experiments assessed the immediate impact of light-induced suppression on bladder pressure during an ongoing voiding event. Here, Îpressure was calculated as Ppeak â Pmin to measure the rapid drop in pressure directly attributable to neuronal inhibition.</p>
<p>We will expand these details in the methods section of the revised manuscript to provide greater transparency.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The discussion could further emphasize how PMCESR1+ cells coordinate bladder contraction and sphincter relaxation to control urination, highlighting their central role in the initiation and suspension of this process.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully agree with this point. Additionally, in response to your and other reviewersâ suggestions, we are preparing a new round of experiments with projection-specific recording, and thus our discussion and conclusion will also be updated according to the newly obtained data.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) In Figure 8, The authors analyze the temporal sequence of bladder pressure and EUS bursting during natural voiding and PMC activation-induced voiding. It would be acceptable to consider the existence of a lower spinal reflex circuit, however, the interpretation of the data contains speculation. Bladder pressure measurement is hard to say reflecting efferent pelvic nerve activity in real time. (As a biological system, bladder contraction is mediated by smooth muscle, and does not reflect real-time efferent pelvic nerve activity. As an experimental set-up, bladder pressure measurement has some delays to reflect bladder pressure because of tubing, but EUS bursting has no delay.) Especially for the inactivation experiment, these factors would contribute to the interpretation of data. This reviewer recommends a rewrite of the section considering these limitations. Most of the section is suitable for the results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for mentioning the possibility of bladder pressure measurement delay. We would prefer to perform a physical control test to quantify how much delay this measurement is under our experimental conditions. We will use a small ballon to mimic the bladder and use two identical pressure sensors, one with a very short tube inserted into the ballon and one with an extended tube same as in our animal experiments. We will then mimic both contraction initiation and halting, and quantify the delay between the two sensors.</p>
