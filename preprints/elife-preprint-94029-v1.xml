<title>Abstract</title><p>Despite the recent breakthrough of AlphaFold (AF) in the field of protein sequence-to-structure prediction, modeling protein interfaces and predicting protein complex structures remains challenging, especially when there is a significant conformational change in one or both binding partners.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In-silico protein structure prediction, <italic>i.e.,</italic> sequence to structure, tackles one of the core questions in structural biology. AlphaFold <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> has brought a paradigm shift in the field of structural biology by intertwining deep-learning (DL) tools with evolutionary data to predict single-chain structures with high accuracy. Further, AlphaFold-multimer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> (AFm) and related work <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> have demonstrated the utility of AlphaFold to predict protein complexes. The association of proteins to form transient or stable protein complexes often involves binding-induced conformational changes. Capturing conformational dynamics of protein-protein interactions is another grand challenge in structural biology, and many physics-based (computational) approaches have been used to tackle this challenge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> Computational tools have sampled the uncharted landscape of protein-protein interactions by emulating kinetic mechanisms such as conformer selection and induced-fit and by identifying energetically stable binding states. However, these tools are hampered by the accuracy of the energy functions and the limitations of time and length scales for sampling. In fact, AF-multimer (AFm) predicted accurate protein complexes in only 43% of cases in one recent study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> As the development of DL-based tools have unveiled ground-breaking performance in structure prediction, integration of a biophysical context has potential to strengthen prediction of protein assemblies and binding pathways.</p>
<p>Blind docking challenges prior to AF, particularly CASP13-CAPRI and CASP14-CAPRI experiments, reported high-quality predictions for only 8% targets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> With the availability of AF and AFm, the CASP15-CAPRI experiment stood as its first blind assessment for prediction of protein complexes and higher-order assemblies. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> In this round, the docking community relied on AF and AFm for single-structure or complex predictions. Given that AlphaFold generates a static three-dimensional structure, it has been unclear whether conformational diversity could be captured by AlphaFold. In other terms, given a protein sequence, could AlphaFold generate ensembles of structures that include both unbound and bound conformations? Additionally, can AlphaFold reveal intrinsic conformational heterogeneity?</p>
<p>To diversify model complexes generated with AlphaFold-multimer in the recent round of CASP15, predictors employed tuning parameters such as dropout,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> higher recycles on inference<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> or modulating the MSA inputs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> with the amino acid sequence. While these approaches demonstrated the ability to generate broader conformational ensembles, AFm performance still worsens with a higher degree of conformational flexibility between unbound and bound targets. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> Prediction accuracies especially deteriorated in bound complex regions involving loop motions, concerted motions between domains, rearrangement of secondary structures, or hinge-like domain motions, <italic>i.e.</italic>, large-scale conformational changes, which are also challenging for conventional docking methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Unlike state-of-the-art docking algorithms, AlphaFold’s output models incorporate a residue-specific estimate of prediction accuracy. This suggests a few interesting questions: (1) Do the residue-specific estimates from AF/AFm relate to potential metrics demonstrating conformational flexibility? (2) Can AF/AFm metrics deduce information about docking accuracy? (3) Can we create a docking pipeline for in-silico complex structure prediction incorporating AFm to convert sequence to structure to docked complexes?</p>
<p>Recent work in physics-based docking approaches tested induced-fit docking <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, large ensembles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, and fast-fourier transforms with improved energy functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> to capture conformational changes and better dock protein structures. Coupling temperature replica exchange with induced-fit docking, ReplicaDock 2.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> achieved successful local docking predictions on 80% of rigid (unbound-to-bound root mean square deviation, RMSD<sub>UB</sub> <italic>&lt;</italic> 1.1Å) and 61% medium (1.1 <italic>≤</italic> RMSD<sub>UB</sub> <italic>&lt;</italic> 2.2 Å) targets in the Docking Benchmark 5.0 set <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. However, like most state-of-the-art physics-based docking methods, ReplicaDock 2.0 performance was limited for highly flexible targets: 33% success rate on targets with RMSD<sub>UB</sub> <italic>≥</italic> 2.2 Å. Promisingly, by focusing backbone moves on known mobile residues (<italic>i.e.,</italic> residues that exhibit conformational changes upon binding), ReplicaDock 2.0 sampling substantially improved the docking accuracy. But the flexible residues must first, somehow, be identified. Additionally, physics-based docking is quite slow (6-8 hrs on a 24-core CPU cluster) compared to recent DL based docking tools (0.1-10 minutes on a single NVIDIA GPU). However, docking-specific DL tools such as EquiDock <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> and dMASIF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> do not allow for protein flexibility, and recent tools like GeoDock, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> and DockGPT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> have very limited backbone flexibility. Further, all of these DL docking tools have low success rates on unbound docking targets such as those in Docking Benchmark 5.5. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this work, we combine the features of a top deep learning approach (AlphaFold-multimer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>) with physics-based docking schemes (ReplicaDock 2.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>) to systematically dock protein interfaces. The overarching goal is to create a robust pipeline for easier, reproducible, and accurate modeling of protein complexes. We investigate the aforementioned questions and create a protocol to resolve AFm failures and capture binding-induced conformational changes. We first assess the utility of AFm confidence metrics to detect conformational flexibility and binding site confidence. Next, we feed these metrics and the AFm-generated structural template to ReplicaDock 2.0, creating a pipeline we call AlphaRED (AlphaFold-initiated Replica Exchange Docking). We test AlphaRED’s docking accuracy on a curated set of benchmark targets of bound and unbound protein structures of varying levels of binding-induced conformational change, including antibody-antigen interfaces, which additionally challenge AF2m due to the lack of evolutionary information across the interface. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> In summary, we to assess the promise of combining the best of deep learning and biophysical approaches for predicting challenging protein complexes.</p>

<title>Dataset curation</title>
<p>We curated a dataset for conformational flexibility from the Docking Benchmark Set 5.5 (DB5.5) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, which comprises experimentally-characterized (X-ray or cryo-EM) structures of bound protein complexes and their corresponding unbound protein subunits. Each protein target (with unbound and bound structures) is classified based on their unbound-to-bound root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD<sub>UB</sub>) as rigid (RMSD<sub>UB</sub> <italic>≤</italic> 1.2 Å), medium (1.2 Å <italic>&lt;</italic> RMSD<sub>UB</sub> <italic>≤</italic> 2.2 Å) or difficult (RMSD<sub>UB</sub> <italic>≥</italic> 2.2 Å). Further, owing to the poor performance of AlphaFold and other predictor groups in predicting antibody-antigen targets in the recent CASP15-CAPRI round<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, we identified a subset comprising only antibody-antigen complexes (including single domain antibodies, or nanobodies) by extracting all the 67 antibody-antigen structures from the DB5.5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> set. The comprehensive dataset includes 254 protein targets exhibiting binding-induced conformational changes.</p>
<p>For each protein target, we extracted the amino acid sequences from the bound structure and predicted a corresponding three-dimensional complex structure with the ColabFold implementation (github.com/YoshitakaMo/localcolabfold) of the AlphaFold-multimer v2.3.0 (released March 2023) for all 254 benchmark targets. Being trained on experimentally-characterized structures deposited in the PDB, AlphaFold is expected to produce models analogous to the PDB structures. However, since both unbound and bound structures exist for the benchmark targets in the PDB, we first investigated whether AFm exhibits any bias towards either unbound or bound forms for the same protein sequence. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> compares the C<italic>α</italic>-RMSD of all protein partners of the AFm predicted complex structures from the bound (B) and unbound (U) crystal structures on a log-log scale (a few AFm predicted models were 20 Å apart from both bound and unbound structures). As evident from <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, the protein partners from the AFm top-ranked model deviate from both unbound and bound forms and skew more often towards the bound state. Antibody-antigen targets further demonstrate a similar trend, however with fewer targets predicted within sub-angstrom accuracy to the bound form (29.7% for Ab-Ag targets as opposed to 41% for DB5.5).</p>

<title>AlphaFold pLDDT provides a predictive confidence measure for backbone flexibility</title>
<p>AlphaFold employs multiple sequence alignments with a multi-track attention-based architecture to predict three-dimensional structures of proteins and complexes. Further, for each structural prediction, it provides a residue-level confidence measure: the predicted local-distance difference test (pLDDT), estimating the agreement between predicted model to an experimental structure based on the C<italic>α</italic> LDDT test (<italic>Methods</italic>). Tunyasuvunakool <italic>et al.</italic> analyzed pLDDT confidence measures for the human proteome demonstrating the correlation between lower pLDDT scores with higher disordered regions in protein structures. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> Building on this observation, we evaluated whether there is a correlation between AlphaFold pLDDT confidence metric and the experimental metrics of conformational change between unbound and bound structures. In this regard, we compared the computational (AF-pLDDT) and experimental (per-residue RMSD and LDDT) metrics against each other.</p>
<p>As a reference, we first superimposed the unbound partners over the bound structures and calculated residue-wise C<italic>α</italic> deviations to determine the per-residue RMSD<italic><sub>BU</sub></italic> values. LDDT<italic><sub>BU</sub></italic> was measured by calculating the local distance differences in the unbound structure relative to the bound form. These metrics capture the extent of motion in the unbound-bound transitions for each of the protein targets. Next, we compared the per-residue pLDDT score from AFm predicted monomer models with the experimental metrics. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A,B</xref> shows the results for two representative protein targets: kinase-associated phosphastase in complex with phospho-CDK2 (1FQ1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>) and TGF-<italic>β</italic> receptor with FKBP12 domain (1B6C <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>). In both cases, pLDDT confidence scores correlate with the experimental measurements of binding: pLDDT decreases as LDDT<italic><sub>BU</sub></italic> decreases and RMSD<italic><sub>BU</sub></italic> increases. This is further illustrated with the AF2 predicted structures of the two targets superimposed over the bound structures (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). In regions of low confidence/pLDDT (highlighted in <italic>red</italic>), the prediction is inaccurate, but higher confidence/pLDDT regions (highlighted in <italic>blue</italic>) have high accuracy of prediction with the bound form. The results for the entire benchmark set (Fig. S1) show similar trends for most targets. The pLDDT, thus, can suggest protein residues that move upon binding.</p>

<title>Interface-pLDDT correlates with DockQ and discriminates poorly docked structures</title>
<p>When the prediction accuracy is lower, it is often evident from lower confidence metrics (such as average pLDDT or PAE). However, for AlphaFold-multimer complex predictions, the confidence metrics of the overall prediction do not correlate with the accuracy of the docked prediction, <italic>i.e.</italic>, even if the complex exhibits higher confidence, the docking interfaces could be incorrect. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> shows a few examples of failed AFm predictions including rigid (2FJU<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>), medium (5VNW<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>) and flexible targets (1IB1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, 2FJG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>). In all the examples, the AFm model (highlighted in <italic>red</italic> to <italic>blue</italic> based on residue-wise pLDDT) is superimposed over an individual binding partner, and the bound structure is highlighted in <italic>pale-green</italic>. AFm models predict the individual subunits (protein partners) accurately in almost all scenarios, however the docking orientation is incorrect.</p>

</fig>
<p>We investigated whether any of the AlphaFold predictive metrics could be repurposed for distinguishing native-like binding sites from non-native ones. That is, can one could utilize pLDDT or PAE from AFm models to determine whether the predicted docked complex has the accurate binding orientation? Thus, we evaluated accuracy with the DockQ score, the standard metric for docking model quality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> DockQ <italic>∈</italic> [0, 1] combines interface RMSD (Irms), fraction of native-like contacts (<italic>f</italic><sub>nat</sub>), and ligand-RMSD (Lrms). DockQ scores above 0.23 correspond to models with a CAPRI quality of “acceptable” or higher. As an acceptable quality target implies docked decoys are in the near-native binding region, we chose a binary classification of success with a threshold of DockQ = 0.23. We then tested how well DockQ correlated with several AFm-derived metrics: (a) Interface residues: the number of interface residues (atoms of residues on one partner within 8 Å from an atom on another partner); (b) Interface contacts: the number of interface contacts between the residues on the interface (C<italic>β</italic> atoms within 5 Å); (c) Average pLDDT, determined by averaging over the per-residue LDDT score of the entire protein complex; and (d) Interface-pLDDT, determined by averaging the per-residue LDDT score only over the predicted interfacial residues (as identified in case <italic>a</italic>).</p>
<p><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> shows the classification accuracy of each of these metrics with a receiver-operating characteristics curve. The interface-pLDDT metric stands out with a higher true positive rate (TPR) with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.86. With interface-pLDDT as a discriminating metric, we set an interface-pLDDT cut-off of 85 to estimate its accuracy and precision at distinguishing near-native structures (defined as an interface-RMSD <italic>&lt;</italic> 4 Å). <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref> summarizes the performance with a confusion matrix. 80% of the targets are classified accurately with a precision of 78%, thereby validating the utility of interface-pLDDT as a discriminating metric to rank the docking quality of the AFm complex structure predictions. This discrimination is also evident in the highlighted interface residues in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, where the AFm predicted models have lower confidence at predicted interfaces (<italic>red</italic>). Finally, we show the trend between DockQ scores and interface-pLDDT for each target in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>. The interface-pLDDT threshold of 85 (<italic>dashed line</italic>) thus can serve as the AlphaFold-derived metric to distinguish acceptable quality docked predictions from incorrect models.</p>

<title>Docking benchmark targets initiated from AlphaFold models improves performance</title>
<p>With metrics to identify the flexible regions in the protein and the docking accuracy of generated docked models, we next fused AlphaFold-multimer (AFm) with our docking protocol, ReplicaDock 2.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, to build a protocol for: (1) improving on incorrect AF docking predictions and producing alternate, near-native binding models and (2) capturing backbone conformational changes with our induced-fit protocol ReplicaDock2.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. We named the protocol AlphaRED (AlphaFold-initiated Replica Exchange Docking). AlphaRED uses AFm predicted structures as the primary template, estimates docking accuracy metrics, and initiates global docking or refinement protocols as required.</p>
<p><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> illustrates this docking pipeline. After AFm predicts a model from the protein sequences, we calculate the interface-pLDDT to determine the docking scheme to follow. If the AFm model is likely to be inaccurate (interface pLDDT <italic>&lt;</italic> 85), we initiate a global replica exchange docking simulation to explore the protein conformational landscape and identify putative binding sites. On the other hand, if the interface-pLDDT <italic>&gt;</italic> 85 for the AFm predicted model, the docked complex is likely in the correct binding orientation. This implies the global docking stage of the protocol can be skipped and local docking simulations can be directly initiated from the complex coordinates. Global docking follows an exhaustive, rigid-body search (no backbone moves) between the protein partners to sample putative landscapes in the energy landscape. An unbiased global docking simulation is initiated by randomizing the spatial orientation of protein partners from the input structure. The replica exchange MC routine ReplicaDock 2.0 performs rigid-body rotations (8<italic><sup>◦</sup></italic>) and translations (4 Å). Sampled decoys are clustered from all replicas (based on energies and structural similarity) and the five top clusters are passed along for flexible local docking.</p>

<p>Starting with protein sequences of putative complexes, we obtain predicted models from AlphaFold.

</fig>
<p>For flexible local docking, we perform aggressive backbone moves (backrub + kinematic closure, <italic>Methods</italic>) on candidate encounter complexes (clustered decoys), with fine rigid-body rotations and translations. To narrow conformational sampling, backbone moves are explicitly performed over residues identified as mobile’ based on the per-residue pLDDT metric (residue pLDDT <italic>&lt;</italic> 80). Unlike ReplicaDock 2.0 that performs induced-fit over putative interfaces, this approach targets backbone motions over these predicted mobile residues, reducing the sampling space. Local docking decoys are further refined for side-chain packing and minimization to obtain the final docked structures (details in <italic>Methods</italic>). The methodological advancements and Rosetta movers in AlphaRED are further detailed in the <italic>Methods</italic> section.</p>
<p>We investigated AlphaRED’s performance on all 254 benchmark targets (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). 97 targets under the threshold of interface-pLDDT (<italic>≤</italic> 85) were passed to the global docking branch. Targets with interface-pLDDT over 85 proceeded directly to local docking refinement. For all benchmark targets, we compared AlphaRED performance of the top-scoring decoys against initial AFm-predicted complex structures. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref> shows the interface-RMSD (Irms) of the AFm and AlphaRED predictions from the bound structure, respectively. The lower Irms values indicate that AlphaRED improves on existing predictions for almost all targets. For targets where AFm prediction is determined to be a failure (interface-pLDDT <italic>≤</italic> 85, <italic>red</italic>), AlphaRED demonstrates a vast improvement in Irms for 93 out of 97 targets. Additionally, for targets where AFm prediction is considered acceptable (interface-pLDDT <italic>&gt;</italic> 85), local docking slightly improves performance.

<p>For each target, we employed the AlphaRED strategy as described in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>AlphaFold has dramatically transformed the field of structural biology and is currently the state-of-the-art method to predict protein structures from sequences, not just for monomers but also for complexes and higher assemblies. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> One of the key elements of its success was the ability to mine evolutionary links between amino acids across protein families and determine structural templates. This approach dramatically improves prediction accuracy for monomers as reflected from prior CASP rounds. However, across protein interfaces, the evolutionary constraints can be weak and often skew predictions to inaccurate binding sites. Here we demonstrated how augmenting the predictions of AlphaFold with an energy-function dependent sampling approach reveals better backbone conformational diversity and accurate prediction of protein complex structures. By utilizing the AlphaRED strategy, we show that failure cases in AFm predicted models are improved for all targets (lower Irms for 97 of 254 failed targets) with CAPRI acceptable-quality or better models generated for 66% of targets overall (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>).</p>

<p>First, we showed that AlphaFold confidence measures can be repurposed for estimating flexibility and docking accuracy. Interface-pLDDT, an average of the per-residue pLDDT only for the interfacial residues, is a robust metric to determine whether AFm predicted binding interfaces are correct. Additionally, thresholds of per-residue pLDDT can ascertain regions of backbone flexibility upon binding. Thus, AFm predicted models can be used as input structures for ReplicaDock 2.0 guiding the choices of global or local sampling and identifying the mobile protein segments. With DL-methods for structure prediction and downstream sampling with a physics-based energy function, one can efficiently explore the protein energy landscape as demonstrated with AlphaRED’s performance on DB5.5. Finally, we evaluated recent CASP15 targets to investigate the extrapolation of this strategy over blind protein targets. CASP15 targets were absent from the training routine of AlphaFold and served as blind challenges to determine the efficacy of the protocol. With AlphaRED, we obtained DockQ scores over 0.23 for all five targets, with medium-quality models (DockQ <italic>&gt;</italic> 0.49) for targets T205, T207, and T208 respectively. AFSample, a top-performing group in CASP15, employed stochastic perturbation with dropout and increased sampling to obtain medium and high-quality models for these targets. However, AFSample requires GPU simulations to produce <italic>∼</italic>240x models with compute time <italic>∼</italic>1000x more than the baseline AFm. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> On other hand, we utilized ColabFold <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> to generate 1-5 structures for our docking routine with the baseline version. As opposed to a couple of days on GPU (each GPU node contains up to 48 cores) utilized by AFSample, our docking routine fused with ColabFold uses 5-7 hours on our CPU cluster (runs on 1 node, with 24 cores, approximating to <italic>∼</italic>100 hours of CPU-hours per target). The AlphaRED docking strategy demonstrates a new and better way to predict protein complex structures within feasible compute times.</p>
<p>This work is particularly impactful for its success rate on antibody-antigen targets. Deep learning promises accurate design and optimization of antibody therapeutics <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, but a lack of fast and accurate docking methods for antibodies prevent high-throughput computational screening. Additionally, this work is impactful because by integrating a physics-based method for refinement, the pipeline can potentially handle post-translationally modified proteins or non-canonical residue types that are not defined in ML approaches like AF.</p>
<p>With this work, we have built upon the recent advances in structural biology to develop a robust tool for protein docking. We fused deep-learning tools with conventional physics-based sampling tools to develop a pipeline that extracts the best outcomes of each methodology; where deep-learning methods generate accurate, static structures, and physics-based sampling provides diversity and better discrimination. The protein conformational landscape is vast and deep-learning tools such as AlphaFold provide a snapshot of relevant local minima that can aid in narrowing down the degrees of freedom in sampling. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> With the paradigm shift in computational structural biology towards deep-learning approaches, integrating physics within these models has tremendous potential towards understanding protein dynamics, modulating protein-protein interactions, and downstream applications to protein design.</p>

<title>Metrics for backbone flexibility: RMSD and LDDT</title>
<p>Structures of proteins deposited in the PDB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> provide a static representation of the native-state of the protein. However, structural diversity has been captured by experimental techniques to identify different states of a protein in diverse physiological or chemical states, e.g. catalysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, transport<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, and ligand binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. For protein docking challenges in particular, conformational changes are binding-induced, leading to structural differences between unbound and bound structures of protein targets.</p>
<p>To measure the conformational change in protein structures, we calculated two metrics: C<italic>α</italic> root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) and local distance difference test (LDDT) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. To get a detailed representation of the intrinsic motion of a protein, we calculated RMSDs at a residue-level, <italic>i.e.</italic>, per-residue C<italic>α</italic> RMSD for each residue of a protein target. The sequences+structures of unbound and bound proteins were aligned and the RMSDs were calculated for the aligned residues. The total sequence lengths were also matched and lingering end-termini residues were trimmed to ensure structural and sequential similarity.</p>
<p>Local Distance Difference Test (LDDT) is a superimposition-free score that estimates local distance differences in a model relative to a reference structure. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> Unlike the Global Distance Test (GDT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> score based on rigid-body superimposition, the LDDT score measures the conserved local interactions in the protein model to the reference. For every residue, it computes the distance between all pair of atoms <italic>D</italic>(<italic>i, j</italic>) in both the model and the reference structure (bound) within a threshold (defined as the inclusion radius, generally set to 10 Å). For each pairwise distance in both distance vectors, if the distance is within the threshold, the distance is considered conserved and the fraction of conserved distances is calculated. The final LDDT score is the average of this fraction for the tolerances of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 Å.</p>

<p>The advantage of the LDDT measurement lies in the estimation of relative domain orientations in multi-domain proteins or concerted motions (e.g.: hinge-like moves in closed and apo proteins). In these cases, the RMSDs would be relatively high for all residues in the mobile domain, however, since the inter-residue distances within the domains are conserved, they would provide an inaccurate depiction of flexibility for the protein. Estimating both RMSDs and LDDT scores allows us to obtain a nuanced perspective of flexibility during protein association based on experimental structures.</p>

<title>Developing a pipeline for protein docking</title>
<p>Using AlphaFold2 as a structural module, we built a pipeline for protein-protein docking to better predict protein complex structures with relatively higher accuracy. As illustrated in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, given a sequence of a protein complex, we use the ColabFold implementation of AF2-multimer to obtain a predictive template. An interface-pLDDT filter determines the accuracy of the docking prediction of the top-ranked model from AFm. If the interface-pLDDT <italic>≤</italic> 85, the prediction has lower confidence in the docking orientation, and the protocol initiates a rigid, global docking search with ReplicaDock 2.0. Implementation of ReplicaDock 2.0 (global docking) is similar to the version reported in prior work <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Each simulation initiates 8 trajectories across 3 temperature replicas with inverse temperatures set to 1.5<sup>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> kcal<italic><sup>−</sup></italic><sup>1</sup>.mol, 3<italic><sup>−</sup></italic><sup>1</sup> kcal<italic><sup>−</sup></italic><sup>1</sup>.mol and 5<italic><sup>−</sup></italic><sup>1</sup> kcal<italic><sup>−</sup></italic><sup>1</sup>.mol, respectively. Across each replica within each trajectory, rigid body perturbations (4 Å translations and 8<italic><sup>◦</sup></italic> rotations) are performed for an exhaustive global search. Next, we perform an energy-based clustering of the models to obtain diverse and energetically favourable clusters. Five cluster centers (decoys) are selected and passed to the flexible local docking stage to sample conformational changes.</p>
<p>On other hand, if the interface-pLDDT <italic>&gt;</italic> 85, the binding orientation has higher confidence and the protocol directly performs a flexible local docking simulation skipping the rigid, global docking. In this stage, we perform smaller rigid-body perturbations (1 Å translations and 3<italic><sup>◦</sup></italic> rotations) and aggressive backbone moves using a set of backbone and side-chain movers: Rosetta <monospace>Backrub</monospace> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, <monospace>Balanced Kinematic Closure</monospace> (BalancedKIC) and <monospace>Sidechain</monospace>.

We perform directed backbone sampling by focusing on predicted mobile residues (per residue pLDDT <italic>&lt;</italic> 80). This is automated with the <monospace>BFactorResidueSelector</monospace> that selects contiguous sets of residues below the specified pLDDT threshold.</p>
<p>However, unlike the induced-fit strategy in ReplicaDock <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, we perform backbone sampling directed only on the mobile residues (with per residue pLDDT <italic>&lt;</italic> 80) identified from the AlphaFold model.

<p>The authors report a previously published method ReplicaDock to improve predictions from AlphaFold-multimer (AFm) for protein docking studies. The level of improvement is modest for cases where AFm is successful; for cases where AFm is not as successful, the improvement is more significant, although the accuracy of prediction is also notably lower. Therefore, the evidence for the ReplicaDock approach being more predictive than AFm is <bold>solid</bold> for some cases (e.g., the antibody-antigen test case) but <bold>incomplete</bold> for the more extensive test sets (e.g., those presented in Figure 6). Overall, the study makes a <bold>valuable</bold> contribution by combining data- and physics-driven approaches.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors wanted to use AlphaFold-multimer (AFm) predictions to reduce the challenge of physics-based protein-protein docking.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
They found that two features of AFm predictions are very useful. 1) pLLDT is predictive of flexible residues, which they could target for conformational sampling during docking; 2) the interface-pLLDT score is predictive of the quality of AFm predictions, which allows the authors to decide whether to do local or global docking.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. As admitted by the authors, the AFm predictions for the main dataset are undoubtedly biased because these structures were used for AFm training. Could the authors find a way to assess the extent of this bias?</p>
<p>2. For the CASP15 targets where this bias is absent, the presentation was very brief. In particular, it would be interesting to see how AFm helped with the docking. The authors may even want to do a direct comparison with docking results without the help of AFm.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In short, this paper uses a previously published method, ReplicaDock, to improve predictions from AlphaFold-multimer. The method generated about 25% more acceptable predictions than AFm, but more important is improving an Antibody-antigen set, where more than 50% of the models become improved.</p>
<p>When looking at the results in more detail, it is clear that for the models where the AFm models are good, the improvement is modest (or not at all). See, for instance, the blue dots in Figure 6. However, in the cases where AFm fails, the improvement is substantial (red dots in Figure 6), but no models reach a very high accuracy (Fnat ~0.5 compared to 0.8 for the good AFm models). So the paper could be summarized by claiming, &quot;We apply ReplicaDock when AFm fails&quot;, instead of trying to sell the paper as an utterly novel pipeline. I must also say that I am surprised by the excellent performance of ReplicaDock - it seems to be a significant step ahead of other (not AlphaFold) docking methods, and from reading the original paper, that was unclear. Having a better benchmark of it alone (without AFm) would be very interesting.</p>
<p>These results also highlight several questions I try to describe in the weakness section below. In short, they boil down to the fact that the authors must show how good/bad ReplicaDock is at all targets (not only the ones where AFm fails. In addition, I have several more technical comments.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Impressive increase in performance on AB-AG set (although a small set and no proteins).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The presentation is a bit hard to follow. The authors mix several measures (Fnat, iRMS, RMSDbound, etc). In addition, it is not always clear what is shown. For instance, in Figure 1, is the RMSD calculated for a single chain or the entire protein? I would suggest that the author replace all these measures with two: TM-score when evaluating the quality of a single chain and DockQ when evaluating the results for docking. This would provide a clearer picture of the performance. This applies to most figures and tables. For instance, Figure 9 could be shown as a distribution of DockQ scores.</p>
<p>The improvements on the models where AFm is good are minimal (if at all), and it is unclear how global docking would perform on these targets, nor exactly why the plDDT&lt;0.85 cutoff was chosen. To better understand the performance of ReplicaDock, the authors should therefore (i) run global and local docking on all targets and report the results, (ii) report the results if AlphaFold (not multimer) models of the chains were used as input to ReplicaDock (I would assume it is similar). These models can be downloaded from AlphaFoldDB.</p>
<p>Further, it would be interesting to see if ReplicaDock could be combined with AFsample (or any other model to generate structural diversity) to improve performance further.</p>
<p>The estimates of computing costs for the AFsample are incorrect (check what is presented in their paper). What are the computational costs for RepliaDock global docking?</p>
<p>It is unclear strictly what sequences were used as input to the modelling. The authors should use full-length UniProt sequences if they were not done.</p>
<p>The antibody-antigen dataset is small. It could easily be expanded to thousands of proteins. It would be interesting to know the performance of ReplicaDock on a more extensive set of Antibodies and nanobodies.</p>
<p>Using pLDDT on the interface region to identify good/bas models is likely suboptimal. It was acceptable (as a part of the score) for AlphaFold-2.0 (monomer), but AFm behaves differently. Here, AFm provides a direct score to evaluate the quality of the interaction (ipTM or Ranking Confidence). The authors should use these to separate good/bad models (for global/local docking), or at least show that these scores are less good than the one they used.</p>
