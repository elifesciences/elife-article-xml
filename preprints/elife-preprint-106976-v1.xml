<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a progressive disorder marked by lipid accumulation, leading to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). A key feature of the transition to MASH involves oxidative stress resulting from defects in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Here, we show that pathological alterations in the lipid composition of the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) directly instigate electron transfer inefficiency to promote oxidative stress. Specifically, mitochondrial cardiolipin (CL) was downregulated with MASLD/MASH in humans and in mice. Hepatocyte-specific CL synthase knockout (CLS-LKO) led to spontaneous and robust MASH with extensive steatotic and fibrotic phenotype. Loss of CL paradoxically increased mitochondrial respiratory capacity but also reduced the formation of I+III<sub>2</sub>+IV respiratory supercomplex, promoted electron leak primarily at sites III<sub>QO</sub> and II<sub>F</sub> of the electron transport chain, and disrupted the propensity of coenzyme Q (CoQ) to become reduced. Thus, low mitochondrial CL disrupts electron transport chain to promote oxidative stress and contributes to pathogenesis of MASH.</p>

<title>Main</title>
<p>Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a growing global health concern with an increasing prevalence that parallels the rise in obesity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> In the United States, annual medical costs related to MASLD exceed $103 billion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> A large portion of patients with MASLD only exhibit steatosis, a silent and relatively benign early stage characterized by lipid accumulation in hepatocytes without hepatocellular inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> Steatosis can then progress to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), determined by hepatocyte injury and tissue fibrosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> MASH is the last stage of MASLD that may be reversible, making intervention at this stage particularly important.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> Although extensive clinical and basic research have been conducted in this field, the underlying mechanisms by which fatty liver transitions to MASH remain poorly understood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>A defect in mitochondrial function is considered one of the hallmarks of MASLD progression in both mice and humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> MASLD is initially associated with an increase in mitochondrial respiratory capacity, followed by a subsequent impairment in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and increased production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> Mitochondrial ROS is thought to be caused by an inefficient electron transport chain (ETC) that increases the propensity for electron leak. However, the mechanisms by which mitochondrial electron leak promotes MASLD are unknown.</p>
<p>Cardiolipin (CL) is a phospholipid with four acyl chains conjugated to two phosphatidylglycerol moieties linked by another glycerol molecule.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> CL resides almost exclusively in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM), constituting approximately 15–20% of the mitochondrial phospholipids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> CL is synthesized by the condensation of phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and cytidine diphosphate-diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG) at the IMM via the enzyme cardiolipin synthase (CLS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> Structural studies indicate that CL is essential for the activities of OXPHOS enzymes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> In non-hepatocytes, decreased CL leads to compromised oxidative capacity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> impaired membrane potential,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> and altered cristae morphology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> In particular, low CL is associated with increased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this manuscript, we set out to examine the changes in liver mitochondrial lipidome induced by MASH. In both mice and in humans, mitochondrial CL was downregulated in livers with MASLD/MASH compared to healthy controls. We then performed a targeted deletion of CLS in hepatocytes and studied its effects on liver, mitochondrial bioenergetics, and potential mechanisms that drive these changes.</p>

<title>Mitochondrial cardiolipin levels are decreased in MASLD/MASH</title>
<p>Previous research from our lab in non-hepatocytes indicated that mitochondrial phospholipid composition affects OXPHOS electron transfer efficiency to alter electron leak.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> MASLD has been shown to alter the total cellular lipidome in liver.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> However, MASLD may also influence mitochondrial content in the hepatocytes, making it difficult to discern whether these are changes in the lipid composition of mitochondrial membranes and/or changes in cellular mitochondrial density. Thus, we performed liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) lipidomics specifically on mitochondria isolated from human liver samples with or without MASH. Samples from patients undergoing liver transplant or resection due to end-stage MASH (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, and <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Figure 1-table supplement 1</xref>) were compared to samples from patients without MASH, undergoing resection for benign liver tumors or metastases (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Strikingly, mitochondrial CL levels were reduced, primarily due to a decrease in tetralinoleoyl CL (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), commonly thought as the mature and functional form of CL. Additionally, levels of mitochondrial PG, an essential precursor to CL production, were also reduced, suggesting a disruption in CL biosynthesis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-E</xref>).</p>

<p>We next performed lipidomic analyses on four distinct mouse models of MASLD/MASH (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F-Q</xref>). These included: 1) mice given a Western high-fat diet (HFD, Envigo TD.88137) or standard chow diet for 16 weeks (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>), 2) ob/ob mice or their wildtype littermates at 20 weeks of age (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>), 3) mice given the Gubra Amylin NASH diet for 30 weeks (GAN, Research Diets D09100310) or standard chow (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>), 4) mice injected with carbon tetrachloride (CCI<sub>4</sub>) or vehicle (corn oil) for 6 weeks (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). Importantly, none of these interventions appear to alter the protein abundances of OXPHOS subunits or citrate synthase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J-M</xref>), suggesting that these interventions did not alter mitochondrial density in hepatocytes. Nevertheless, we performed all mitochondrial lipidomic analyses by quantifying lipids per mg of mitochondrial proteins. Each intervention appeared to alter different subsets of mitochondrial lipid classes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1N-Q</xref>, and <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), as seen with our previous studies in skeletal muscle and brown adipose tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> We take these observations to mean that most physiological interventions induce multiple systemic and local responses that are not mechanistically directly related to the phenotype of interest (e.g., cold exposure or exercise can increase food intake, obesity could affect locomotion and insulation, etc.). Although several phospholipid classes were altered among the four models, strikingly, mitochondrial CL was reduced in all four MASLD/MASH models (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1N-R</xref>). Furthermore, PG was significantly increased in all MASLD/MASH models (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1N-R</xref>).

<p>We sought to further characterize livers from control and CLS-LKO mice.

To more comprehensively describe the effects of loss of hepatic CLS on gene expression, we performed RNA sequencing on these livers. CLS deletion increased the expression of 713 genes and decreased 1026 genes (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>).

<p>MASLD is known to be associated with reduced mitochondrial oxidative capacity, and such an effect may also occur with CL deficiency to induce lipid accumulation. Indeed, mRNA levels of several genes in the ETC were downregulated with CLS deletion, particularly those associated with structural components of the ETC complexes and the electron carrier CoQ (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Given that CL is located in the IMM where it binds to enzymes involved in OXPHOS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> we reasoned that the loss of CL could reduce mitochondrial oxidative capacity to promote steatosis. Consistent with subcellular localization of CL, CLS deletion resulted in mitochondria with disorganized membrane structures and poorly developed cristae (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). However, mitochondrial density quantified with western blots for respiratory complex subunits and citrate synthase (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>), as well as mtDNA/nucDNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>), showed no differences in livers from control and CLS-LKO mice. We thus speculated that CL lowers respiratory capacity not by reducing the total number of mitochondria or OXPHOS respirasomes, but by reducing the activity of respiratory enzymes. To our surprise, CLS deletion increased, rather than decreased, mitochondrial respiration (<italic>J</italic>O<sub>2</sub>), as measured by high-resolution Oroboros respirometry (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>), using both with Krebs cycle substrates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>) as well as fatty acyl substrates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3L</xref>), to a similar degree. Importantly, these changes occurred in the absence of differences in OXPHOS subunit abundance per unit of mitochondria (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3M</xref>), ruling out the possibility that changes in the abundance of respiratory enzymes are contributing to the change in respiration. A caveat to these findings is that CLS deletion promotes reduction in respiratory capacity after HFD-feeding (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>) However, CLS-LKO mice are steatotic in standard chow-fed condition, indicating that reduced mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation cannot be the cause of steatosis at baseline. The initial increase in respiration followed by its subsequent decrease is reminiscent of what is thought to occur with liver’s mitochondrial respiration over the course of MASLD progression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>High-resolution respirometry experiments were performed in isolated mitochondria from hepatocytes by providing exogenous supraphysiological concentrations of substrates. While these assays provide robust measurements of respiratory capacity (the potential of mitochondria), they do not necessarily reflect their endogenous activity. To address this point, we performed stable isotope tracing experiments using uniformly labeled <sup>13</sup>C-palmitate (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> in murine hepa1-6 cells without (scrambled shRNA or shSC) or with CLS knockdown (shRNA targeting CLS or shCLS). Surprisingly, but consistent with the <italic>J</italic>O<sub>2</sub> data, CLS deletion increased, not decreased, the incorporation of palmitate into TCA intermediates (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B-D</xref>). We also performed a similar tracing experiment using uniformally labeled <sup>13</sup>C-glucose (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E-J</xref>, and <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-E</xref>) and observed increased labeling towards pyruvate (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E,F</xref>), reduced labeling towards lactate and alanine (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>, and <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>), and normal labeling towards TCA intermediates except for reduced labeling towards succinate (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H-J</xref>, and <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B,C,E</xref>).

<p>To further examine the efficiency of the electron transport chain, we studied the redox state of CoQ, a carrier that feeds electrons from complex I and II into complex III. It is noteworthy that CoQ, like CL, is a lipid molecule (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>), and we thought it was conceivable that CL somehow interacts with CoQ to influence its electron transfer efficiency. Using redox mass spectrometry, we measured CoQ levels in whole liver tissues from control and CLS-LKO mice and found no difference in whole liver tissue CoQ levels (<xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A-I</xref>). However, since CoQ may also be found outside of mitochondria, we performed CoQ redox mass spectrometry in isolated mitochondria fractions of livers from control or CLS-LKO mice. Indeed, oxidized CoQ levels were increased (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>, and <xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7—figure supplement 1J,L,N</xref>) in CLS-LKO mice compared to their controls. In contrast, reduced forms of CoQ were not lower in CLS-LKO mice compared to control mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref>, and <xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7—figure supplement 1K,M,O</xref>). Our findings that the normal level of reduced CoQ yielded greater oxidized CoQ, combined with increased electron flux (i.e., increase <italic>J</italic>O<sub>2</sub>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J-L</xref>) can be interpreted to mean that there is a defect at the interface of CoQ-complex III that disrupts the efficient transfer of electrons promoting electron leak at site III<sub>QO</sub>. Conversely, it may also be interpreted that there are defects at complex I and II where oxidized CoQ are unable to become reduced due to lack of their ability to efficiently charge CoQ, also promoting electron leak.</p>
<p>To extrapolate these findings into humans, we went back to liver samples from patients undergoing liver transplant or resection due to end-stage MASH (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) to quantify the abundance of mitochondrial CoQ. MASH was associated with a striking ∼40% reduction in the abundance of mitochondrial CoQ (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7I</xref>) (tissue samples were not large enough to perform CoQ redox mass spectrometry on mitochondria). A Pearson correlation analysis showed a highly robust correlation between the abundances of mitochondrial CL and CoQ (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7J</xref>, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.64), indicating that the variability in the abundance of CL explains 64% of the variability of the abundance of CoQ. Based on our findings that CL is reduced with MASLD/MASH and that loss of CL influences CoQ electron transfer efficiency, we interpret these findings to mean that loss of CL destabilizes CoQ in humans.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In hepatocytes, disruptions of mitochondrial bioenergetics lead to and exacerbate metabolic-associated steatohepatitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> CL, a key phospholipid in the inner mitochondrial membrane, plays a critical role in mitochondrial energy metabolism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> In this manuscript, we examined the role of CL in the pathogenesis of MASLD. In mice and in humans, MASLD/MASH coincided with a reduction in mitochondrial CL levels. Hepatocyte-specific deletion of CLS was sufficient to spontaneously induce MASH pathology, including steatosis and fibrosis, along with shift in immune cell populations towards a more pro-inflammatory profile, all of which occurred in mice given a standard chow diet. Paradoxically, high-resolution respirometry and stable isotope experiments showed that CLS deletion promotes, instead of attenuates, mitochondrial oxidative capacity in a fashion reminiscent of temporal changes that occur with mitochondrial bioenergetics in human MASH.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> Our principal finding on the role of hepatocyte CL in bioenergetics is that its loss robustly increases electron leak. This was likely due to: 1) direct interaction of CL with complex III, 2) lower abundance of I+III<sub>2</sub>+IV respiratory supercomplex, 3) global electron leak from the electron transport chain, and 4) loss of CL potentially interfering with the ability of CoQ to transfer electrons. In humans, mitochondrial CL and CoQ were co-downregulated in MASH patients compared to healthy controls, with a strong correlation (R² = 0.64) between CL and CoQ. Together, these results implicate CL as a key regulator of MASH progression, particularly through its effect on the electron transport chain to promote oxidative stress.</p>
<p>How might CL regulate CoQ? CoQ is the main electron transporter between complex I/II and III. CLS deletion in hepatocytes appeared to disrupt CoQ’s ability to cycle between its oxidized and reduced forms. There are several ways in which low CL might directly or indirectly influence CoQ’s redox state. The primary suspect is CL interacting with complex III, as eight or nine CL molecules are tightly bound to complex III<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> and are thought to be essential to its function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> While CL has been found to bind to other respiratory complexes, our data suggest that loss of CL might disproportionately influence complex III. This is also supported by our findings that the loss of CL reduced the formation of complex III-dependent supercomplex, without influencing other supercomplexes. Reduced capacity for complex III to efficiently accept electrons from CoQ might explain the increased electron leak at site III<sub>Q0</sub> and increased level of oxidized CoQ. Meanwhile, loss of CL also increased electron leak at complex I and II. CL has also been implicated to bind to these complexes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> Thus, complex III dysfunction is perhaps unlikely to entirely explain electron leaks at sites I<sub>F</sub>, I<sub>Q</sub>, and II<sub>F</sub>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> Conversely, complex I and II are unlikely to be the only primary sites of defect as such defects probably will not promote electron leak at site III<sub>QO</sub>. Moreover, CLS deletion did not have an effect on the abundance of reduced CoQ despite there being greater abundance of oxidized CoQ, suggesting that complex I/II might also have reduced ability to transfer electrons onto CoQ. Another potential mechanism by which CL influences CoQ redox state is by CL directly interacting with CoQ. As they are both lipid molecules in the IMM, low CL may reduce the lateral diffusability of CoQ between respiratory complexes. Low CL might also indirectly influence CoQ by contributing to changes in membrane properties, distribution of ETC in the cristae, and the cristae architecture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> Finally, increased electron leak, regardless of their origin, could have a feed-forward effect by which oxidative stress disrupts redox homeostasis in other components of ETC.</p>
<p>MASH is a progressive liver disease characterized by lipid accumulation, inflammation, and fibrosis in the liver.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup> The progression to MASH involves a complex interplay of metabolic stress, mitochondrial defects, and immune responses that collectively promote hepatocellular injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> Our findings suggest that a low mitochondrial CL level directly induces key pathological features of MASH, including steatosis, fibrosis, and immune cell infiltration, even in the absence of dietary or environmental stressors, such as high-fat diet. When mice were fed a standard chow diet, CLS-LKO mice were more prone to lipid droplet accumulation than control mice. This phenotype was exacerbated when the mice were challenged with a high-fat diet. We primarily interrogated the mitochondrial bioenergetics of standard chow-fed control or CLS-LKO mice. A lower respiration rate would partially explain the lipid droplet accumulation, but to our surprise, CLS deletion increased <italic>J</italic>O<sub>2</sub> regardless of substrates. Similarly, experiments using uniformly labeled <sup>13</sup>C-palmitate or <sup>13</sup>C-glucose showed that CLS deletion promoted an overall increase in the flux toward TCA intermediates, particularly for palmitate. CLS deletion did not appear to increase de novo lipogenesis or reduce VLDL secretion. Thus, it is unclear what mechanisms contribute to steatosis induced by CLS deletion.</p>
<p>Liver fibrosis is characterized by the accumulation of excess extracellular matrix components, including type I collagen, which disrupts liver microcirculation and leads to injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> Livers from CLS-LKO mice exhibited more fibrosis compared to control mice, even on a standard chow diet, which was worsened when fed a high-fat diet. Indeed, transcriptomic analyses revealed that CLS deletion activates pathways for fibrosis and degeneration, with many of the collagen isoforms upregulated. In the MASH liver, collagen deposition is accompanied by inflammatory cell infiltrate promoting an overall inflammatory environment. Flow cytometry experiments further confirmed that CLS deletion led to an increase in Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> cell population, suggesting that dying resident Kupffer cells are being replaced by Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes in the livers of CLS-LKO mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>Early in the MASLD disease progression, mitochondria adapt to the increased energy demands by increasing their respiratory capacity. In the later stages of disease progression to MASH, mitochondrial respiration diminishes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> This pattern was reminiscent of our observations in the CLS-LKO mice. Livers from CLS-LKO mice fed a standard chow diet exhibited greater respiratory capacity compared to that of control mice. Conversely, livers from CLS-LKO mice on a high-fat diet exhibited lower respiratory capacity compared to that of control mice. We interpret these findings to suggest that liver mitochondria in chow-fed CLS-LKO mice are more representative of early stage of MASLD, while high-fat-diet fed CLS-LKO mice resemble later stages of MASLD.</p>
<p>In non-hepatocytes, low CL levels have been linked to electron leak in the context of a deficiency of the tafazzin gene, a CL transacylase, whose mutation promotes Barth syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> Paradoxically, we previously showed that CLS deletion in brown adipocytes does not increase electron leak.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> It is important to note that CLS deletion in our current or previous study does not completely eliminate CL (likely due to an extracellular source). We do not believe that CL is dispensable for efficient electron transfer in adipocytes. Rather, due to unclear mechanisms, different cell types likely exhibit varying tolerances to low CL influencing their bioenergetics, with brown adipocytes appearing more tolerant than hepatocytes. Regardless, electron leak was elevated with CLS deletion in both standard chow and high-fat diet-fed conditions. These observations mirror what has been shown in MASLD progression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup> The effect of CLS deletion on electron leak was due to reduced CL levels, as the reintroduction of cardiolipin via SUVs completely rescued the electron leak.</p>
<p>CL is reported to be essential for the formation and stability of supercomplexes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup> CL has a distinctive conical shape with four fatty acyl chains, which allows it to create a highly curved membrane environment in the IMM, promoting close packing of protein complexes that likely facilitates supercomplex formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> CL also directly interacts with various subunits of the ETC complexes through electrostatic interactions, which help stabilize the supercomplexes by anchoring them together in a specific spatial orientation to optimize electron flow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> Liver-specific deletion of CLS only resulted in a lower abundance of the I+III<sub>2</sub>+IV supercomplex. We interpret these findings to mean that I+III<sub>2</sub>+IV supercomplex is particularly sensitive to the reduced CL level in hepatocytes.</p>
<p>In our study, we observed a striking correlation between CL levels and CoQ in human liver samples from healthy/MASH patients (R<sub>2</sub> of 0.64). In contrast, low mitochondrial CL induced by CLS deletion coincided with a greater mitochondrial CoQ content in CLS-LKO mice compared to controls. These data likely suggest that acute and robust reduction in CLS or CL level might trigger a compensatory CoQ production in mice. Conversely, because the samples from healthy/MASH patients were from those who had cirrhosis, MASH samples likely came from subjects that had suffered from years of MASLD pathology. In those samples, where reduction in CL was quantitatively modest compared to what was induced with CLS knockout, CoQ might have gradually decreased coincidental to the decrease in CL. Regardless of these differences in mice and humans, it is clear that there is a relationship between CL and CoQ that is worth further exploration.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our findings identify a critical role for CL in regulating ETC efficiency to promote oxidative stress. In both humans and mice, MASLD is associated with a decrease in hepatic mitochondrial CL, suggesting that low CL may be the cause of the obligatory increase in oxidative stress known to occur with MASLD progression. We further link CL deficiency to increased electron leak from the electron transport chain, and as the primary defect that promotes oxidative stress. We believe that these bioenergetic changes underlie the pathogenesis of MASLD, as CL deletion was sufficient to cause steatosis, fibrosis, and inflammation, phenocopying many changes that occur with MASLD/MASH progression. Further research will be needed to fully uncover how CL regulates CoQ, and to test whether rescuing the CL/CoQ axis might be effective in treating patients with MASLD/MASH.</p>

The liver extract was mashed through a 70µm filter and re-suspended in RPMI-1640 containing 10% FBS and centrifuged at 1600 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet re-suspended in approximately 4 ml of 70% Percoll, then transferred to 15 ml conical tube, carefully overlayed with 4 ml of 30% Percoll and centrifuged 1600 rpm for 25 min with the brake turned off. The non-parenchymal cell suspension from the Percoll interface was removed and mixed with 10 mL of RPMI-1640 containing 10% FBS and the cells were centrifuged at 1600 rpm for 5 min. Red blood cells (RBC) were removed from the pelleted single cell suspensions of livers non-parenchymal cells by incubation in an ammonium chloride -based 1x RBC lysis buffer (Thermofisher, eBioscience).

<title>Electron microscopy</title>
<p>To examine mitochondrial ultrastructure and microstructures, freshly dissected liver tissues from CLS-LKO and their controls were sectioned into ≈2 mm pieces and processed by the Electron Microscopy Core at University of Utah. To maintain the ultrastructure of the tissue via irreversible cross-link formation, each section was submerged in fixative solution (1% glutaraldehyde, 2.5% paraformaldehyde, 100 mM cacodylate buffer pH 7.4, 6 mM CaCl2, 4.8% sucrose) and stored at 4°C for 48 hours. Samples then underwent 3 × 10-minute washes in 100 mM cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) prior to secondary fixation (2% osmium tetroxide) for 1 hour at room temperature. Osmium tetroxide as a secondary fixative has the advantage of preserving membrane lipids which are not preserved using aldehyde alone. After secondary fixation, samples were subsequently rinsed for 5 minutes in cacodylate buffer and distilled H<sub>2</sub>O, followed by prestaining with saturated uranyl acetate for 1 hour at room temperature. After prestaining, each sample was dehydrated with a graded ethanol series (2 × 15 minutes each: 30%, 50%, 70%, 95%; then 3 × 20 minutes each: 100%) and acetone (3 × 15 minutes) and were infiltrated with EPON epoxy resin (5 hours 30%, overnight 70%, 3 × 2-hour 40 minute 100%, 100% fresh for embed).

<title>Isolation of mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions</title>
<p>Liver tissues were minced in ice-cold mitochondrial isolation medium (MIM) buffer [300 mM sucrose, 10 mM Hepes, 1 mM EGTA, and bovine serum albumin (BSA; 1 mg/ml) (pH 7.4)] and gently homogenized with a Teflon pestle. To remove excess fat in the samples, an initial high-speed spin was performed on all samples: homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 10 mins at 4°C, fat emulsion layers were removed and discarded, and resulting pellets were resuspended in MIM + BSA. Samples were then centrifuged at 800 x g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatants were then transferred to fresh tubes and centrifuged again at 1,300 x g for 10 min at 4°C. To achieve the mitochondrial fraction (pellet), the supernatants were again transferred to new tubes and centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 10 min at 4°C. The resulting crude mitochondrial pellets were washed three times with 0.15 M KCl to remove catalase, and then spun a final time in MIM. The final mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in MIM buffer for experimental use. For cytosolic fraction, the supernatant from 12,000 x g spin was ultracentrifuged at 180,000 x g for 16 hours in a fixed angle rotor (FIBERLite, F50L-24×1.5). The top half of the supernatant was collected as analyzed as the cytosolic fraction for western blotting analyses.</p>

<title>Mitochondrial respiration measurements</title>
<p>Mitochondrial O<sub>2</sub> utilization was measured using Oroboros O2K Oxygraphs. Isolated mitochondria (50 µg for TCA substrate respiration and 100 µg for fatty acid respiration) were added to the oxygraph chambers containing assay buffer Z (MES potassium salt 105 mM, KCl 30 mM, KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 10 mM, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 5 mM, BSA 1 mg/ml). Respiration was measured in response to the following substrates: 0.5 mM malate, 5 mM pyruvate, 2.5 mM ADP, 10 mM succinate, 1.5 μM FCCP, 0.02 mM palmitoyl-carnitine, 0.5 mM malate.</p>

<title>Mitochondrial <italic>J</italic>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub></title>
<p>Mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production was determined in isolated mitochondria from liver tissue using the Horiba Fluoromax-4/The Amplex UltraRed (10 μM)/horseradish peroxidase (3 U/ml) detection system (excitation/emission, 565:600, HORIBA Jobin Yvon Fluorolog) at 37°C. Mitochondrial protein was placed into a glass cuvette with buffer Z supplemented with 10 mM Amplex UltraRed (Invitrogen), 20 U/mL CuZn SOD). Since liver tissue is capable of producing resorufin from amplex red (AR), without the involvement of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) was included to the experimental medium due to its ability to inhibit HRP-independent conversion of AR to resorufin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup> PMSF was added to the cuvette immediately prior to measurements and at a concentration that does not interfere with biological measurements (100 µM).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup> A 5-min background rate was obtained before adding 10 mM succinate to the cuvette to induce H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production. After 4 min, 100 µM 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) was added to the cuvette with 1 µM auranofin to inhibit glutathione reductase and thioredoxin reductase, respectively. After an additional 4 min, the assay was stopped, and the appearance of the fluorescent product was measured.</p>
<p>Site-specific electron leak was measured by systematically stimulating each site while inhibiting the other three.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> Site I<sub>F</sub> was investigated in the presence of 4 mM malate, 2.5 mM ATP, 5 mM aspartate, and 4 µM rotenone; site I<sub>Q</sub> was measured as a 4 µM rotenone-sensitive rate in the presence of 5 mM succinate; site III<sub>QO</sub> was measured as a 2 µM myxothiazol-sensitive rate in the presence of 5 mM succinate, 5 mM malonate, 4 µM rotenone, and 2 µM antimycin A; and site II<sub>F</sub> was measured as the 1 mM malonate-sensitive rate in the presence of 0.2 mM succinate and 2 µM myxothiazol. As previously mentioned, electron leak is quantified using Amplex Red in the presence of excess superoxide dismutase, such that both superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production are accounted for by a change in fluorescence intensity (JH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) using high-resolution fluorometry (Horiba Fluoromax4®).</p>

<title>Lipid mass spectrometry for reduced and oxidized CoQ</title>
<p>Liver tissue was homogenized in ice cold isolation buffer (250 mM sucrose, 5 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1% fatty acid free BSA, pH 7.4, 4°C) using a tissuelyser. Mitochondria were then isolated via differential centrifugation (800 x g for 10 min, 1300 x g for 10 min, 12,000 x g for 10 min at 4°C), flushing each step under a stream nitrogen to prevent oxidation. Protein content was determined by bicinchoninic acid assay using the Pierce BCA protein assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. To extract CoQ from mitochondria, incubations of 100 µg mitochondrial protein in 250 µL ice-cold acidified methanol, 250 µL hexane, and 1146 pmol per sample of CoQ standard (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, CIL DLM-10279) were vortexed. The CoQ-containing hexane layer was separated by centrifugation (10 min, 17,000 x g, 4°C) and then dried down under a stream of nitrogen. Dried samples were then resuspended in methanol containing 2 mM ammonium formate and transferred to 1.5 mL glass mass spectrometry vials. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was then performed on the reconstituted lipids using an Agilent 6530 UPLC-QTOF mass spectrometer.</p>

<title>U-<sup>13</sup>C-glucose and U-<sup>13</sup>C-palmitate labeling in hepa1-6 cell line</title>
<p>Stable isotope tracing experiments were conducted using U-<sup>13</sup>C-glucose or U-<sup>13</sup>C-palmitate to assess metabolic fluxes in hepa1-6 cells with or without CLS knockdown. Cells were incubated in either U-<sup>13</sup>C-glucose or U-<sup>13</sup>C-palmitate for 4 hours. For palmitate incubations, U-<sup>13</sup>C-palmitate was conjugated to fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) and supplemented with 1 mM carnitine prior to being added to the culture medium. Following the 4-hour incubation period, cells were washed once with 1 mL of ice-cold Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline (dPBS) and then scraped in 0.7 mL ice-cold dPBS. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 x g for 5 minutes at 4°C, and the supernatant was carefully removed. Cell pellets were resuspended in 215 µL of ice-cold dPBS and sonicated on ice using a 1/8” probe sonicator at 30% amplitude for 6 seconds. Debris was lightly pelleted by centrifugation at 500 x g for 2 minutes at 4°C. From the resulting supernatant, 25 µL was transferred to a separate tube for protein quantification using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay. Samples incubated with U-<sup>13</sup>C-glucose were submitted for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis, while those incubated with U-<sup>13</sup>C-palmitate were submitted for GC-MS analysis only.</p>

<p>All GC-MS analysis was performed with an Agilent 5977b GC-MS MSD-HES and an Agilent 7693A automatic liquid sampler. Dried samples were suspended in 40 µL of a 40 mg/mL O-methoxylamine hydrochloride (MOX) (MP Bio #155405) in dry pyridine (EMD Millipore #PX2012-7) and incubated for one hour at 37 °C in a sand bath. 25 µL of this solution was added to auto sampler vials. 60 µL of N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoracetamide (MSTFA with 1% TMCS, Thermo #TS48913) was added automatically via the auto sampler and incubated for 30 minutes at 37 °C. After incubation, samples were vortexed and 1 µL of the prepared sample was injected into the gas chromatograph inlet in the split mode with the inlet temperature held at 250 °C. A 10:1 split ratio was used for analysis for most metabolites. Any metabolites that saturated the instrument at the 10:1 split was analyzed at a 100:1 split ratio. The gas chromatograph had an initial temperature of 60 °C for one minute followed by a 10 °C/min ramp to 325 °C and a hold time of 10 minutes. A 30-meter Agilent Zorbax DB-5MS with 10 m Duraguard capillary column was employed for chromatographic separation. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a rate of 1 mL/min.</p>
<p>Data were collected using MassHunter software (Agilent). Metabolites were identified and their peak area was recorded using MassHunter Quant. This data was transferred to an Excel spread sheet (Microsoft, Redmond WA).

A SCIEX 7600 Zeno-ToF (AB SCIEX LLC, Framingham, MA, USA) coupled to an Agilent 1290 Infinity II HPLC system in positive-ionization modes was used for analysis. Separation was achieved using a Waters BEH zhilic 2.1 x 100 mm column (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) with Phenomenex Krudkatcher Ultra (Phenomenex, Torrence, CA, USA). Buffers consisted of 99% ACN with 5% ddH2O (buffer B) and 5% 25 mM ammonium carbonate in ddH2O (buffer A). An initial concentration of 99% buffer B was decreased to 85% over 2 min, then further decreased to 75%, and 60% over 3-minute intervals. Next, buffer B was decreased to 40% and held for 1 min. Then Buffer B was decreased to 1% and held for 1 min. Eluents were returned to initial conditions over 0.1 min, and the system was allowed to equilibrate for 5 min between runs. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed by high-resolution multiple reaction monitoring (MRM HR).</p>

<p>This paper reports on a correlation between diminished cardiolipin content and the severity of steatohepatitis in human subjects. This is supported further by experimental evidence from mice in which the gene encoding a key enzyme in cardiolipin synthesis has been compromised in the liver. The correlations established between lipidology, mitochondrial function, and the induction of respiration and oxidative stress are notable and will be <bold>useful</bold> to researchers in the field. However, given that the causal relationship between lipid perturbation and the progression of steatohepatitis implied in the title has not been tested experimentally, the evidence supporting the paper's key conclusion is <bold>incomplete</bold>.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Brothwell and colleagues describes a central role for hepatic cardiolipin deficiency in MASH. The authors identify cardiolipin as a mediator of two long-standing problems in the field: how dysregulated lipid metabolism relates to altered mitochondrial metabolism during MASLD, and what the innate changes are in the steatotic liver that cause the increased respiration. The authors identified reduced liver cardiolipin in humans with MASH and in a variety of mouse models with MASH. When they knocked out hepatic cardiolipin synthesis, mice developed steatosis and inflammation. These mice also recapitulated the elevated hepatic oxidative metabolism and oxidative stress found in obese humans with MASLD. Some of the in vivo functional data related to glucose homeostasis and substrate metabolism could be stronger, and interpretation of the in vitro flux data needs some clarification, but in both cases, the data are not essential to the main conclusions of the manuscript. Overall, the study offers compelling evidence that cardiolipin is reduced in MASLD and that impaired cardiolipin synthesis is sufficient to recapitulate many features of MASLD.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The main strengths of the study are:</p>
<p>(1) The identification of reduced cardiolipin levels in the liver of humans with MASLD and in a variety of mouse models of MASLD.</p>
<p>(2) The finding that loss of cardiolipin synthesis recapitulates steatosis and inflammation in MASH.</p>
<p>(3) The finding that loss of cardiolipin increases mitochondrial respiration, ROS production, and fat oxidation (in a separate hepatocyte cell line), again recapitulates several previous studies in obese humans with MASLD.</p>
<p>(4) Evidence, though less definitive, that cardiolipin deficiency promotes electron leak by disrupting respiratory supercomplexes and preventing CoQ reduction.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Figure 3A-D tries to make the point that liver CLS KO causes defects in substrate handling in vivo, based on glucose and pyruvate tolerance tests. The KO mice have a blunted response to a glucose tolerance test, but the pyruvate tolerance test showed very little (almost no) effect on glucose levels in either WT or LKO mice. The small blunting of the response in the LKO is impossible to interpret (if it's real), since the ability to clear glucose is also increased, and no tracers were used. It might be useful to monitor pyruvate and lactate levels during the experiment. However, this reviewer doesn't think the data is essential to prove the authors' main points.</p>
<p>(2) After presenting convincing evidence that respiration is elevated in isolated mitochondria from CLS KO liver, the authors follow up the findings by investigating whether 13C-palmitate and 13C-glucose oxidation are altered by CLS knockdown in murine Hepa1-6 cells (Figure 4). A few comments are worth mentioning about Figure 4:</p>
<p>a. It is not clear why the authors chose to use a hepatoma cell line rather than primary hepatocytes from LKO mice. The latter would be more convincing, since there could be important differences in metabolism between hepatoma cells and hepatocytes (e.g., preference for fatty acids vs glucose). Nevertheless, I think the approach is sufficient to test the general effect of loss of CLS on substrate metabolism.</p>
<p>b. The authors use the M+2 enrichments of TCA cycle intermediates to infer rates of oxidation of [U-13C]palmitate or [U-13C]glucose. It is important to note that this kind of data reports fractional carbon sources (i.e., substrate preference) rather than rates of oxidation. For example, data from the 13C-palmitate experiment indicates that the CLS KD cells increase the fractional contribution from 13C palmitate (compared to glucose, for example) to the TCA cycle, but the actual rate of palmitate oxidation is not implicit in the data. However, it is reasonable to suggest that, in combination with the increased rates of O2 consumption observed in isolated mitochondria, this data supports increased fat oxidation.</p>
<p>c. I have some concern that the [U-13C]glucose experiment is more complicated to interpret than the description implies. I'm not sure what happens in this cell line, but in the liver, most labeling from pyruvate (i.e., originating from glucose in this case) enters the TCA cycle via pyruvate carboxylase, with smaller amounts entering via PDH (depending on the nutritional state). Since one could expect pyruvate carboxylase to contribute M+3 labeled TCA cycle intermediates initially, and M+2 on the first turn of the cycle, it's hard to conclude what the data indicates about glucose oxidation. The authors could generalize the conclusion by framing the TCA cycle enrichment data as the contribution of glucose carbons and noting in Figure 4A that pyruvate carbons can enter the TCA cycle via PDH or pyruvate carboxylase, without attempting to assign their relative contributions. There are better ways to do it, but it's a small nuance here since the authors aren't making a critical point about the pathways.</p>

<p>In this study, the authors show that alterations in the lipid composition of the inner mitochondrial membrane, particularly changes in cardiolipin (CL) content, lead to defects in electron transport, supercomplex formation, and oxidative stress. Using liver-specific CLS knockout mice, which are characterized by dysfunctional capacity for cardiolipin synthesis, the authors highlight an underappreciated role for CL in MASH pathology. Overall, this is an interesting study highlighting the importance of functional/physiological electron transport (and in this context, electron leakage) in MASH pathophysiology. Despite that, this manuscript has several weaknesses that require attention.</p>
<p>(1) For all LKO studies, it is stated that the decrease in hepatic CL is causal for the observed phenotype. However, it is evident that many other lipids are impacted by CLS KO, including a marked increase in hepatic PG. In this respect, the authors show no evidence that the observed metabolic phenotype is indeed due to the reduction in CL and not to other accompanying changes.</p>
<p>(2) In the results, the authors highlight that 'MASLD has been shown to alter the total cellular lipidome in liver.' Given that this study focused on CL, it would be useful to include specific studies that pointed to changes in hepatic CL content in MASLD/MASH/fibrosis.</p>
<p>(3) The initial human mitochondrial lipidomics studies show a reduction in mitochondrial CL and PG content. What was the content/expression of CL synthase and PGP synthase in these samples? If this cannot be assessed, is there any association of CLS or PGPS expression and MASLD/fibrosis (etc) in publicly available databases (e.g, GEP liver) that may explain the reduction in mitochondrial PG and CL content?</p>
<p>(4) The validation of MASH in patients (Figure 1B) is not convincing (ie., no quantification/scoring provided). NAS /fibrosis scoring (according to Kleiner) would help to define if all patients have indeed MASH, and what subset has fibrosis. Could the reduction in CL/PG content be (also) associated with fibrosis? In addition, Masson's Trichrome should be added to Figure 1B.</p>
<p>(5) In human lipidomics, the authors suggest that reductions are observed in tetralinoleoyl CL (Figure 1C). However, Figure 1C only shows the combined FA acyl chain length + unsaturation, therefore not allowing for FA-specific ID (unless such data are available from the LC/MS analysis).</p>
<p>(6) Figures 1 J/K/I. It is obvious that the background in all murine immunoblotting analysis has been altered. The authors should provide unaltered images for these immunoblots.</p>
<p>(7) For Figure 1, it is unclear what is meant by 'we performed all mitochondrial lipidomic analyses by quantifying lipids per mg of mitochondrial proteins'. Was the murine lipidomics carried out on fractionated mitochondria or whole liver? If whole liver, then how were the data corrected, particularly given that PG is not a mitochondria-specific lipid?</p>
<p>(8) While total CL content seems indeed decreased across the different mouse models, this is mostly due to 1-2 CL species showing a pronounced reduction, with the remainder being unaltered. This should at least be acknowledged in the results. This is similarly the case in the LKO livers.</p>
<p>(9) Figure 2. A secondary biochemical analysis of changes in lipid content should be provided, e.g., total triglyceride content, particularly given that the histology analysis does not show any major changes in hepatic lipid droplets/steatosis. In addition, the Masson's Trichrome staining shows almost no collagen deposition.</p>
<p>(10) Figure 3. 'CLS deletion modestly reduced glucose handling' should be reworded. The LKO mice show improved glucose tolerance (despite the MASH phenotype), which is not evident from the above wording.</p>
<p>(11) Looking at the mechanism behind the increase in hepatic steatosis, the authors state that lipid accumulation can occur due to increased lipogenesis, or dysfunctional VLDL secretion or beta oxidation, and subsequently assessed the relevant proteins/pathways. What about fatty acid uptake, which is also one of the four major pathways impacted in MASLD? This should be included in this assessment in Figure 3.</p>
<p>(12) For Figure 5A, it is simply stated 'CLS deletion promotes liver fibrosis in standard chow-fed condition', and it is unclear what is highlighted within the selected EM images and what the arrows refer to. The authors should clarify this within the text.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Mitochondrial oxphos causes lipid accumulation, leading to MASH, although the mechanism has been poorly understood. In this study, Funai and colleagues identify that reductions in cardiolipin in the mitochondria cause disruptions in the electron transport chain. Knockout of cardiolipin synthase was sufficient to drive MASH phenotypes, increase respiratory capacity, and cause electron leak at complexes II and III. It is well established that loss of cardiolipin increases ROS. Studies to date have been performed on whole tissue lysates, but to rule out which changes in mitochondrial lipids are driven by changes in mitochondrial number versus lipid synthesis/turnover, the authors uniquely purified mitochondria from human and mouse livers in MASH and NASH models for this study. This study provides critical information to the field that will inevitably help us better understand the mechanisms underlying MASH and NASH onset. The evidence provided is both convincing and compelling. With further suggested revision experiments, this study has the potential to change our understanding of MASH and NASH pathogenesis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors use a unique approach of lipidomics on purified mitochondria. They also analyze many distinct MASH models and provide a unique resource for the field of comprehensive lipidomics analysis of the different ways in which MASH can be induced. The use of human tissue elevates the impact/significance of the findings.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The data on the super complexes was the least compelling, and frankly, I do not think the authors needed those data to make a compelling argument! The authors should shift their focus more to the compelling electron leak data they have collected. If possible, it would also strengthen the work to include cardiolipin rescues on more of the experiments. Finally, expanding their explanations of the model systems would be very helpful for the readership.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Here, the authors wish to shed light on factors that contribute to the development of liver disease in what used to be called 'the metabolic syndrome'. This is a human-health problem of considerable significance, and the insights they provide, namely the implication of a defect in mitochondrial cardiolipin (CL) content to the progression from metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease to steatohepatitis, are plausible.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The experimental evidence proffered is derived from the observation of lower levels of (CL) in mitochondria from the liver of patients undergoing liver transplant or resection due to end-stage steatohepatitis compared with mitochondria derived from livers of patients with other conditions. This correlation is buttressed by observations made in mice with liver-selective compromise in CL synthesis and which suggest a pathological environment associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and enhanced oxidative stress, features deemed to play a role in the progression from steatotic liver disease to steatohepatitis.</p>
<p>The paper is well written, and the findings are well explained and superficially convincing.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>It is unclear how much can be learned from compromising a key enzyme that produces a key mitochondrial lipid in a busy metabolic organ like the liver - isn't the discovery of a mitochondrial defect in such a context rather trivial? And how reliably can these findings be related to the human observations? Most importantly, the chain of causality implied by the title is unproven: the key question of whether or not (somehow) preventing the drop in cardiolipin content affects the course of steatohepatitis remains unanswered.</p>
