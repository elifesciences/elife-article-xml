<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Astrocytes are highly complex cells that mediate critical roles in synapse formation and maintenance by establishing thousands of direct contacts with synapses through their perisynaptic processes. Here, we found that the most common Parkinsonism gene mutation, LRRK2 G2019S, enhances the phosphorylation of the ERM proteins (Ezrin, Radixin, and Moesin), components of the perisynaptic astrocyte processes in a subset of cortical astrocytes. The ERM hyperphosphorylation was accompanied by decreased astrocyte morphological complexity and reduced excitatory synapse density and function. Dampening ERM phosphorylation levels in LRRK2 G2019S mouse astrocytes restored both their morphology and the excitatory synapse density in the anterior cingulate cortex. To determine how LRRK2 mutation impacts Ezrin interactome, we used an <italic>in vivo</italic> BioID proteomic approach, and we found that astrocytic Ezrin interacts with Atg7, a master regulator of autophagy. The Ezrin/Atg7 interaction is inhibited by Ezrin phosphorylation, thus diminished in LRRK2 G2019S astrocytes. Importantly, the Atg7 function is required to maintain proper astrocyte morphology. Our data provide a molecular pathway through which the LRRK2 G2019S mutation alters astrocyte morphology and synaptic density in a brain-region-specific manner.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Most synapses in the central nervous system are in direct contact with perisynaptic astrocyte processes (PAPs)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>], forming the “tripartite synapse”[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. At the tripartite synapse, astrocytes clear excess neurotransmitters, maintain ion homeostasis, and secrete factors regulating synapse development and function[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. To accomplish these crucial functions, astrocytes develop elaborate morphologies to tile the entire brain parenchyma[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Astrocyte morphogenesis and synaptogenesis are interdependent and bidirectional[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. In neurological disorders like Parkinson’s Disease (PD), astrocytes become reactive, undergoing morphological and molecular changes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Recent studies suggested that astrocyte dysfunction contributes to PD[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. However, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown.</p>
<p>Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (<italic>LRRK2</italic>) gene cause familial PD[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], with LRRK2 G2019S being the most common[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. It is largely accepted that LRRK2 G2019S is a gain-of-function mutation that increases LRRK2’s kinase activity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Brain RNA-seq databases suggested that LRRK2 expressed in astrocytes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. Previous studies also suggested ERM proteins (Ezrin, Radixin and Moesin) as LRRK2 substrates[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. ERM proteins are structural components of perisynaptic astrocyte processes (PAPs), with Ezrin being the most enriched in expression[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Previous studies suggested that LRRK2 phosphorylates a conserved threonine residue present in all ERM proteins[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. When phosphorylated, ERM proteins change conformation and link the F-actin cytoskeleton to the cell membrane[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. This switch is thought to play an important role in organizing cell morphology[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Among the ERM proteins, Ezrin is specifically and highly enriched in astrocytes and is known to localize at the PAPs preferentially[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. Genetic ablation or downregulation of Ezrin has been shown to alter astrocyte morphology <italic>in vivo</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we tested whether LRRK2 regulates astrocyte morphology and synaptic densities using the LRRK2 G2019S knockin (<sup>ki/ki</sup>) mouse model[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>] in conjunction with <italic>in vivo</italic> astrocyte-specific genetic, proteomic, electrophysiological, and biochemical approaches. We found that, in the prefrontal cortex of humans and mice carrying the LRRK2 G2019S mutation, a subset of astrocytes has increased ERM (Ezrin, Radixin, and Moesin) phosphorylation levels. This phospho-ERM change accompanies three observations: Astrocytes have reduced morphological complexity; The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) has decreased excitatory (VGLUT1/PSD95) synapse density; The primary motor cortex (MOp) has increased inhibitory (VGAT/Gephyrin) synapse density. By overexpression of an Ezrin mutant that cannot be phosphorylated in astrocytes, we dampened astrocytic ERM hyperphosphorylation. This reduction in astrocytic ERM phosphorylation restored both LRRK2 G2019S astrocyte morphology and the ACC excitatory synapse density. However, this phospho-ERM manipulation did not rescue the MOp inhibitory synapse changes. We further compared <italic>in vivo</italic> Ezrin interactomes in WT and LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> mouse cortical astrocytes. We discovered that Ezrin interacts with a master regulator of autophagy, Atg7. This interaction is weakened by Ezrin’s phosphorylation. We also found that Atg7 is required for astrocyte morphological complexity. Knocking down Atg7 in LRRK2 G2019S astrocytes partially restores their morphology. This study shows that LRRK2-ERM pathways are important for astrocytes to reach their morphological complexity. This study also hinted that astrocyte morphological changes correlate with synapse density changes in a brain region-specific manner.</p>

<title>ERM phosphorylation is increased in the prefrontal cortices of mice and humans carrying the LRRK2 G2019S mutation</title>
<p>To study how the LRRK2 G2019S mutation impacts astrocytes in the prefrontal cortex, a cortical region linked to PD, we stained sections from the frontal cortices of age and sex-matched control and LRRK2 G2019S mutation-carrying PD patients (Supplemental Table 1) with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, a marker for astrocyte branches) and phosphorylated ERM (Phospho-ERM, which are enriched in PAPs) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Remarkably, the astrocytic organization, determined by GFAP staining, was severely disrupted, and GFAP levels were significantly elevated (∼42%) in PD patients carrying the LRRK2 G2019S mutation, indicative of reactive gliosis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-C</xref>). Unexpectedly, the phospho-ERM signal was increased by 7-fold in the frontal cortices of PD patients carrying the LRRK2 G2019S mutation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-C</xref>). To determine if this ERM hyperphosphorylation is cell type-specific we co-stained for phospho-ERM with astrocyte marker S100β and neuronal dendrite marker MAP2. We found a significant increase in phospho-ERM signal colocalized with both S100β and MAP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1A-C</xref>).</p>

<p>To determine whether ERM hyperphosphorylation is an early event in LRRK2 G2019S PD pathology, we used LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> mice, in which the human G2019S mutation was introduced into exon 41 of the LRRK2 gene[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. To determine if ERM hyperphosphorylation localizes to astrocytes, we crossed these mice to an astrocyte reporter line carrying the Aldh1L1-eGFP transgene, which labels all astrocytes by GFP[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. We examined the phospho-ERM levels in coronal brain sections from 21-day-old (P21, juvenile) and 12-week-old (P84, adult) WT or LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> mice. Compared to WT mice, LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> mice across both age groups have a brain region-specific and heterogeneous phospho-ERM increase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-L</xref>). This phospho-ERM increase was localized to layers (L)1 and L2-3 of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the primary motor cortex (MOp) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E-L</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2A-C</xref>) but was absent in both the primary sensory cortex (SSp) and the dorsal medial striatum (DMS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2D-I</xref>). In P21 LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> mice, the phospho-ERM integrated densities in the ACC and MOp L1 and L2-3 were increased by ∼32% (ACC) and ∼41% (MOp) compared to the WTs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>); In P84 LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> mice, the phospho-ERM integrated densities were increased by ∼57% (ACC) and ∼37% (MOp) compared to the WTs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1L</xref>). In the ACC and MOp L1 and L2/3 of LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> mice, phospho-ERM was significantly increased and colocalized with S100β and MAP2 but not Iba1 (microglia marker), with a predominant localization to astrocytes in the ACC and MOp of LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3A-C</xref>). We also confirmed the specificity of the phospho-ERM antibody by treating brain sections from both mice and human samples with lambda protein phosphatase (λ-PPase). λ-PPase dephosphorylates proteins[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. In both cases, the phospho-ERM signal was eliminated after λ-PPase treatment, confirming the phospho-ERM antibody specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4A-F</xref>).</p>
<p>In the human samples, phospho-ERM elevation was observed concurrently with reactive gliosis (elevated GFAP staining). To determine if, in LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> mice, there were reactive astrocytes detectable at early ages, we stained sections from the same P21 mouse brains with an anti-GFAP antibody. In the mouse cortex, grey matter astrocytes do not display GFAP staining unless there is reactive gliosis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. We did not detect any increase in the levels of GFAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Figure S5A-C</xref>). These data indicate that, in LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> mice, phospho-ERM upregulation does not occur concurrently with reactive astrogliosis. Moreover, distinct from the P21 and P84 LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> mice where phospho-ERM was restricted to a subset of astrocytes in a brain region-specific manner, in the human patient brains (∼80 years old), phospho-ERM accumulation was present equally in both astrocytes and neurons. These data suggest that ERM hyperphosphorylation is an early and astrocyte-specific event in LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> mouse cortices; however, is more widespread in human patient brains.</p>

<title>LRRK2 G2019S mutation alters excitatory and inhibitory synapse densities and functions in the cortex</title>
<p>Previous studies did not observe dopaminergic neuron loss or motor dysfunction in the LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> mice[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]; however, synapse dysfunction at cortico-striatal circuits was reported in adult mice[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. Despite the critical role of LRRK2 in cortico-striatal synapses and PD-related cortical circuits[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>], whether LRRK2 G2019S affects cortical synapse densities and function has not been explored. Understanding these cortical synaptic abnormalities is crucial, as they may underlie the early cognitive deficits in PD. Next, we investigated if LRRK2 G2019S mutation alters synaptic densities in the ACC and MOp L1 and L2-3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), regions in which ERM hyperphosphorylation within astrocytes was observed.</p>

<p>We quantified the densities of excitatory and inhibitory intracortical synapses in WT and LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> mice. To do so, we marked the excitatory synapses as the co-localization of the presynaptic Vesicular Glutamate Transporter 1 (VGlut1) and the Postsynaptic Density Protein (PSD95), whereas inhibitory synapses were labeled using presynaptic Vesicular GABA Transporter (VGAT), and postsynaptic gephyrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>] (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Structural synapses were identified as the apposition and co-localization of presynaptic and postsynaptic markers, which are in two distinct neuronal compartments (i.e., axons and dendrites) and would only appear to co-localize at synapses due to their proximity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>].</p>
<p>Excitatory synapse density was quantified both at P21 and P84. In the ACC of the LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> mice, there was a significant decrease in intracortical excitatory synapse density in both layers and ages we analyzed (∼30%) when compared to the WT controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C-D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Figure S6A-B</xref>). However, no differences in excitatory synapse density were observed between genotypes in the MOp (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E-F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Figure S6C-D</xref>). When we quantified the densities of inhibitory synapses in the MOp, we found significant differences between genotypes (∼40% increase). In contrast, in the ACC of WT and LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> mice, no differences were observed for inhibitory synapse density (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G-J</xref>). These results revealed two changes in LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> mouse brains: reduced excitatory synapse density in the ACC; increased inhibitory synapse density in the MOp. These data suggested a brain region-specific synapse density change associated with the LRRK2 G2019S mutation.</p>
<p>We then used electrophysiology to assess how altered synapse density in the ACC and MOp of LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> mice affects synaptic function. We recorded miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in the ACC L2-3 pyramidal neurons and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) in the MOp L2-3 pyramidal neurons from acute brain slices of P84 WT and LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> mice. LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> neurons displayed reduced mEPSC frequency by ∼65% and a corresponding right shift in the cumulative distributions of mEPSC inter-event intervals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-B</xref>) when compared to WT neurons, with no change in mEPSC amplitude (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). mEPSC frequency changes correlate with synapse densities and/or the probability of presynaptic glutamate release[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>], whereas mEPSC amplitude indicates the synaptic strength reflecting the number of AMPARs at the postsynapse[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. Therefore, together with our anatomical data, these findings suggest that the LRRK2 G2019S mutation reduces the number of intracortical excitatory connections formed on L2-3 pyramidal neurons in the ACC without altering synaptic strength. In contrast, in the MOp, LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> neurons exhibited a ∼72% increase in mIPSC frequency compared to WT, with no significant change in amplitude (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D-F</xref>). These data indicate that inhibitory synapse density is elevated in the MOp of the LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> mice.</p>

<title>Reducing ERM hyperphosphorylation in astrocytes restores excitatory synapse density and function in the ACC of adult LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> mice</title>
<p>LRRK2 phosphorylates a conserved threonine residue present in all ERM proteins[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. We found that LRRK2 G2019S mutation increases ERM phosphorylation in astrocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) and asked if dampening ERM phosphorylation in astrocytes could restore synapse densities in LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> mice. To test this, we overexpressed a phospho-dead Ezrin mutant, which cannot be phosphorylated, in astrocytes via adenovirus (AAV) retro-orbital injection. We chose Ezrin because Ezrin is highly abundant and specifically enriched in astrocytes compared to its family members, Radixin and Moesin[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Figure S7A-B</xref>). Switching the amino acid threonine (T) at location 567 with alanine (A) results in a version of the protein that cannot be phosphorylated (Phospho-dead Ezrin, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Figure S7C</xref>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>].</p>
<p>To determine if phospho-dead Ezrin can reduce ERM phosphorylation in astrocytes of LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> mice, we retro-orbitally injected 9-week-old WT and LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> mice with AAVs to express Hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged WT Ezrin or phospho-dead Ezrin under the control of the astrocyte-specific GfaABC1D promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Figure S7D</xref>). The GfaABC1D promoter ensures astrocyte-specific expression, as validated in prior work[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. While AAV serotypes may infect multiple cell types, our data support astrocyte-specific expression based on promoter specificity and cell labeling. 3 weeks after injection, the mouse brains were harvested for histological analyses. The widespread viral expression of Ezrin in astrocytes was verified by staining with an anti-HA tag antibody (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). While WT or phospho-dead Ezrin overexpression had no effect on ERM phosphorylation in WT brains, WT Ezrin increased phospho-ERM levels in LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> astrocytes; phospho-dead Ezrin abolished this increase (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-B</xref>). This indicates that the LRRK2 G2019S sensitizes astrocytes to LRRK2-mediated ERM phosphorylation. To determine the specificity of phospho-dead Ezrin, we examined the hyperphosphorylation of another LRRK2 substrate, Rab10 (Thr 73)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. We found higher Rab10 phosphorylation in LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> brain sections than in WT mice. However, neither WT nor phospho-dead Ezrin overexpression impacted Rab10 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Figure S8</xref>), showing that phospho-dead Ezrin selectively reduces ERM hyperphosphorylation in astrocytes.</p>

<p>We next tested whether reducing ERM hyperphosphorylation in astrocytes could rescue synaptic deficits in LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> ACC and MOp. We found that, in WT ACC, WT Ezrin overexpression in astrocytes had no effect on excitatory synapse density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Figure S9</xref>). However, compared to WT mice overexpressing WT Ezrin, overexpression of phospho-dead Ezrin in WT astrocytes reduced excitatory synapse density by ∼30% (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C-D</xref>). In contrast, in LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> astrocytes, overexpression of phospho-dead Ezrin increased the LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> ACC excitatory synapse density. This increase brings the excitatory synapse density of LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> ACC similar to those of WT ACC overexpressing astrocytic WT Ezrin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C-D</xref>). We also found that, in the MOp L1 and L2-3 of LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> mice, neither the WT nor the phospho-dead Ezrin overexpression in adult astrocytes restored inhibitory synapse density back to the levels in the WT MOp overexpressed with WT Ezrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs10">Figure S10</xref>). These data indicate that phospho-dead Ezrin expression in adult WT or LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> astrocytes is sufficient to modify excitatory synapse density in the ACC but cannot alter inhibitory synapse density in the MOp. It is plausible that LRRK2 G2019S mutation impairs inhibitory synapses in the MOp by altering the number or connectivity of cortical interneurons through a developmental mechanism. Thus, manipulation in adults is insufficient to rectify this inhibitory synapse phenotype.</p>
<p>Because astrocytic overexpression of phospho-dead Ezrin impacted excitatory synapse density in the ACC of WT and LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> mice, we next performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from ACC L2-3 pyramidal neurons transduced with the same AAVs. In LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> ACC L2-3, overexpression of WT Ezrin in astrocytes did not rescue the decreased frequency of mEPSCs. However, overexpression of phospho-dead Ezrin in LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> astrocytes restored the frequency up to the levels of WT mice expressing WT Ezrin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E-F</xref>). Interestingly, in WT ACC L2-3, overexpression of phospho-dead Ezrin in WT astrocytes significantly reduced the frequency of mEPSCs (∼54%) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E-F</xref>). Posthoc comparisons confirmed no significant differences in mean mEPSC amplitudes across all 4 conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>).</p>
<p>Altogether, these electrophysiological and neuroanatomical analyses reveal that the LRRK2 G2019S mutation dysregulates proper excitatory and inhibitory synapse densities and functions in the cortex in a brain region-specific manner. These results also pinpoint a link between ERM hyperphosphorylation in LRRK2 G2019S astrocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) and the excitatory synaptic density change in the ACC (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Our results suggest that balancing ERM phosphorylation in astrocytes plays a role in maintaining excitatory synapse density and function in the ACC.</p>

<title>LRRK2 regulates astrocyte morphological complexity <italic>in vivo</italic> through ERM phosphorylation</title>
<p>In the brain, astrocytes have numerous functions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. To accomplish these functions, astrocytes develop elaborate morphologies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Astrocyte morphology is a crucial indicator for its function. We next asked whether ERM hyperphosphorylation in LRRK2 G2019S astrocytes would impair their morphological complexity. To answer this question, we sparsely labeled astrocytes with a membrane-targeted fluorescent protein (mCherry-CAAX) using postnatal astrocyte labeling by electroporation (PALE). To image and reconstruct the morphology of individual whole astrocytes, we collected 100-µm thick mouse brain sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs11">Figure S11A</xref>). We focused our analyses of astrocyte territory size and complexity on the ACC and MOp L1 and L2-3 at P21 (see Methods for details).

<p>Because phospho-dead Ezrin overexpression in astrocytes differentially impacts synapse densities and function in WT and LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), we wondered if overexpression of phospho-dead Ezrin would also impact astrocyte morphology differently between genotypes. We found that, in the ACC and MOp, the overexpression of phospho-dead Ezrin decreased the WT astrocyte territory volume and morphological complexity but restored LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> astrocyte territory volume and complexity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-C</xref>). These results suggested that unphosphorylated Ezrin differentially regulates astrocyte morphology in WT versus LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> astrocytes. We postulated that Ezrin’s conformational status may need to be tightly regulated for proper astrocyte morphogenesis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). In LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> astrocytes, Ezrin is more likely to be in a phosphorylated and open state. This would deplete the presence of the closed unphosphorylated Ezrin. Such a distorted phospho-Ezrin balance may explain the morphological defects of LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> astrocytes. To test this possibility, we sought to shift the balance in the opposing direction by reducing Ezrin phosphorylation through the knockdown of mouse Lrrk2. Similar to LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> astrocytes, astrocytes transfected with shLrrk2 (∼90% <italic>Lrrk2</italic> reduction, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs12">Figure S12A-B</xref>) exhibited significantly smaller territory volumes (∼36% reduction) and reduced complexity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E-G</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies suggested phosphorylation at T567 promotes Ezrin acquiring an open conformation by binding to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. In this conformation, the N-terminus interacts with membrane proteins, and the C-terminus is available to bind to the actin cytoskeleton[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. An Ezrin mutant in which the T567 residue is switched to aspartate (D) prefers Ezrin’s open conformation, thereby mimicking the phosphorylated state (Phospho-mimetic Ezrin, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4C</xref>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]. When we overexpressed phospho-mimetic Ezrin in astrocytes, we found that phospho-mimetic Ezrin restored the territory volume and morphological complexity of shLRRK2 astrocytes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E-G</xref>) but had no effect on shControl astrocytes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E-G</xref>). These results show that both the gain of LRRK2 kinase function (in LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> mice) and the loss of LRRK2 function (shLRRK2) decrease astrocyte complexity and size and the manipulation of Ezrin conformational/phosphorylation states in opposing directions ( expression of phospho-dead or phospho-mimetic Ezrin respectively) can rescue these morphological phenotypes.</p>

<p>Affinity-purified proteins from cortices were analyzed using quantitative liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>), identifying 30,815 unique peptides corresponding to 4,081 unique proteins (Supplemental Tables 2-4). Principle component analyses (PCA) of BioID results showed that distinct clustering between Cyto-BioID (control) and Ezrin-BioID (bait) samples, with further separation between WT or LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs14">Figure S14A</xref>). Radixin and Moesin, known as Ezrin family proteins, were significantly enriched in the Ezrin-BioID sample compared to Cyto-BioID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs14">Figure S14B</xref>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]. Comparative analysis revealed 344 proteins with significantly altered proximity to Ezrin in LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> astrocytes (fold-change &gt;1.5 or &lt; -1.5, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05); 190 gained, and 154 lost Ezrin proximity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs14">Figure S14C-D</xref>; Supplemental Table 5). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of these proteins showed enrichment in phospholipid binding, microtubule binding, and membrane transporter and cell-adhesion mediator activity were over-represented in differentially enriched proteins (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>; Supplemental Table 6). This aligns with our model that the LRRK2 G2019S mutation would shift Ezrin towards its phosphorylated/open state, promoting membrane interactions. Unexpectedly, GO-term analyses of biological processes highlighted enrichment in catabolic processes, macroautophagy, negative regulation of developmental growth, and intracellular transport (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>; Supplemental Table 7). These findings indicated that Ezrin plays a role in these biological processes, which are altered by the LRRK2 G2019S mutation.</p>
<p>Previous studies showed macroautophagy deficits in neurons with the LRRK2 G2019S mutation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]. To assess global cytosolic changes, we analyzed the Astro-Cyto-BioID dataset across genotypes, identifying 195 differentially enriched proteins (78 gained, 117 lost in LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs14">Figure S14E</xref>; Supplemental Table 8). GO-term analysis revealed an enrichment of proteins associated with phospholipid binding and vesicle trafficking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs14">Figure S14F-G</xref>; Supplemental Tables 9-10). However, macroautophagy-related terms were not enriched, suggesting that the observed changes in Ezrin-BioID are specifically related to alterations in Ezrin function in the LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> astrocytes.</p>
<p>BioID captures proteins in close proximity to the bait but does not guarantee direct interactions. To identify potential direct Ezrin interactors affected by LRRK2 G2019S, we compared protein abundance in Astro-Ezrin-BioID to Astro-Cyto-BioID within each genotype (Ezrin/Cyto fold -change &gt; 1.5, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, 346 proteins in WT and 335 proteins in LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup>; Supplemental Tables 11-12). To generate high-confidence lists of interactors that gained or lost proximity to Ezrin in LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> astrocytes, we set a second requirement for proteins with fold-change &gt; 1.5 or &lt; -1.5 between LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> and WT Astro-Ezrin-BioID. Using these filters, we narrowed down our list to 28 as “gained proximity to Ezrin in LRRK2 G2019S astrocytes” and 30 as “lost proximity to Ezrin in LRRK2 G2019S astrocytes” (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F-H</xref>; Supplemental Table 13). Upregulated proteins, such as Rala, Cops3, and Anks1a, are involved in vesicular trafficking, cell signaling, and cytoskeletal regulation, aligning with enhanced ERM phosphorylation and their recruitment to the plasma membrane. In contrast, the downregulated proteins (e.g., Atg7, Cul4b, Myo1e, Irs1) suggest a disruption in intracellular trafficking and autophagy due to excessive ERM phosphorylation. Together, these data map Ezrin interactomes in WT and LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> mouse cortical astrocytes <italic>in vivo</italic>, revealing changes in Ezrin interactions with proteins involved in catabolic processes and autophagy. This highlights a potential molecular mechanism linking LRRK2-Ezrin signaling to astrocyte morphogenesis.</p>

<title>Atg7 is an Ezrin interactor that is required for proper astrocyte morphogenesis</title>
<p>Among high-confidence astrocytic Ezrin interactors, we identified autophagy-related gene 7 (Atg7), a crucial autophagy regulator, which was enriched (∼2.3-fold) in the Ezrin-BioID fraction of WT astrocytes but de-enriched (0.5-fold) in the Ezrin-BioID fraction of LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> astrocytes compared to the Cyto-BioID. Atg7 is essential for autophagy initiation and has been implicated in neurological disorders[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]. However, its role in astrocytes and its interaction with Ezrin is unclear. To explore this, we used AlphaFold-2.0 Multimer[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>] to model the structures of Ezrin and Atg7 alone or in complex.</p>
<p>Atg7, a homodimer, has two globular domains: An N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain that are separated by a short flexible linker. The C-terminal domain is further divided into the adenylation and extreme C-terminal domains (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A-B</xref>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>]. Ezrin has an N-terminal FERM (four-point one, Ezrin, Radixin, Moesin) domain (subdivided into three subdomains-F1, F2, and F3), α-helical domain, and a C-terminal ERM Association domain (C-ERMAD) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]. Upon phosphorylation of T567 and binding to PIP2, Ezrin adopts an open conformation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>; see Methods for details of modeling)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>]. We then predicted the structure of the complex formed between the closed conformation of Ezrin and the homodimer of Atg7 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). Alpha-fold 2.0 multimer, in conjunction with CABS-Flex 2.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://biocomp.chem.uw.edu.pl/CABSflex2">https://biocomp.chem.uw.edu.pl/CABSflex2</ext-link>, RRID: SCR_025674) and PyMol (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pymol.org/">http://www.pymol.org/</ext-link>, RRID: SCR_000305), were used to predict and assess conformational changes in Atg7 and Ezrin after binding each other (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>). When Ezrin binds Atg7, it is predicted to undergo drastic conformational changes in its α-helical domain, which is pulled towards the ERMAD and FERM domains, whereas the changes in the Atg7 dimer structure after Ezrin binding are minimal (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>).</p>

<p>To validate the interaction between Ezrin and Atg7, we performed co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) in HEK293T cells overexpressing Myc-tagged Atg7 (Atg7-Myc) and HA-tagged WT Ezrin. To understand how the open or closed conformation of Ezrin would impact the Ezrin – Atg7 interaction, we also conducted Co-IPs with modulation of Ezrin phosphorylation levels: phospho-mimetic T567D (“TD”, open) and phospho-dead T567A (“TA”, closed) Ezrin. We found that WT Ezrin or phospho-dead Ezrin coimmunoprecipitated with Myc-Atg7, indicating that Atg7 interacts with WT Ezrin or phospho-dead Ezrin (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>). However, the interaction between Atg7 and phospho-mimetic Ezrin was significantly reduced (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we describe a previously unknown role for LRRK2, a PD-linked gene, in controlling astrocyte morphological complexity by regulating the phosphorylation state of ERM proteins. In the presence of LRRK2 G2019S mutation, we found enhanced ERM phosphorylation in human and mouse cortical astrocytes. ERM hyperphosphorylation in the LRRK2 G2019S background is specific to a subset of the ACC and MOp astrocytes of juvenile and adult mice. Previous studies suggested a direct interaction between LRRK2 and ERM proteins[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] and that ERM proteins are substrates of LRRK2[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. However, whether the enhanced ERM phosphorylation in LRRK2 G2019S astrocytes is due to a direct effect of LRRK2 kinase is unclear. Several other kinases, such as lymphocyte-oriented kinase, STE20-like protein kinase (SLK), and Rho kinase, were found to be involved in ERM phosphorylation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>], suggesting the enhanced ERM phosphorylation we observed in LRRK2 G2019S brains may be an indirect effect of the LRRK2 G2019S mutation on the activities of these kinases.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>How does ERM phosphorylation control astrocyte morphology and synaptogenic functions?</title>
<p>The canonical function of ERM proteins is linking the actin cytoskeleton with the plasma membrane, thus allowing cellular process outgrowth and morphogenesis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. Our findings suggest that disruptions in the interaction between Ezrin and a core autophagy-related protein, Atg7, contribute to the altered astrocyte morphology observed in LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> mice. <italic>In vivo</italic> Ezrin interactome in astrocytes included several other proteins related to autophagy, which changed their proximity to Ezrin in the LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> astrocytes, compared to WT astrocytes. These observations indicate that LRRK2 G2019S-induced ERM hyperphosphorylation may impair astrocyte autophagy and cause astrocyte dysfunction.</p>
<p>Another intriguing observation is that, <italic>in vivo</italic>, knocking down Atg7 in WT astrocytes reduces astrocyte morphological complexity. Atg7 is a homodimeric E1-like enzyme essential for autophagy, which maintains cellular homeostasis by degrading and recycling damaged organelles and proteins[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]. Autophagic dysregulation is linked to neurodegenerative diseases, including those associated with PD-related LRRK2 mutations[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]. However, the role of autophagy in astrocyte morphology and synaptogenic functions is not well understood, nor is the impact of LRRK2 G2019S on autophagy in astrocytes. It is possible that Atg7 depletion disrupts autophagic flux, causing the accumulation of damaged components that compromise astrocyte structure and function.</p>
<p>Our data also show that Atg7 knockdown in LRRK2 G2019S astrocytes does not worsen their morphological defects. The G2019S mutation enhances LRRK2’s kinase activity, leading to aberrant phosphorylation of Rab proteins and trapping them on the membrane surface[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>]. Our studies revealed that Atg7/Ezrin interaction requires the unphosphorylated form of Ezrin. It is plausible that this interaction, which is impaired in LRRK2 G2019S astrocytes, diminished astrocytic Atg7 function. Therefore, additional knockdown of Atg7 in LRRK2 G2019S astrocytes does not further reduce their size and complexity. Instead, LRRK2 G2019S astrocytes may try to compensate by upregulating catabolic pathways like ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. These mechanisms are crucial for clearing misfolded or damaged proteins in the absence of functional endolysosomal function and may help mitigate the loss of autophagic flux[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>]. Our Ezrin BioID dataset also showed that Nedd4l, an E3 ubiquitin ligase[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>], lost proximity to Ezrin in LRRK2 G2019S astrocytes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>).</p>
<p>Astrocytes regulate synapse formation and function through cell adhesion molecules and secreted proteins that signal to neurons[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Synaptogenic proteins like Hevin and thrombospondins shape cortical excitatory circuits[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>]. ERM proteins are known to link the actin cytoskeleton with the plasma membrane, supporting cellular process outgrowth and morphogenesis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>], but their role in secretion is less understood. Phosphorylation of ERM proteins may refine secretory mechanisms in astrocytes or regulate synapse elimination via phagocytosis. In agreement with this possibility, a recent study found that synapses are more likely to be eliminated if phospho-ERM proteins are localized to peri-synaptic astrocyte processes in ALS patient brains and mouse models[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>]. Future research exploring the relationships between LRRK2, ERM, and autophagy in astrocytes will help clarify these processes and their impact on brain region-specific excitatory and inhibitory synapse phenotypes.</p>

However, these mice may serve as good models for the non-motor (prodromal) PD symptoms seen in LRRK2 G2019S carriers[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>]. These non-motor symptoms, which arise long before motor dysfunction in PD, indicate aberrant synaptic connectivity within multiple brain circuits, including the cortex, long before the death of dopaminergic neurons[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>]. LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> mice display early circuit dysfunction and non-motor symptoms akin to prodromal PD. Previous studies showed that LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> mice have deficits in attention and goal-directed learning and differential response to stress[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>]. Our findings showing synaptic deficits in the ACC of LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) fit well with these studies because the ACC is a brain region that controls attention, goal-directed actions, and mood[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>]. Furthermore, we observed synaptic deficits in the ACC of LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> mice concurrently with astrocyte morphological deficits located in the ACC and MOp.</p>
<p>Why do ERM phosphorylation and synaptic deficits happen in specific brain regions of LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> mice? Cortical astrocytes are heterogeneous in their gene expression, morphology, and function[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>]. Interestingly, cortical astrocyte heterogeneity is controlled by layer-specific neuron heterogeneity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>]. It is plausible that neurons and astrocytes in different cortical regions have varying levels of LRRK2 and diverse susceptibilities to LRRK2 mutations. The ACC and MOp may highly depend on the LRRK2-ERM pathway to maintain synaptic integrity and astrocyte function. A recent single-nucleus RNA sequencing in the striatum revealed that the differential expression level of LRRK2 is correlated with changes in the ciliogenesis of different cholinergic neurons[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>], suggesting that LRRK2 transcriptional states influence cell function in a cell-type-specific manner. Future studies investigating the impacts of LRRK2 G2019S on cortical neurons and astrocytes’ transcriptional profiles may help explain why specific brain regions and astrocyte populations are susceptible to the LRRK2 G2019S mutation.</p>
<p>In sum, our findings reveal that LRRK2 G2019S mutation-mediated ERM hyperphosphorylation in astrocytes causes morphological dysfunction in cortical astrocytes. Our results suggest that this astrocytic dysfunction could directly contribute to excitatory synaptic deficits observed in the ACC of the LRRK2 G2019S mice. Restoring astrocyte function by inhibiting ERM hyperphosphorylation, even post-development, was sufficient to rectify excitatory synaptic pathology. Future studies aiming to identify the molecular mechanisms by which LRRK2 controls ERM phosphorylation and the specific phosphatases involved could lead to new therapeutic targets for PD.</p>

<title>Limitations of the study</title>
<p>In our study, we found that a subset of astrocytes in the ACC and MOp were responsive to LRRK2 kinase activity. We also pinpoint that the balance of ERM phosphorylation plays a crucial role in regulating astrocyte morphology in the ACC and MOp. However, astrocytes display molecular, morphological, and functional heterogeneities[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>]. We do not yet know why these astrocytes in the ACC and MOp would be sensitive to LRRK2 kinase activity and how these astrocytes are unique compared to other astrocytes in terms of their transcriptional and proteomic profiles. Another future direction would be to determine how the ERM phosphorylation balance modulates astrocyte morphological changes and synapse changes. ERM is a crucial player in linking F-actin to the cell membrane and is important for regulating membrane tension. Actin cytoskeleton dynamics are important for astrocyte morphogenesis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>]. Future single-cell multi-omics studies and experiments understanding how ERM phosphorylation alters actin cytoskeleton dynamics in astrocytes will help us address these current limitations. In addition, the difference in GFAP levels between human PD patients and LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> mice reflects the complexity of human PD pathology, the limitations of single-gene mouse models, and potential species-specific differences in astrocyte reactivity. This discrepancy highlights the challenges in modeling human neurodegenerative diseases in animal models and underscores the need for caution when translating findings from animal studies to human disease. Furthermore, in our study, we used PALE to label astrocytes. While PALE is a powerful tool that allows us to label a sparse population of astrocytes in the brain and study their morphological complexity in detail, it has limitations in labeling astrocytes in deep brain regions like the striatum and substantia pars compacta. Future studies using systemic approaches may overcome this technical limitation and clarify whether and how LRRK2 G2019S affects astrocyte morphology and function in additional brain regions.</p>

<p>All mice and rats were used in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and the Duke Division of Laboratory Animal Resources (DLAR) oversight (IACUC Protocol Numbers A147-17-06 and A117-20-05). All mice and rats were housed under typical day/night conditions of 12-hour cycles. LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> mice (RRID: IMSR_TAC:13940) were obtained through Taconic. This model was generated on the C57BL6/NTac background. It has been maintained on that pure background in Taconic. Aldh1l1-EGFP (RRID: MMRRC_011015-UCD) mice were obtained through MMRRC and backcrossed on a C57BL/6J background. Wild-type CD1 mice used for PALE were purchased through Charles River Laboratories (RRID: IMSR_CRL:022).</p>
<p>Mice and rats were used for experiments as specified in the text and figure legends. For all experiments, age, and sex-matched mice were randomly assigned to experimental groups based on genotypes. Mice of both sexes were included in the analysis, and we did not observe any influence or association of sex on the experimental outcomes.</p>

<title>Primary cortical neuron isolation and culture</title>
<p>Purified (glia-free) rat cortical neurons were prepared as described previously[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. Briefly, cortices from P1 rat pups of both sexes (Sprague Dawley, Charles River Laboratories, SD-001) were micro-dissected, digested in papain (∼7.5 units/ml) at 33°C for 45 minutes, triturated in low and high ovomucoid solutions, resuspended in panning buffer (DPBS (GIBCO 14287) supplemented with BSA and insulin) and passed through a 20 μm mesh filter (Elko Filtering 03-20/14). Filtered cells were incubated on negative panning dishes coated with Bandeiraea Simplicifolia Lectin 1 (x2), followed by goat anti-mouse IgG+IgM (H+L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch 115-005-044), and goat anti-rat IgG+IgM (H+L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch 112-005-044) antibodies, then incubated on positive panning dishes coated with mouse anti-L1 (ASCS4, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Univ. Iowa) to bind cortical neurons. Adherent cells were collected by forceful pipetting with a P1000 pipette. Isolated neurons were pelleted (11 minutes at 200 g) and resuspended in serum-free neuron growth media (NGM; Neurobasal, B27 supplement, 2 mM L-Glutamine, 100 U/ml Pen/Strep, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 4.2 μg/ml Forskolin, 50 ng/mL BDNF, and 10 ng/mL CNTF). 70,000 neurons were plated onto 12 mm glass coverslips coated with 10 μg/ml poly-D-lysine (PDL, Sigma P6407) and 2 μg/ml laminin and incubated at 37°C in 10% CO<sub>2</sub>.

Between 15-20 million cells were plated on 75 mm<sup>2</sup> flasks (non-ventilated cap) coated with poly-D-lysine and incubated at 37°C in 10% CO<sub>2</sub>. On DIV 3, the removal of non-astrocyte cells was performed by forcefully shaking closed flasks by hand for 10-15 s until only an adherent monolayer of astrocytes remained. AraC was added to the media from DIV 5 to DIV 7 to eliminate contaminating fibroblasts. On DIV 7, astrocytes were trypsinized (0.05% Trypsin-EDTA) and plated into 12-well or 6-well dishes. On DIV 8, cultured rat astrocytes were transfected with shRNA and/or expression plasmids using Lipofectamine LTX with Plus Reagent (Thermo Scientific) per the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, 1 μg (12-well) or 2 μg (6-well) total DNA was diluted in Opti-MEM containing Plus Reagent, mixed with Opti-MEM containing LTX (1:2 DNA to LTX), and incubated for 30 minutes. The transfection solution was added to astrocyte cultures and incubated at 37°C for 3 hours.

<title>Lentivirus production and transduction</title>
<p>Lentiviruses containing shRNA targeting vectors were produced to test the knockdown efficiency of shRNA constructs in cultured primary astrocytes or to bulk transduce neurons with shRNA and GFP.

One day after transfection, the media was replaced with AGM (for astrocyte transduction), and media containing lentivirus was collected on days 2 and 3 post-transfection. To assess the knockdown efficiency of shRNAs in astrocytes, rat primary astrocytes at DIV 7 were plated in 6-well dishes in 2 ml of AGM. On DIV 8, 1 ml of AGM was removed, and 500 μl of fresh AGM was added along with 500 μl of lentivirus-containing media and 1 μg/ml polybrene.

<p>Astrocyte-neuron co-cultures on glass coverslips were fixed on DIV 12 with warm 4% PFA for 7 minutes, washed 3 times with PBS, blocked in a blocking buffer containing 50% normal goat serum (NGS) and 0.4% Triton X-100 for 30 minutes, and washed in PBS. Samples were then incubated overnight at 4°C in primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer containing 10% NGS, washed with PBS, incubated in Alexa Fluor conjugated secondary antibodies (Life Technologies) for 2 hours at room temperature, and washed again in PBS. Coverslips were mounted onto glass slides (VWR Scientific) with Vectashield mounting media containing DAPI (Vector Labs), sealed with nail polish, and imaged on an AxioImager M1 (Zeiss) fluorescence microscope. Images of healthy astrocytes with strong expression of fluorescent markers that did not overlap with other fluorescent astrocytes were acquired at 40x magnification in red, green, and/or DAPI channels using a CCD camera. Astrocyte morphological complexity was analyzed in FIJI using the Sholl analysis plugin[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref>], as described previously[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Eroglu-Lab/In-Vitro-Sholl">https://github.com/Eroglu-Lab/In-Vitro-Sholl</ext-link>, RRID: SCR_022758).

<title>Mouse astrocyte territory volume analysis</title>
<p>To assess the territory volume of individual astrocytes in the mouse cortex, 100 μm-thick floating sections containing anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and primary motor cortex (MOp) astrocytes labeled sparsely via PALE with mCherry-CAAX were collected. High-magnification images containing an entire astrocyte (50-60 μm z-stack) were acquired with an Olympus FV 3000 microscope with the 60x objective. Criteria for data inclusion required that the entirety of the astrocyte could be captured within a single brain section and that the astrocyte was in L2-3 of the ACC or MOp. Astrocytes in which the entire astrocyte could not be captured within the section or was in other layers or outside of the ACC or MOp were not imaged. Imaged astrocytes were analyzed using Imaris Bitplane software (RRID: SCR_007370) as described previously[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. Briefly, surface reconstructions were generated, and the Imaris Xtensions “Visualize Surface Spots” and “Convex Hull” were used to create an additional surface render representing the territory of the astrocyte. The volume of each territory was recorded, and astrocyte territory sizes from biological replicates were analyzed across experimental conditions using a nested two-way ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni posthoc test. For 3D Sholl analysis of individual PALE astrocytes, we first loaded images onto Imaris and then created a surface. After generating the surface of astrocytes, we created filaments using ‘Add new filament (leaf icon)’. For the quantification of complexity, we clicked on the gear tool on Imaris to display Sholl intersections.

Synaptic staining was performed in coronal sections (30 μm thick) containing the ACC and MOp from WT and LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> mice. To label pre and postsynaptic proteins, the following antibody combinations were used: VGluT1 and PSD95 (excitatory, intracortical), VGAT, and GEPHYRIN (inhibitory). High magnification 60x objective plus 1.64x optical zoom z-stack images containing 15 optical sections spaced 0.34 μm apart were obtained using an Olympus FV 3000 inverted confocal microscope. Each z-stack was converted into 5 maximum projection images (MPI), each corresponding to a 1 μm section of z plane, using FIJI. Synapses were identified by the colocalization of pre and postsynaptic puncta. The number of co-localized synaptic puncta of excitatory intracortical (VGluT1-PSD95) and inhibitory (VGAT-GEPHYRIN) synapses were obtained using the FIJI plugin Puncta Analyzer[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. 15 MPIs were analyzed for each mouse (5 MPI/tissue section, 3 tissue sections/mouse).

<p>Full-length mouse Ezrin (UniProt ID: Q4KML7) and Atg7 (UniProt ID: Q9D906) were used for structure prediction in Alphafold 2.0 Multimer. The structure of Ezrin in the open conformation was generated by segmenting independently predicted Ezrin N- and C-termini and threading them onto an open ERM hinge structure using the PyMOL2 molecular visualization software. To model the Ezrin:Atg7 interaction and associated conformational changes, the structures of Ezrin and the Atg7 homodimer were predicted and docked using Alphafold 2.0 Multimer. Conformational changes in the Ezrin:Atg7 protein complex were assessed using PyMOL2 and CABS-flex 2.0[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref>].

<p><italic>In vivo,</italic> BioID experiments were performed as described in Takano et al., 2020 with modifications[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref>]. Genotype-matched animals (wild-type C57BL6 or LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup>) were bred to produce single-genotype litters. For each genotype (WT or G2019S), 6 pups were injected with AAVs carrying Astro-Ezrin-BioID (PHP.eB.GfaABC1D-Ezrin WT-BioID2-HA) or Astro-CYTO-BioID (PHP.eB.GfaABC1D-BioID2-HA). 2 genotype-matched cortices were pooled at the time of protein isolation, yielding 3 independent replicates per BioID construct. 12 total samples (3 per genotype per construct) were subjected to LC-MS/MS and downstream analysis. WT and LRRK2 G2019S<sup>ki/ki</sup> P0 – P2 mouse pups were anesthetized by hypothermia, and 1µl of each concentrated AAV-BioID vector was injected bilaterally into the cortex using a Hamilton syringe. Pups were monitored until they recovered on a heating pad. At P18, P19, and P20, biotin was subcutaneously injected at 24 mg/kg to increase the biotinylation efficiency. At P21, the cerebral cortices were removed and stored at -80° C. For the protein purification, each cortex was lysed in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA; protease inhibitor mixture (Roche); and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (PhosSTOP, Roche). Next, an equal volume of buffer containing 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA; 0.4 % SDS; 2 % TritonX-100; 2 % deoxycholate; protease inhibitor mixture; and phosphatase inhibitor mixture was added to the samples, following by sonication and centrifugation at 15,000 g for 10 min. The remaining supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 100,000g for 30min at 4° C. Finally, SDS detergent was added to the samples and heated at 45 ° C for 45 min. After cooling on ice, each sample was incubated with High-Capacity Streptavidin Agarose beads (ThermoFisher) at 4° C overnight. Following incubation, the beads were serially washed: 1) twice with a solution containing 2% SDS; 2) twice with a buffer 1% TritonX-100, 1% deoxycholate, 25 mM LiCl; 3) twice with 1M NaCl, and finally, five times with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. The biotinylated proteins attached to the agarose beads were eluted in a buffer of 125 mM Tris/HCl, pH6.8; 4 % SDS; 0.2 % β-mercaptoethanol; 20 % glycerol; 3 mM biotin at 60°C for 15min.</p>

Briefly, the sample was first trapped on a Symmetry C18 20 mm × 180 μm trapping column (5 μl/min at 99.9/0.1 v/v water/acetonitrile), after which the analytical separation was performed using a 1.8 μm Acquity HSS T3 C18 75 μm × 250 mm column (Waters Corp.) with a 90-min linear gradient of 5 to 30% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 400 nanoliters/minute (nL/min) with a column temperature of 55C. Data collection on the Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer was performed for three difference compensation voltages (-40v, -60v, -80v). Within each CV, a data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode of acquisition with a r=120,000 (@ m/z 200) full MS scan from m/z 375 – 1500 with a target AGC value of 4e5 ions was performed. MS/MS scans with HCD settings of 30% were acquired in the linear ion trap in “rapid” mode with a target AGC value of 1e4 and max fill time of 35 ms. The total cycle time for each CV was 0.66s, with total cycle times of 2 sec between like full MS scans. A 20s dynamic exclusion was employed to increase the depth of coverage.

<title>Quantitative Data Analysis</title>
<p>Following 15 total UPLC-MS/MS analyses (excluding conditioning runs, but including 3 replicate SPQC samples), data were imported into Proteome Discoverer 3.0 (Thermo Scientific Inc.) and individual LCMS data files were aligned based on the accurate mass and retention time of detected precursor ions (“features”) using Minora Feature Detector algorithm in Proteome Discoverer. Relative peptide abundance was measured based on peak intensities of selected ion chromatograms of the aligned features across all runs. The MS/MS data was searched against the SwissProt <italic>M. musculus</italic> database, a common contaminant/spiked protein database (bovine albumin, bovine casein, yeast ADH, etc.), and an equal number of reversed-sequence “decoys” for false discovery rate determination. Sequest with INFERYS was utilized to produce fragment ion spectra and to perform the database searches. Database search parameters included fixed modification on Cys (carbamidomethyl) and variable modification on Met (oxidation). Search tolerances were 2ppm precursor and 0.8Da product ion with full trypsin enzyme rules. Peptide Validator and Protein FDR Validator nodes in Proteome Discoverer were used to annotate the data at a maximum 1% protein false discovery rate based on q-value calculations. Note that peptide homology was addressed using razor rules in which a peptide matched to multiple different proteins was exclusively assigned to the protein has more identified peptides. Protein homology was addressed by grouping proteins that had the same set of peptides to account for their identification. A master protein within a group was assigned based on % coverage.</p>
<p>Prior to normalization, a filter was applied such that a peptide was removed if it was not measured at least twice across all samples and in at least 50% of the replicates in any one single group. After that filter, samples were total intensity normalized (total intensity of all peptides for a sample are summed and then normalized across all samples). Next, the following imputation strategy is applied to missing values. If less than half of the values are missing in a biological group, values are imputed with an intensity derived from a normal distribution of all values defined by measured values within the same intensity range (20 bins). If greater than half values are missing for a peptide in a group and a peptide intensity is &gt; 5e6, then it was concluded that the peptide was misaligned and its measured intensity is set to 0. All remaining missing values are imputed with the lowest 2% of all detected values. Peptide intensities were then subjected to a trimmed-mean normalization in which the top and bottom 10 percent of the signals were excluded, and the average of the remaining values was used to normalize across all samples. Lastly, all peptides belonging to the same protein were then summed into a single intensity. These normalized protein level intensities are what was used for the remainder of the analysis.</p>
<p>To assess technical reproducibility, we calculated the % coefficient of variation (%CV) for each protein across 3 injections of an SPQC pool that were interspersed throughout the study (Table S4). The mean %CV of the SPQC pools was 11.7%, which is well within our expected analytical tolerances. To assess biological + technical variability, %CVs were measured for each protein across the individual groups which averaged 19.8%, which is also within our normal tolerances and indicated a reproducible IP and sample processing.</p>
<p>As an initial statistical analysis, we calculated fold-changes between various sample groups based on the protein expression values and calculated two-tailed heteroscedastic t-test on log2-transformed data for this comparison. Those fold changes and p-values are presented for all proteins in Tables S5, S7, S9, and S10. False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction was performed using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, and these values are reported (“p.adjusted”) in Tables S5, S7, S9, and S10. To optimize for discovery, we opted to use the less stringent parameter of unadjusted p-value for downstream analyses. Within supplemental tables, we have labeled proteins significantly more abundant (“Up”, fold change &gt;1.5 and unadjusted p-value &lt;0.05), or less abundant (“Down”, fold change &gt;-1.5 and unadjusted p-value &lt;0.05) in a particular genotype or BioID sample group. These annotated proteins were used for downstream analyses, including protein interaction networks using Cytoscape (v.3.9.1) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis using the ClusterProfiler package for R, with all M. musculus genes as the reference background.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors aim to uncover how the Parkinson's disease-linked LRRK2 G2019S mutation affects synaptic integrity through astrocyte-intrinsic mechanisms. Specifically, they investigate whether LRRK2-driven ERM hyperphosphorylation disrupts astrocyte morphology and excitatory synapse maintenance, with a focus on regional specificity within the cortex.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Novelty and significance: The work provides important insights into non-neuronal contributions to Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology by highlighting a previously underappreciated role of astrocytic ERM signaling in synapse maintenance. This astrocyte-specific mechanism might help explain early cognitive dysfunctions in PD.</p>
<p>(2) Mechanistic depth: The authors present a detailed molecular pathway where the LRRK2 G2019S mutation increases ERM phosphorylation, disrupting Ezrin-Atg7 interactions critical for astrocyte morphology.</p>
<p>(3) Robust methodology: The study uses a powerful combination of tools, including AAV-mediated gene delivery, BioID-based interactome mapping, PALE labeling, and patch-clamp electrophysiology to link molecular, morphological, and functional changes.</p>
<p>(4) Physiological relevance: Parallel findings in both mouse models and human post-mortem brains suggest conservation of the observed phenotypes and strengthen the relevance to PD pathogenesis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Causal directionality: While ERM hyperphosphorylation is clearly shown to correlate with morphological and synaptic changes, the specific causal hierarchy-especially between Ezrin-Atg7 interaction loss and synapse alteration, is inferred but not definitively proven. For example, a rescue experiment directly restoring Atg7 function alongside Ezrin manipulation could strengthen this point.</p>
<p>(2) Brain region specificity: Although regional differences between ACC and MOp are well documented, the underlying cause of this differential vulnerability remains speculative. Examining astrocyte heterogeneity within cortical layers or via transcriptomic/proteomic profiling could clarify these regional effects.</p>
<p>(3) Autophagy function: While Atg7 knockdown leads to clear morphological changes, autophagic flux (e.g., LC3-II turnover or p62 accumulation) is not directly assessed. This would strengthen the mechanistic link to autophagy disruption.</p>
<p>(4) GFAP-based astrogliosis interpretation: The conclusion that no astrogliosis occurs in LRRK2 G2019S mice is based solely on GFAP staining. However, GFAP-negative reactive states have been reported. Including additional markers would help validate this interpretation.</p>
<p>(5) Impact on neuronal populations: The authors conclude that changes in inhibitory synapse density in the MOp are not rescued by astrocytic Ezrin manipulation and suggest developmental effects on interneurons. However, this is speculative without neuronal cell-type-specific data. Including interneuron density or synaptic connectivity analysis would make this claim more robust.</p>
<p>(6) Despite these limitations, the authors substantially achieve their stated aims. Their results provide strong support for a model in which astrocytic ERM signaling downstream of LRRK2 contributes to region-specific synaptic changes, particularly in the anterior cingulate cortex. While certain mechanistic links-such as the role of Ezrin-Atg7 interaction in synaptic maintenance-would benefit from further functional validation, the study offers a well-supported framework for understanding astrocyte-intrinsic contributions to synaptic dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.</p>
<p>This work is likely to contribute meaningfully to ongoing research in neurodegeneration, glial biology, and synaptic regulation. The methodological approaches - especially the combination of in vivo models with proteomics and electrophysiology - will be of interest to others studying astrocyte function and neuron-glia interactions. More broadly, the study highlights the importance of astrocyte heterogeneity and regional specialization in shaping neural circuit vulnerability, providing a valuable foundation for future investigations.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This is an important study that examines the relationship between a Parkinson's 's-associated mutation in LRRK2 kinase and increased ERM phosphorylation in astrocytes, altered excitatory and inhibitory synapse density and function, and a reduction in astrocyte size. The scope is impressively large and includes human and mouse samples, and employs immunolabeling, whole cell patch clamp recording techniques, molecular manipulation in vivo, and BioID. Experiments have appropriate controls, and the outcomes are mostly convincing. The chief weakness is that the study emphasizes scope over depth, such that it falls short of a unifying model of LRRK2-ERM interactions and leave many outcomes difficult to interpret.</p>
<p>The main idea is that the G2019S Parkinson's mutation in LRRK2 increases its kinase activity and that this either directly or indirectly increases ERM phosphorylation. This excessive ERM phosphorylation is expected to occur within perisynaptic astrocytic processes, reduce astrocyte complexity, and reduce excitatory synapse density and function in ACC. Overexpression of a dominant negative ezrin (phospho-dead) in astrocytes restores their morphology and excitatory synapse density in ACC. This pathway is well supported if taken on its own. But several datapoints presented do not fit this model. The reasoning driving selectivity to ACC and not M1 is not discussed or pursued (is it relevant that pERM levels appear lower in M1 at P21? Do astrocytes in S1 from G2019S mice also show reduced territories?); the differential effects on excitatory versus inhibitory synapses does not fit the model (or is this effect also expected to lie downstream of astrocytes?). Importantly, the effects of ezrin manipulation in wildtype samples (see below) are not integrated into the model, perhaps because the data run counter to expectation.</p>
<p>Specific Concerns and Questions:</p>
<p>(1) Effects in wildtype mice are not fully incorporated into the model. Overexpressing (OE) WT ezrin appears to reduce pERM levels by about half (Figure 1i vs 4B). OE-phospho-dead ezrin also appears to reduce pERM integrated density compared to control levels (same figures). This is not discussed (see also item 2). OE phospho-dead ezrin decreases synapse density and maybe function compared to OE WT ezrin in wildtype mice (4C, 4F), but it is not clear whether or not these data differ from unmanipulated wildtype sections/slices (Figures 2 and 3) because the data are normalized. These synaptic findings in wildtype should also be joined to the morphology findings in wildtype astrocytes, where OE-phospho-dead ezrin reduces astrocyte territory similar to LRRK2-G2019S. The shared morphological outcome is discussed as a potential defect in ERM phospho/dephospho balance, but it was hard to see if this could be similarly related to changes in synapse density.</p>
<p>(2) Labeling for pERMs shown in wildtype mouse and control human is not convincing, but is convincing in the G2019S samples (e.g., Figure 1/S1, Figure 2) (although concentration in perisynaptic astrocytes is not clear). The data presented seem to better support the idea that the mutation confers a pathological gain of ERM phosphorylation (rather than hyperphosphorylation). If the faint labeling in wildtype and control samples is genuine, one would anticipate that pERM labeling would be different in shControl vs. shLrrk2 astrocytes.</p>
<p>(3) Given the data presented, it would seem that overexpressing the BirA2 ezrin construct, like wildtype ezrin, could impact astrocyte biology. If overexpressing a wildtype ezrin reduces pERM levels, then perhaps the BirA2 construct expression already favors a closed conformation. This is not so much a critique of the approach as a request for clarification and to include, if possible, whether there are reasons to believe or data to support that the BirA2 construct adopts both open and closed conformations.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Wang et al. reported a new role of LRRK2-GS mutant in astrocyte morphology and synapse maintenance and a potential mechanism that acts through phosphorylation of ERM, which binds to ATG7. In both human LRRK2-GS patients and LRRK2-GS KI mouse brain cortex, they found increased ERM phosphorylation levels. LRRK2-GS alters excitatory and inhibitory synapse densities and functions in the cortex, which can be restored by p-ERM-dead mutant. They further demonstrated that LRRK2 regulates astrocyte morphological complexity in vivo through ERM phosphorylation. Proteomic and biochemistry approaches found that ATG7 interacts with Ezrin, which is inhibited by Ezrin phosphorylation. This provides a potential mechanism by which LRRK2-GS impairs the astrocyte morphology.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Data in human PD patients (Figure 1B, C) is impressive, showing a clear increase of p-ERM in LRRK2-GS samples.</p>
<p>(2) Both LRRK2-GS and siLRRK2 show similar phenotypes, supporting both GOF and LOF decrease astrocyte complexity and size.</p>
<p>(3) Using p-ERM-dead and mimic mutants is elegant. The data is striking that the p-ERM-dead mutant can restore LRRK2-GS-induced excitatory synapse density in the ACC and astrocyte territory volume and complexity, while the p-ERM-mimic mutant can restore the siLRRK2 phenotype.</p>
<p>(4) ATG7 binding to Ezrin provides a potential mechanism. It is compelling that siATG7 shows a similar decrease in astrocyte territory volume and complexity, and siATG7 in LRRK2-GS does not enhance the astrocyte phenotype.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors claim that p-ERM colocalizes with astrocyte marker ALDH1L1, e.g., Figure 1E, F, G, H, J, K. It is hard to tell from the representative images. Given that this is critical for this paper, it would be appreciated if the authors could improve the images and show clear colocalization. The same concern for Figures S1, 2, 3. Validation of the p-ERM antibody is critical. Figure S4, using λ-PPase to eliminate the phosphorylation signal in general, is very helpful. Additional validation of the p-ERM antibody specific to ERM would be appreciated.</p>
<p>(2) Does the total ERM level change /increase in LRRK2-GS samples? The increased p-ERM levels could be because the total ERM level increases. Then, the follow-up question is whether the total ERM level matters to the astrocyte phenotypes seen in the paper.</p>
<p>(3) WT mice carry WT-LRRK2, which also has kinase activity to phosphorylate ERM. So, what are the effects of overexpression of the p-ERM mutants (dead or mimic) on the excitatory and inhibitory synapse densities and functions in WT mouse samples? In Figure 4, statistics should be done comparing WT+Ezrin O/E vs WT+phosphor-dead Ezrin O/E. From what is shown in the graphs, it looks like phosphor-dead Ezrin worsens the phenotype in WT mice, which is opposite to the GS mice. How to explain? The same question for the graphs in Figure 5.</p>
<p>(4) Rab10 is not a robust substrate for the LRRK2-G2019S mutant, and p-Rab10 is very difficult to detect in mouse brains. The specificity of the pRab10 immunostaining signal in Fig. S8 is not certain.</p>
<p>(5) Would ATG7, Ezrin, and LRRK2 form a complex?</p>
