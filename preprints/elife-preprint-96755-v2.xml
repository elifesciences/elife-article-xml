<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Axonemal protein complexes, including the outer and inner dynein arms (ODA/IDA), are highly ordered structures of the sperm flagella that drive sperm motility. Deficiencies in several axonemal proteins have been associated with male infertility, which is characterized by asthenozoospermia or asthenoteratozoospermia. Dynein axonemal heavy chain 3 (DNAH3) resides in the IDA and is highly expressed in the testis. However, the relationship between DNAH3 and male infertility is still unclear. Herein, we identified biallelic variants of <italic>DNAH3</italic> in four unrelated Han Chinese infertile men with asthenoteratozoospermia through whole-exome sequencing (WES). These variants contributed to deficient DNAH3 expression in the patients’ sperm flagella. Importantly, the patients represented the anomalous sperm flagellar morphology, and the flagellar ultrastructure was severely disrupted. Intriguingly, <italic>Dnah3</italic> knockout (KO) male mice were also infertile, especially showing the severe reduction in sperm movement with the abnormal IDA and mitochondrion structure. Mechanically, nonfunctional DNAH3 expression resulted in decreased expression of IDA-associated proteins in the spermatozoa flagella of patients and KO mice, including DNAH1, DNAH6, and DNALI1, the deletion of which has been involved in disruption of sperm motility. Moreover, the infertility of patients with <italic>DNAH3</italic> variants and <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mice could be rescued by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment. Our findings indicated that <italic>DNAH3</italic> is a novel pathogenic gene for asthenoteratozoospermia and may further contribute to the diagnosis, genetic counseling, and prognosis of male infertility.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Infertility is a global public health and social problem that affects approximately one in six couples worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Male infertility, which accounts for half of infertile cases, is a multifactorial disease with common phenotypes, including oligo/azoospermia (poor sperm count or absence of spermatozoa); teratozoospermia (aberrant sperm morphology); asthenozoospermia (weakened sperm motility); and a combination of these phenotypes, such as asthenoteratozoospermia, oligoasthenozoospermia, oligoteratozoospermia and oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>).</p>
<p>Asthenoteratozoospermia is one of the most common phenotypes of male infertility, and genetic factors have been established as the predominant cause of asthenoteratozoospermia. Multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF), a subtype of asthenoteratozoospermia, characterized by a mosaic of abnormalities of the flagellar morphology, including absent, short, coiled, bent and/or irregular flagella, is almost always caused by genetic defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). To date, more than 40 genes have been identified as pathogenic genes of MMAF, but these genes can only explain approximately 60% of MMAF-affected cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Therefore, the genetic basis of the remaining cases is still unknown.</p>
<p>The motility of a sperm is driven by its rhythmically beating flagella, and at the center of the flagella lies a conserved axonemal structure, containing the “9 + 2” microtubular arrangement: a ring of nine microtubule doublets (MTDs) surrounding a central pair (CP) of singlet microtubules. Each MTD consists of an A tubule and a B tubule, and the outer (ODA) and inner (IDA) dynein arms are anchored along the A tubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). The ODA and IDA are ATPase-based protein complexes that drive the movement between the A tubule and the neighboring B tubule of the next doublet, producing the original force for sperm motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Structural and functional abnormalities of the ODA and IDA have been demonstrated to cause male infertility associated with asthenozoospermia and/or asthenoteratozoospermia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>).</p>
<p>The dynein axonemal heavy chain (DNAH) family comprises a series of proteins (DNAH1–3, DNAH5–12, and DNAH17) that are precisely assembled with other axonemal dynein motor proteins in the ODAs and IDAs of sperm flagella and motile cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). In humans, DNAH1, DNAH2, DNAH6, DNAH7, DNAH8, DNAH10, DNAH12 and DNAH17 are highly expressed in the testis, and deficiency of these proteins has been demonstrated to cause MMAF-associated asthenoteratozoospermia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). DNAH3 is an evolutionarily conserved IDA-associated protein and is highly expressed in testes of humans and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Deficient DNAH3 has been shown to impair sperm motility in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and cattle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). In humans, <italic>DNAH3</italic> has been identified as a novel breast cancer candidate gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). However, the role of DNAH3 in male reproduction in humans and mice remains largely unknown.</p>
<p>In the present study, we identified four biallelic variations in <italic>DNAH3</italic> in four unrelated Han Chinese patients with asthenoteratozoospermia using whole-exome sequencing (WES). The spermatozoa of the patients showed extremely reduced sperm motility and a high proportion of sperm tail defects characterized by the MMAF phenotype. We further generated <italic>Dnah3</italic> knockout (KO) mice, and the male KO mice expectedly showed aberrations in sperm movement, flagellar IDA, and mitochondrion. Moreover, the absence of DNAH3 led to decreased expression of other IDA-associated proteins, including DNAH1, DNAH6 and DNALI1. Importantly, good outcomes of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment were observed in <italic>DNAH3</italic>-deficient patients and <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mice. This study revealed <italic>DNAH3</italic> as a novel pathogenic gene of asthenoteratozoospermia, and the findings provide valuable suggestions for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of male infertility.</p>

<title>Identification of biallelic pathogenic variants of <italic>DNAH3</italic> in four unrelated infertile men</title>
<p>In the present study, we employed whole-exome sequencing (WES) to identify potential candidate variants associated with primary asthenoteratozoospermia. After comprehensive filtering and screening, we identified 98, 101, 67 and 91 candidate variants for Patient 1, Patient 2, Patient 3 and Patient 4, respectively (Table S1). To refine these candidate variants, we excluded those whose corresponding genes were not expressed in the human or mouse testis, were associated with diseases unrelated to male infertility, or were monoallelic variants. Ultimately, only bi-allelic variants in <italic>DNAH3</italic> (NG_052617.1, NM_017539.2, NP_060009.1) remained, suggesting as the pathogenic variants responsible for the infertility of the patients: a compound heterozygous mutation of c.3590C&gt;T (p.Pro1197Leu) and c.3590C&gt;G (p.Pro1197Arg) in Patient 1, a homozygous missense mutation of c.4837G&gt;T (p.Ala1613Ser) in Patient 2, a compound heterozygous mutation of c.5587del (p.Leu1863*) and c.10355C&gt;T (p.Ser3452Leu) in Patient 3 and a compound heterozygous mutation of c.2314C&gt;T (p.Arg772Trp) and c.4045G&gt;A (p.Asp1349Asn) in Patient 4 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Importantly, routine semen analysis revealed that all patients showed extremely reduced sperm motility and a high proportion of sperm tail defects (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These variants either were not recorded or had an extremely low frequency in East Asian population in multiple public population databases, including the ExAC browser, GnomAD and the 1000 Genomes Project, and were predicted to be potentially deleterious by SIFT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sift.bii.a-star.edu.sg/">https://sift.bii.a-star.edu.sg/</ext-link>), PolyPhen-2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/">http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/</ext-link>), MutationTaster (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mutationtaster.org/">https://www.mutationtaster.org/</ext-link>), and CADD (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cadd.gs.washington.edu/">https://cadd.gs.washington.edu/</ext-link>) (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Next, Sanger sequencing confirmed these variants in the probands, and their fertile parents carried the heterozygous variants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Moreover, the variant sites are localized in several domains of the DNAH3 protein and are highly conserved across species (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>Strikingly, immunofluorescence staining revealed that DNAH3 was exclusively resided in the tail and concentrated in the midpiece of control sperm. However, the fluorescence signal of DNAH3 was hardly detected in the patients’ spermatozoa (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Additionally, subsequent western blotting analysis yielded consistent results with immunofluorescence staining, indicating that these variants led to disrupted expression of DNAH3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). These results suggested that biallelic variants in <italic>DNAH3</italic> disrupted DNAH3 expression and might be responsible for the infertility of the four patients.</p>

<p>We next investigated the aberrant sperm morphology of the patients using Papanicolaou staining and SEM analysis. Notably, the tails of sperm from the patients exhibited a typical phenotype associated with MMAF, including coiled, short, bent, irregular, and/or absent flagella (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A and B</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>).

<p>TEM was employed to determine the ultrastructure of the sperm from the patients. Compared to the integrated and well-organized “9L+L2” axonemal arrangement of the sperm flagella from the normal control, spermatozoa from the patients showed absent or disordered CPs, MTDs, and outer dense fibers (ODFs) in different regions of the flagella (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B</xref>). Interestingly, the IDAs of sperm flagella of the patients were hardly captured compared to the control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Additionally, in the midpiece of sperm flagella of the patients, dissolved mitochondrial material was also observed evidently under TEM (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). We next conducted immunofluorescence staining to label the mitochondria of patients’ sperm with TOM20, a subunit of the mitochondrial import receptor. Remarkably, in contrast to the robust TOM20 signals observed in the normal control, the TOM20 signals in the sperm from the patients were considerably diminished, indicating a disrupted mitochondrial function (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Together, these data suggested that <italic>DNAH3</italic> may function in sperm flagellar development, and loss-of-function variants were associated with MMAF in humans.</p>

<title>DNAH3 is exclusively expressed in the sperm flagella of humans and mice</title>
<p>To further understand the function of DNAH3 in male reproduction, we explored the expression pattern of DNAH3 in humans and mice. qPCR results revealed that <italic>Dnah3</italic> was predominantly expressed in the mouse testis (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A</xref>). Moreover, when observing the expression of <italic>Dnah3</italic> in testes from mice at different postnatal days, we found that <italic>Dnah3</italic> expression was significantly elevated beginning on postnatal Day 22, peaked at postnatal Day 30, and maintained a stable expression level thereafter (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2B</xref>). In addition, germ cells at different stages were isolated from the testes of humans and mice and were stained with anti-DNAH3 antibody. The results showed that DNAH3 was expressed in the cytoplasm of spermatocytes and spermatogonia and then obviously in the flagellum of early and late spermatids (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A and B</xref>). These expression data suggest that DNAH3 may play an important role in sperm flagellar development during spermatogenesis in humans and mice.</p>

<title>Deletion of <italic>Dnah3</italic> causes male infertility in mice</title>
<p>Considering the absent expression of DNAH3 in the patient sperm, we generated <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mice using CRISPRLCas9 technology to further confirm the essential role of DNAH3 in spermatogenesis (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A</xref>). PCR, qPCR, and immunofluorescence staining were used to confirm that <italic>Dnah3</italic> was null in KO mice (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4B-E</xref>). The <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mice survived without any evident abnormalities in development and behavior. H&amp;E staining further revealed that there were no histological differences in the lung, brain, eye, or oviduct between wild-type (WT) and <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mice (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5A</xref>). In addition, no obvious abnormalities in ciliary development were observed in these organs in KO mice compared to WT mice (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5B</xref>). The <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO female mice were fertile with normal oocyte development (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6A</xref>). However, the <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO male mice were completely infertile (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>).

<p>TEM was further utilized to evaluate the sperm flagellar ultrastructure of <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mice.

However, in contrast to the clear display of an IDA and an ODA on the A-tube of each microtubule doublet in the sperm flagella of WT mice, the sperm flagella of <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mice exhibited an absence of almost all the IDAs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7D</xref>).

We next performed immunofluorescence staining to label SLC25A4, which is responsible for the exchange of ATP and ADP across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Strikingly, compared to the bright fluorescence signals in the midpiece of WT sperm, the signals <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO were significantly diminished (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>), indicating impaired mitochondrial function. Collectively, DNAH3 is essential for spermatogenesis, and its deficiency seriously damages the sperm motility and IDAs in both humans and mice.</p>

<title>DNAH3 deficiency impairs IDAs related to the reduction of IDA-associated proteins</title>
<p>Considering the disrupted IDAs revealed by TEM analysis in both our patients and <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mice, we speculated whether the defective IDAs were attributed to the decreased expression of the key IDA-associated proteins. The immunofluorescence data showed that DNAH1/DNAH6 and DNALI1, corresponding to the heavy and light intermediate chains of the IDAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), respectively, were almost invisible along the sperm flagella of the patients when compared to control (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-C</xref>). Consistent results were obtained in our subsequent western blotting analysis of sperm lysates from the patients (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D-F</xref>), indicating that DNAH3 may manipulate the assembly of IDA through regulating the expression of IDA-associated proteins. In contrast, DNAH8/DNAH17 and DNAI1, corresponding to the heavy and intermediate chains of ODAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>), were readily detectable in the patients’ sperm flagella and were comparable to the control (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figure S8A-C</xref>), suggesting that DNAH3 may not regulate the expression of ODA-associated proteins. We also performed immunofluorescence staining and western blotting analysis of DNAH1, DNAH6, DNALI1, DNAH8, DNAH17 and DNAI1 on sperm from <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mice, and the results observed were consistent with those of the patients (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-F</xref>, <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Figure S9A-C</xref>).

<title>ICSI treatment of humans with <italic>DNAH3</italic> variants and <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mice</title>
<p>ICSI treatment has been reported to be effective in asthenoteratozoospermia-associated infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). ICSI cycles were attempted for the patients after written informed consent was obtained. The female partners all had normal basal hormone levels and underwent a long gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist protocol (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The wife of Patient 1 underwent one ICSI attempt. A total of 21 metaphase II (MII) oocytes were retrieved and microinjected, of which 17 oocytes were successfully fertilized (17/21, 80.95%) and cleaved (17/17, 100%). Thirteen Day 3 (D3) embryos were formed, six of which developed into blastocysts (8/13, 61.54%) after standard embryo culture. Two blastocysts were transferred, one of which was implanted. She eventually achieved clinical pregnancy, and the pregnancy is ongoing (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The partner of Patient 2 underwent two ICSI attempts. In her first ICSI attempt, six MII oocytes were retrieved, of which three were fertilized (3/6, 50%) and cleaved (3/3, 100%). After standard embryo culture, two D3 embryos were formed and transferred. However, this ICSI failed because no embryos were implanted. In her second ICSI attempt, all five MII oocytes were fertilized and cleaved (5/5, 100%). Five D3 embryos were obtained, of which two were transferred, but no embryos were implanted. The remaining three D3 embryos were cultured continuously, and two available blastocysts were formed and kept to be transferred in the future (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The partner of Patient 3 underwent one ICSI attempt. Of the 20 MII oocytes retrieved, 19 oocytes were fertilized (19/20, 95.0%) and cleaved (19/19, 100%). Fifteen D3 embryos were obtained, and 10 developed into available blastocysts (10/15, 66.7%). One blastocyst was transferred and implanted. She achieved clinical pregnancy, and the pregnancy is ongoing (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The wife of Patient 4 underwent four failed ICSI attempts. In her first two ICSI attempts, 13 and 12 MII oocytes were retrieved, of which five (5/12, 41.67%) and six (6/13, 46.15%), respectively, were fertilized and cleaved. Two available D3 embryos were obtained and transferred in both ICSI attempts, but no embryos were implanted. In her third ICSI attempt, of the eight MII oocytes retrieved, four (4/8, 50%) were fertilized and cleaved (4/4, 100%). However, no available D3 embryos were acquired. In her last ICSI attempt, seven MII oocytes were retrieved, of which three were fertilized (3/7, 42.68%) and two were cleaved (2/3, 66.7%), but no available D3 embryos were formed (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).

<p>We also carried out ICSI treatment on <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO male mice. Strikingly, favorable outcomes of ICSI were obtained in <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO male mice.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we identified pathogenic variants in <italic>DNAH3</italic> in unrelated infertile men with asthenoteratozoospermia. These variations resulted in the almost absence of DNAH3 and sharply decreased the expression of other IDA-associated proteins, including DNAH1, DNAH6 and DNALI1. Combined with similar findings in <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mice, we demonstrated that DNAH3 is fundamental for male fertility. Moreover, we suggest that ICSI might be a favorable treatment for male infertility caused by DNAH3 deficiency. Our findings identify a function for DNAH3 in male reproduction in humans and mice and may provide a new view on the clinical practice of male infertility.</p>
<p>Recently, Meng et al. identified bi-allelic variants in <italic>DNAH3</italic> from patients diagnosed with asthenoteratozoospermia, revealing multiple morphological defects and a disrupted “9+2” arrangement in the patients’ sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Furthermore, they generated <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mice, which were infertile, and exhibited moderate morphological abnormalities with a normally structured “9 + 2” microtubule arrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). In our study, we also observed similar phenotypic differences between the phenotypes of <italic>DNAH3</italic>-deficient patients and <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mice. These findings indicate that DNAH3 may play crucial yet distinct roles in human and mouse male reproduction. Additionally, our TEM analysis demonstrated a notable absence of IDAs in sperm from both <italic>DNAH3</italic>-deficent patients and <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mice, resembling the findings of Meng et al. To further investigate, we conducted immunofluorescent staining and western blotting to assess the levels of IDA-associated proteins (DNAH1, DNAH6 and DNALI1) and ODA-associated proteins (DNAH8, DNAH17 and DNAI1) in sperm samples from both our <italic>DNAH3</italic>-deficient patients and <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mice. Our data revealed a reduction in IDA-associated protein levels and comparable ODA-associated protein levels in comparison to normal controls and WT mice, respectively, thus corroborating the TEM observations. These results suggest that DNAH3 is involved in sperm flagellar development in human and mice, specifically through its role in the assembly of IDAs.</p>
<p>Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD, MIM: 244400) is a genetic disorder affecting at least one in 7554 individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). The most common symptoms of PCD are recurrent infections in airways due to malfunction of the motile cilia that are responsible for mucus clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). It has been suggested that male infertility associated with sperm defects is highly prevalent (up to 75%) among individuals with PCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). Axonemal defects caused by variants within <italic>DNAH</italic> family members, including <italic>DNAH5</italic>, <italic>DNAH6</italic>, <italic>DNAH7</italic>, <italic>DNAH9</italic> and <italic>DNAH11,</italic> are causative factors for PCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). Moreover, deficiency in these PCD-causing <italic>DNAH</italic>s has also been associated with male infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). Additionally, other <italic>DNAH</italic>s, such as <italic>DNAH1</italic>, <italic>DNAH2</italic>, <italic>DNAH8</italic>, <italic>DNAH10</italic>, <italic>DNAH12</italic> and <italic>DNAH17,</italic> are suggested to be pathogenic genes of isolated male infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). These phenotype–genotype correlations may be attributed to the fact that ciliary and flagellar axonemes have cell type-specific or cell type-enriched DNAHs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). DNAH3 resides in the IDA and is expressed in testis and ciliary tissues, including the lung, brain, eye, and oviduct. However, despite its presence in these tissues, the relationship between deficient DNAH3 and disease is unclear to date. Intriguingly, in our study, none of the patients with <italic>DNAH3</italic> deficiency reported experiencing any of the principal symptoms associated with PCD. Additionally, our <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mice exhibited normal ciliary development in the lung, brain, eye, and oviduct. Similarly, Meng et al. did not mention any PCD symptoms in their <italic>DNAH3</italic>-deficient patients, and their <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mice also demonstrated normal ciliary morphology in the trachea and brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). These combined observations suggest that DNAH3 may play a more important role in sperm flagellar development than in other motile cilia functions. Given that DNAH3 is expressed in ciliary tissues, its role in these tissues remains intriguing and could be elucidated through sequencing of larger cohorts of individuals with PCD.</p>
<p>ICSI has been an efficient treatment for male infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). However, the outcomes of ICSI for male infertility caused by variants in different <italic>DNAH</italic> genes are variable. It has been demonstrated that infertile males with variants in <italic>DNAH1</italic>, <italic>DNAH2</italic>, <italic>DNAH7</italic>, and <italic>DNAH8</italic> have a favorable prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>), while patients with variants in <italic>DNAH17</italic> have poor outcomes after ICSI treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). Meanwhile, the ICSI outcomes in male infertility caused by <italic>DNAH6</italic> variants may depend on the specific mutation or be controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). The patients with <italic>DNAH3</italic> mutations in our study experienced different clinical outcomes of ICSI treatment. The partners of Patient 1 and Patient 3 achieved clinical pregnancy. The wives of Patient 2 and Patient 4 obtained favorable fertilization and cleavage rates but experienced no clinical pregnancy due to the nonimplantation of the transferred embryos. Remarkably, despite the diverse variants within <italic>DNAH3</italic> observed in the four patients, all variants led to a complete absence of DNAH3 expression. Additionally, we did not identify any pathogenic variants that associated with fertilization failure and early embryonic development in the two patients with failed ICSI outcomes. Therefore, these different ICSI outcomes might be attributed to additional unexplained factors from the female partners. Importantly, in the study from Meng et al., one patient carrying <italic>DNAH3</italic> variants received ICSI treatment, and the partner obtained clinical pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Combined with the successful ICSI outcomes observed in <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mice, we suggest ICSI as an optimized treatment for infertile men carrying variants in <italic>DNAH3</italic>. More cases are needed to precisely estimate the prevalence of <italic>DNAH3</italic> mutations and determine a prognosis for ICSI treatments.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study revealed an unexplored role of DNAH3 in male reproduction in humans and mice, suggesting <italic>DNAH3</italic> as a novel causative gene for human asthenoteratozoospermia. Moreover, ICSI is as an optimized treatment for infertile men with <italic>DNAH3</italic> variants. This study expands our knowledge of the relationship between DNAH proteins and disease, facilitating genetic counseling and clinical treatment of male infertility in the future.</p>

<title>Genetic analysis</title>
<p>Peripheral blood samples were obtained from the subjects to extract genomic DNA using a DNA purification kit (TIANGEN, DP304). For WES, 1 μg of genomic DNA was utilized for exon capture using the Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon V6 Kit and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq X system (150-bp read length). The quality of WES, including clean reads, sequencing depth, sequencing coverage, and mapping quality are listed in Table S1. The variants identified through WES were annotated and filtered using Exomiser. Next, the variants were screened to obtain candidate variants based on the following criteria: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) the allele frequency in the East Asian population was less than 1% in any database, including the ExAC Browser, gnomAD, and the 1000 Genomes Project; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) the variants affected coding exons or canonical splice sites; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) the variants were predicted to be possibly pathogenic or damaging. The remain genes were then analyzed using the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/">https://www.proteinatlas.org/</ext-link>) and Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://informatics.jax.org/">https://informatics.jax.org/</ext-link>) to access their expression in human and mouse testis. Additionally, OMIM database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.omim.org/">https://www.omim.org/</ext-link>) and relevant literature were used to understand their relationship with human infertility. Given the assumption of a recessive inheritance pattern, monoallelic variants were excluded from consideration. The remained candidate pathogenic variants were verified by Sanger sequencing on DNA from the patients’ families. The primer pairs used for PCR amplification are listed in Table S2.</p>

<title>Generation of the <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mouse model</title>
<p>Animal experiments in this study were approved by the Experimental Animal Management and Ethics Committee of West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, and complied with the Animal Care and Use Committee of Sichuan University. A <italic>Dnah3</italic> knockout mouse model was generated by the CRISPRLCas9 system. Briefly, Cas9 and signal-guide RNAs (5’-GTATCAAGTGGATGTAAACC-3’) were transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase in vitro and comicroinjected into the cytoplasm of single-cell C57BL/6J mouse embryos to generate frameshift mutations by nonhomologous recombination through introduction of a 1 bp insertion in exon 13. Then, the embryos were cultured and transferred into the oviducts of pseudopregnant female mice at 0.5 days post-coitum. A mutation of <italic>Dnah3</italic> in the founder mouse and their offspring was confirmed using PCR and Sanger sequencing. The primers used for the generation of animal models are listed in Table S2.</p>

<title>Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)</title>
<p>ICSI was carried out using standard techniques. In brief, one-month-old female KM mice were injected with 5 IU of equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) (ProSpec, HOR-272) to induce superovulation. Metaphase II-arrested (MII) oocytes were acquired through another injection of 5 IU human chorionic gonadotropin after 48 hours. MII oocytes were incubated with Chatot-Ziomek-Bavister medium (Easycheck, M2750) at 37.5 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> until use. Mouse cauda epididymal spermatozoa were incubated in human tubal fluid (HTF) medium (Easycheck, M1150) and then frozen and thawed repeatedly to remove sperm tails. For ICSI, a single sperm head was microinjected into an MII oocyte by using a NIKON inverted microscope and a Piezo (PrimeTech, Osaka, Japan) in Whitten’s-HEPES medium containing 0.01% polyvinyl alcohol (Gibco,12360-038) and cytochalasin B (3.5 g/ml; SigmaLAldrich, C-6762). The successfully injected oocytes were transferred into G1-Plus medium (Vitrolife, 10132) and incubated at 37.5 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Wang and colleagues identify biallelic variants of DNAH3 in four unrelated Han Chinese infertile men through whole-exome sequencing, which contributes to abnormal sperm flagellar morphology and ultrastructure. To investigate the importance of DNAH3 in male infertility, the authors generated crispant Dnah3 knockout (KO) male mice. They observed that KO mice are also infertile, showing a severe reduction in sperm movement with abnormal IDA (inner dynein arms) and mitochondrion structure. Moreover, nonfunctional DNAH3 expression decreased the expression of IDA-associated proteins in the spermatozoa of patients and KO mice, which are involved in the disruption of sperm motility. Interestingly, the infertility of patients and KO mice is rescued by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Taken together, the authors propose that DNAH3 is a novel pathogenic gene for asthenoterozoospermia and male infertility.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work investigates the role of DNAH3 in sperm mobility and male infertility. By using gold-standard molecular biology techniques, the authors demonstrate with exquisite resolution the importance of DNAH3 in sperm morphology, showing strong evidence of its role in male infertility. Overall, this is a very interesting, well-written, and appealing article. All aspects of the study design and methods are well described and appropriate to address the main question of the manuscript. The conclusions drawn are consistent with the analyses conducted and supported by the data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The paper is solid, and in its current form, I have not detected relevant weaknesses.</p>

<p>Wang et al. investigated the role of dynein axonemal heavy chain 3 (DNAH3) in male infertility. They found that variants of DNAH3 were present in four infertile men, and the deficiency of DNAH3 in sperm affects sperm mobility. Additionally, they showed that Dnah3 knockout male mice are infertile. Furthermore, they demonstrated that DNAH3 influences inner dynein arms by regulating several DNAH proteins. Importantly, they showed that intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) can rescue the infertility in Dnah3 knockout mice and two patients with DNAH3 variants.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The conclusions of this paper are well-supported by data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The sample/patient size is small; however, the findings are consistent with those of a recent study on DNAH3 in male infertility involving 432 patients.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>(1) To further explore the genetic basis of asthenoteratozoospermia, the authors performed whole-exome sequencing analyses among infertile males affected by asthenoteratozoospermia. Four unrelated Han Chinese patients were found to carry biallelic variations of DNAH3, a gene encoding IDA-associated protein.</p>
<p>
(2) To verify the function of IDA associated protein DNAH3, the authors generated a Dnah3-KO mouse model and revealed that the loss of DNAH3 leads to severe male infertility as a result of the severe reduction in sperm movement with the abnormal IDA and mitochondrion structures.</p>
<p>
(3) Mechanically, they confirmed decreased expression of IDA-associated proteins (including DNAH1, DNAH6 and DNALI1) in the spermatozoa from patients with DNAH3 mutations and Dnah3-KO male mice.</p>
<p>
(4) Then, they also found that male infertility caused by DNAH3 deficiency could be rescued by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment in humans and mice.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) In addition to existing research, the authors provided novel variants of DNAH3 as important factors leading to asthenoteratozoospermia. This further expands the spectrum of pathogenic variants in asthenoteratozoospermia.</p>
<p>
(2) By mechanistic studies, they found that DNAH3 deficiency led to decreased expression of IDA-associated proteins, which may be used to explain the disruption of sperm motility and reduced fertility caused by DNAH3 deficiency.</p>
<p>
(3) Then, successful ICSI outcomes were observed in patients with DNAH3 mutations and Dnah3 KO mice, which will provide an important reference for genetic counselling and clinical treatment of male infertility.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) Combined Public Reviews:</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work investigates the role of DNAH3 in sperm mobility and male infertility and utilised gold-standard molecular biology techniques, showing strong evidence of its role in male infertility. All aspects of the study design and methods are well described and appropriate to address the main question of the manuscript. The conclusions drawn are consistent with the analyses conducted and supported by the data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We extend our sincere gratitude to the expert reviewers for their valuable comments and insightful suggestions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1.1) The manuscript lacks a comparison with previous studies on DNAH3 in the Discussion section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewers' comments.</p>
<p>Recently, Meng et al. identified bi-allelic variants in DNAH3 from patients diagnosed with asthenoteratozoospermia, revealing multiple morphological defects and a disrupted &quot;9+2&quot; arrangement in the patients' sperm (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1093/hropen/hoae003">https://doi.org/10.1093/hropen/hoae003</ext-link>, PMID: 38312775). Furthermore, they generated <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mice, which were infertile, and exhibited moderate morphological abnormalities with a normally structured “9 + 2” microtubule arrangement. In our study, we also observed similar phenotypic differences between the phenotypes of <italic>DNAH3</italic>-deficient patients and <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mice. These findings indicate that DNAH3 may play crucial yet distinct roles in human and mouse male reproduction. Additionally, our TEM analysis demonstrated a notable absence of IDAs in sperm from both <italic>DNAH3</italic>-deficent patients and <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mice, resembling the findings of Meng et al. To further investigate, we conducted immunofluorescent staining and western blotting to assess the levels of IDA-associated proteins (DNAH1, DNAH6 and DNALI1) and ODA-associated proteins (DNAH8, DNAH17 and DNAI1) in sperm samples from both our <italic>DNAH3</italic>-deficient patients and <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mice. Our data revealed a reduction in IDA-associated protein levels and comparable ODA-associated protein levels in comparison to normal controls and WT mice, respectively, thus corroborating the TEM observations. These results suggest that DNAH3 is involved in sperm flagellar development in human and mice, specifically through its role in the assembly of IDAs.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, in our study, none of the patients with <italic>DNAH3</italic> deficiency reported experiencing any of the principal symptoms associated with PCD. Additionally, our <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mice exhibited normal ciliary development in the lung, brain, eye, and oviduct. Similarly, Meng et al. did not mention any PCD symptoms in their <italic>DNAH3</italic>-deficient patients, and their <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mice also demonstrated normal ciliary morphology in the trachea and brain. These combined observations suggest that DNAH3 may play a more significant role in sperm flagellar development than in other motile cilia functions. Given that DNAH3 is expressed in ciliary tissues, its role in these tissues remains intriguing and could be elucidated through sequencing of larger cohorts of individuals with PCD.</p>
<p>We have added these discussions in line 267 to 283, and line 300 to 303.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1.2) The variants of DNAH3 in four infertile men were identified through whole-exome sequencing. Providing an overview of the WES data would be beneficial to offer additional insights into whether other variants may contribute the infertility. This could also help explain why ICSI only works for two out of four patients with DNAH3 variants.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer's helpful suggestions.</p>
<p>We have deposited the raw whole-exome sequencing data in the National Genomics Data Center (NGDC) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/">https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/</ext-link>, accession number: HRA007467). The clean reads, sequencing depth, sequencing coverage, and mapping quality of the WES on the patients are listed below (Table R1). A summary of WES has been presented in Table S1.</p>
<table-wrap id="sa4table1">

<title>Quality of whole exome sequencing on infertile men.</title>
</caption>
<graphic mime-subtype="jpg" xlink:href="elife-96755-sa4-table1.jpg" mimetype="image"/>
</table-wrap>
<p>The variants identified through WES were annotated and filtered using Exomiser. Next, the variants were screened to obtain candidate variants based on the following criteria: (1) the allele frequency in the East Asian population was less than 1% in any database, including the ExAC Browser, gnomAD, and the 1000 Genomes Project; (2) the variants affected coding exons or canonical splice sites; (3) the variants were predicted to be possibly pathogenic or damaging.</p>
<p>Following filtering and screening, the numbers of candidate variants obtained were as follows: Patient 1: 98, Patient 2: 101, Patient 3: 67, and Patient 4: 91(Table S1). Subsequently, we utilized the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/">https://www.proteinatlas.org/</ext-link>) and Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://informatics.jax.org/">https://informatics.jax.org/</ext-link>) to analyze the expression patterns of corresponding genes. Variants whose corresponding genes were not expressed in the human or mouse testis were excluded from further consideration. We also consulted OMIM database and reviewed relevant literature to exclude variants associated with diseases unrelated to male infertility. Additionally, considering the assumption of a recessive inheritance pattern, we excluded all monoallelic variants. Ultimately, only bi-allelic variants in DNAH3 (NG_052617.1, NM_017539.2, NP_060009.1) remained, suggesting as the pathogenic variants responsible for the infertility of the patients (Table S1). These <italic>DNAH3</italic> variants were verified by Sanger sequencing on DNA from the patients' families.</p>
<p>We have added the overview of the WES in Table S1 and supplemented the analysis process of WES data in line 100 to 106, and line 348 to 360.</p>
<p>Additionally, we did not identify any pathogenic variants that associated with fertilization failure and early embryonic development in the two patients with failed ICSI outcomes. Therefore, these different ICSI outcomes might be attributed to additional unexplained factors from the female partners.</p>

<p>(1.3) Quantification of images would help substantiate the conclusions, particularly in Figures 2, 3, 4, and 6. Improved images in Figures 3A, 4B, and 4C, would help increase confidence in the claims made.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In response to reviewer’s valuable suggestions. We presume that the reviewer means quantification of images in Figure S6, but not Figure 6.</p>
<p>We have compiled statistics for results shown in Figures 2, 3, 4, and S6. Specifically:</p>
<p>- The percentages of abnormal flagellar morphology in normal control and patients, associated with the observations in Figure 2A, have been shown in Figure S1A.</p>
<p>- The percentages of aberrant axonemal ultrastructure in different cross-sections of sperm from in normal control and patients, correspond to the findings in Figure 3A, have been presented in Figure S1B.</p>
<p>- The percentages of abnormal flagellar morphology in WT mice and <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mice have been shown in Figure S7A.</p>
<p>- The percentages of aberrant axonemal arrangement in different cross-sections of sperm from WT mice and <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mice, corresponding to the findings in Figure 4B, have been presented in Figure S7C.</p>
<p>- The percentages of microtubule doublets presenting IDAs in sperm from WT mice and <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mice, related to Figure 4B, have been detailed in Figure S7D.</p>
<p>- The percentages of malformed mitochondria in the midpiece of sperm from WT mice and <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mice, associated with the observations in Figure 4C, have been presented in Figure S7E.</p>
<p>Moreover, we have revised Figures 3A, 4B, and 4C by replacing the unclear TEM images.</p>

<p>(3.1) A summary of the WES data would be needed (i.e. number of reads, mapping quality, etc). As mentioned in the public review, it would be beneficial to present a summary of all variants identified in the data and clarify whether DNAH3 is the only gene that contains variants and whether these variants have been validated.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reviewer's comments.</p>
<p>SIFT, PolyPhen-2, MutationTaster and CADD assess the deleteriousness of genetic variants by considering genomic features and evolutionary constraint of the surrounding sequence or structural and chemical property altercations by the amino acid substitutions. We have added websites and references of these tools in the manuscript (line 116 to 118).</p>
<p>Here are the principles of these tools.</p>
<p>- The SIFT considers the position at which the change occurred and the type of amino acid change, and then to predict whether an amino acid substitution in a protein will affect protein function [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sift.bii.a-star.edu.sg/">https://sift.bii.a-star.edu.sg/</ext-link>, PMID: 12824425].</p>
<p>- The PolyPhen-2 predicts the impact of an amino acid substitution on a human protein by considering several features, including sequence, phylogenetic, and structural information [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/">http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/</ext-link>, PMID: 20354512].</p>
<p>- The MutationTaster utilizes a Bayes classifier to predict the functional consequences of amino acid substitutions, intronic and synonymous changes, short insertions/deletions (indels), etc. [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mutationtaster.org/">https://www.mutationtaster.org/</ext-link>, PMID: 24681721].</p>
<p>- The CADD scores are based on diverse genomic features derived from surrounding sequence context, gene model annotations, evolutionary constraint, epigenetic measurements, and functional predictions [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cadd.gs.washington.edu/">https://cadd.gs.washington.edu/</ext-link>, PMID: 30371827].</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>(4) Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(4.1) Please ensure that all gene names used in your manuscript have been approved by the HUGO nomenclature committee. For example, &quot;c.3590C&gt;T (p.P1197L)&quot; should be described as &quot;c.3590C&gt;T (Pro1197Leu)&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In response to the reviewer's suggestion, we have improved all the names of gene and variants according to the HUGO nomenclature committee and HGVS Variant Nomenclature Committee, respectively.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4.2) For Table 1, the authors should provide the rates of abnormal sperm morphologies using the sperm cells from normal male controls.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the reviewer’s careful comments. Consistent with the WHO laboratory manual (<italic>World Health Organization. WHO laboratory manual for the examination and processing of human semen. World Health Organization, 2021.</italic>), our routine semen analysis establishes 4% as the minimum rate of sperm with normal morphology but does not define the maximum rate of various tail defects. However, we reviewed the routine semen analysis on the normal controls in our study, and the approximate distribution of sperm with various flagellar in the normal controls was as follows: normal flagella, 78.6%; absent flagella, 1.7%; short flagella, 0.6%; coiled flagella, 12.5%; bent flagella, 7.9%; irregular flagella, 1.8%.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4.3) In Table 2, &quot;Mutation Tester&quot; or &quot;Mutation Taster&quot;?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer’s comments. It should be &quot;MutationTaster&quot;, and we have corrected this mistake in Table 2 and the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4.4) In Figure 2B, the bars for patient 1 should be aligned.</p>
