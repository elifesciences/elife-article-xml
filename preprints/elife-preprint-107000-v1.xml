<title>Summary</title><p>Pharmacological enhancement of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteostasis is an attractive strategy to mitigate pathology linked to etiologically-diverse protein misfolding diseases. However, despite this promise, few compounds have been identified that enhance ER proteostasis through defined mechanisms of action. We previously identified the phenylhydrazone-based compound AA263 as a compound that promotes adaptive ER proteostasis remodeling through mechanisms including activation of the ATF6 signaling arm of the unfolded protein response (UPR). However, the protein target(s) of AA263 and the potential for further development of this class of ER proteostasis regulators had not been previously explored. Here, we employ chemical proteomics to demonstrate that AA263 covalently targets a subset of ER protein disulfide isomerases, revealing a molecular mechanism for the activation of ATF6 afforded by this compound. We then use medicinal chemistry to establish next-generation AA263 analogs showing improved potency and efficacy for ATF6 activation, as compared to the parent compound. Finally, we show that treatment with these AA263 analogs enhances secretory pathway proteostasis to correct the pathologic protein misfolding and trafficking of both a destabilized, disease-associated α1-antitrypsin (A1AT) variant and an epilepsy-associated GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor variant. These results establish AA263 analogs with enhanced potential for correcting imbalanced ER proteostasis associated with etiologically-diverse protein misfolding disorders.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Nearly one-third of the human proteome is targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for folding and trafficking to downstream secretory environments including the plasma membrane, lysosome, and the extracellular space.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> The folding and trafficking versus degradation of these secretory proteins is decided by a process termed ER quality control, wherein ER-localized chaperones and folding factors engage proteins within the ER to facilitate their folding into a folded, trafficking-competent conformation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> Proteins unable to attain a folded conformation in the ER through interactions with ER chaperones are instead recognized by ER-localized degradation factors that promote their targeting to degradation pathways such as ER-associated degradation by the proteasome or ER-phagy accomplished by the lysosome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> Through this ER quality control process, cells promote the trafficking of folded, functional proteins through the secretory pathway and prevent the accumulation of non-native or aggregation-prone conformations within the ER or in downstream secretory environments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite the efficacy of ER quality control, failure of this process is implicated in the onset and pathogenesis of numerous, etiologically-diverse diseases, collectively referred to as protein misfolding diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> These diseases are primarily associated with destabilizing mutations within a secretory protein that hinder ER quality control machinery, ultimately leading to toxic protein aggregation and/or loss of function pathologies. For example, the aberrant secretion and toxic extracellular aggregation of destabilized, aggregation-prone variants of amyloidogenic proteins including transthyretin (TTR) or immunoglobulin light chain (LC) are implicated in the onset and pathogenesis of protein aggregation diseases such as the TTR amyloidoses and Light Chain Amyloidosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> Alternatively, mutations in subunits of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptors prevent the proper folding, assembly and trafficking of these proteins to the plasma membrane. This loss-of-function phenotype has been implicated in numerous neurological disorders, including genetic epilepsy and neurodevelopmental delay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> Other proteinopathies, such as alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency can involve both toxic protein aggregation and loss of function pathologies. In this disease, destabilized AAT variants (e.g., PIZZ) can lead to both gain of toxic function pathology through intra-ER retention causing liver pathology and loss of function pathology associated with poorly functional secreted AAT leading to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the lung.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The central involvement of ER quality control in the onset and pathogenesis of protein misfolding diseases has suggested that developing strategies to enhance ER quality control offers a potential opportunity to broadly mitigate pathologies linked to the aberrant folding or degradation of proteins targeted to the ER.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> One attractive strategy to regulate ER quality control is through targeting the unfolded protein response (UPR) – the predominant stress responsive signaling pathway that regulates ER quality control in response to pathologic ER insults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> The UPR comprises three integrated signaling pathways activated downstream of the ER membrane proteins IRE1, PERK and ATF6.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> ER stress activates the UPR leading to downstream transcriptional and translational signaling that functions to both alleviate the ER stress and enhance ER function. ER quality control is primarily regulated by the UPR-associated transcription factors XBP1s (downstream of IRE1) and ATF6 (a cleaved product of full length ATF6).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> These transcription factors induce expression of overlapping, but distinct, sets of ER chaperones, folding enzymes, and degradation factors that remodel the composition and the capacity of ER quality control pathways by creating emergent functions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> Consistent with this, stress-independent activation of XBP1s, or especially, ATF6 has been shown to correct pathologic imbalances in ER quality control implicated in the pathogenesis of many different protein misfolding diseases, including those indicated above.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>The potential to improve ER quality control in protein misfolding diseases through activation of ATF6 led to a significant interest in developing pharmacologic approaches that selectively induce activation of this UPR transcriptional program. Towards that aim, we previously used high throughput screening to identify first-in-class ER proteostasis regulator compounds, such as compound AA147, that selectively activate the ATF6 signaling arm of the UPR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> We showed that AA147 activates ATF6 through a mechanism involving metabolic conversion of the prodrug AA147 to an electrophilic quinone methide on the ER membrane that covalently modifies a subset of ER protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> This leads to an increase in reduced, monomeric ATF6 that can traffic to the Golgi for proteolytic release of the active ATF6 transcription factor domain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> Intriguingly, treatment with AA147 improves ER quality control for many different destabilized, disease-associated proteins linked to protein aggregation and loss-of-function protein misfolding diseases including AAT deficiency and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-associated epilepsy, as well as protein aggregation-associated degenerative diseases such as TTR amyloidosis and immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> As predicted based on the mechanism of action of AA147, these benefits can be attributed to ER proteostasis remodeling induced by either direct PDI modification and/or by ATF6 activation, demonstrating the broad potential for this approach to influence ER proteostasis of multiple different disease-relevant proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> However, despite this promise, the continued development of AA147 has proven challenging, as AA147 has been shown to be largely recalcitrant towards scaffold modifications aimed at improving its potency, selectivity, and efficacy for ATF6 activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition to finding AA147, our original high-throughput screen also identified the phenylhydrazone compound AA263 as a selective ATF6 activating compound.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> However, the mechanism of AA263-dependent ATF6 activation and the potential for the development of improved analogs based on this scaffold by medicinal chemistry have not been previously explored. Herein, we show that AA263, like AA147, covalently targets ER PDIs, providing a mechanism to explain the ATF6 activation afforded by this compound. Intriguingly, we also show that modification of the AA263 B-ring at the <italic>para</italic> position allows for the establishment of compounds with improved selectivity and efficacy for ATF6 activation. Taking advantage of this, we establish next generation AA263 analogs that show improved potency and efficacy in comparison to the parent AA263. Further, we demonstrate that these enhanced AA263 analogs correct ER quality control defects in cellular models expressing disease-relevant proteins including the Z-variant of AAT and epilepsy-associated variants of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. Collectively, these results establish AA263 and its associated analogs as ER proteostasis regulators with enhanced potential for further development, expanding the toolbox of compounds suitable for targeting ER quality control in the context of etiologically diverse protein misfolding diseases.</p>

<title>AA263 covalently modifies a subset of ER PDIs</title>
<p>ER proteostasis regulators including AA147 and AA132 activate the ATF6 arm of the UPR through a mechanism involving their metabolic activation to a quinone methide and subsequent covalent targeting of ER PDIs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> Intriguingly, 2-hydroxyphenylhydrazones are known to tautomerize to a quinone methide (AA263-QM), suggesting that AA263 could similarly activate ATF6 through spontaneous quinone methide electrophile generation and covalent PDI targeting (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), without the requirement of metabolic activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> Interestingly, co-treatment with β-mercaptoethanol (BME), which acts as both an exogenous nucleophile and modulator of cellular redox potential, or the antioxidant resveratrol decreased AA263-dependent activation of the ERSE-FLuc reporter (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B,C</xref>) suggesting that an ER enzyme oxidative activation of AA263 to an unknown electrophile could also be playing a role in PDI conjugation. Consistent with this, synthesis of an AA263 analog lacking the hydroxyl moiety on the A-ring (AA263-1; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>) does not activate the ATF6-selective ERSE-FLuc reporter in HEK293 cells. These results support a model whereby AA263 activates ATF6 through a mechanism involving both enzymatic oxidation and direct tautomerization to an AA263-QM and subsequent covalent modification of predominantly ER protein targets (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>To monitor covalent protein labeling by AA263, we generated an AA263 analog with replacement of the nitro group on the B-ring with an alkyne amenable for affinity enrichment experiments (AA263<sup>yne</sup> <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). We found that this analog robustly activated the ERSE-FLuc reporter, demonstrating an ∼2-fold increase in potency, as compared to AA263 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). We also confirmed that the AA263<sup>yne</sup>-dependent activation of the ERSE-FLuc reporter was inhibited by co-treatment with BME (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). We treated HEK293 cells with AA263<sup>yne</sup> and visualized protein modification by appending a Cy5-azide fluorophore to the terminal alkyne of conjugated proteins using Cu(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). AA263<sup>yne</sup> showed robust protein labeling in HEK293 cells upon in site compound treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). Co-treatment with excess AA263 reduced labeling by AA263<sup>yne</sup>, confirming that AA263<sup>yne</sup> and AA263 label the same subset of the human proteome. Further, co-treatment with BME or resveratrol also reduced AA263<sup>yne</sup> proteome labeling (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>). Intriguingly, unlike AA147<sup>yne</sup>, treatment of lysates with AA263<sup>yne</sup> showed mild proteome labeling, indicating that some AA263-dependent protein labeling may proceed through direct tautomerization to the electrophilic QM species (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C</xref>).</p>
<p>We next sought to identify proteins modified by AA263 using Tandem Mass Tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomics. We previously showed that selective ATF6 activation afforded by compounds such as AA147 and AA132 is attributed to the extent of compound-dependent modification of PDIs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> Thus, we compared the extent of proteome labeling observed with AA263<sup>yne</sup> labeling to that observed with AA132<sup>yne</sup> – a compound that globally activates the UPR through covalently modifying a large number of PDIs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> For these comparative chemoproteomic experiments, we treated HEK293 cells with vehicle, AA263<sup>yne</sup> or AA132<sup>yne</sup> and then used CuAAC to append biotin-azide to modified proteins. Proteins were then enriched with streptavidin, digested with trypsin digestion, labeled with tandem mass tag (TMTs), and analyzed by LC-MS/MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> Modified proteins were defined by a 3-fold enrichment in compound-treated cells (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01), as compared to vehicle-treated cells. We identified 17 proteins covalently modified by AA263<sup>yne</sup>, as compared to 20 proteins modified by AA132<sup>yne</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). Intriguingly, 12 proteins were shared between these two conditions, including 7 different ER-localized PDIs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). This is similar to results observed when comparing proteins modified by the selective ATF6 activating compound AA147<sup>yne</sup> and AA132<sup>yne</sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> Further, we found that the extent of labeling for key PDIs including PDIA1, PDIA4, PDIA6, and TMX1 showed greater modification by AA132<sup>yne</sup>, as compared to AA263<sup>yne</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>). Similar results were observed for AA147<sup>yne</sup>. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> This suggests that, like AA147, the selective activation of ATF6 afforded by AA263 can be attributed to the modest modifications of a subset of ER-localized PDIs by this compound. Four of the 5 proteins that formed conjugates with AA263<sup>yne</sup>, but not AA132<sup>yne</sup>, are cytosolic proteins, suggesting that tautomerization to an AA263-QM may be occurring as a minor quinone methide formation pathway. However, spontaneous tautomerization to the quinone methide of AA263 seems unlikely to be the main pathway of electrophile formation from AA263 given the remarkable preference of AA263 to react with ER-localized proteins, which is not a general feature of other small molecule electrophiles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> This specificity for ER proteins instead suggests the localized generation of AA263 quinone methides at the ER membrane, likely through metabolic activation by ER localized oxidases, which has been previously been shown to contribute to the selective modification of ER proteins afforded by other compounds such as AA147.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup></p>

<title>Structure activity relationship studies identify AA263 analogs with improved potency and efficacy</title>
<p>The increased potency observed for AA263<sup>yne</sup>, as compared to AA263, suggests that the B-ring of AA263 may be amenable to medicinal chemical modification for modulating the activation of ATF6 by this class of compounds (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>).

<p>Next, we used RNAseq to further probe the selectivity for ATF6 activation in HEK293 cells treated with either vehicle, AA263, AA263<sup>yne</sup> or AA263-5. Initially, we monitored the activation of ATF6 and other arms of the UPR by comparing the expression of sets of genes regulated by these different UPR signaling pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> Aligning with our qPCR results, AA263<sup>yne</sup> and AA263-5 increased expression of ATF6 target genes, in comparison to AA263 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, Table S1). These compounds also showed a modest increase in IRE1/XBP1s target genes, reflecting the known overlap between ATF6 and IRE1/XBP1 target genesets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> In contrast, both compounds modestly reduced expression of PERK/ISR target genes.

<p>We next sought to evaluate whether we could further elaborate the <italic>para</italic>-amide substructure of the AA263<sup>yne</sup> scaffold by a medicinal chemistry strategy to provide additional enhancement of ATF6 activity. Towards that aim, we synthesized AA263<sup>yne</sup> analogs where the alkyne moiety was replaced with various aliphatic or aromatic substituent groups (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). We then monitored activation of the ERSE-FLUC ATF6 reporter stably expressed in HEK293 cells treated with increasing doses of these analogs. This identified two analogs, AA263-15 and AA263-20, that showed higher levels of reporter activation, as compared to AA263 or AA263<sup>yne</sup>, with exhibiting increased potency (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B,C</xref>). Both AA263-15 and AA263-20 increased expression of the ATF6 target gene <italic>BiP</italic> at 6 h after 5 µM treatment to levels greater than that observed for AA263<sup>yne</sup> in HEK293 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>).

<title>Optimized AA263 analogs rescue the surface trafficking and function of an epilepsy-prone GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor variant</title>
<p>We next sought to investigate the potential of prioritized AA263 analogs for modulating the expression and functional activity of destabilized gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptors. GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are pentameric proteins assembled in the ER from eight subunit classes, with the most common composition being 2 α1 subunits, 2 β2/β3 subunits, and 1 γ2 subunit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> Various variants in these major subunits have been reported to impair the trafficking of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors to the plasma membrane, ultimately leading to a significant decrease in their function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> As such, GABA<sub>A</sub> variants have been widely associated with the onset and pathogenesis of numerous neurological disorders, including genetic epilepsy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> It has previously been reported that enhancement of ER proteostasis can stabilize GABA<sub>A</sub> variants and restore their surface trafficking as well as their function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> Thus, we aimed to determine if our optimized AA263 analogs could similarly rescue the surface expression and activity of a known trafficking-deficient γ2(R177G) GABA<sub>A</sub> variant, associated with complex febrile seizures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>We treated HEK293T cells stably expressing α1β2γ2(R177G) pathogenic receptors with each AA263 analog. While both AA263<sup>yne</sup> and AA263-5 increased total protein levels of γ2(R177G) (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A</xref>), only AA263<sup>yne</sup> could increase the surface expression of α1β2γ2(R177G) GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors transiently transfected in HEK293T cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Thus, the optimized compound AA263<sup>yne</sup> effectively rescues the trafficking of this GABA<sub>A</sub> variant to the cell surface. Next, we used cycloheximide (CHX) chase assays to determine the impact of AA263<sup>yne</sup> on the turnover of the γ2(R177G) variant. Compared with WT receptors, we found that the pathogenic γ2(R177G) variant displayed a faster turnover, which was slowed down by treatment with AA263<sup>yne</sup> to a similar rate compared to GABA<sub>A</sub> WT (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5B</xref>). In addition to AA263<sup>yne</sup>, both AA263-15 and AA263-20 increased the total expression levels of γ2(R177G) subunit in HEK293T cells treated with either compound (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5C</xref>). Further, treatment with these compounds increased surface expression levels of the γ2(R177G) subunit (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Together, these results show that AA263<sup>yne</sup> and optimized analogs such as AA263-20 can efficiently correct the misfolding of an epilepsy-associated GABA<sub>A</sub> variant and rescue its trafficking to the plasma membrane.</p>

<p>Finally, to determine if compound-dependent increases of α1β2γ2(R177G) receptor surface expression also translate into a rescued function of the receptor, we used whole-cell patch clamp in HEK293T cells transiently transfected with either WT GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor or the α1β2γ2(R177G) GABA<sub>A</sub> variant and recorded evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eIPSCs) by a 4-second application of 10 mM GABA. Consistent with the literature we first showed that cells expressing the epilepsy-associated γ2(R177G) variant displayed eIPSCs of significantly smaller amplitude than cells expressing WT GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C,D</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> In addition, after normalizing each cell’s amplitude by its capacitance, γ2(R177G) GABA<sub>A</sub>-containing cells had a lower peak current density when compared with WT GABA<sub>A</sub>-containing cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C,E</xref>). Importantly, treatment with AA263<sup>yne</sup> or AA263-20 in HEK293T cells transiently expressing α1β2γ2(R177G) GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors restored both eIPSC peak amplitude and peak current density to levels nearly identical to those observed in cells expressing WT GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C-E</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Herein, we define the molecular basis for AA263-dependent ER proteostasis remodeling. We show that AA263, like AA147, covalently targets a subset of ER-localized PDIs to promote activation of the adaptive ATF6 signaling arm of the UPR. Intriguingly, unlike AA147, structure-activity relationship studies showed that AA263 activity could be enhanced by altering the putative B-ring of this compound. This identified two analogs, AA263-5 and AA263<sup>yne</sup>, that exhibited enhanced selectivity and efficacy for ATF6 activation. Further optimization of the amide moiety of AA263<sup>yne</sup> afforded prioritized analogs including AA263-20 We then showed AA263<sup>yne</sup> and this prioritized analog exhibited enhanced activity relative to the parent compound AA263 in correcting ER proteostasis in cellular models of alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor channelopathies. These studies demonstrate the potential to enhance ER proteostasis remodeling activity with compound AA263 to correct proteostasis deficits in etiologically-diverse protein misfolding diseases.</p>
<p>Unlike other ER proteostasis activators, such as AA147 and AA132, AA263 does not possess the 2-amino-<italic>p</italic>-cresol moiety required for the enzymatic activation of these other compounds to a reactive quinone methide. Despite this, we show that AA263 functions through the covalent targeting of ER-localized PDIs. Salicaldehyde N-acylhydrazones can generate transient quinone-methide type species driven by tautomerization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup> This suggests that AA263 tautomerization to a quinone methide may underlie this covalent PDI targeting. Consistent with this, we show that AA263 can covalently modify proteins ex vivo in cellular lysates. However, a key question is how does AA263 show selectivity for ER PDIs independent of the localized metabolic activation afforded by other compounds such as AA147. One potential explanation is that the AA263 electrophilic species may possess differential reactivity towards a subset of proteinogenic thiols such as those in PDIs versus glutathione.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup> Regardless, these results, when combined with our analyses for AA147 and AA132<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, demonstrate how the diverse covalent engagement profiles of subtly different electrophilic species against a subset of ER proteins can elicit a spectrum of transcriptional outcomes.</p>
<p>Our findings that AA263 engages similar PDI family members and ER proteins as AA147 further underlines the importance of this family of proteins for adjusting ER proteostasis through mechanisms including activation of ER stress responsive signaling pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup> We previously showed that the relatively labeling of PDI modifications directly impacts the ability for this class of compounds to selectively activate ATF6, with more modest levels leading selective ATF6 activation while higher levels of labeling activating all three arms of the UPR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> Interestingly, our results indicate that AA263 maintains selectivity for ATF6 activation despite modifying an intermediate population of PDIs greater than those observed for the selective ATF6 activator AA147, but less than those observed for the global UPR activator AA132. This suggests that higher levels of PDI engagement than those observed with AA147 are still accessible without compromising selectivity for ATF6 activation.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, like AA147 and AA132, we show that the AA263 scaffold is amenable to modifications on the putative non-reactive B-ring. However, unlike these other compounds, medicinal chemistry efforts focused on improving AA263 activity identified analogs with improved potency and transcriptional selectivity for ATF6 activation relative to the parent compound. The improvements in transcriptional selectivity of the compounds may be attributed to the removal of the nitro group from the parent compound AA263. Nitroarene-containing compounds have been shown to affect mitochondrial function and also lead to ROS production through nitroarene metabolism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup> Thus, the crosstalk between ISR signaling and the mitochondria may explain the higher levels of PERK/ISR signaling with AA263 relative to our prioritized analogs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup> Additionally, we do observe some basal CHOP signaling with inactive AA263 analogs, exemplified by AA263-2, perhaps suggesting some inherent promiscuity of the phenylhydrazone scaffold. As a result, the identity of the B-ring electron-withdrawing group may improve the spectrum of target protein engagement in a positive manner to boost selectivity for ATF6 activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is important to note that both 2-hydroxyphenylhydrazones and 4-hydroxyphenylhydrazones have been classified as pan-assay interference compounds (PAINS), due, in part, to their reactivity towards biological nucleophiles and metal chelation properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup> However, our observation of SAR trends connecting scaffold modifications to magnitude of pathway activation indicates that this particular compound activity is perhaps independent of PAINS activity. Further, many of our negative analogs possess a functional A-ring, and thus would still be expected to possess covalent reactivity if PAINS behavior mediated the activation of stress-responsive signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup> Thus any nonspecific covalent modification, if it exists, seems to be functionally silent in this assay. Moreover, we found that these compounds showed remarkable specificity for ER-localized protein engagement, further indicating that AA263 and prioritized analogs possess other potential properties that drive specificity towards the ER, which we are continuing to pursue.</p>
<p>Optimized AA263 analogs identified herein have enhanced potential to correct ER proteostasis in two distinct cellular models of protein misfolding diseases – AAT deficiency and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor trafficking. We show that AA263 analogs reduce both intracellular and extracellular accumulation of AAT-Z aggregates and improve activity of the secreted protein, correcting both aspects of disease pathology. Further, we demonstrate that our optimized AA263 analogs enhanced trafficking, surface expression, and membrane activity of a pathogenic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor variant associated with genetic epilepsy, restoring is functional activity at the plasma membrane. AA263 and its related analogs can influence ER proteostasis in these models through different mechanisms including ATF6-dependent remodeling of ER proteostasis and direct modification of PDIs. While additional studies are required to deconvolute the relative contributions of these two mechanisms on the protection afforded by our optimized compounds, our results demonstrate the potential for these compounds to enhance ER proteostasis in the context of different protein misfolding diseases. As we and others continue expanding on this class of ER proteostasis regulators, we will further demonstrate the therapeutic utility of these compounds and identify next-generation compounds with improved potential for translation to correct ER proteostasis defects in etiologically-diverse diseases.</p>

<title>Comparative AA132 vs. AA263 Chemoproteomic Experiments</title>
<p>HEK293T cells in 10 cm plates at 80-90% confluency were treated for 6 h with vehicle (0.1% DMSO), AA132yne (10 μM), or AA263-5 (10 μM) at 37 °C. The cells were washed with PBS before harvesting with trypsin, pelleting (500 g, 5 min), and washing with PBS (1 mL). Cells pellets were resuspended in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer before sonication with a probe tip sonicator for cell lysis (15 sec, 3 sec on/2 off, 30% amplitude). For each sample, 1 g lysate (500 µL) were reacted with click reagents to give final concentrations as follows: 100 µM of diazo biotin-azide (Click Chemistry Tools, Scottsdale, AZ), 800 µM copper (II) sulfate, 1.6 mM BTTAA ligand (2-(4-((bis((1-tert-butyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methyl)amino)methyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)acetic acid) (Albert Einstein College), and 5 mM sodium ascorbate. The reaction was placed on a shaker at 1000 rpm at 30 °C for 90 The reaction was quenched with the sequential addition of cold methanol (4x volume), chloroform (1x volume), and DPBS (4x volume) to precipitate proteins. Proteins were pelleted by centrifugation (4,700 g, 10 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was discarded, and the pellets dried under air for 5 min. Protein pellets were resuspended in 6M urea in PBS (500 µL) with brief sonication. 50 µL of high-capacity streptavidin beads were washed with PBS and mixed with the protein solution in 6 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). This suspension was placed on a rotator or a shaker and agitated for 2 h. The beads were centrifuged and washed 5 times with PBS and 1% SDS. The protein was eluted from the beads by two washes of 50 mM sodium dithionite in 1% SDS for 1 h and then precipitated by chloroform/methanol precipitation as described above. 50 µL of freshly made 1:1 mixture 200 mM TCEP·HCl in DPBS and 600 mM K2CO3 in DPBS was added to each sample before incubation at 37 °C for 30 minutes while shaking. Alkylation of reduced thiols was achieved by addition of 70 µL freshly prepared 400 mM iodoacetamide in DPBS and incubation at room temperature while protected from light. The reaction was quenched by adding 130 µL of 10% SDS in DPBS and then diluted to approximately 0.2% SDS via DPBS (5.5 mL) and incubated with preequilibrated streptavidin agarose beads (3×1 mL PBS wash). The samples were rotated at room temperature for 1.5 hours, centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 2 minutes, and then washed sequentially with 5 mL 0.2% SDS in DPBS, 5 mL DPBS, and 5 mL 100 mM TEAB (Thermo Cat #90114) pH 8.5 to remove non-binding proteins. The beads were transferred to low-bind 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes and the bound proteins digested overnight at 37 °C in 200 µL 100 mM TEAB containing 2 µg sequencing grade porcine trypsin, 1 mM CaCl2, and 0.01% ProteaseMax (Promega Cat #V2071). The beads were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 minutes to separate the beads from the supernatant. 200 µL supernatant was transferred to a new tube using a gel-loading tip, and the beads were washed with 100 µL TEAB buffer. The beads were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 minutes and the supernatant combined with the previous. 120 µL acetonitrile was added to each supernatant sample before addition of 80 µL (200 µg) of TMT 10 plex (Thermo Scientific, cat #90110) reconstituted in acetonitrile. The samples were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour and vortexed occasionally. 7 µL of freshly prepared 5% hydroxylamine in water was added to each sample to quench the reaction, vortexed, and incubated for 15 minutes before quenching with addition of 5 µL MS-grade formic acid. The samples were then vacuum centrifuged to dryness. The samples were combined by redissolving the contents of one tube in 200 µL 0.1 % trifluoroacetic acid solution in water and sequential transfer to the respective multiplexed experiment until all samples were redissolved. This stepwise process was repeated with an additional 100 µL 0.1 % TFA solution for a final volume of 300 µL. The pooled samples were fractionated using the Pierce high pH Reversed-Phase Fractionation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific 84868) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The peptide fractions were eluted from the spin column with solutions of 0.1% triethylamine containing an increasing concentration of MeCN (5 - 95% MeCN; 8 fractions). Samples were dried via vacuum centrifugation, reconstituted in 50 µL 0.1% formic acid, and stored at -80 °C until ready for mass spectrometry analysis.</p>
<p>LC-MS/MS analysis was performed using a Q Exactive mass spectrometer equipped with an EASY nLC 1000 (Thermo Fisher). The digest was injected directly onto a 30 cm, 75 µm ID column packed with BEH 1.7 µm C18 resin (Waters). Samples were separated at a flow rate of 200 nl/min on a nLC 1000 (Thermo). Buffer A and B were 0.1% formic acid in water and acetonitrile, respectively. A gradient of 5–40% B over 110 min, an increase to 50% B over 10 min, an increase to 90% B over another 10 min and held at 90% B for a final 10 min of washing was used for 140 min total run time. The column was re-equilibrated with 20 µl of buffer A prior to the injection of sample. Peptides were eluted directly from the tip of the column and nanosprayed directly into the mass spectrometer by application of 2.5 kV voltage at the back of the column. The Q Exactive was operated in a data-dependent mode. Eluted peptides were scanned from 400 to 1800 m/z with a resolution of 30,000 and the mass spectrometer in a data dependent acquisition mode. The top ten peaks for each full scan were fragmented by HCD using a normalized collision energy of 30%, a 100 ms activation time, a resolution of 7500, and scanned from 100 to 1800 m/z. Dynamic exclusion parameters were 1 repeat count, 30 ms repeat duration, 500 exclusion list size, 120 s exclusion duration, and exclusion width between 0.51 and 1.51. Peptide identification and protein quantification was performed using the Integrated Proteomics Pipeline Suite (IP2, Integrated Proteomics Applications, Inc., San Diego, CA) as described previously.</p>

<p>This study reports the <bold>important</bold> development and characterization of next-generation analogs of the molecule AA263, which was previously identified for its ability to promote adaptive ER proteostasis remodeling. The evidence supporting the conclusions is <bold>convincing</bold>, with rigorous assays used to benchmark the changes in potency and efficacy of the AA263 analogs as well as AA263 targets. The ability of AA263 analogs to restore the loss of function associated with disease-associated proteins prone to misfolding will be of interest to pharmacologists, chemical biologists, and cell biologists, as well as those working on protein misfolding disorders.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study builds off prior work that focused on the molecule AA147 and its role as an activator of the ATF6 arm of the unfolded protein response. In prior manuscripts, AA147 was shown to enter the ER, covalently modify a subset of protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs), and improve ER quality control for the disease-associated mutants of AAT and GABAA. Unsuccessful attempts to improve the potency of AA147 have led the authors to characterize a second hit from the screen in this study: the phenylhydrazone compound AA263. The focus of this study on enhancing the biological activity of the AA147 molecule is compelling, and overcomes a hurdle of the prior AA147 drug that proved difficult to modify. The study successfully identifies PDIs as a shared cellular target of AA263 and its analogs. The authors infer, based on the similar target hits previously characterized for AA147, that PDI modification accounts for a mechanism of action for AA263.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors are able to establish that, like AA147, AA263 covalently targets ER PDIs. The work establishes the ability to modify the AA263 molecule to create analogs with more potency and efficacy for ATF6 activation. The &quot;next generation&quot; analogs are able to enhance the levels of functional AAT and GABAA receptors in cellular models expressing the Z-variant of AAT or an epilepsy-associated variant of the GABAA receptor, outlining the therapeutic potential for this molecule and laying the foundation for future organism-based studies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Arguably, the work does not fully support the statement provided in the abstract that the study &quot;reveals a molecular mechanism for the activation of ATF6&quot;. The identification of targets of AA263 and its analogs is clear. However, it is a presumption that the overlap in PDIs as targets of both AA263 and AA147 means that AA263 works through the PDIs. While a likely mechanism, this conclusion would be bolstered by establishing that knockdown of the PDIs lessens drug impact with respect to ATF6 activation. Alternatively, it has previously been suggested that the cell-type dependent activity of AA263 may be traced to the presence of cell-type specific P450s that allow for the metabolic activation of AA263 or cell-type specific PDIs (Plate et al 2016; Paxman et al 2018). If the PDI target profile is distinct in different cell types, and these target difference correlates with ATF6-induced activity by AA263, that would also bolster the authors' conclusion.</p>

<p>Modulating the UPR by pharmacological targeting of its sensors (or regulators) provides mostly uncharted opportunities in diseases associated with protein misfolding in the secretory pathway. Spearheaded by the Kelly and Wiseman labs, ATF6 modulators were developed in previous years that act on ER PDIs as regulators of ATF6. However, hurdles in their medicinal chemistry have hampered further development. In this study, the authors provide evidence that the small molecule AA263 also targets and covalently modifies ER PDIs, with the effect of activating ATF6. Importantly, AA263 turned out to be amenable to chemical optimization while maintaining its desired activity. Building on this, the authors show that AA263 derivatives can improve the aggregation, trafficking, and function of two disease-associated mutants of secretory pathway proteins. Together, this study provides compelling evidence for AA263 (and its derivatives) being interesting modulators of ER proteostasis. Mechanistic details of its mode of action will need more attention in future studies that can now build on this.</p>
<p>In detail, the authors provide strong evidence that AA263 covalently binds to ER PDIs, which will inhibit the protein disulfide isomerase activity. ER PDIs regulate ATF6, and thus their finding provides a mechanistic interpretation of AA263 activating the UPR. It should be noted, however, that AA263 shows broad protein labeling (Figure 1G), which may suggest additional targets, beyond the ones defined as MS hits in this study. Also, a further direct analysis of the IRE1 and PERK pathways (activated or not by AA263) would have been a benefit, as e.g., PDIA1, a target of AA263, directly regulates IRE1 (Yu et al., EMBOJ, 2020), and other PDIs also act on PERK and IRE1. The authors interpret modest activation of IRE1/PERK target genes (Figure 2C) as an effect on target gene overlap, indeed the most likely explanation based on their selective analyses on IRE1 (ERdj4) and PERK (CHOP) downstream genes, but direct activation due to the targeting of their PDI regulators is also a possible explanation. Further key findings of this paper are the observed improvement of AAT behavior and GABAA trafficking and function. Further strength to the mechanistic conclusion that ATF6 activation causes this could be obtained by using ATF6 inhibitors/knockouts in the presence of AA263 (as the target PDIs may directly modulate the behavior of AAT and/or GABAA). Along the same line, it also warrants further investigation why the different compounds, even if all were used at concentrations above their EC50, had different rescuing capacities on the clients.</p>
<p>Together, the study now provides a strong basis for such in-depth mechanistic analyses.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study aims to develop and characterize phenylhydrazone-based small molecules that selectively activate the ATF6 arm of the unfolded protein response by covalently modifying a subset of ER-resident PDIs. The authors identify AA263 as a lead scaffold and optimize its structure to generate analogs with improved potency and ATF6 selectivity, notably AA263-20. These compounds are shown to restore proteostasis and functional expression of disease-associated misfolded proteins in cellular models involving both secretory (AAT-Z) and membrane (GABAA receptor) proteins. The findings provide valuable chemical tools for modulating ER proteostasis and may serve as promising leads for therapeutic development targeting protein misfolding diseases.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The study presents a well-defined chemical biology framework integrating proteomics, transcriptomics, and disease-relevant functional assays.</p>
<p>(2) Identification and optimization of a new electrophilic scaffold (AA263) that selectively activates ATF6 represents a valuable advance in UPR-targeted pharmacology.</p>
<p>(3) SAR studies are comprehensive and logically drive the development of more potent and selective analogs such as AA263-20.</p>
<p>(4) Functional rescue is demonstrated in two mechanistically distinct disease models of protein misfolding-one involving a secretory protein and the other a membrane protein-underscoring the translational relevance of the approach.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) ATF6 activation is primarily inferred from reporter assays and transcriptional profiling; however, direct evidence of ATF6 cleavage is lacking.</p>
<p>(2) While the mechanism involving PDI modification and ATF6 activation is plausible, it remains incompletely characterized.</p>
<p>(3) No in vivo data are provided, leaving the pharmacological feasibility and bioavailability of these compounds in physiological systems unaddressed.</p>
