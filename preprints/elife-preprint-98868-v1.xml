<title>Abstract</title><sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remains a major cause of death, with limited understanding of its early risk stratification. While late-stage AMI has recognized associations with gut microbiome disturbances, the connection to eAMI is less explored.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Using metabolomics and metagenomics, we analyzed 56 samples, comprising 30 eAMI patients (within 12 hours of onset) and 26 age- and gender-matched healthy controls, to discern the influence of gut microbes and their metabolites.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>We found the eAMI plasma is dominated by increased long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs), 14 of which provide differentiating power of eAMI patients from HCs. Multiomics analysis reveals up to 70% of the variance in LCFAs of eAMI patients can be explained by altered gut microbiome. Higher-resolution profiling of gut bacterial species demonstrated that bacterial structural variations are mechanistically linked to LCFAs dysregulation. By <italic>in silico</italic> molecular docking and <italic>in vitro</italic> thrombogenic assay in isolated human platelets, we highlighted that eAMI-associated LCFAs contribute to platelet aggregation, a driving factor for AMI initiation.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>LCFAs hold significant potential as early biomarkers of AMI and gut microbiome contributes to altered LCFAs in eAMI. Further studies are imperative to expand upon these observations to better leverage LCFAs as a potential biomarker for eAMI and as a therapeutic target for inhibition of platelet aggregation in eAMI.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the most lethal type in coronary artery disease (CAD) and primary cause leading to human mortality and morbidity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>), is mainly resulted from the rupture or erosion of atherosclerotic plaque, accompanied by the formation of an occlusive or sub-occlusive thrombus in one or more coronary artery branches(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Accordingly, AMI is divided into two subtypes, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). It has been showed that systemic or local inflammation, imbalance in adaptive immune pathways can modulate atherosclerotic plaque activity and contribute to coronary dysfunction and myocardial ischemic necrosis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). However, the exact underlying mechanism responsible for the progression of coronary artery disease and occurrence of adverse event remains unclear.</p>
<p>A rising body of epidemiological study suggests that gut microbiota have a pivotal role in low-grade inflammatory metabolic diseases such as obesity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>) and diabetes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), which are considered risk factor for atherosclerotic development. Thereafter, pathological evidence indicates that bacteria from the gut or the oral cavity might translocate to and reside in atherosclerotic plaques and could affect the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Improved sequencing technology and bioinformatics analyses have provided the several significant associations between the microbiota taxa and ASCVD(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>).</p>
<p>On how gut microbiota promote to the development of ASCVD, we have summarized recent advances in the atherosclerosis-linked alterations in gut microbiome, highlighting the microbiota-related circulating metabolites that accelerate the development of ASCVD(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Microbiota-synthesized metabolites such as trimethylamine N-oxide, secondary bile acids, short-chain fatty acids, lipopolysaccharides and phenylacetylglutamine have been recognized as the important contributor to atherosclerotic consequences. Nevertheless, whether gut microbiota participate in the initiation of AMI, some observational study reported the statistical correlation between gut bacteria profiling and AMI clinical phenotype. However, results are inconsistent across previous findings(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>).</p>
<p>So far, the reported investigations on the associations between intestinal microbes and AMI recruited mostly patients in the late or stable stage of AMI, sparse report on very early phase of disease has been shown. Whether gut microbes contribute to the early stage of AMI (eAMI) lesion through its derived metabolites remains unknown. Here, we recruited a cohort of 30 patients with eAMI within 12 hours and 26 normal controls, for whom we performed metagenomic sequencing of the gut microbiome and plasma metabolomics. We found that long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) dominate the metabolome perturbations in eAMI plasma, and the gut microbiome at species level explains up to 70% of the variance in LCFAs composition in eAMI patients. We also found that eAMI-associated LCFAs may possess potent thrombogenic functionality by molecular docking and platelet aggregation assay, which furtherly supports the rational for causal relationship between altered gut microbiota and the initiation of AMI.</p>

<title>Study design and cohort description</title>
<p>This study enrolled 30 AMI patients and 26 normal controls who were hospitalized in the First Affiliated Hospital of Ningbo University from February 2021 to November 2021. Participants were in strictly conformity with the inclusion and exclusion criteria (<bold>Figure S1</bold>). The diagnosis of AMI is based on the guidelines of the American Heart Association (ACC) in 2021(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>).</p>
<p>Inclusion criteria were diagnoses of AMI defined as follows: cardiac troponin (cTn) I/T &gt; the upper limit of the 99% normal reference value and have any one or more of the following: significant chest pain of myocardial ischemia; changes in newly diagnosed ischemic electrocardiogram (ST-T changes or left bundle branch block or pathological Q wave); imaging evidence suggested new loss of myocardial activity or regional wall motion abnormalities; abnormal coronary angiography.</p>
<p>Exclusion criteria were: history of digestive diseases; severe hepatic and renal dysfunction; history of autoimmune diseases, malignant hematological diseases and tumor; infection within one month of the study or the use of antibiotic or probiotic. Normal controls were hospitalized for health examination at the same period.</p>
<p>The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of The First Affiliated Hospital of Ningbo University (No. 2021-R018-YJ01). The study was performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided written, informed consent for participation in the study.</p>

<title>Sample collection and biochemical analysis</title>
<p>Peripheral venous blood was drawn immediately after the patients arrived at the emergency department, or first moments after hospitalization for normal control individuals. Blood samples were centrifuged immediately at 4 °C, 4000 rpm for 10 minutes, and the supernatant (plasma) was stored at −80 °C for further analysis. The first morning fresh fecal (each 400-600 mg) and urine samples were collected from all the participants under the hospital diet, then placed into sterile cryotube and frozen at −80°C refrigerator before further use.</p>
<p>Whole blood samples for biochemical measurements were collected after at least 10-hour fasting period. The measurements of fasting glucose, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, c-reactive protein, serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, glutathione S-transferase, creatinine, glycated serum protein, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoproteins, lipoprotein, and serum amyloid A were performed by an autoanalyzer (AU5800, Beckmancoulter). HbA1C was measured by an automated clinical analyzer (H100plus, Lifotronic). Plasma brain natriuretic peptide level was measured by a full-automatic chemiluminescence immunoassay analyzer (Cobas e602, Roche). Plasma troponin was measured using an autoanalyzer (DXI800, Beckmancoulter). Urine samples were analyzed by urine sediment analyzer (UF-5000, Sysmex).</p>

<title>Pseudo-targeted metabolomics profiling and preprocessing</title>
<p>Metabolomic profiling was performed utilizing the CalOmics metabolomics platform at Calibra Lab, affiliated with DIAN Diagnostics. The analytical instrumentation comprised an ACQUITY 2D UPLC system (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) coupled with a Q Exactive (QE) hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, USA). Metabolites were analyzed, based on the chemical properties of the serum metabolites, utilizing both polar ionic and lipid modes.</p>
<p>Sample preparation involved the extraction of metabolites using a methanol solvent at a 1:4 ratio. Following extraction, mixtures were shaked for three minutes and subsequently subjected to centrifugation at 4000 × g for 10 minutes at 20°C to precipitate proteins. The resulting 100 μL aliquots of supernatant were transferred onto sample plates, dried under a stream of nitrogen, and reconstituted in appropriate solvents for injection into the UPLC-MS/MS system.</p>
<p>The QE mass spectrometer settings included a mass resolution of 35,000 and a scan range from 70 to 1000 m/z. For the first UPLC-MS/MS method, the instrument operated in positive electrospray ionization (ESI) mode using a C18 reverse-phase UPLC column (UPLC BEH C18, 2.1×100 mm, 1.7 μm; Waters). The mobile phases consisted of water (A) and methanol (B) with 6.5 mM ammonium bicarbonate at pH 8 for gradient elution. The third method similarly employed the C18 reverse-phase column in ESI positive mode, but used a mobile phase of water (A) and a mixture of methanol, acetonitrile, and water (B) containing 0.05% perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPA) and 0.01% formic acid (FA). In the fourth method, the system was operated in negative ESI mode with a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) column (UPLC BEH Amide, 2.1×150 mm, 1.7 μm; Waters), and the mobile phases were water (A) and acetonitrile (B) containing 10 mM ammonium formate.</p>
<p>Following the preprocessing of raw data and rigorous data quality control assessments, ion peaks were extracted employing proprietary in-house information technology hardware and software systems. Metabolites were subsequently identified through querying a bespoke library, which was compiled using pure standards sourced from commercial providers or other available channels. The identification protocol for metabolites within the samples was stringent, requiring a precise match across three specific criteria when compared to the library entries: a narrow retention index window, mass accuracy within a 10 ppm deviation, and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra that exhibit high scores in both forward and reverse searches. Quantification of each metabolite was achieved by calculating the peak area using the area-under-the-curve (AUC) method. This approach ensures accurate measurement of metabolite concentrations within the samples.</p>
<p>Before statistical analysis, raw peak areas were normalized to adjust for system fluctuation among different run days. The normalized peak areas were then log-transformed (log2) to reduce data distribution skewness and be in approximate normal distribution (Gaussian distribution). Missing values in peak area matrix were imputed by using the minimal detection value of a metabolite among all tested samples.</p>

<title>DNA extraction and library construction of fecal samples</title>
<p>Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was extracted from fecal samples utilizing the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method. Control samples included unused swabs which were processed identically through the DNA extraction protocol to ensure absence of DNA amplification products. The resultant DNA was eluted in 50 µl of elution buffer, following a modified protocol provided by QIAGEN, and preserved at −80°C for subsequent analyses.</p>
<p>For polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, the samples were processed at LC-BIO Technologies Co., Hangzhou, China. The construction of the DNA library was accomplished using the TruSeq Nano DNA LT Library Preparation Kit (FC-121-4001). Fragmentation of the DNA was performed using dsDNA Fragmentase (NEB, M0348S) at 37°C for 30 minutes. This step produced blunt-ended DNA fragments via a combination of fill-in reactions and exonuclease activity.

<p>To prepare the DNA fragments for adapter ligation, an adenine (A) base was added to the blunt ends of each strand. Each adapter, designed with a thymine (T) base overhang, facilitates the ligation to the A-tailed DNA fragments. These adapters are crucial as they contain necessary sites for the hybridization of sequencing primers, enabling single, paired-end, and indexed sequencing reads.</p>
<p>Ligation involved either single or dual index adapters, and the products were subsequently amplified via PCR. The amplification parameters included an initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 minutes, followed by 8 cycles of denaturation at 98°C for 15 seconds, annealing at 60°C for 15 seconds, extension at 72°C for 30 seconds, and a final extension at 72°C for 5 minutes. This process prepares the library for high-throughput sequencing analyses.</p>

<title>Metagenomic sequencing data processing</title>
<p>Raw sequencing data were processed to generate clean reads suitable for downstream analyses. Initially, sequencing adapters were excised from the reads using Cutadapt (version 1.9). Subsequently, low-quality reads were trimmed using fqtrim (version 0.94), which employs a sliding-window algorithm. Reads were then aligned to the host genome using Bowtie2 (version 2.2.0) to eliminate host-derived sequences. Following the quality filtering, the remaining reads were assembled de novo using IDBA-UD (version 1.1.1) to construct individual metagenomes for each sample. Predictions of coding regions (CDS) within the metagenomic contigs were performed by MetaGeneMark (version 3.26). The CDS sequences across all samples were clustered using CD-HIT (version 4.6.1) to generate a set of unigenes. Unigene abundance in each sample was estimated using transcripts per million (TPM) based on read alignment performed again with Bowtie2 (version 2.2.0). Taxonomic classification of the unigenes was achieved by aligning them to the NCBI non-redundant (NR) database using DIAMOND (version 0.9.14). The taxonomic annotations and abundance profiles of these unigenes were utilized to conduct differential analysis at both taxonomic and gene-specific levels. Enterotypes profiling was performed using pipeline as previously demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Phage-inclusive metagenomics profiling was conducted with Phanta.</p>

<title>Molecular docking simulation</title>
<p>The crystal structures of several human receptors were obtained from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/">https://www.rcsb.org/</ext-link>). These include the free fatty acid receptor 1 (GPR40, PDB ID: 5TZY), the thromboxane A2 receptor (TXA2, PDB ID: 6IIV), and the P2Y purinoceptors 1 and 12 (PDB IDs: 4XNW and 7PP1, respectively). Subsequent to download, water molecules and co-crystallized ligands were removed from the .pdb files to prepare the proteins for molecular docking studies. For the docking simulations, the receptor structures were prepared by adding polar hydrogen atoms and computing partial charges using the Kollman and Gasteiger methods. These modifications were performed using AutoDock Tools (version 1.5.638). The prepared structures of both ligands and receptors were then saved in .pdbqt format, facilitating their use in subsequent molecular docking procedures. The molecular docking studies were performed using the open-source software AutoDock Vina (version 1.1.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>) investigate the interactions between AMI-associated long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) and selected receptors involved in platelet aggregation.

The three-dimensional interactions between the selected receptors and long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) were analyzed and visualized using the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System (version 2.5.0), an open-source platform.

<p>Thereafter, we divided our cohort into a training group (comprising 70% of the subjects) and a test set (comprising 30% of the subjects) to identify diagnostic biomarkers for differentiating HC and patients with eAMI.

<p>To furtherly understand if gut microbiome is involved in the regulation of LCFAs during the onset of eAMI, we performed a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model to compute the variance in each of the detected LCFAs that can be explained by gut microbiome. Intriguingly, gut microbiome at species level explains up to 70% of the variance in LCFAs composition in this cohort (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>).

As a non-ignorable example, FFA 19:1 (n-9), as a non-omega-6 LCFA, also causes strong thrombosis in human platelet (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6d</xref>), while the mechanistic understanding behind this finding remains unknown. Our results imply suggest that eAMI-associated LCFAs may possess potent thrombogenic functionality, making it fair to assume that they play a significant role in host cardiometabolic health.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The factors triggering the onset of AMI and the precise indicators of eAMI remain unclear. However, the application of plasma metabolomics provides valuable insights into the search for accurate diagnostic markers for complex conditions such as AMI. Additionally, comprehensive multi-omics profiling plays a crucial role in unraveling the underlying mechanisms responsible for AMI. Together, these approaches shed light on both diagnostic advancements and a deeper dissection disentangling the complexity of eAMI.</p>
<p>By plasma metabolomics profiling, we found that in patients with eAMI, there was a remarkable increase in 28 LCFAs dominating the altered eAMI metabolome. These LCFAs encompassed a variety of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated types. When investigating the etiology of LCFA dysmetabolism in eAMI, we initially examined its correlation with conventional AMI risk factors including age, sex, body mass index, and potentially diabetes. However, these factors alone could only explain a maximum of 10% of the variation observed in LCFA proportions. This raises the question of what accounts for the remaining 90% of LCFA variation. To this end, we turned our attention to profiling the gut microbiota, as it is widely recognized for its potential role in regulating the metabolome. The LASSO regression model allows us to examine various factors influencing LCFA composition and reveals gut microbiome at the species level accounted for up to 70% of the observed variance in the composition of LCFAs. This finding suggests a significant association between the gut microbiome and the alterations in LCFA levels.</p>
<p>To gain mechanistic insights behind the gut microbiome-LCFA interactions, we associated bacterial SVs with LCFAs and observed significant relations. Of specific interest is a 3-kbp deletion (<italic>A. shahii</italic>: 575-578) representing <italic>FabG</italic> gene, a key enzyme in reduction step of elongation cycle in fatty acid biosynthesis, which is more prevalent in eAMI gut microbiome, resulting in a relatively higher plasma FFA 22:4 and FFA 14:1 in eAMI patients. Others have already reported the increase of intracolonic saturated LCFAs positively associated with elevated abundances of <italic>Prevotella, Lactobacillus</italic>, and <italic>Alistipes</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Additionally, the presence of <italic>A. shahii</italic> was also shown to strengthen the positive associations of red meat intake with trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) concentrations levels(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>), while increased TMAO levels enhances platelet hyperreactivity and thrombosis risk(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>), and is associated with an increased risk of incident major adverse cardiovascular events(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). These findings support that in addition to short-chain fatty acids – which are known gut microbial products – disturbances in the gut microbiota also contribute significantly to the variation in plasma LCFAs during eAMI.</p>
<p>Indeed, the question arises whether the elevated levels of LCFA in eAMI are merely a marker or if they hold pathophysiological significance. Considering that platelet activation is a distinct pathophysiological characteristic of eAMI, we sought to explore the impact of eAMI-associated LCFA on circulating platelet activation. As expected, we found a majority of omega-6 LCFAs rather than omega-3 LCFAs dose-dependently stimulate platelet aggregation. A role for omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) supplementation to achieve cardioprotective effects has also been shown by attenuating platelet function(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>), aligning with our findings. To date, there is limited conclusive evidence regarding the effect of LCFAs on platelet activation, except for arachidonic acid (FFA 20:4 (n-6)), a well-known LCFA that activates platelets. However, our study has yielded intriguing results. We have discovered that both FFA 19:1 (n-9) (also known as 10-nonadecenoic acid, HMDB0013622) and FFA 22:4 (n-6) (Adrenic acid, HMDB0002226) can significantly induce human platelet aggregation to a similar degree as arachidonic acid (FFA 20:4 (n-6), see <bold>Figure S6</bold>). Notably, FFA 22:4 (n-6) can be synthesized from arachidonic acid (FFA 20:4 (n-6)), which, in turn, can be elongated from FFA 18:2 (n-6), also known as linoleic acid. These conversions and interactions among omega-6 PUFAs provide a potential mechanism for their role in activating platelets.</p>
<p>Consistent with previous reports(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>), the outcome of our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments supports many eAMI-associated LCFAs, especially omega-6 PUFAs can promote platelet aggregation even in normal physiological concentration (1-5 mM). However, lots of epidemiological investigation has found higher intakes of omega-6 PUFA appear to be safe and may be even more beneficial, hence the AHA supports an omega-6 PUFA intake of at least 5% to 10% of energy for dietary recommendations of coronary heart disease(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). In another prospective analyses, higher <italic>in vivo</italic> circulating and tissue levels of LA and possibly AA were associated with lower risk of major cardiovascular events(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Intriguingly, omega-6 PUFA, dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (FFA 20:3 (n-6)) has been shown to play a role in inhibiting platelet aggregation ex vivo, via COX-1–derived prostanoid metabolites(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Therefore, it still has the overwhelming controversial data on potential effects of omega-6 PUFAs on platelet function.</p>
<p>While our study offered valuable multi-omics insights into a cohort of patients with eAMI, uncovering the association between gut dysbiosis and plasma metabolomic perturbations characterized by the notable enrichment of LCFAs, it is important to acknowledge certain limitations in our present study. Firstly, we propose that intestinal microbial disturbances are significantly associated with fatty acid dysmetabolism based on cross-sectional correlation analysis. However, the causal relationship between gut microbiota dysbiosis and altered FA metabolism remains unclear and requires confirmation in prospective cohorts. Secondly, while platelet activation is a characteristic feature of eAMI, the specific <italic>in vivo</italic> role of LCFAs is still not well understood, and there is ongoing debate regarding the effect of ω-6 LCFAs on platelet function. Thirdly, we still don’t know the direct or indirect effect of gut microbiota dysbiosis on platelet activation, as well the underlying mechanism responsible for it, despite there is report on TMAO(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>) and phenylacetylglutamine(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>) contributing to platelet hyperreactivity and enhanced thrombosis potential. Fourthly, although all participants followed a standardized in-hospital diet and stool samples were collected shortly after hospitalization, the potential influence of pre-hospital diet on intestinal microbiome and plasma metabolome profiling, as well as their interaction, cannot be completely ruled out. Finally, due to the limitations of sample size and the specific population background included in this study, the conclusions drawn from our findings should be furtherly validated through large-scale, prospective studies involving diverse regional populations.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors aimed to identify potential biomarkers for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) through blood metabolomics and fecal microbiome analysis. They found that long chain fatty acids (LCFAs) could serve as biomarkers for AMI and demonstrated a correlation between LCFAs and the gut microbiome. Additionally, in silico molecular docking and in vitro thrombogenic assays showed that these LCFAs can induce platelet aggregation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study utilized a comprehensive approach combining blood metabolomics and fecal microbiome analysis.</p>
<p>The findings suggest a novel use of LCFAs as biomarkers for AMI.</p>
<p>The correlation between LCFAs and the gut microbiome is a significant contribution to understanding the interplay between gut health and heart disease.</p>
<p>The use of in silico and in vitro assays provides mechanistic insights into how LCFAs may influence platelet aggregation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The evidence is incomplete as it does not definitively prove that gut dysbiosis contributes to fatty acid dysmetabolism.</p>
<p>The study primarily shows an association between the gut microbiome and fatty acid metabolism without establishing causation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Fan et al. investigated the relationship between early acute myocardial infarction (eAMI) and disturbances in the gut microbiome using metabolomics and metagenomics analyses. They studied 30 eAMI patients and 26 healthy controls, finding elevated levels of long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) in the plasma of eAMI patients.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The research attributed a substantial portion of LCFA variance in eAMI to changes in the gut microbiome, as indicated by omics analyses. Computational profiling of gut bacteria suggested structural variations linked to LCFA variance. The authors also conducted molecular docking simulations and platelet assays, revealing that eAMI-associated LCFAs may enhance platelet aggregation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The results should be validated using different assays, and animal models should be considered to explore the mechanisms of action.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this reviewer’s insightful comment regarding the causal relationship between gut dysbiosis and fatty acid dysmetabolism. We acknowledge that our study primarily demonstrates a strong association rather than causation. While establishing causality was beyond the scope of the current study, we recognize the importance of addressing this point. In our revised manuscript, we will emphasize the observational nature of our findings and discuss the need for future research, including longitudinal studies and interventional trials, to explore the causal links between gut dysbiosis and fatty acid dysmetabolism. We believe that this clarification strengthens the interpretation of our results and aligns with the reviewer's concern.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The study primarily shows an association between the gut microbiome and fatty acid metabolism without establishing causation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that our study presents an association rather than definitive proof of causation between the gut microbiome and fatty acid metabolism. To address this, we plan to expand the discussion section to more clearly outline the limitations of our study in establishing causality. We will also propose future research directions, such as the use of animal models and longitudinal human studies, which could help elucidate the causal pathways. By clarifying this aspect, we aim to provide a more balanced perspective on our findings.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to validate our findings using additional assays and animal models. We agree that further validation is crucial to confirm the robustness of our results and to explore the underlying mechanisms in greater detail. While our current study focused on human subjects and in vitro assays to establish initial findings, we acknowledge that additional experimental approaches are necessary. In the revised manuscript, we plan to include a discussion on the potential use of different assays (e.g., advanced metabolomics techniques, multi-omics integration) and animal models to validate and expand upon our findings. Moreover, we are planning to undertake these experiments in future studies to build upon the foundational work presented here.</p>
<p>We believe that our revised responses and the planned manuscript revisions will address the reviewers’ concerns effectively. We are confident that these changes will enhance the overall contribution of our study to the field. Thank you again for your valuable feedback.</p>
