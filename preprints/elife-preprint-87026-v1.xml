<title>Introductory Paragraph / Abstract</title>
<p>The bloodstream represents a hostile environment that bacteria must overcome to cause bacteraemia. To understand how the major human pathogen <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> manages this we have utilised a functional genomics approach to identify a number of new loci that affect the ability of the bacteria to survive exposure to serum, the critical first step in the development of bacteraemia. The expression of one of these genes, <italic>tcaA</italic>, was found to be induced upon exposure to serum, and we show that it is involved in the elaboration of a critical virulence factor, the wall teichoic acids (WTA), within the cell envelope. The activity of this protein alters the sensitivity of the bacteria to cell wall attacking agents, including antimicrobial peptides, human defence fatty acids, and several antibiotics. This protein also affects the autolytic activity and lysostaphin sensitivity of the bacteria, suggesting that in addition to changing WTA abundance in the cell envelope, it also plays a role in peptidoglycan crosslinking. With TcaA rendering the bacteria more susceptible to serum killing, while simultaneously increasing the abundance of WTA in the cell envelope, it was unclear what effect this protein may have during infection. To explore this, we examined human data and performed murine experimental infections. Collectively, our data suggests that whilst mutations in <italic>tcaA</italic> are selected for during bacteraemia, this protein positively contributes to the virulence of <italic>S. aureus</italic> through its involvement in altering the cell wall architecture of the bacteria, a process that appears to play a key role in the development of bacteraemia.</p>

<title>Main Text</title>
<p><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> is an important human pathogen and a significant global health concern<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. The most common interaction with its human host is as an asymptomatic coloniser; however, it frequently transitions to a pathogenic state with the ability to cause a wide range of diseases, ranging from relatively minor skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) to more life-threatening incidents of endocarditis or bacteraemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. <italic>S. aureus</italic> is notorious for producing a plethora of virulence factors ranging from pore forming toxins to various immune evasion strategies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. The toxicity of <italic>S. aureus</italic> is generally accepted as playing an important role during infection, with high toxicity isolates typically causing more severe symptoms and disease progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. However, for the more invasive diseases such as bacteraemia and pneumonia, it has been shown that the causative isolates are often impaired in their toxin production and instead rely on alternative virulence approaches to cause disease, such as being able to better survive exposure to host immune defences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>As the most severe type of infection caused by <italic>S. aureus</italic>, bacteraemia has a mortality rate of between 20 and 30%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, and despite infection control measures that have reduced the incidence of MRSA bacteraemia, the incidence of MSSA bacteraemia continues to increase in several countries, suggesting we have much to learn about this disease process. Entry into the bloodstream is the first step in the development of bacteraemia and represents a major bottle neck for the bacteria, whether they seed from an infection elsewhere in the body, or take a more direct route through an intravenous device. As a heavily protected niche, the bloodstream contains numerous humoral immune features with potent anti-staphylococcal activity, including antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and host defence fatty acids (HDFAs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. However, the fact that cases of <italic>S. aureus</italic> bacteraemia occur demonstrates that these do not represent an impregnable force and that the bacteria can adapt to resist these defensive features.</p>
<p>In previous work we have pioneered the application of genome wide association studies (GWAS) to characterise bacterial virulence, where it has proven to be a powerful approach to define complex regulatory pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. In related work we have also begun to characterise a new category of <italic>S. aureus</italic> genes we refer to as MALs (mortality associated loci) and found that many of these are involved in serum survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Given the outstanding research questions surrounding the development of bacteraemia we performed a GWAS on a collection of 300 clinical isolates with respect to serum resistance. We found significant variability in how well individual isolates survive exposure to serum and identified seven novel effectors of this activity. Of particular note was the TcaA protein, which we have further characterised and demonstrate that it is a critical protein for the bacteria involved in the remodelling of the bacterial cell wall during the development of bacteraemia.</p>

<title>Survival of S. aureus upon exposure to human serum is a variable trait</title>
<p>The human bloodstream is a highly protected niche, and so to establish an infection in this environment the bacteria must evade many aspects of host immunity, such as the bacterial membrane damaging antimicrobial peptides (AMP) and host defence fatty acids (HDFAs) found in serum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. To examine the level of variability that exists in serum-susceptibility in natural populations of <italic>S. aureus</italic>, we exposed 300 clinical isolates to pooled human serum and quantified the proportion of each culture that survived. These 300 isolates represent the two major clones, as defined by multi-locus sequence typing: clonal complex 22 (CC22) and clonal complex 30 (CC30), that are responsible for the majority of MRSA cases in the UK and Ireland<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. This collection is a unique resource as each strain has been sequenced, extensively phenotyped, and we have clinical metadata for many of the patients the bacteria were isolated from<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. We found there to be similar levels of variability in the ability of the bacteria to survive exposure to human serum across the two CCs, both with a &gt;10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> fold difference between the most and least susceptible isolate with respect to the number of bacteria that survived (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1a</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">b</xref>).</p>

<title>Survival of S. aureus upon exposure to human serum is a polygenic trait</title>
<p>As the genome sequence for each of the 300 clinical <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates was available we performed a GWAS (genome wide association study) to identify polymorphic loci or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that associated with the level of susceptibility of isolates to serum. For this, the data from the two distinct clones were analysed independently, with population structure within the clones being accounted for (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1c</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">d</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables 1a</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1b</xref>). We applied both uncorrected and corrected (for multiple comparisons) significance thresholds to this analysis, as our previous work has demonstrated that the stringency of multiple correction approaches increases the likelihood of type II errors (i.e. false negative results). For the CC22 collection 12 loci were associated with serum survival and for the CC30s there were 32 associated loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1c</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">d</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables 1a</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1b</xref>).</p>

<title>The SNPs in the tcaA gene of the clinical isolates are associated with decreased serum sensitivity</title>
<p>The <italic>tcaA</italic> gene has previously been reported to be involved in conferring increased sensitivity to the antibiotic teicoplanin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, and our findings suggest it also confers increased sensitivity to serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a</xref>). To visualise the signal detected by the GWAS for this gene we have mapped the position of the clinical isolates with the <italic>tcaA</italic> SNPs onto a figure displaying the range of serum sensitivities of the collection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3a</xref>). The majority of the isolates with the SNPs were less sensitive to serum, suggesting the SNPs negatively affects the activity of the protein. The most common SNP in the <italic>tcaA</italic> gene amongst the clinical isolates conferred a Phe (290) to Ser change in the protein sequence. Using AlphaFold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> we generated a structure for TcaA where it is predicted to be membrane bound with a single membrane spanning domain; to have a zinc finger presented intracellularly; with the majority of the protein including the Phe290 displayed extracellularly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Given that phenylalanines are frequently involved in protein-protein interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> we examined the effect this change has on the activity of TcaA by cloning the <italic>tcaA</italic> gene with this SNP into the complementing pRMC2 plasmid and comparing its ability to confer serum resistance relative to that of the <italic>tcaA</italic> gene without the SNP. The TcaA protein with Ser at position 290 instead of Phe were slightly more resistant to serum killing, but not as affected as when the entire protein was inactivated, suggesting this change has a subtle effect on the serum sensitising activity of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3c</xref>).</p>

<title>TcaA confers increased sensitivity to multiple antibacterial components of serum</title>
<p>To examine whether the effect of TcaA on serum resistance was specific to the JE2 background we transduced the <italic>tcaA::tn</italic> mutation from JE2 into <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains SH1000 and Newman. Attempts were made to transduce this mutation into a clinical CC22 isolate, but this lineage was refractory to any of the available transducing phage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. In all three backgrounds TcaA increased the sensitivity of the bacteria to serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4a</xref>) verifying that the effect was not limited to the JE2 background. To determine which aspects of human serum TcaA was conferring increased sensitivity to, we measured the relative ability of the wild type and mutant to survive exposure to some of the anti-bacterial factors found in serum: to the HDFA arachidonic acid, and to two AMPs: HNP-1 and LL37. The strains producing TcaA (i.e. the WT and complemented strain) were more sensitive to all three components of human serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4b-d</xref>). For the AMPs this sensitivity was significant after only 90 min exposure, whereas for arachidonic acid sensitivity was also evident after 90 minute, but was more prominent after overnight incubation.</p>

<p>Although none of the individual antibacterial components of serum tested here are involved in <italic>S. aureus</italic> cell clumping, it is a possibility that some of the effects seen in serum is as a result of this activity, artificially amplifying the effect. To examine this the wild type and <italic>tcaA</italic> mutant were visually examined by microscopy in both PBS and serum where no differences in clumping was observed (Supplementary Fig. 1). Of the other GWAS identified genes, the <italic>ilvC</italic> mutant was less sensitive to arachidonic acid, the <italic>yfhO</italic> mutant was more resistant to HNP-1 and LL-37, while the <italic>tarK, gntK, arsB and phdD</italic> mutants were all more sensitive to HNP-1 and LL37 when compared to the JE2 wild type strain (Supplementary Fig. 2).</p>

<title>Wall teichoic acids contribute to the arachidonic acid sensitivity of TcaA producing strains</title>
<p>The antibacterial properties of HDFAs and AMPs share some common features in that they both penetrate through the cell wall and attack the bacterial membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. AMPs are positively charged molecules that rely on the relatively negative charge across the bacterial cell envelope to penetrate, and thus resistance is frequently acquired by changing the charge across the cell wall such that the AMPs are repelled<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Less is known about how HDFAs penetrate the cell wall; however, resistance is associated with changes in the abundance of wall teichoic acids (WTA) in the bacterial cell walls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. WTA are hydrophilic and when present in the cell wall they are believed to be protective by interfering with the penetration of the hydrophobic HDFAs through to the bacterial membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. It has also been shown that when the ligation of WTA to the cell wall is affected, such that they are instead released into the environment, this also decreases the sensitivity of the bacteria to HDFAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. With distinct modes of action and means of accessing their target, it is intriguing to consider how TcaA may be contributing to increasing the sensitivity of <italic>S. aureus</italic> to both these types of anti-bacterial molecules.</p>
<p>To examine whether the TcaA associated increase in sensitivity to arachidonic acid is a result of an increase in the abundance of WTA in the bacterial cell we extracted and quantified WTA from the wild type and <italic>tcaA</italic> mutant, where we found that the cell wall of the wild type had significantly more WTA when compared to the <italic>tcaA</italic> mutant cell extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5a</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">b</xref>; densitometric analysis of triplicate extractions can be seen in Supp. Fig. 3). We next quantified WTA in the bacterial supernatant, as recent work on a <italic>S. aureus lcpA</italic> mutant demonstrated that another WTA related means of altering sensitivity to arachidonic acid is to release the WTA the bacteria surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. We found significantly less WTA in the extract of the TcaA producing wild type strain compared to that of the <italic>tcaA</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5a</xref>; densitometric analysis of triplicate extractions can be seen in Supp. Fig. 3), which could explain the observed difference in sensitivity to HDFAs. It was unclear from the previous work on LcpA how the released WTA by the <italic>lcpA</italic> mutant affects arachidonic acid sensitivity, and here we demonstrate that this mutant, like the <italic>tcaA</italic> mutant, is also less sensitive to human serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5d</xref>). One hypothesis is that the WTA can either sequester or inactivate HDFAs in the environment surrounding the bacteria, thereby neutralising them. To test this, we harvested the supernatant of the wild type JE2, the JE2 <italic>tcaA</italic> mutant, and the JE2 <italic>lcpA</italic> mutant from overnight growth. These supernatants were used to supplement fresh broth (at 10%) into which the wild type JE2 strain was inoculated. In the absence of any arachidonic acid JE2 grew equally well regardless of the supernatant supplement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5e</xref>). However, in the presence of the supernatant of both the <italic>tcaA</italic> and <italic>lcpA</italic> mutant (both of which contain an abundance of released WTA), JE2 was able to grow in the presence of arachidonic acid; whereas when the JE2 supernatant was used as the supplement the bacteria were unable to grow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5e</xref>). To further verify that soluble WTA can neutralise arachidonic we performed WTA extractions from an isogenic wild type and mutant of the <italic>S. aureus</italic> strain LAC where the mutant has had the <italic>tarO</italic> gene deleted and consequently does not produce any WTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5e</xref>). The incorporation of the wild type LAC WTA extract to broth at 2% created an environment in which JE2 could grow in the presence of arachidonic acid, whereas the equivalent WTA extract of the <italic>tarO</italic> mutant, which contains no WTA, did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6e</xref>). Together these data demonstrate that WTA in the environment can neutralise arachidonic acid, and this provides a likely explanation for the increased sensitivity to HDFAs associated with TcaA production.</p>

<title>The reduced abundance of WTA in the bacterial cell wall contributes to the resistance of S. aureus to AMPs</title>
<p>In additional to being hydrophilic, WTA is also predominantly negatively charged<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Given that a change in charge across the bacterial cell wall is frequently associated with resistance to AMPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, and that the wild type strain has more WTA in its cell wall, this may explain the increased AMP sensitivity of the TcaA producing strain. To examine this, we incubated the bacteria with cytochrome C, which is positively charged and through its electrostatic-related ability binds to the bacterial cells, providing a measure of the charge across bacterial cell walls. Using this we found that the wild type strain bound significantly more cytochrome C and is therefore more negatively charged than the <italic>tcaA</italic> mutant, which explains the increase in AMP sensitivity we have found associated with TcaA production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5e</xref>). Together these results explain how TcaA production affects the sensitivity of <italic>S. aureus</italic> to both HDFAs and AMPs. By retaining WTA within the cell wall, there is less released to sequester or inactivate the fatty acids from the environment, and due to their negative charge, increased amounts of WTA in the cell wall affects the charge across the cell wall and results in increased electrostatic attraction of the positively charged AMPs.</p>

<sec id="s2h">
<title>Serum induced tcaA expression increases both the abundance of WTA in the cell wall and the sensitivity S. aureus to teicoplanin</title>
<p>As mentioned previously, an additional interesting feature of the TcaA protein is that is has also been associated with changing the sensitivity of the bacteria to the antibiotic teicoplanin, although this has been reported to vary between strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. To examine this for our strains we compared the ability of our three pairs of wild type and <italic>tcaA</italic> mutants (in strains JE2, Newman and SH1000) to grow in the minimum inhibitory concentration of teicoplanin for each wild type strain (Supp. Table 2), where TcaA production resulted in increased sensitivity to this antibiotic across all three strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6a</xref>). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for teicoplanin have also been determined for these, where in each case the production of TcaA halves the MIC of the antibiotic (Supp. Table 2). To examine whether the clinical isolates with the SNPs in the <italic>tcaA</italic> gene associated with increased serum resistance also had altered teicoplanin sensitivity, we compared the ability of 12 clinical isolates containing the GWAS identified <italic>tcaA</italic> SNPs to grow in teicoplanin to that of 12 isolates from the same collection with the wild type gene sequence, i.e., without the polymorphism. The isolates with the polymorphism in the <italic>tcaA</italic> gene were on average less sensitive to teicoplanin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6b</xref>). Using the pRMC2 complementing plasmid expressing either the wild type or SNP (conferring the Phe290-Ser substitution) containing <italic>tcaA</italic> gene, we demonstrated that this mutation significantly reduces the ability of the protein to sensitize the bacteria to serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6c</xref>), confirming that this mutation negatively affects the activity of the TcaA protein.</p>
<p>As TcaA has been shown to be upregulated when exposed to teicoplanin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, we examined whether serum would also induce its expression. The wild type JE2 strain was exposed to either sub-inhibitory (2.5% serum and 0.5μg/ml teicoplanin) or inhibitory (10% serum and 10μg/ml teicoplanin) concentrations of either serum or teicoplanin for 20 mins, total RNA was extracted and the transcription of the <italic>tcaA</italic> gene quantified by qRT-PCR. For both serum and teicoplanin, induction of expression of the <italic>tcaA</italic> gene was concentration dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6d</xref>). Given the association of WTA abundance in the cell wall with <italic>tcaA</italic> expression described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5a-c</xref>) we next examined whether serum induced expression of <italic>tcaA</italic> would also result in an increase in abundance of WTA in the bacteria cell wall. Both the wild type and <italic>tcaA</italic> mutant were exposed to inhibitory concentrations of human serum for 90 mins and the WTA extracted from the cell walls, where serum exposure resulted in an increase in WTA for the wild type strain but not the <italic>tcaA</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6e</xref>; densitometric analysis of triplicate extractions can be found in Supp Fig. 3). To examine whether serum induced increased expression of <italic>tcaA</italic> would affect sensitivity to teicoplanin, we exposed the wild type bacteria to a sub-inhibitory concentrations of serum (2.5%) and then incubated these overnight in a subinhibitory concentration of teicoplanin (0.5μg/ml). Pre-exposure to serum induced increased sensitivity to teicoplanin suggesting that induction of <italic>tcaA</italic> expression by the initial serum exposure was sufficient to induce cross-sensitivity to the antibiotic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6f</xref>).</p>
<p>To verify this induction effect was not specific to the JE2 lineage a <italic>tcaA::gfp</italic> reporter plasmid was constructed and electroporated into JE2, SH1000, Newman and a clinical CC22 isolate EMRSA15. In each background serum, arachidonic acid and LL37 had a dose dependent effect on <italic>tcaA</italic> expression with the exception of LL37 and the EMRSA15 strain (Supplementary. Fig. 4). These findings suggest that upon entry into the bloodstream and exposure to many of the antibacterial components of serum, expression of the <italic>tcaA</italic> gene is induced and this sensitizes <italic>S. aureus</italic> to killing by these components of serum.</p>
<p><italic>The inactivation of</italic> tcaA <italic>alters the antibiotic resistance profile of S. aureus</italic>. There is emerging evidence that WTA play a role in cell division and peptidoglycan biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. In support of this, it has been reported that a <italic>tarO</italic> mutant, devoid of WTA, confers sensitization to β-lactam antibiotics due to mislocalization of the PBPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. As the target for teicoplanin is peptidoglycan, more specifically the terminal D-Ala-D-Ala residue of lipid II, we hypothesised that the increased ligation of WTA into the cell wall of the TcaA producing strain may affect peptidoglycan biosynthesis and assembly, and that this may be responsible for the change in sensitivity to teicoplanin. To test this further, we compared the sensitivity of the wild type and mutant to a range of peptidoglycan attacking antibiotics, where we found the TcaA producing wild type strain to be more sensitive to vancomycin, dalbavancin and oritavancin, all alternative members of the glycopeptide class of antibiotic, and ramoplanin, a glycolipodepsipeptide antibiotic (Supp. Fig. 5). However, TcaA production conferred decreased sensitivity to oxacillin, a β-lactam antibiotic that targets penicillin binding protein 2 and moenomycin a phosphoglycolipid antibiotic that inhibits the transglycosylase PBP enzymes and prevents the formation of peptidoglycan polymers (Supp. Fig. 5). This suggests that TcaA production affects the overall composition and structure of peptidoglycan in the wildtype strain.</p>
<p>To examine whether the crosslinking of peptidoglycan is affected by TcaA production, we tested the susceptibility of the wild type and <italic>tcaA</italic> mutant to lysostaphin, which is a glycylglycine endopeptidase capable of cleaving the pentaglycine crosslinks of peptidoglycan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. We found that lysostaphin cleaved the cell wall of the wild type strain more slowly than for the <italic>tca</italic>A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7a</xref>). We next performed a triton X100 induced autolysis assay where the wild type exhibited a slower rate of autolysis compared to the mutant, suggesting that the cell wall is stronger when TcaA is produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7b</xref>). Together these data suggest that the integrity of the peptidoglycan, in particular its crosslinking, is significantly altered when TcaA is produced. This provides a likely explanation for why the mutant is more resistant to teicoplanin, reduced crosslinking in the cell wall increases the number of off target D-ala D-ala which teicoplanin will bind to instead of reaching lipid II in the membrane and causing disruption to this. With changes to the quantity and composition of WTA and peptidoglycan associated with TcaA production, we sought to visualise the cell wall using transmission electron microscopy. We observed a clear difference in the density and structure of the outer layer of the bacterial cell wall between the wild type and <italic>tcaA</italic> mutant, confirming a role for TcaA in the structural integrity of the <italic>S. aureus</italic> cell wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7c</xref>, additional images in Supp. Fig. 6)).</p>

<title>Once established, TcaA contributes positively to the development of bacteraemia</title>
<p>Our data shows that expression of <italic>tcaA</italic> is induced upon exposure to serum, that this can sensitize the bacteria to serum killing but also increase the abundance of WTA in the cell envelope. From a pathogenicity perspective these activities would appear to be in conflict, with one making it less likely for a bacterium to cause bacteraemia (increased serum sensitivity) and the other making it more likely for a bacterium to cause bacteraemia (increased WTA in the cell envelope<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>). To understand this apparent dichotomy we first examined whether TcaA production only affected survival in serum, whereas in whole blood where other components of the human immune system may be present (e.g. complement, antibodies and phagocytes) that this effect may be lost. Using human blood from three donors, we demonstrated that TcaA production increase the sensitivity of the bacteria to whole blood killing (Supp. Fig. 7). We next interrogated our human clinical data, where in addition to the 300 bacteraemia strains that form the basis of this study we have an additional 176 <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates, which has allowed us to include more genetic diversity to this analysis (i.e. from CC22 (n=138), CC30 (n=162), ST8 (n=132) and ST93 (n=44)). The source of these isolates was also available to us (i.e. bacteraemia (n=341), SSTI (n=80) or carriage (n=55)), as well as their genome sequences (Supplementary Table 1). We examined the distribution of nonsynonymous mutations in the <italic>tcaA</italic> gene across these, where it was present in 6% of the bacteraemia isolates compared with only 1.5% of non-bacteraemia isolates (n= 21/341 and 2/135 respectively; p = 0.03, in a Fisher’s Exact test). However, when we examined the 30-day mortality rates for the 113 bacteraemia patients for whom we had this clinical data, the mortality rate of the proportion of patients infected with a <italic>S. aureus</italic> strain with the wild type <italic>tcaA</italic> gene was significantly higher compared to those infected with a mutated <italic>tcaA</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8a</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">b</xref>) (2-tailed chi squared test: p = 0.03). So, although the incidence of mutations in <italic>tcaA</italic> appear to be relatively rare, that isolates with variant <italic>tcaA</italic> genes are enriched amongst those causing bacteraemia suggests that a functional TcaA may limit the propensity of <italic>S. aureus</italic> to cause a bloodstream infection, such that it acts as a selective force for mutants of this gene. However, once the bacteraemia has become established, TcaA positively contributes to the infection process, likely due to the increased abundance of WTA in the cell envelope, and the greater structural integrity of the cell wall.</p>

<p>To experimentally test these human findings we utilised a mouse model of bacteraemia where the tail vein of C57/Bl6 mice are inoculated with 2 x 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> colony forming units (CFU) of bacteria to establish a bloodstream infection, where they seed from there into organs such as the liver spleen and kidneys. We performed mixed infections, where the wild type and mutant bacteria had to compete during the development of the infection within the mouse. The mice were infected with equal quantities of both bacteria and the change in ratio of the bacteria in the mouse blood, liver, spleen and kidney recorded after 48hr, which allowed the relative virulence ratio (RVR) of each bacterium to be calculated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. The RVR of the TcaA producing wild type strain was significantly higher than that of the mutant at a systemic level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8c</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To develop novel therapeutic approaches for infectious diseases, we need to understand how microorganisms cause disease and evade the host’s immune system. To address this, we have applied a population-based approach to analyse the pathogenicity of <italic>S. aureus</italic> and identified seven genes that affect the bacteria’s ability to survive exposure to human serum, the first step in the development of bacteraemia. The dissection of the molecular detail of how these genes affect serum survival is underway to determine their potential for therapeutic intervention. However, our focus here has been on the <italic>tcaA</italic> gene where we show that its expression is induced upon exposure to serum, that it is involved in the ligation or retention of WTA in the cell wall, and that this renders the bacteria more susceptible to killing by both AMPs and HDFAs. We have also found that TcaA is associated with changes to the structural integrity of peptidoglycan, such that the bacteria are more susceptible to some antibiotics (e.g. teicoplanin) and less susceptible to others (e.g. oxacillin). It is interesting to note that our GWAS approach identified <italic>tcaA</italic> due to the presence of function altering SNPs amongst clinical isolates. Our human data suggests that bacteraemia and/or the antibiotics commonly used to treat it such as teicoplanin and vancomycin may impose a selective pressure on the bacteria to mutate this gene, due to the decreased sensitivity this confers to serum killing and to clinically relevant antibiotics. However, both our human and mouse data have confirmed, that once bacteraemia has become established, TcaA contributes positively to disease progression, likely due to its cell wall re-modelling activity.</p>
<p>The <italic>tcaA</italic> gene is part of a three gene locus alongside the <italic>tcaR</italic> gene, which is predicted to encode a transcriptional regulator, and the <italic>tcaB</italic> gene which is predicted to encode an efflux pump<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. This locus is also reported to be part of the <italic>S. aureus</italic> cell wall stimulon, following a number of studies that monitored the response of <italic>S. aureus</italic> to cell wall attack<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. While work to understand the activity of each of the proteins encoded by the <italic>tca</italic> locus is underway, our data suggests that TcaA play a role in the ligation or retention of WTA within the cell wall, perhaps alongside the LcpA protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. How this is achieved is yet to be determined. TcaA may play a direct role in ligating WTA to the cell wall; it may play a role in cell wall turnover and the subsequent release of WTA and other cell wall macromolecules into the external environment; or it may interact and subsequently interfere with other cell wall biosynthetic processes that are responsible for WTA ligation. It is interesting to note that <italic>tarK</italic>, which is one of the other six genes associated here with serum survival is also involved in the biosynthesis of WTA. Additionally, <italic>yfhO</italic> which encodes an enzyme that glycosylates lipoteichoic acid (LTA) is also involved in serum resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, providing further evidence for the importance of teichoic acid associated molecules to this aspect of the biology and pathogenicity of <italic>S. aureus</italic>. For TcaR, we hypothesise that it likely controls the transcription of the co-transcribed <italic>tcaA</italic> and <italic>tcaB</italic> genes, and may directly respond to the external stimulus of teicoplanin and serum as reported here. What is less clear is what role TcaB plays, as efflux pumps are more typically associated with increasing the resistance of a bacterium to an antibiotic, or other toxic molecules.</p>
<p>In addition to <italic>tcaA</italic> this study has identified one other locus (<italic>yfhO</italic>) that negatively affects serum survival, and added a further five loci (<italic>tarK, gntR, ilvC, arsB</italic>, and <italic>pdhD</italic>) to the list of genes that contribute positively to serum survival by protecting the bacteria from HDFAs and AMPs. This leads us to the questions of why <italic>S. aureus</italic> has loci in apparent conflict with regards to the survival of the bacteria during bacteraemia. It is perhaps through the consideration of the other ways in which <italic>S. aureus</italic> interact with humans that we may understand this. The vast majority of interactions that occur between <italic>S. aureus</italic> and humans is as a commensal in the human nose from which it can readily transmit. The five identified protective genes may therefore also protect the bacteria during colonisation, which would confer a selective advantage, and it is just an unfortunate coincidence that they also confer increased survival in serum during the development of bacteraemia. While the focus of this work has been on the role of TcaA in serum, it is also worth considering what role it may have during colonisation of the nose, which involves the adherence of the bacteria to the nasal epithelium, to which WTA has a well-established role. It is therefore possible that TcaA enhances the ability of <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells to colonise the nose by retaining WTA within the cell wall. However, the role of TcaA in responsiveness to cell wall attack is as yet unclear, but perhaps it contributes to the competitiveness of <italic>S. aureus</italic> within the nasal microbiome in response to cell wall damage inflicted by competitors.</p>
<p>The evolution of the virulence of a pathogen is heavily dependent upon their mode of transmission, which for opportunistic pathogens raises interesting challenges. If within-host invasiveness limits between-host fitness by preventing them from transmitting to a new host, there are likely selective pressures acting on bacterial populations to evolve means of limiting their ability to cause invasive disease. However, if increased invasiveness facilitates enhanced within-host fitness, as the bacteria multiply and spread throughout the body, the ‘short-sighted evolution of virulence’ hypothesis proposed by Levin and Bull<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> could apply and may explain situations like <italic>S. aureus</italic> bacteraemia. We propose that TcaA may represents a system at the cusp of both these scenarios, in that it responds to cell wall attack by serum by making itself more susceptible to killing by serum, thereby potentially limiting its ability to cause bacteraemia, which could have long-term between host benefits. However, once established in the bloodstream and TcaA has remodelled the cell wall, the short-sighted view of virulence hypothesis applies where the bacteria survive and thrive, allowing them to cause a successful bacteraemia.</p>
<p>Entry into the bloodstream to establish an infection has long been considered a significant bottle neck for the bacteria, but until now, the stringency of this bottleneck was believed to be a result of the onslaught of all the immune mechanisms present in blood. Here we suggest that <italic>S. aureus</italic> may contribute to this bottleneck by responding to serum induced cell wall damage by further sensitizing itself to this attack as part of the pathway towards increasing their pathogenic capabilities by remodelling the cell wall. Our findings presented here opens up an entirely novel aspect to the biology of a major human pathogen and brings into question the appropriateness of the term ‘opportunistic’ when we refer to such highly effective bacterial pathogens.</p>

<p>Normal human serum was prepared from blood obtained from 8 healthy volunteers using Serum CAT tubes (BD). Blood was allowed to clot for 30 mins at room temperature followed by 1h incubation on ice. Serum was extracted following two rounds of centrifugation at 700 x g at 4°C for 10 min. Serum from individual donors were pooled, aliquoted and immediately stored at −80°C. The bacteria were grown overnight, and their density normalised to an OD<sub>600nm</sub> of 0.1 and 20 μl used to incubate in 180 μl 10% pooled human serum (diluted in PBS) for 90 min at 37°C with shaking. Serial dilutions were plated on tryptic soy agar (TSA) to determine CFUs. The same number of bacterial cells inoculated into PBS, diluted, and plated acted as a control. Survival was determined as the percentage of CFU in serum relative to the PBS control. Relative survival was determined through normalisation to JE2, which is presented ats 100% in the graphs.

<title>GWAS</title>
<p>Genome-wide association mapping was conducted using a generalized linear model, with capsule production as the quantitative response variable. We accounted for bacterial population substructure by adding to the regression model the first two component from a <italic>principal component decomposition</italic> of SNP data for each set of clinical samples (CC22 and CC30). The first two components accounted for 32% and 40% of the total variance for CC22 and CC30, respectively. In both cases, three distinct clusters were identified. We further considered a third model where we used cluster membership as covariates in our regression model, where clusters were defined using K-means clustering analysis (setting K=3); this, however, yielded identical results to the one based on PCA components. In total, 2066 (CC22) and 3189 (CC30) unique SNPs were analysed, the majority of which were subsequently filtered out for exhibiting a minor allele frequency (maf) of &lt;0.03, reducing the data to 378 and 1124 SNPs, respectively.

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study uses an innovative genome-wide approach and targeted testing to identify S. aureus genes that affect susceptibility to serum, serum-derived antimicrobial products, and commonly used antibiotics. The findings are significant in that they highlight evidence of evolution of virulence determinants in the setting of exposure to host stressors expected to be present during bacteremia and antibiotic therapy. The evidence is <bold>solid</bold>, but the presentation could be improved by providing details that clarify the methods and highlighting the limited current understanding of the major target, tcaA.</p>

<p>In this manuscript by Douglas et al, the investigative team seeks to identify Staphylococcus aureus genes (and associated polymorphisms) that confer altered susceptibility to human serum, with the hypothesis that such genes might contribute to the propensity of a strain to cause bacteremia, invasive disease, and/or death. Using an innovative GWAS-like approach applied to a bank of over 300 well-characterized clinical S. aureus isolates, the authors discover SNPs in seven different staphylococcal genes that confer increased survival in the setting of serum exposure. The authors then mainly focus on one gene, tcaA, and illustrate a potential mechanism whereby modification of peptidoglycan structure and WTA display leads to altered susceptibility to serum, serum-derived antimicrobial compounds, and antibiotics. One particularly significant finding is that the identified tcaA SNP is significantly associated with patient mortality, in that patients infected with the SNP bearing isolate are less likely to die from infection. It is therefore hypothesized that this SNP represents an adaptive mutation that promotes serum survival while decreasing virulence and host mortality. In a murine model of infection, the strain bearing the WT allele of tcaA is significantly more virulent than the tcaA mutant, suggesting that the role of tcaA in bacteremia is infection-phase dependent.</p>
<p>This manuscript has many strengths. The triangulation of genomic analysis, patient outcomes data, and in vitro and in vivo mechanistic testing adds to the significance of the findings in terms of human disease. Testing the impact of mutating tcaA in multiple staphylococcal lineages and backgrounds also increases the rigor of the study. The identification of bacterial loci that impact susceptibility to both host antimicrobial compounds and commonly used antibiotics is also a strength of this work, given the evolutionary and treatment implications for such genes.</p>
<p>One moderate weakness is that the impact of the identified SNP in tcaA is only tested in some of the assays, whereas the majority of the testing is performed with a whole gene knockout. Additionally, for some experiments, rigor is lacking in that statistical measures are not deployed to support the conclusions of biologically meaningful changes based on data with very modest differences between groups. In some cases this results in more speculative conclusions that will require further testing to validate. Finally, there are instances of inter-experiment variability that require further explanation. All in all, this is an exciting manuscript that will be of interest to the broader research communities focused on staphylococcal pathogenesis, bacterial evolution, and host-pathogen interactions, as well as to clinicians who care for patients with invasive staphylococcal infection.</p>

<p>The authors embarked on a study to identify SNPs in clinical isolates of S. aureus that influence sensitivity to serum killing. Through a phenotypic screen of 300 previously sequenced S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) isolates, they identified ~40 SNPs causing altered serum survival. The remainder of the study focuses of tcaA, a gene with unknown function. They show that when tcaA is disrupted, it results in increased resistance to glycopeptides and antimicrobial components of human serum.</p>
<p>They perform an elegant series of experiments demonstrating how a tcaA knockout is more resistant to killing by whole serum. arachadonic acid, LL-37 and HNP-1. They provide compelling evidence that in the absence of tcaA resistance to arachidonic acid is mediated through release of wall teichoic acids from the cell wall, which acts as a decoy and sequesters the fatty acid.</p>
<p>Similarly, they suggest that resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides is through alteration of the net charge of the cell wall due to loss of negatively charged WTAs based on reduced cytochrome C binding.</p>
<p>They continue to show that tcaA is induced in the presence of human serum, which causes increased resistance to the glycopeptide teichplanin.</p>
<p>They propose that tcaA disruption causes altered cell wall structure based on morphologic changes on TEM and increased sensitivity to lysostaphin and increased autolysis via triton x-100 assay.</p>
<p>5, Finally, they propose that tcaA influences mortality in SAB based on raw differences in 30-day morality. Interestingly they do decreased fitness during murine bacteremia model compared to wild-type.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>1. The manuscript is well-written and easy to follow</p>
<p>
2. The identification of SNPs leading to altered serum killing is convincing and valuable data</p>
<p>
3. The mechanism for tcaA-mediated resistance to arachadonic acid and AMPs is compelling and novel</p>
<p>
4. The murine infection data demonstrating that tcaA mutants exhibit reduced virulence is important data</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. Some of the conclusions are not supported by the data shown (either missing or incomplete)</p>
<p>
2. The authors conclude that tcaA mutants show reduced peptidoglycan crosslinking. This conclusion is based on qualitative TEM images and increased sensitivity to lysostaphyin/autolysis. While these data are suggestive. it is difficult to draw such a conclusion without analysis of the cell wall by LC-MS (such as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009468">http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009468</ext-link>).</p>
<p>
3. The authors conclude &quot;TcaA contributes to increased disease severity in mice and humans&quot;. While it seems biologically plausible that a polymorphism known to increase glycopeptide MIC affects mortality, the human data presented is based on raw 30-day mortality numbers. It is misleading to make the association with mortality without adjusting for confounding variables known to influence mortality in SAB (e.g. age, comorbidities, presence of sepsis, endocarditis, duration of bacteremia). Also, with just 12 patients in the SNP group, this is likely underpowered to detect any difference.</p>
<p>Overall, I think this is a good submission and the majority of their conclusions are supported by the data. The mechanism behind the clinically relevant tcaA mutation is important, given its known role in glycopeptide resistance and therefore likely clinical outcomes. This manuscript would benefit with the inclusion of some additional experiments to help support their finding.</p>

<p>In this manuscript by Douglas et al., the authors used a functional genomics approach to understand how Staphylococcus aureus survives in the bloodstream to cause bacteraemia. They identified seven novel genes that affect serum survival. The study focused on tcaA, a gene associated with resistance to the antibiotic teicoplanin and is activated when exposed to serum and plays a role in producing a critical virulence factor called wall teichoic acids (WTA) in the cell envelope. This protein affects the bacteria's sensitivity to cell wall attacking agents, human defense fatty acids, and antibiotics, as well as autolytic activity and lysostaphin sensitivity. The data in this study suggested that TcaA play a role in the ligation or retention of WTA within the cell wall. However, more work is needed to clarify that part. Interestingly, despite making the bacteria more vulnerable to serum killing, tcaA contributes to S. aureus virulence by altering the cell wall architecture, as demonstrated by the wild type strain outcompeting the tcaA mutant in a Mouse Co-infection model. The study raises an important point that TcaA in S. aureus may represent a system balancing two scenarios: it makes the bacteria more susceptible to serum killing, potentially limiting bacteraemia and providing long-term benefits between hosts; however, once established in the bloodstream, the bacteria survive and thrive, causing successful bacteraemia, as per the short-sighted evolution of virulence hypothesis. This duality highlights the complex interplay between within-host and between-host fitness in bacterial evolution. I strongly suggest creating a graphical abstract to illustrate the complex relationship between within-host and between-host fitness scenarios involving TcaA. Having this visual representation in the discussion will enhance comprehension and provide a concise summary of the complex system for the reader.</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors achieved their aims, and the results support their conclusions. This work will be fundamental for understanding this complex system and for developing novel therapeutics and vaccines for S. aureus.</p>
