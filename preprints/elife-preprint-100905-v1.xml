<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) recognizes Polycomb response elements (PREs) and catalyzes trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27me3) for gene silencing. This silencing is counteracted by H3K36 methylation for epigenetic activation of gene expression. Here, we show that the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> H3K36 methyltransferases SET DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 7 (SDG7) and SDG8 antagonize PRC2-mediated silencing and establish H3K36 methylation patterns with the general transcription machinery. The <italic>sdg7 sdg8</italic> double mutant shows developmental defects and lower H3K36me2 and H3K36me3 levels. SDG7 preferentially binds near PREs, but SDG8 is recruited to H3K36 methylation peaks. The <italic>sdg7 sdg8</italic> phenotypes are partially rescued by loss of Polycomb function. SDG7 overlaps with PRC2 and its recruiters on chromatin and evicts them from shared target genes when conditionally induced. SDG8 and RNA Polymerase II associate at SDG- and RNA POLYMERASE II ASSOCIATED FACTOR 1 complex-regulated targets for H3K36 methylation and transcription. These results suggest that SDG proteins evict PRC2 from PREs to prevent H3K27me3 deposition and activate target genes via transcription-coupled H3K36 methylation.</p>

<sec id="s1">
<p>Post-translational modifications of histone proteins play critical roles in regulating the physical properties of chromatin and defining the transcriptional state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Among various histone modifications, histone methylation primarily occurs on lysine or arginine residues and can affect both chromatin condensation and transcriptional states. Trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3) is associated with downregulation of nearby genes, leading to the formation of heterochromatic regions that are responsive to certain conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Methylation of lysine 4 and 36 on histone H3 (H3K4 and H3K36) is present on nucleosomes of transcriptionally active chromatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Histone modifications are complex and reflect the topological constraints caused by nearby modifications. Indeed, the presence of particular histone modifications can promote the addition of the same type of modification or the removal of different types: for example, higher H3K36 levels hinder H3K27me3 deposition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Such interconnected epigenetic systems, characterized by bistable states, determine the transcriptional activity of each gene.</p>
<p>Methylation marks can be added to histones by specific enzymes called methyltransferases. In all eukaryotic organisms, the activity of H3K27 methyltransferase is controlled by Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, PRC2 contains four core subunits, including Enhancer of zeste [E(z)] with a catalytic SET domain and Extra sex comb (Esc)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>) has three E(z) methyltransferases homologous to E(z)—CURLY LEAF (CLF), SWINGER (SWN) and MEDEA (MEA)—that catalyze H3K27me3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Because these methyltransferases act redundantly, higher-order mutants exhibit more severe developmental defects than any single mutant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT ENDOSPERM (FIE) is a WD40 homolog of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Esc. PRC2 interacts with multiple transcription factors through its subunits and is recruited to <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions of several hundred base pairs in length called Polycomb Response Elements (PREs). Proper PRC2 placement by <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors, such as BASIC PENTACYSTEINE (BPC), APETALA2 (AP2)-like or C2H2 zinc-finger (ZnF) family members, triggers the initial deposition of H3K27me3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. The opposing H3K36 trimethylation is regulated by SET DOMAIN GROUP8 (SDG8)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. SDG8 interacts with the transcription machinery, namely RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) and the polymerase-associated factor 1 (Paf1) complex (PAF1C)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. PAF1C components include VERNALIZATION INDEPENDENCE2 (VIP2, also named EARLY FLOWERING 7 [ELF7]), VIP3, VIP4, VIP5 and VIP6 (also named ELF8)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Despite the critical importance of H3K36me3 and the general transcription machinery, <italic>sdg8</italic> single mutants show relatively weak developmental defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, suggesting that the full function of SDG8 may be masked by partial redundancy with closely related protein(s). However, the identity of such factor(s) and their roles in the epigenetic systems have not been established.</p>
<p>In this study, we focus on one SDG8 homolog, SDG7, to consolidate the existing knowledge of the epigenetic interaction network along with the general transcription machinery. We show that the <italic>sdg7 sdg8</italic> double mutant exhibits developmental abnormalities and a notable decrease in both H3K36me2 and H3K36me3 levels, supporting the partial redundancy of SDG7 and SDG8. We also examine the genomic regions to which SDG7 and SDG8 are recruited and explore the connection between the <italic>sdg7 sdg8</italic> mutant phenotypes, the PRC2 complex, and RNA Pol II. We propose that SDGs displace PRC2 from PREs, preventing the deposition of H3K27me3 and activating the expression of target genes through transcription-coupled H3K36 methylation.</p>

<title>H3K36me2 and K36me3 levels are decreased by the double loss of SDG7/SDG8 genes</title>
<p>To identify potential factors that function together with SDG8, we examined the five class II <italic>SDG</italic> genes for overlapping expression patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>.

Comparison between predicted SDG7 and SDG8 and the crystal structure of the SET domain from ARABIDOPSIS TRITHORAX-RELATED PROTEIN 5 (ATXR5) in complex with a K36me3 peptide suggested that these proteins have highly similar catalytic core pockets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1d</xref>). These results suggest a conserved biochemical function for SDG7 and SDG8 in H3K36me3 recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1d</xref>).</p>

<p>To assess the biological function of SDG7 and SDG8 during plant development, we generated three independent <italic>sdg7 sdg8</italic> double mutant using different <italic>sdg7</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Although the <italic>sdg7</italic> single mutants did not show any clear developmental defects, the <italic>sdg7 sdg8</italic> double mutant flowered significantly earlier and exhibited a dwarf phenotype compared to the <italic>sdg8</italic> single mutant, which itself had an earlier flowering time and smaller than the wild type (WT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1e–i</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Supplementary Figs. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">4</xref>) (<italic>p</italic>&lt; 0.05, one-way ANOVA tests). We closely examined cells from leaves and petals in the <italic>sdg7 sdg8</italic> double mutant, which revealed that the observed dwarfism is due to defects in both cell size and cell number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Consistent with these phenotypic changes, we detected lower expression levels for marker genes of auxin homeostasis, cell division and key developmental regulators in the <italic>sdg7 sdg8</italic> mutant using promoter reporter lines driving <italic>GUS</italic>, green fluorescent protein (<italic>GFP</italic>) or yellow fluorescent protein (<italic>YFP</italic>) expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>).</p>
<p>To evaluate the biochemical function of SDG7 and SDG8 in the context of H3K36me3 and H3K36me2 deposition, we conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq). Metaplot profiles in the wild type indicated that H3K36me3 and H3K36me2 deposition reaches their highest levels near the 5′ and 3′ ends of transcribed genes, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1j,k</xref>). The <italic>sdg7 sdg8</italic> mutant showed higher levels of the H3K36me3 mark at the 5′ ends of genes, downstream of the transcription start site (TSS), compared to the wild type, and lower levels for the same mark located in the middle of the genes, as reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1j,k</xref>). By contrast, the H3K36me2 marks were absent across the entire gene body of transcribed regions in the <italic>sdg7 sdg8</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1j,k</xref>). In the <italic>sdg7 sdg8</italic> mutant, we identified 3,380 genes as being H3K36me3-hypomethylated and another 4,878 as H3K36me2-hypomethylated relative to the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1l</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data1">Supplementary Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data2">2</xref>). Based on gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis, these hypomethylated genes were associated with similar developmental processes, such as meristem and reproductive development as well as cell cycle process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1m</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data3">Supplementary Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data4">4</xref>). At selected targets, H3K36me3 and H3K36me2 levels in <italic>sdg7 sdg8</italic> were either similar to or significantly lower than those in the <italic>sdg8</italic> single mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1n</xref>). These results indicate that SDG7 and SDG8 are required to maintain proper H3K36me3 and H3K36me2 levels.</p>

<title>SDG7 occupies TSS and TES while SDG8 occupies gene body</title>
<p>We addressed the genome-wide binding pattern of SDG8 and SDG7 by ChIP-seq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data5">Supplementary Tables 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data6">6</xref>). We detected SDG8 binding along the gene body, particularly in introns, exons and their junctions, whereas SDG7 binding was primarily located near the TSS and transcription end site (TES) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). We determined that more than 50% of SDG7-bound regions are within promoter regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2b</xref>). We conducted a GO term enrichment analysis using the predicted direct SDG8 and SDG7 targets based on their binding peaks. In good agreement with a previous publication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, we observed an enrichment for light-related GO terms associated with SDG8 target genes such as ‘photosynthesis’, ‘light reaction’ and ‘circadian rhythm’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data7">Supplementary Table 7</xref>). The top 20 significantly enriched GO terms for SDG7 targets included ‘biological regulation’, ‘response to stimulus’, ‘response to chemical’ and ‘developmental process’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data8">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). An exploration of semantic similarity among all significant GO terms with REVIGO revealed that SDG8 and SDG7 are involved in similar biological processes, such as response to stimulus and circadian rhythm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data9">Supplementary Tables 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data10">10</xref>).</p>

<p>We also examined the degree of genome-wide overlap in chromatin occupancy for SDG8, SDG7, H3K36me3 and H3K36me2 at the same developmental stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2e</xref>). We observed a co-localization between significant SDG8- and SDG7-bound peaks (<italic>p</italic>&lt; 1.1 × 10<sup>-17</sup>, hypergeometric test) and with peaks for H3K36me3 and H3K36me2, both on a global scale and at specific loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data11">Supplementary Table 11</xref>). Among 331 direct SDG8 targets, 103 genes (31%) met the criteria of decreased H3K36me3 deposition, with another 147 genes (44%) showing lower H3K36me2 levels in the <italic>sdg7 sdg8</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2f</xref>). Consistent with the general distribution patterns, SDG8 bound to genes enriched with H3K36me3, showing a greater preference for the 5′ region of genes, encompassing the gene body, promoter and 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2f</xref>). For both H3K36me3- and H3K36me2-decorated genes, we observed most SDG8 binding peaks within the gene body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2f</xref>). Looking at H3K36me2 deposition, we determined that SDG8 primarily binds to the 3′ ends of genes, including the 3′ UTR and intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2f</xref>), suggesting that SDG8 is recruited to H3K36 methylation peaks. We also established that 34% of all SDG7-bound genes overlap with H3K36me3-hypomethylated genes, while another 42% overlapped with H3K36me2-hypomethylated genes. By contrast, SDG7 binding peaks exhibited the same patterns along genomic features for both H3K36me2- and H3K36me3-hypomethylated genes, unlike SDG8. Taking these results together, we propose that SDG7 and SDG8 regulate key shared target genes via H3K36 methylation by distinct mechanisms.</p>

<title>SDG7 displaces PRC2 from PRE to overcome H3K27me3-mediated gene silencing</title>
<p>Permissive histone modifications influence the access of transcription factors and/or the transcriptional machinery by controlling accessibility to their binding sites along chromatin. Since SDG7 is preferentially localized at gene regulatory regions on the genome, we conducted <italic>de novo</italic> motif profiling and identified motifs recognized by known transcription factors within the SDG7-bound peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data12">Supplementary Table 12</xref>). We noticed the overrepresentation of GA repeat (recognized by the BPC family), CTCC, CCG (recognized by AP2/ETHYLENE-RESPONSE FACTORs [ERFs]), G-box (recognized by ZnF proteins),and CArG box (recognized by MADS-box transcription factors) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data12">Supplementary Table 12</xref>). Except for the CArG box, these motifs have previously been reported to be associated with Polycomb occupancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Overrepresentation of the CArG box may be due to BPC-mediated recruitment of MADS domain complex to DNA for tissue-specific regulation of target genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Indeed, we observed a significant overlap between <italic>cis</italic>-elements located at SDG7 peaks and previously identified <italic>cis</italic>-elements located at PREs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> (<italic>p</italic>&lt; 1.2 × 10<sup>-58</sup>, hypergeometric test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data13">Supplementary Table 13</xref>). The top 10 significantly enriched shared <italic>cis</italic>-elements included binding motifs for Polycomb-recruiting or interacting transcription factors, such as AP2/ERF, Barley B Recombinant (BBR)-BPC and ZnF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3c</xref>). After recognizing these motifs as common elements for SDG7 and PRC2, we investigated the mechanism underlying the antagonism between SDG7 and PRC2. As reported previously, enrichment of PRC2 components (FIE and CLF), and their recruiters (AZF1 and BPC1) was seen at key target loci<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, such as <italic>PETAL LOSS</italic> (<italic>PTL</italic>), <italic>SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE</italic> (<italic>SVP</italic>) and <italic>AGAMOUS</italic> (<italic>AG</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Indeed, SDG7 binding peaks were present near the PRC2 and recruiter peaks at these loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3d</xref>). To examine the possible competition between SDG7 and PRC2 for their binding sites, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation–quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) in <italic>35S:SDG7-HA-GR proCLF:CLF-GFP</italic> plants 8 hours after mock or dexamethasone (DEX) treatment. DEX induction resulted in rapid recruitment of SDG7-HA-GR (a fusion between SDG7, the hemagglutinin tag and the glucocorticoid receptor) to known PREs, the regions occupied by PRC2, as evidenced by ChIP-qPCR with an anti-HA antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3e</xref>). An anti-GFP and anti-H3K27me3 ChIP-qPCR performed on the same sample uncovered a concomitant decrease in CLF and H3K27me3 occupancy at <italic>PTL, SVP</italic>, and <italic>AG</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3e</xref>), suggesting that SDG7 evicts PRC2 complex from PREs to overcome H3K27me3-mediated gene silencing.</p>

<p>Considering the deposition of opposing histone modifications by SDG7/SDG8 and PRC2, these two types of proteins may function antagonistically in plant development and gene expression.

Some phenotypes, however, such as flowering time and leaf size, were enhanced in the triple mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>), possibly due to secondary effects caused by expression changes in many regulatory genes as reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>.

By contrast, the genes encoding the calmodulin-like proteins TOUCH3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> (TCH3) and TCH4, and the serine/threonine kinase PINOID<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> (PID), were downregulated in <italic>clf sdg7 sdg8</italic>compared to <italic>sdg7 sdg8</italic>.

We determined that 230 out of 467 genes (49%) are commonly downregulated in these mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4a</xref>), suggesting that SDG8 primarily mediates target gene expression in conjunction with PAF1C.

Several genes, including <italic>FLC</italic>, were significantly repressed by CLF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Indeed, CLF and SDG7 binding peaks were present near the TSS of these loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4d</xref>). In addition, we observed H3K27me3 deposition along the gene body at these loci in wild type, while the spreading of the silencing modification disappeared in the <italic>clf</italic> mutant.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we identify SDG7 and SDG8 as key regulators that overcome PRC2-mediated silencing, leading to a switch from H3K27 to H3K36 methylation during growth and development. We provide a molecular framework for the antagonistic roles of SDG7 and PRC2, which relies on their competition at PREs in the regulatory regions of their shared target loci. Key targets, under dual opposite transcriptional regulation by SDG7 and PRC2, are controlled by SDG8 and the RNA Pol II elongation complex. The binding of these factors balances global distribution patterns between methylation of H3K36 and H3K27 and determines expression levels.</p>
<p>In Arabidopsis, PRC2 binds to PREs consisting of GAGA, telobox and G-box motifs. <italic>Trans-acting</italic> factors such as BPC, Arabidopsis ZINC-FINGER PROTEINs (AZFs), SCREAM and MUTE recruit PRC2 to PREs for H3K27me3 deposition and gene silencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. We uncover a PRC2 eviction strategy that enables the alteration of epigenetic states. SDG7 is recruited to PREs and displaces PRC2, facilitating H3K36 methylation and activation of the target gene. Hence, the opposing dynamics of H3K27 and H3K36 methylation is regulated by <italic>cis</italic>-localized DNA motifs. It has been reported that the MADS-box protein AG can evict PRC2 from PREs at specific loci<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Interestingly, CArG boxes, which are important for MADS box binding, were significantly enriched under the SDG7 binding peaks. The relationship between SDG7 and MADS-box proteins in the context of PRC2 displacement needs to be examined in the future. Although we identified many <italic>cis</italic>-elements associated with PRC2 occupancy, we did not identify the telobox among them. Hence, additional factors that can displace PRC2 from PREs besides SDG7 likely exist and may act at different stages in different tissues.</p>
<p>Our data suggest that SDG8 and RNA Pol II (as well as its phosphorylated versions Ser2P and Ser5P) are located near the TSS and 3′ ends of target genes. We observed H3K36me3 and H3K36me2 peaks at the TSS and 3′ end pause sites of RNA Pol II, and these signals were significantly weaker in <italic>sdg7 sdg8</italic>, suggesting the critical role of SDG8 and the RNA Pol II elongation complex for H3K36me3 and H3K36me2 deposition. Differentially H3K36me3-methylated genes maintained their H3K36me3 peaks at their 5′ ends in the wild type and the <italic>sdg7 sdg8</italic> double mutant. Additional support for this pattern comes from previous ChIP assays in the <italic>sdg8</italic> single mutant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, suggesting that SDG8 may primarily function in the propagation of H3K36me3 rather than its initial deposition. Thus, additional histone methyltransferases may contribute to H3K36me3 deposition near the TSS, even in the <italic>sdg7 sdg8</italic> double mutant background. Notably, H3K36me2 was almost absent from differentially H3K36me2-methylated genes in the <italic>sdg7 sdg8</italic> double mutant. H3K36me2 functions not only in the elongation and/or termination steps of mRNA transcription from the 5′ end, but also in the initiation of transcription from the 3′ end, as observed with <italic>COOLAIR</italic>.</p>
<p>Changes in the relative balance of mutually exclusive histone modifications occur during plant development. Due to the different distribution of histone modification patterns along the genome between plants and animals, gaining mechanistic insight into the antagonism in plants will benefit not only plant development but also the evolution of gene expression systems.</p>

<title>Phenotyping</title>
<p>For plant height analysis, plants were grown on soil. The final height of the main stem bearing an inflorescence was measured. Photographs of the entire plant were taken, and plant height was measured with ImageJ software (NIH).</p>
<p>For root phenotypic analysis, seedlings were grown on vertically oriented MS plates. The root length of seedlings 7 days after germination (7 DAG) was measured. Photographs of the entire seedling were taken. The length from the base of the hypocotyl to the root tip was measured with ImageJ software (NIH). To quantify lateral root number, the roots of 7-DAG seedlings were used. The lateral root number was counted using a microscope (Olympus SZ).</p>
<p>For leaf phenotypic analysis, the 5th true leaves from plants grown on soil were used. Leaves were excised with forceps and placed into glass vials containing FAA (formalin: ice-cold acetic acid:70% [v/v] ethanol at a volume ratio of 1:1:18) for fixation. After 30 min in Faa under vacuum, the leaves were transferred to a chloral hydrate/glycerol/H2O mixture solution (8 g: 1 mL: 2 mL) and incubated for at least 16 h until clear. Leaves were then placed onto glass slides (Matsunami Glass Industry Co., Ltd.), and covered with coverslips (Matsunami Glass Industry Co., Ltd.). Images were taken with an AXIO Zoom V16 stereo microscope (Zeiss). Leaf area and leaf length from the leaf tip to the petiole were measured with ImageJ software (NIH). To quantify palisade cell size and number, the same leaf samples were used. The cells were imaged using an AxioScope A light microscope (Zeiss). The epidermal cell area was measured with ImageJ software (NIH). Cell numbers were calculated from leaf and cell areas.</p>
<p>For petal phenotypic analysis, plants were grown on soil. Petals from stage 15 flowers were used. The petal area was measured with ImageJ software (NIH).

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors reveal a new role for SDG7 in the regulation of H3K36me2 and me3. SDG7 appear to be functionally redundant to SDG8 as the double mutant presents lower levels of H3K36me and stronger phenotypes than either single mutant, however, their mechanisms of action might differ as the proteins displayed different localization on their target genes, with SDG7 localizing preferentially to TSS and TES while SDG8 covers the gene body. SDG7 binds preferentially to PREs, which recruit PRC2 for H3K27me3 deposition. The authors therefore present an interesting model where SDG7 evicts PRC2 from silenced genes, leading to a loss of H3K27me3. This would allow the transcriptional activation of the genes and the deposition of H3K36me3.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, the manuscript is well-written and organized, although some paragraphs need clarifications. The figures are clear and well designed and the proposed model is compelling. While the manuscript is already interesting as it is, I think addressing the following questions would elevate it even more and refine the proposed model:</p>
<p>Weaknesses/potential aspects to address:</p>
<p>(1) It is still unclear whether SDG7 directly catalyzes H3K36me or if it promotes its deposition simply by eviction of PRC2. The AlphaFold and structure analyses show a significant similarity between the catalytic domains which would support the first possibility, but some more experiments would be required to prove this more definitively.</p>
<p>(2) Does SDG7 directly recognize the PRE (as suggested by the model in Figure 5F) or is it recruited by some transcription factors? Is SDG7 known to interact with any of the PRC2 recruiters?</p>
<p>(3) Line154/Figure 2A: The metagene plot for H3K36me3 shows a lower level on the gene body but a higher peak in sdg7sdg8 double mutants compared to the Wild-type, which is a bit surprising, especially considering that the immunostaining in reference 19 showed a near complete loss of H3K36me3 signal in the same double mutant. Can this higher peak be an artifact from the normalization strategy, or due to the existence of different subpopulations of genes?</p>
<p>Indeed, on the genome tracks presented by the authors, the hypomethylated genes show a loss of signal on the entire gene body, and not a higher peak near the TSS. It might be interesting to generate metagene plots for H3K36me3 hypo and hyper-methylated genes, to see if the higher peak at the TSS is solely due to the hyper-methylated genes.</p>
<p>(4) Figure 2C: More than 40% of differentially methylated genes are actually hypermethylated, but the authors do not discuss this at all. What are those genes, are they targeted by SDG7 or 8? Could they be responsible for the higher peak at the TSS observed in the double mutant? (see previous comment).</p>
<p>(5) Figure 2C and D: The method section states that the ChIP-seq was performed on 5-day-old seedlings, while the legend of this figure mentions root and shoot samples but this does not appear in the figure itself. There is also mention of shoot and root samples in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2. The authors should clarify which tissue was used for the data presented in Figure 2 and correct the legends or the methods accordingly.</p>
<p>(6) Line 270/Fig 4K and L: The text mentions looking at the 838 genes &quot;downregulated in clf sdg7 sdg8 relative to sdg7 sdg8&quot; and in the overlap, the authors identified FLC. However, in Figure 5D, FLC is upregulated in clf sdg7-sdg8 compared to sdg7-sdg8, not downregulated as mentioned in line 270. The Venn diagram in Figure 4L mentions &quot;sdg vs clf sdg up&quot;, which would fit the pattern seen in Figure 5D, but the number of genes (838) matches the number of downregulated genes in the sdg7sdg8 vs clf s dg7sdg8 volcano plot.</p>
<p>I would actually expect the phenotype rescue to be caused by genes that are up in Wt vs clf, down in Wt vs sdg7-sdg8, and back up in sdg7-sdg8 vs clf-sdg7-sdg8, not &quot;up/down/down&quot; as mentioned in the text: genes would be downregulated in sdg7-sdg8 because of a loss of H3K36me and therefore hypermethylation of H3K27, but in the absence of CLF, this hypermethylation is reversed and the genes are upregulated in the triple mutant compared to the sdg7-sdg8 mutant. This is also what the authors see and describe in their cluster analysis in Figure 4M and line 280, mentioning an upregulation in clf-sdg7-sdg8 vs sdg7-sdg8. Could the authors please clarify these discrepancies between the different subplots and within the text itself? Was there maybe some error plotting the volcano plot and/or Venn diagram?</p>
<p>In general, as this part is quite complicated, maybe it would benefit from a clearer explanation from the authors as to why they look at those particular overlaps, so that the reader can more easily follow their train of thought.</p>
<p>(7) Figure 4N/Line 286: How were these 828 genes identified? Is it stemming from a clf-sdg7-sdg8 vs sdg7-sdg8 comparison? The legend says &quot;genes shown by white color in Fig. 4M&quot;, do the authors mean the two clusters previously described?</p>
<p>(8) Line 300: &quot;suggesting that SDG8 primarily mediates target gene expression in conjunction with PAF1C&quot;. This statement is based on overlapping genes that are downregulated in sdg7-sdg8 double mutant and paf1c mutants but concludes only on the role of SDG8. I feel that to state that SDG8 regulates expression in conjunction with PAF1C, the authors should rather examine the genes downregulated in the sdg8 mutant, especially considering the reduced overlap between genes downregulated in sdg8 and sdg7-sdg8 (according to Figure 2C, only 30% of the genes downregulated in sdg8 are also downregulated in the double mutant), or this statement should be corrected to also include SDG7.</p>
<p>Maybe it would be easier to read the figure if the authors created a master list of genes downregulated in at least one of the paf1c mutants they examined (as they anyway do not examine in detail the contribution of each individual paf1c mutant), and overlap it with the genes downregulated in sdg7, sdg8 or sdg7-sdg8.</p>
<p>(9) Line 326: &quot;We also discovered that SDG7 and SDG8 overcome PRC2-mediated silencing, leading to a switch from H3K27 methylation to H3K36 methylation during growth and development.&quot; While part of this statement is supported by the ChIP data presented in Figure 4E, I think a ChIP for H3K36me2 and/or me3 is necessary to prove the existence of a K27me to K36me switch.</p>
<p>(10) Line 347: The authors state that SDG8 is located at the TSS and 3' end of genes, but on line 187 they state that it occupies the gene body (which is supported by the plot in Figure 3A).</p>
<p>(11) Line 351: The authors suggest a role of RNApolII in the deposition of K36me, but their data are not sufficient to support this hypothesis. The transcriptome data show that both SDGs and PAF1C regulate a similar set of genes, but they do not show data demonstrating that RNApolII is necessary for the deposition of K36me. It might be interesting to examine H3K36me levels in a paf1c mutant to further consolidate their hypothesis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors combined imaging approaches with molecular and genetic experiments to</p>
<p>(i) for the first time establish a chromatin regulatory role for SDG7;</p>
<p>
(ii) examine its role in H3K36 methylation, along with its homolog SDG8;</p>
<p>
(iii) examine its potential role in mediating antagonism to PRC2, thereby mediating transcriptional activation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript explores interesting and relevant mechanistic hypotheses about chromatin-mediated gene regulation by combining a range of experimental tools and a genome-wide perspective. The writing is very clear. The study makes good connections to existing data and generates datasets that complement existing datasets, providing a valuable resource to the community.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Some of the claims appear to need further supporting evidence to establish their robustness.</p>
<p>Review of the main conclusions and supporting evidence:</p>
<p>(1) SDG7 contributes to H3K36 methylation at several loci along with SDG8:</p>
<p>
This conclusion is supported by the genome-wide differences (measured by ChIP-seq) in H3K36me3 and me2 levels observed between WT, the sdg7 and sdg8 single mutants, and the double mutant. The reduction in H3K36 methylation levels observed at a large number of genes in the sdg7 mutant, and the further reduction in H3K36 methylation levels in the double mutant compared to sdg8 (observed at multiple genes) indicates that SDG7 promotes this transcription-associated modification. The significantly larger number of H3K36 hypomethylated genes in the double mutant (3380) compared to either of the single mutants (523 and 605) indicates lower overall H3K36me3 levels in the double mutant.</p>
<p>
While direct evidence of SDG7 methyltransferase activity on H3K36 is lacking, the study reports structural comparisons using AlphaFold predictions that suggest the possibility of such a role.</p>
<p>(2) SDG7 influences gene expression together with SDG8:</p>
<p>
This conclusion is supported by a range of phenotypic differences observed between sdg8 and the double mutant sdg7 sdg8. The reported genome-wide differential gene expression between the WT and the double mutant as well as expression differences in specific genes detected by imaging are also consistent with SDG7 and SDG8 together influencing gene expression. However, a role specifically for SDG7 could be further supported by a direct differential expression analysis between the single mutant sdg8 and the double mutant sdg7 sdg8. A role for SDG7 in gene expression is also consistent with its observed effect on H3K36 methylation, which is generally associated with productive transcription.</p>
<p>(3) SDG8 is exclusively nuclear, but SDG7 localises to the cytosol and the nucleus in meristematic cells:</p>
<p>
This conclusion is supported by imaging of fluorescent-tagged SDG8 and SDG7 in the root tip, which shows nuclear localisation of SDG8-GFP, consistent with previous reports, and a combination of nuclear and cytosolic localisation for SDG7-VENUS. However, the study presents only one replicate - more replicates are needed to establish the robustness of this conclusion.</p>
<p>(4) Distinct binding patterns of SDG7 and SDG8 on chromatin:</p>
<p>
This conclusion is supported by the analysis of genome-wide binding patterns of these proteins measured by ChIP-seq (using fluorescent tagged versions). This data indicates that while SDG7 tends to localise to TSS and TES regions of genes, SDG8 tends to be more uniformly spread across gene loci. These patterns suggest that SDG7 and SDG8 may influence H3K36 methylation through distinct mechanisms, but do not indicate what these mechanisms may be.</p>
<p>(5) SDG7/SDG8 antagonism with PRC2:</p>
<p>
a. SDG7 overlaps with PRC2 and its recruiters on chromatin and can bind to PREs</p>
<p>
This conclusion is supported by statistically significant overlaps genome-wide between cis-elements at SDG7 binding peaks and those previously reported to be Polycomb associated. This is further supported by the observation of SDG7 binding peaks close to PRC2 subunit binding peaks at known PRC2 targets.</p>
<p>
b. SDG7/SDG8 antagonism with PRC2</p>
<p>
This conclusion is supported by the observation that the sdg7 sdg8 double mutant phenotypes are partially rescued by disrupting CLF, one of the PRC2 methyltransferases. However, this does not necessarily suggest a direct antagonism with PRC2, but could be part of a more general antagonism between productive transcription (in which H3K36 methylation plays an active role), and PRC2-mediated silencing.</p>
<p>
c. SDG7 can evict PRC2 from PREs to overcome H3K27me3-mediated silencing</p>
<p>
This conclusion - that SDG7 directly antagonises PRC2 interaction with cis-elements that mediate its targeting - is partly supported by the observation that inducing overexpression of SDG7 (through dexamethasone induction) can cause changes in CLF occupancy and H3K27me3 levels at certain designated PREs. To establish the robustness of these conclusions, it will be necessary to examine designated regions to be used as a negative control and include a non-transgenic control for the SDG-7-HA ChIP. A suitable negative control may be a non-PRE region known to have a CLF peak and high H3K27me3 levels, where the levels would not be expected to change in this experiment.</p>
<p>
It remains to be established whether this apparent antagonism of PRC2 by SDG7 is only part of a more general antagonism of PRC2 by productive transcriptional activity, or whether SDG7 can evict PRC2 from PREs independent of transcripts and therefore is a precursor to switching to an active transcriptional state.</p>
<p>
Another aspect that would be interesting to examine in the light of recent findings is the single-cell-level behaviour at these genes targeted by SDG7-to examine whether SDG7 induction is causing individual copies of these genes to stochastically switch to an active transcriptional state so that the observed changes in H3K27me3 result from a fraction of copies completely losing silencing rather than all copies losing some H3K27me3.</p>
<p>(6) H3K36me3 levels are co-regulated by SDG8 and Paf1c, SDG8 associates with Pol II to deliver transcription-coupled H3K36 methylation</p>
<p>
This conclusion is supported by analysis of a subset of loci previously reported to be regulated by Paf1c, which also exhibit changes in the sdg7 sdg8 double mutant as well as a clf mutant. This analysis is based on a qualitative examination of ChIP-seq signal at a small number of loci, and therefore provides indirect support for this conclusion. It is, therefore, difficult to draw mechanistic insights from this analysis that go beyond correlation.</p>
