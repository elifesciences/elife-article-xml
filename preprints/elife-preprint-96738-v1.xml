<title>Abstract</title><p>Annotation of newly-sequenced genomes frequently includes genes, but rarely covers important non-coding genomic features such as the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory modules—e.g., enhancers and silencers—that regulate gene expression. Here, we begin to remedy this situation by developing a workflow for rapid initial annotation of insect regulatory sequences, and provide a searchable database resource with enhancer predictions for 33 genomes. Using our previously-developed SCRMshaw computational enhancer prediction method, we predict over 2.8 million regulatory sequences along with the tissues where they are expected to be active, in a set of insect species ranging over 360 million years of evolution. Extensive analysis and validation of the data provides several lines of evidence suggesting that we achieve a high true-positive rate for enhancer prediction. One, we show that our predictions target specific loci, rather than random genomic locations. Two, we predict enhancers in orthologous loci across a diverged set of species to a significantly higher degree than random expectation would allow. Three, we demonstrate that our predictions are highly enriched for regions of accessible chromatin. Four, we achieve a validation rate in excess of 70% using in vivo reporter gene assays. As we continue to annotate both new tissues and new species, our regulatory annotation resource will provide a rich source of data for the research community and will have utility for both small-scale (single gene, single species) and large-scale (many genes, many species) studies of gene regulation. In particular, the ability to search for functionally-related regulatory elements in orthologous loci should greatly facilitate studies of enhancer evolution even among distantly related species.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The past two decades have witnessed an explosive rise in sequenced metazoan genomes, from a mere handful in the first few years of the century to over 8,000 today (ref. 1; accessed 16 January 2024). This impressive statistic, however, masks the reality that these genomes exist in various stages of completion. Fewer than 30% of these genomes are assembled at the chromosome level, and only 28% of those have a comprehensive annotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Moreover, almost none of the genome annotations include regulatory sequences (also referred to as <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory modules, or CRMs) such as enhancers and silencers. This is unfortunate, as CRMs comprise a significant percentage of the genome, and knowledge of these sequences is expected to have value comparable to that of knowing the protein-coding genes. Characterizing CRMs is critical for understanding mechanisms of gene regulation and the organization of gene regulatory networks. Moreover, the role of regulatory mutations is increasingly recognized as a driver of both evolution and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>).</p>
<p>One reason for the overall dearth of regulatory annotations is that, historically, large-scale CRM discovery has been difficult and both resource and labor intensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). For much of the last four decades, CRMs could only be identified through painstaking, low-throughput experimental assays. Although in recent years high-throughput empirical and computational CRM discovery methods have been developed, the various different methods frequently show limited agreement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), with the result that comprehensive CRM annotation across all cell types and life-cycle stages has remained a challenge for all but the most exhaustively studied model organisms. The problem is particularly acute for the insects. Insects represent a species-rich class—they constitute somewhere between 65%-90% of all animal species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>)—and have major impacts on human health and agriculture. The early radiation of the insects, coupled with typically short generation times, means that most of the relevant biomedically and agriculturally important species share little non-coding sequence conservation with each other or with the principal insect model species, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Thus, common sequence-homology based CRM discovery approaches are of little use in providing regulatory insights into these species, and knowledge transfers poorly from one species to another. Furthermore, many insects have a complex and varied life cycle, making it particularly important—yet onerous—to assay for CRM function at multiple stages.</p>
<p>We previously developed a powerful computational method, SCRMshaw (“<underline>S</underline>upervised <italic><underline>C</underline>is</italic>-<underline>R</underline>egulatory <underline>M</underline>odule prediction”), for accurate prediction of CRMs, particularly enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). (Although we expect SCRMshaw to be adept at finding multiple CRM types, our validation efforts to date have focused solely on enhancers.) SCRMshaw requires only a sequenced genome and a “training set” of some 15-30 known enhancers that regulate a common pattern of gene expression (e.g., midgut expression) and relies on the idea that enhancers with similar function will have similar sequence characteristics, not possible to detect by eye or by traditional alignment methods, but identifiable using machine-learning. Although not universally true, this assumption is robust enough to allow effective enhancer discovery without requiring knowledge of transcription factor binding sites or of the expression patterns of the genes being regulated.</p>
<p>Importantly, we have shown that we can leverage the wealth of existing <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> enhancer data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>) to train models for <italic>cross-species</italic> supervised enhancer discovery in diverged (160-345 million years (MY)) insect species—including flies, mosquitoes, beetles, bees, and wasps—despite a virtually complete lack of observable alignment at the non-coding sequence level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we use SCRMshaw to undertake an initial regulatory annotation of 33 individual insect genomes, using a collection of 48 training sets composed of experimentally validated <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> enhancers. These species are spread across five orders spanning over 360 MY of evolution, and represent roughly 10% of annotated insect species with scaffold-level or better assembly. Annotated predicted enhancers are provided in a searchable database that allows querying by species, tissue/cell type, or potential target gene. A series of simulations as well as <italic>in silico</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> validation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and place an upper bound on false positive prediction rates. Our results represent the first release of a rich insect regulatory genome annotation resource, which will continue to grow and annotate insect regulatory genomes in parallel with the sequencing of new insect genomes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2">
<title>Results</title>
<p>We previously demonstrated that SCRMshaw is remarkably effective at predicting enhancers across the entire ∼345 MY range of the holometabolous insects, using training data derived solely from <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). SCRMshaw (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) uses training sets composed of known enhancers defined by a common functional characterization (e.g. “nervous system,” “wing disc”) to build a statistical model that captures their short DNA subsequence (kmer) count distribution. This kmer distribution is then compared to that of a set of non-enhancer “background” sequences in a machine-learning framework. The kmers likely serve as proxies for the unknown transcription factor binding sites, but these sites themselves, even when known, are not explicitly used by the algorithm. The trained model is then used to score overlapping sequence windows in the genome, and the highest-scoring windows are output as predicted enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). When searching the genomes of the mosquitoes <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> and <italic>Aedes aegypti,</italic> the red flour beetle <italic>Tribolium castaneum,</italic> the honey bee <italic>Apis mellifera,</italic> and the wasp <italic>Nasonia vitripennis,</italic> SCRMshaw successfully predicted enhancers in a cross-species fashion with an approximately 75% prediction success rate, based on reporter gene assays in xenotransgenic <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (chosen as a pragmatic transgene host species) and comparison to already-identified enhancers in the other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). These results suggest that there are significant, albeit hidden, homologies governing the sequence characteristics of insect enhancers, at least for those involved in a substantial number of gene regulatory networks, and motivated us to apply SCRMshaw to a large and diverse set of sequenced insect genomes.</p>

<title>A cross-species SCRMshaw pipeline</title>
<p>To facilitate application of SCRMshaw to large numbers of newly-sequenced genomes, we developed a detailed workflow to ensure proper formatting of input genomes, rapid prediction of tissue-specific enhancer sequences, evaluation of results, and annotation of loci with information drawn from the respective orthologous regions in the richly-investigated <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genome (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>; see Methods). The workflow consists of four major steps:</p>
<sec id="s2a1">
<title>Preflight</title>
<p>SCRMshaw requires two input files for each genome: a FASTA-formatted file of the genome sequence itself, and a GFFv3-formatted file of the genome annotation. The genome file is masked for tandem repeats using Tandem Repeat Finder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). <italic>Preflight</italic> validates the formats of these files and produces a comprehensive log file that highlights any issues along with basic information such as the number of chromosomes/scaffolds and their sizes, data types present in the annotation (e.g., ‘gene’, ‘exon’, ‘ncRNA’, etc.), and average intergenic distances. <italic>Preflight</italic> also provides a sample output of the SCRMshaw-generated ‘gene’ and ‘exon’ files. This feature allows users to identify any discrepancies or errors stemming from the input files and to reformat these files as needed before running SCRMshaw. Any minor scaffolds that are not annotated as containing genes are discarded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2a2">
<title>SCRMshaw</title>
<p>SCRMshaw is run as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), using the “HD” variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2a3">
<title>Post-processing</title>
<p>The raw SCRMshaw output is post-processed to determine the final set of predicted enhancers. The original post-processing procedure described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>) had a tendency to predict enhancers skewed toward long lengths (median ∼ 1100 bp). We have revised that method here (see Methods) to yield predictions of more compact size (median 750 bp), which is more in keeping with empirically characterized enhancer lengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2a4">
<title>Orthology mapping</title>
<p>As a final step, we map all putative target genes in the SCRMshaw output to their <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> orthologs (if an ortholog exists) using a custom pipeline incorporating the <italic>Orthologer</italic> software from the Zdobnov lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) (see Methods). We use <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> as it has by far the most comprehensive gene annotation of the insects and thus provides the most detailed functional information for each gene. Mapping the genes from each species to a common ortholog allows us to assess whether we have obtained predicted enhancers in orthologous loci within the various species on which we have run SCRMshaw. The orthology mapping step requires that a set of predicted proteins is present as part of the existing genome annotation.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Annotation of 33 insect genomes</title>
<p>We ran our annotation pipeline on an initial set of 33 genomes (additional genome annotation is ongoing). These initial genomes were chosen based on availability and to sample broadly among the holometabolous insect orders and the Hemiptera (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For each genome, we ran SCRMshaw using a collection of 48 training sets (Supplemental Table S1) and all three SCRMshaw scoring methods (“IMM,” “hexMCD”, “PAC-rc”; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>)). For fifteen species where a protein annotation was available, we assigned <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> orthologs to each predicted locus, with an average of 54% (range 38-82%) of genes in a given species having a <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> ortholog (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Collectively, we predicted a total of 2,873,192 enhancers in these 33 species, with each species having on average approximately 87,000 predictions (Supplemental Table S2) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). (As some enhancers are predicted by multiple scoring methods, or from more than one training set, the number of unique sequences is lower at 1,164,354; see gray bars in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>.) The median length of the predicted enhancers across all species was 750 bp (mean 695, range 490-32500 bp). However, we noted the presence of a small number—2642, &lt; 0.1% of the total—of unusually large regions (&gt; 2000 bp), the bulk of which were confined to just a few genomes (Supplemental Fig. S1). We therefore discarded any predictions with length greater than 1.5 times the interquartile range of the complete prediction set and re-evaluated the size distribution. This resulted in a median size of 740 bp with a mean of 676 bp and a range of 490-1120 bp, indicating that the overall impact of these outlier sequences is minimal (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Inspection of the excessively large elements revealed that they result from SCRMshaw predictions that lie immediately adjacent to each other (without gaps) and have similar SCRMshaw scores, which thus become merged into one broad predicted element. Preliminary analysis suggests that these regions result from insufficient masking of tandem repeat regions and/or genome assembly errors, although other causes, such as extremely enhancer-dense “superenhancer” regions (reviewed by 25), cannot entirely be ruled out.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Many loci contain multiple enhancer predictions</title>
<p>We have noted in the past that SCRMshaw often predicts multiple enhancers in a single locus (e.g. 26). This is consistent with the concept of “shadow enhancers,” sets of multiple redundant or semi-redundant enhancers regulating the same gene (reviewed by 27). On the other hand, if SCRMshaw is predicting enhancers with low specificity (i.e., largely at random), it is instead possible that larger loci may just accumulate a high number of predictions simply due to their greater length.</p>
<p>To distinguish between these possibilities, we conducted simulations on three representative genomes (<italic>D. melanogaster, C. pipiens,</italic> and <italic>A. aegypti</italic>), each with a different average intergenic region size chosen to represent small, medium and large genomes respectively (average sizes 610 bp, 5,274.5 bp, and 14,641 bp; see Methods). We randomized the location of SCRMshaw predictions across the non-coding component of each genome and compared the randomized results to our SCRMshaw output. We found that, for a subset of loci, the number of real SCRMshaw predictions per locus was consistently higher than the number obtained at random (Supplemental Table S3). For example, using the <italic>mapping1.visceral_mesoderm</italic> training set, 4.6% (15/328) of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> loci containing one or more SCRMshaw predictions had a significantly (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) larger number of predictions/locus than expected, 1.5% (10/658) of <italic>C. pipiens</italic> loci had more predictions than expected, and 1% (3/299) of <italic>A. aegypti</italic> loci had excess predicted enhancers (Supplemental Table S3). Similarly, for the <italic>mapping2.ectoderm</italic> training set, 7.6%, 1.5%, and 11% of loci in the three species, respectively, had a significantly (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) greater than expected number of predictions per locus (Supplemental Table S3). Averaged over all training sets, 3-4% of loci with predictions had significantly more than expected by chance (mean values: 3.0% for <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, 3.0% for <italic>C. pipiens</italic>, and 3.7% for <italic>A. aegypti</italic>; maximum values: 10.2% for <italic>D. melanogaster,</italic> 9.3% for <italic>C. pipiens</italic>, and 11.6% for <italic>A. aegypti</italic>). Only very few training sets did not have any loci with significantly more enhancers than expected (1 set in <italic>A. aegypti,</italic> 1 in <italic>C. pipiens</italic> and 8 in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>; Supplemental Table S3).</p>
<p>To further ensure that these results were not influenced by locus size, we binned the loci by length and assessed the numbers of real versus simulated predictions/locus for each bin. The binned results were similar to the results using all loci, i.e., the number of SCRMshaw predictions/locus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, blue boxplots) was consistently higher than the number obtained via randomization (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, pink boxplots). Results were also similar when comparing predictions only at intergenic versus only at intronic positions (Supplemental Table S3). These results suggest that SCRMshaw is not predicting enhancers randomly throughout the genome, but rather is identifying multiple related “shadow” enhancers in a subset of loci. Consistent with this interpretation, functional tests of the full set of predicted enhancers in several <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> loci has confirmed that many of the predictions act as functionally similar enhancers (T. Williams, personal communication).</p>

<title>SCRMshaw predicts enhancers in orthologous loci across species</title>
<p>A major premise underlying cross-species applications of SCRMshaw is that conserved regulatory strategies should allow for a model trained on enhancers in one species to predict for similar enhancers in another species. We reasoned that at least some of the time, this should lead to identification of enhancers in orthologous loci, as orthologous genes are frequently involved in similar biological pathways and developmental regulatory networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Indeed, we previously showed that SCRMshaw was able to predict enhancers in several orthologous loci, for instance those for the <italic>single-minded</italic> locus in <italic>D. melanogaster, A. gambiae,</italic> and <italic>A. mellifera,</italic> and the <italic>wingless</italic> locus in <italic>D. melanogaster, A. mellifera,</italic> and <italic>T. castaneum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). To test whether this is generally true, we used the fifteen species with mapped <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> orthologs (plus <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> itself), and all 48 of our training sets, to compare the number of SCRMshaw-based versus random predictions obtained in common (orthologous) loci.</p>
<p>We observed a substantial reduction in the number of orthologous loci with predictions in common as we moved from considering a set of ten to the full set of all sixteen species (average number of common loci over all 48 training sets: 70.7 (10 species) &gt; 39.4. &gt; 19.8 &gt; 9.14 &gt; 4.12 &gt; 1.6 &gt; 0.6 (16 species) out of an average number of 640 predictions with mapped orthologs) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, Supplemental Table S4a). This rapid decline is likely due to a variety of factors, including differences in taxonomic order (e.g., Diptera vs. Hymenoptera), the quality and degree of ortholog data for each species, and the quality of annotation for each species, all of which likely lead to an underestimation of the true numbers of common loci in our data (see Discussion). We simulated SCRMshaw predictions for all sixteen species by randomizing the SCRMshaw results and compared the number of common loci between the simulated and real data for combinations of ten to sixteen species. The number of common loci among the real SCRMshaw predictions was consistently significantly higher than the number of common loci observed in the simulated data (<italic>P</italic>&lt; 0.05; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref> and Supplemental Table S4). In particular, when evaluating between 10 and 12 species (data for 14-16 species are not reliable due to the very small number of observed loci in common) only a single training set, <italic>adult_PNS</italic>, did not have a significant overrepresentation of common loci (Supplemental Table S4c). We also examined the fold enrichment, i.e., the extent to which the true number was in excess of the simulated number, and found that on average there were greater than 2.4x more predictions in common loci than expected, when considering groups of 10-12 species; almost all training sets had a fold enrichment &gt;1.5x (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, Supplemental Table S4d). These results strongly suggest that SCRMshaw is successfully finding sets of conserved (or convergent) enhancers, as it is predicting sequences in orthologous loci in a training-set specific manner across multiple species significantly more often than can be accounted for by chance.</p>

<title>SCRMshaw predictions correlate with regions of accessible chromatin</title>
<p>Active enhancers are frequently found in regions of accessible chromatin, as assayed by methods such as DNAse-seq, FAIRE-seq (Formaldehyde-Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements with sequencing), and ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin by sequencing)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). We confirmed previously that FAIRE-predicted and SCRMshaw-predicted enhancers in <italic>T. castaneum</italic> have a high (&gt;79%) degree of overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). To determine whether a similar correlation exists for other species, we compared our SCRMshaw predictions with available FAIRE-seq and ATAC-seq data for seven species: <italic>D. melanogaster, T. castaneum, A. gambiae, Danaus plexippus, Vanessa cardui, Junonia coenia,</italic> and <italic>Heliconius himera</italic>. These comparisons are imperfect, as the tissues used to obtain the chromatin data do not precisely correspond to the training sequences used for SCRMshaw. Nevertheless, in the majority of cases where we were able to establish a rough match between the tissues, we observed significant overlap between the two methods of enhancer detection. For example, in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, 40% of SCRMshaw predictions using the <italic>blastoderm.mapping1</italic> training set overlapped ATAC-seq peaks obtained from blastoderm embryos (<italic>P</italic>&lt;4.15e-112, fold enrichment 2.98) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>)(<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> row 2). Similarly, 35% and 41% of SCRMshaw predictions from the <italic>mappng2.wing</italic> and <italic>haltere_disc</italic> sets overlapped FAIRE data that included wing and haltere cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>)(<italic>P</italic>&lt;4.6e-117 and 1.5e-102, fold enrichment of 3.29 and 2.98)(<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, rows 1, 3). In the mosquito <italic>A. gambiae</italic>, we compared SCRMshaw predictions from the <italic>embryonic_midgut</italic> and <italic>mapping1.salivary</italic> training sets to ATAC-seq data from adult midgut and salivary tissues, observing overlaps of 40% and 37% respectively (<italic>P</italic>&lt;1.5e-102 and 2.15e-93, fold enrichment of 3.45 and 3.22; )(<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, rows 9, 10). When comparing our SCRMshaw predictions from the <italic>mapping2.wing</italic> set to ATAC-seq data for larval wing tissue in the butterflies <italic>D. plexippus</italic> and <italic>H. himera</italic>, we observed overlaps of 60% and 68% (<italic>P</italic>&lt;5.59e-19 and <italic>P</italic>&lt;9.92e-25, fold enrichment of 1.99, 1.66;)(<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, rows 11, 12)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). The butterflies <italic>J. coenia</italic> and <italic>V. cardui</italic> are exceptions; intriguingly, they show a depletion in SCRMshaw predictions compared to expectation (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, rows 13, 14). Whether this is due to a mismatch in the data used for comparison, the state of the genome assemblies for these two draft genomes, or some other failure of SCRMshaw to perform strongly on these species remains to be determined. Overall, the highly significant overlap we observe between SCRMshaw predictions and open chromatin regions in most species and tissues provides further strong evidence that SCRMshaw is effectively predicting enhancers across a broad range of genomes.</p>

<title>Reporter gene analysis demonstrates that SCRMshaw predictions are functional enhancers</title>
<p>As a concrete test of our ability to use SCRMshaw to predict functional enhancers, we assayed a subset of SCRMshaw predictions by reporter gene analysis in transgenic <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. Our previous studies have shown a high success rate for such assays, ranging from 65% through &gt;80%, depending on the species and training sets used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>).</p>
<p>We focused our <italic>in vivo</italic> validation experiments on SCRMshaw predictions made using the <italic>mapping2.wing, haltere_disc,</italic> and <italic>disc.mapping2</italic> training sets and a set of four species we had previously shown to be amenable to SCRMshaw prediction<italic>: D. melanogaster, A. aegypti, T. castaneum,</italic> and <italic>A. mellifera</italic>. The imaginal discs are well-established tissues for investigating gene regulation in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, and the chosen training sets all gave significant results in the open-chromatin comparisons discussed above. We selected six sets of putative enhancers for testing (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). For the first three sets, we selected sequences where we had predictions in each of the orthologous loci for <italic>D. melanogaster, T. castaneum,</italic> and <italic>A. mellifera</italic> (<italic>A. aegypti</italic> was not considered for these sets), and where the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> prediction mapped near a gene expressed in the wing imaginal discs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). These predictions were conducted using SCRMshaw’s IMM scoring method only, with post-processing performed using the original method described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>), and the Amel_4.5 version of the <italic>A. mellifera</italic> genome. For the second three sets, we chose sequences where we had predictions in orthologous loci for at least three of the four species and where the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> sequence had previously been tested in a reporter gene assay and was known to be active in the relevant imaginal discs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Imposing this latter criterion allowed us to leverage existing knowledge and reduce the necessary amount of <italic>in vivo</italic> testing for each set of predictions, enabling us to test a larger set of sequences overall. For this second set of three, we used all three SCRMshaw scoring methods with a revised post- processing algorithm (see Methods), and the Amel_Hav3.1 <italic>A. mellifera</italic> genome. For all six sets, predictions were chosen for testing based on high SCRMshaw scores and overlap with open- chromatin data (where available). We also considered the position of each prediction within the locus (i.e., first intron, downstream intergenic region, etc.), favoring sequences where position was maintained among the orthologs. Selected sequences were cloned into a cross-species compatible reporter vector (Deem et al., <italic>submitted</italic>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), and reporter gene activity was visualized either directly or by using the lineage tracing system G-TRACE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). In the latter, enhancer activity is visualized through two reporters; the first reporter visualizes the direct enhancer activity while expression of the second reporter is induced and maintained in all cells that descend from a cell in which the enhancer is initially active, even if activity subsequently shuts off.</p>

<p>The <italic>A. mellifera</italic> genome had eleven predictions at the <italic>Ubx</italic> locus (Supplemental Fig. S3). <italic>Am_Ubx_37p2</italic> was chosen based on a high SCRMshaw score, although it falls within the fourth, rather than the third, intron. <italic>Am_Ubx_0p39</italic>, on the other hand, was in the corresponding third intron location. <italic>Am_Ubx_0p39</italic> had activity in the pouch region of the wing and haltere discs, as well as in the proximal region of leg discs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref>). <italic>Am_Ubx_37p2</italic> drove expression in specific portions of the wing and haltere discs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G</xref>). Although <italic>Ubx</italic> is not expressed in the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> wing disc (i.e., the forewing of the fly), wing activity has been observed previously with tested <italic>Ubx</italic> enhancer fragments (e.g. 42). Moreover, <italic>Ubx</italic> is expressed in both the forewing and hindwing discs in honeybees, making the reporter expression we observed driven by the two predicted <italic>A. mellifera</italic> enhancers consistent with their potential native activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>).</p>

<title>Embryonic activity</title>
<p>Although our SCRMshaw predictions were targeted toward imaginal disc activity, activity was also observed in embryos for many of the reporter lines (Supplemental Fig. S5). Analysis of this activity was complicated by the fact that our reporter vectors, while not having any basal activity in imaginal discs (Supplemental Fig. S4, A-E), displayed reporter gene expression in several tissues including hemocytes, caudal visceral mesoderm, and the proventriculus, even in the absence of a putative enhancer sequence (Supplemental Fig. S5A-D). In those lines that had reporter gene expression in other tissues (Supplemental Fig. S5I-S, X, Y), most of that expression was not clearly associated with the expected endogenous expression of the predicted target gene, although the complex embryonic expression patterns of these genes makes a definitive assessment difficult. Moreover, for most of the species, we do not currently know the expression patterns of either the gene in its native species (as opposed to the expression of its <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog), or the expression patterns of other nearby potential target genes. Further analysis, including additional control experiments, use of different reporter vectors, and assessment of gene expression patterns in each of the relevant species will be necessary before drawing final conclusions as to embryonic enhancer activity.</p>

<title>An insect regulatory annotation resource</title>
<p>Taken together, the results from our simulations, our comparisons to open chromatin regions, and our <italic>in vivo</italic> validation experiments demonstrate that SCRMshaw is remarkably effective at predicting regulatory sequences across a wide range of insect species. To facilitate access to our SCRMshaw-based regulatory annotations, we created a database with the results from our predictions using all training sets and all completed species. This database, which is freely accessible as part of the REDfly insect regulatory annotation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), contains processed final prediction data and can be searched and filtered by gene, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> ortholog, training set, enhancer location, and various other criteria. We will continue to add to this database as additional species and training sets are run through our annotation pipeline.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The resource we introduce here is part of an ongoing effort to provide an initial regulatory annotation for all sequenced insects. These annotations are not complete, as we currently lack well-curated training sets for many tissues, including key embryonic tissues such as the central nervous system and many non-embryonic tissues. We aim to generate the necessary additional training sets over time, and add these new annotations to those presented here, along with comprehensive annotation for additional species. As a predictive pipeline, SCRMshaw is subject to the usual tradeoffs of sensitivity versus specificity in generating results. Sensitivity is difficult to assess, as there is no “complete” known set of enhancers for any organism, and it is currently impossible to make an accurate estimate of what the yield should be for any of our training models. Similarly, without comprehensive <italic>in vivo</italic> testing using multiple conditions and methods, an accurate false-positive rate cannot be computed. However, we presented here several lines of evidence demonstrating that true positives significantly outweigh false positives: we non- randomly predict multiple enhancers for specific subsets of loci; we predict enhancers in orthologous loci at a rate significantly higher than random expectation; our predictions are highly enriched for regions of accessible chromatin; and we achieve a high rate of validation using <italic>in vivo</italic> reporter gene assays.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Validation success rates</title>
<p>The results from the <italic>in vivo</italic> validation experiments are summarized in <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. Overall, 17/22 (77%) of tested sequences revealed imaginal disc activity, consistent with our previous SCRMshaw success rates. 59% of these (10/17), or 45% of the total (10/22), had the correct target specificity of wing and/or haltere discs. This is again consistent with previous SCRMshaw experience, which shows that functional enhancers are predicted at a higher success rate than enhancers with specific targeted activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>These numbers may in fact underestimate the success rate of our predictions, for several reasons. One, all of the testing was performed in transgenic <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, despite the putative enhancers being from three additional species. Reduced efficiency of certain transcription factor or cofactor binding, reduced enhancer-promoter compatibility, or other species-specific differences may lead to elevated false negative results. Two, predictions for <italic>ex, klu</italic>, and <italic>ush</italic> were made using a less-effective SCRMshaw post-processing algorithm and, for <italic>A. mellifera</italic>, a less- complete genome build. This may have led to suboptimal candidate enhancer selection. Three, it is possible that some of our predicted enhancers act as silencers rather than enhancers. Silencers, which attenuate rather than promote gene expression, are less well understood than enhancers, but in at least some instances have identical sequence characteristics (and in fact can act simultaneously as enhancers in some tissues and silencers in others) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). Our reporter gene assay was not designed to detect silencers, which would therefore appear as false-positive predictions. Indeed, an intriguing possibility is that some of our sequences that had reporter gene activity in non-targeted discs (e.g., leg discs) act as enhancers in those tissues but as silencers in the targeted wing discs. Alternatively, identified enhancers that drove expression in multiple imaginal discs may simply represent pleiotropic enhancers. Enhancer pleiotropy is not uncommon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>), and moreover, there is overlap in the enhancer content of our training sets for the various discs. There are many gene expression and developmental similarities among the discs, and likely significant regulatory overlap; chromatin profiling experiments have found that wing, leg, and eye discs share the majority of their regions of accessible chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>).</p>
<p>Additional experiments will be necessary to distinguish between pleiotropic enhancers, dual- function silencers/enhancers, and other possibilities.</p>

<sec id="s3b">
<title>Redundant enhancers</title>
<p>Almost all of our training sets predicted multiple enhancers in certain loci at rates exceeding random expectation, consistent with the noted prevalence of redundant or “shadow” enhancers in numerous plant and animal species (reviewed by 27). The few training sets that did not may reflect types of tissues or regulatory processes for which having shadow enhancers is unusual, or may be indicative of poorly-performing training sets. Indeed, the sole training set that did not suggest the presence of shadow enhancers in either mosquito species, <italic>adult_PNS</italic>, also performed poorly by other metrics, such as failing to produce predictions in common over multiple species and scoring “poor” using our <italic>pCRM_eval</italic> training set evaluation tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the evolutionary origins of shadow enhancers are not well understood, several studies suggest that at least one important contribution of shadow enhancers is to provide phenotypic robustness during development, particularly during stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). In some cases, a mechanistic basis for this robustness has been suggested by the finding that different groups of transcription factors act on individual members of a shadow enhancer set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>). Further support for this idea can be found in the fact that shadow enhancers appear to have limited sequence similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). However, our successes with SCRMshaw have demonstrated that enhancers can have little overt sequence similarity but still rely on the same underlying subsequence (and presumably, transcription factor binding) model. As the potential shadow enhancers we identify are predicted using the same training set, they are likely to be functioning using similar, rather than independent, regulatory mechanisms. Thus, shadow enhancers appear to come in at least two flavors: those that use similar mechanisms, such as those identified here, and those that use different mechanisms, such as the <italic>Krüppel</italic> enhancers studied by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>).</p>

<title>Enhancer evolution at large divergence distances</title>
<p>SCRMshaw’s ability to find putatively “orthologous” enhancers—i.e., enhancers in orthologous loci predicted using the same regulatory model—not only substantiates the non-random nature of our prediction approach, but also opens the door to exciting studies of enhancer evolution over large divergence ranges. We previously illustrated the power of such an approach with an analysis of a small number of enhancers in just 2-3 highly diverged species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). However, the greatly increased number of species for which we now have regulatory predictions should allow us to follow the evolution of specific enhancers over their entire divergence range. Although the number of common loci tails off rapidly as the number of species considered increases, we suspect that this small (albeit statistically significant) number understates the true results. For one, only a limited number of species have been evaluated for common predictions so far, and these are not evenly distributed along the phylogenetic spectrum of sequenced species. Also, our analysis depends wholly on the presence of recognized <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> orthologous genes to define the common loci. This in turn is dependent on several factors, including the sensitivity and accuracy of our ortholog-calling pipeline, the reliability of the protein annotations we use in that pipeline, and on accurate target gene assignments. Each of these has known sources of error. For example, our ortholog-calling pipeline currently does not disambiguate multiple paralogs (see Methods), and ortholog detection has been shown to be sensitive to the method used for generating protein annotation, in particular when different annotation methods have been applied to different species in the comparison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>). Moreover, our target gene assignments are presently based solely on closest-gene relationships, a method which is known to mis-assign a fair number of enhancer-gene target pairings (e.g. 62, 63, 64) and which does not take into account complexities in genome architecture such as nested genes, long non-coding RNAs, promoter competition, and the like (which are common in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, e.g. 65, 66). Developing effective and scalable solutions to these issues will be an important goal for future work.</p>
<p>As the number of species in our prediction database with fully mapped orthologs grows, it will become possible to ask increasingly sophisticated questions about the nature of enhancer evolution. For instance, we will be able to determine whether the numbers of putatively orthologous enhancer predictions follow phylogenetic relationships and degree of sequence divergence, and whether certain loci are only found in common for specific groups of species. Also in need of further investigation will be to determine whether sets of common enhancers are restricted to certain functional Gene Ontology categories, and how this might vary with phylogenetic grouping.</p>

<title>Ongoing regulatory annotation</title>
<p>While effective, SCRMshaw still has various limitations and aspects in need of improvement. Errors in genome assembly and insufficient repeat masking both appear to contribute to overly long predictions (multiple kilobases) that are unlikely to represent individual single enhancers (HA and MSH, unpublished observations). Poor assembly, while not having major effects on SCRMshaw overall, can significantly affect results at specific loci, as can inaccurate gene annotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Also requiring further investigation is how to best combine and weight the scores from the three individual SCRMshaw scoring methods of IMM, hexMCD, and PAC-rc. Individual SCRMshaw predictions should therefore be treated as just that—predictions—and appropriate validation experiments are recommended for any sequences of interest. The regulatory annotations presented here represent initial “1.0” versions of the regulatory genome. Like all genome annotations, these will continue to be revised as updated models become available, including addition of new training sets, confidence scores based on validation experiments, and improved genome builds. Nevertheless, the enrichment scores from our <italic>in silico</italic> experiments and the true-positive rates from our <italic>in vivo</italic> reporter gene experiments suggest that overall, true positive rates for most training sets are between 50-85%, with most likely having success rates exceeding 70%. Note that even this lower bound of a 50% true positive rate means that one out of every two predictions is correct—a more than acceptable rate to encourage follow-up experiments for predicted enhancers in organisms of interest. The catalog of predicted enhancers we introduce here, spanning 33 insect species and growing, should thus be useful resource for both large-scale and small-scale studies of the insect regulatory genome.</p>

<title>Evaluating the number of predictions per locus</title>

The results were then permuted 1000 times using BEDTools “shuffle”, with coding regions excluded. BEDTools “closest” was used to assign upstream and downstream flanking genes to each of the permuted predictions, with the following parameters: the ’-io’ flag was enabled to ignore any overlaps between predictions and genes, and ’-D ref -id’ and ‘-D ref -iu’ were used to obtain the closest 5’ and 3’ genes (with respect to chromosome coordinates), respectively. A custom Python script, <italic>checkSameLocus_ForSimulations.py</italic> (located at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/HalfonLab/UtilityPrograms/blob/master/checkSameLocus_ForSimulations.py">https://github.com/HalfonLab/UtilityPrograms/blob/master/checkSameLocus_ForSimulations.py</ext-link>) was used to calculate the number of predictions per locus for both the real and permuted results. For this purpose, “locus” was defined as the entire region between the left and right flanking genes for each SCRMshaw prediction; that is, for each prediction we take the region between the 3’ end of the upstream gene and the transcription start site of the downstream gene. If a prediction is within an intron, we define the locus as the entire span of the enclosing gene. If a prediction overlaps two genes, the locus is considered to be the entire span of the two genes.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> manuscript uses a machine-learning approach to predict and annotate cis-regulatory elements across insect genomes, helping to address a much-needed gap in comparative genomics. This method does not rely on sequence alignments, thereby allowing functional genomics studies of more distant species, including emerging model organisms. There are nuanced views on the strength of the evidence from the predictions: the pipeline appears to be based on <bold>solid</bold> evidence, but the methods could be better described. We suggest the manuscript would be much more robust if the code used was accessible for review and validated further.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors provide a genome annotation resource of 33 insects using a motif-blind prediction method for tissue-specific cis-regulatory modules. This is a welcome addition that may facilitate further research in new laboratory systems, and the approach seems to be relatively accurate, although it should be combined with other sources of evidence to be practical.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The paper clearly presents the resource, including the testing of candidate enhancers identified from various insects in Drosophila. This cross-species analysis, and the inherent suggestion that training datasets generated in flies can predict a cis-regulatory activity in distant insects, is interesting. While I can not be sure this approach will prevail in the future, for example with approaches that leverage the prediction of TF binding motifs, the SCRMShaw tool is certainly useful and worth consideration for the large community of genome scientists working on insects.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the authors made the effort to provide access to the SCRMShaw annotations via the RedFly database, the usefulness of this resource is somewhat limited at the moment. First, it is possible to generate tables of annotated elements with coordinates, but it would be more useful to allow downloads of the 33 genome annotations in GFF (or equivalent) format, with SCRMshaw predictions appearing as a new feature. Also, I should note that unlike most species some annotations seem to have issues in the current RedFly implementation. For example, Vcar and Jcoen turn empty.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The ability of researchers to identify and compare enhancers across different species is an important facet of understanding gene regulation across development and evolution. Many traditional methods of enhancer identification involve sequence alignments and manual annotations, limiting the ability to expand the scope of regulatory investigations into many species. In order to overcome this obstacle, the authors apply a previously published machine learning method called SCRMshaw to predict enhancers across 33 insect species, using D. melanogaster as a reference. SCRMshaw operates through the selection of a few dozen training loci in a reference genome, marking genomic loci in other species that are significantly enriched with similar k-mer distributions relative to randomly selected genomic backgrounds. Upon identification of predicted enhancer regions, the authors perform post-processing step filtering and identify the most likely predicted enhancer candidates based on the proximity of an orthologous target gene. They then perform reporter gene analysis to validate selected predicted enhancers from other species in D. melanogaster. The analysis of the expression patterns returned variable results across the selected predicted regions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors provide annotations of predicted regions across dozens of insect species, with the intention of expanding and refining the annotations for use by the scientific field. This is useful, as researchers will be able to use the identified annotations for their own work or as a benchmark for future methods. This work also showcases the flexible and versatile nature of SCRMshaw, which can readily obtain predictions using training sets of genomic loci requiring only a few dozen annotations as input. SCRMshaw does not require sequence alignments of the enhancers and can operate without prior knowledge of the cis-regulatory sequence rules such as transcription factor binding motifs, making it a useful tool to explore the evolution of enhancers in further distant and less well-studied species.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This work provides predicted enhancer annotations across many insect species, with reporter gene analysis being conducted on selected regions to test the predictions. However, the code for the SCRMshaw analysis pipeline used in this work is not made available, making reproducibility of this work difficult. Additionally, while the authors claim the predicted enhancers are available within the REDfly database, the predicted enhancer coordinates are currently not downloadable as Supplementary Material or from a linked resource.</p>
<p>The authors do not validate or benchmark the application of SCRMshaw against other published methods, nor do they seek to apply SCRMshaw under a variety of conditions to confirm the robustness of the returned predicted enhancers across species. Since SCRMshaw relies on an established k-mer enrichment of the training loci, its performance is presumably highly sensitive to the selection of training regions as well as the statistical power of the given k-mer counts. The authors do not justify their selection of training regions by which they perform predictions.</p>
<p>While there is an attempt made to report and validate the annotated predicted enhancers using previously published data and tools, the validation lacks the depth to conclude with confidence that the predicted set of regions across each species is of high quality. In vivo, reporter assays were conducted to anecdotally confirm the validity of a few selected regions experimentally, but even these results are difficult to interpret. There is no large-scale attempt to assess the conservation of enhancer function across all annotated species.</p>
<p>Lastly, it is suggested that predicted regions are derived from the shared presence of sequence features such as transcription factor binding motifs, detected through k-mer enrichment via SCRMshaw. This assumption has not been examined, although there are public motif discovery tools that would be appropriate to discover whether SCRMshaw is assigning predicted regions based on previously understood motif grammar, or due to other sequence patterns captured by k-mer count distributions. Understanding the sequence-derived nature of what drives predictions is within the scope of this work and would boost confidence in the predicted enhancers, even if it is limited to a few training examples for the sake of clarity of interpretation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this ambitious paper, the authors develop an unparalleled community resource of insect genome regulatory annotations spanning five insect orders. They employ their previously-developed SCRMshaw method for computational cross-species enhancer prediction, drawing on available training datasets of validated enhancer sequence and expression from Drosophila melanogaster, which had been previously shown to perform well across select holometabolous insects (representing 160-345MY divergence). In this work, they expand regulatory sequence annotation to 33 insect genomes spanning Holometabola and Hemiptera, which is even more distantly related to the fly model. They perform multiple downstream analyses of sets of predicted enhancers to assess the true-positive rate of predictions; the independent comparisons of real predictions with simulated predictions and with chromatin accessibility data, as well as the functional validation through reporter gene analysis, strengthen their conclusions that their annotation pipeline achieves a high true-positive rate and can be used across long divergence times to computationally annotate regulatory genome regions, an ability that has been previously inaccessible for non-model insects and now is possible across the many newly-sequenced insect scaffold-level genomes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work fills a large gap in current methods and resources for predicting regulatory regions of the genome, a task that has long lagged behind that of coding region prediction and analysis.</p>
<p>Despite technical constraints in working outside of well-developed model insect systems, the authors creatively draw on existing resources to scaffold a pipeline and independently assess the likelihood of prediction validity.</p>
<p>The established database will be a welcome community resource in its current state, and even more so as the authors continue to expand their annotations to more insect genomes as they indicate. Their available analysis pipeline itself will be useful to the community as well for research groups that may want to undertake their own regulatory genome annotation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The rates of predicted true positive enhancer identification vary widely across the genomes included here based on the simulations and comparison to datasets of accessible chromatin in a manner that doesn't map neatly onto phylogenetic distance. At this point, it is unclear why these patterns may arise, although this may become more clear as regulatory annotation is undertaken for more genomes.</p>
<p>Functional assessment of predicted enhancers was performed through reporter gene assays primarily in Drosophila melanogaster imaginal discs, a system amenable to transgenics. Unfortunately, this mode of canonical imaginal disc development is only representative of a subset of all holometabolous insects; therefore, it is difficult to interpret reporter gene expression in a fly imaginal disc as evidence of a true positive enhancer that would be active in its native species whose adult appendages develop differently through the larval stage (for example, Coleopteran and Lepidopteran legs). However, the reporter gene assays from other tissues do offer strong evidence of true positive enhancer detection, and constraints on transgenic experiments in other systems mean that this approach is the best available.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewers for their thoughtful and insightful comments. We were pleased to see that the reviewers and editors consider our work a “welcome addition” that “fills a large gap” in comparative genomics methods and provides “an unparalleled community resource of insect genome regulatory annotations.”</p>
<p>Many of the reviewers’ comments reflect weaknesses in our description of the methodology. As the basic SCRMshaw methodology has been published previously, we had opted for brevity over detail in the current manuscript. We recognize now that we went too far in that direction, and we will include more methodological detail in our revised submission, along with easier access to the code we used. The reviewers also offered some helpful suggestions regarding data availability which we intend to address, including direct download of the results in GFF format and adding to the results database several species that were inadvertently omitted.</p>
<p>Reviewer 2 expressed concerns about benchmarking SCRMshaw against other methods. We respectfully feel this lies outside the scope of the current study, which focuses on application of SCRMshaw to generate a multi-species annotation resource rather than on an attempt to show that SCRMshaw is superior to other approaches. We provide evidence in this manuscript, as well as in previous publications, that supports the effectiveness of SCRMshaw as an approach for regulatory element discovery that is suitable for the task at hand. Benchmarking for regulatory element discovery brings many challenges, as there are no comprehensive “truth” sets to serve as a comparison baseline. We therefore do not attempt strong claims here about the relative merits of SCRMshaw vs. other methods (although we have explored this in previous publications). Note that we also previously demonstrated commonality of transcription factor binding sites in cross-species SCRMshaw predictions, in particular in Kazemian et al. 2014 (<italic>Genome Biol. Evol.</italic> 6:2301).</p>
<p>Finally, because it has important implications for understanding our results, we would like to point out a small misconception in Reviewer 2’s Summary of our study. The reviewer states that we “identify the most likely predicted enhancer candidates based on the proximity of an orthologous target gene.” We stress, however, that putative target gene assignments and identities have no impact at all on our prediction of regulatory sequences. Predictions are solely based on sequence-dependent SCRMshaw scores, with no regard to the nature or identities of nearby annotated features. Putative target genes are mapped to <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologs purely as a convenience to aid in interpreting and prioritizing the predicted regulatory elements. We will take care to clarify this important point in our revised submission.</p>
