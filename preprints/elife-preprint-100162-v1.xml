<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by alterations in social communication and interaction, as well as the presentation of restricted, repetitive behaviors (APA, 2022). Given that ASD has high heritability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Sandin et al., 2017</xref>), much work has been done in the last 30 years to identify genes that confer risk of developing ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">De Rubeis et al., 2014</xref>; Iossifov et al., 2014; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sanders et al., 2015</xref>). Through this, hundreds of high-confidence risk genes have been identified, varying greatly in the proteins for which they code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Satterstrom et al., 2020</xref>). These include transcriptional and translational regulators, ion channels, receptors, cell adhesion molecules, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">De Rubeis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Delorme et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ebert &amp; Greenberg, 2013</xref>). Recent work has focused on identifying brain regions and circuits that may be commonly affected by ASD-related mutations. The basal ganglia, in particular the striatum, represents one such commonly altered brain region and prior studies have demonstrated changes in striatal circuit function and striatum-associated behaviors in mice with mutations in ASD risk genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Benthall et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Fuccillo, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Peca et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Peixoto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Platt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Rothwell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). However, whether basal ganglia circuits are convergently changed in ASD mouse models is an open question. Here we investigated whether loss of function of the syndromic ASD risk gene <italic>Cntnap2</italic> alters striatal physiology and basal ganglia-dependent behaviors in mice.</p>
<p><italic>Cntnap2</italic> codes for a neurexin-like cell adhesion molecule called Contactin-associated protein-like 2 (Caspr2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Poliak et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Poliak et al., 2003</xref>). In mice, Caspr2 is expressed in several cortical and subcortical regions, including the striatum, from embryonic day 14 (E14) onward into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Penagarikano et al., 2011</xref>). Caspr2 is primarily localized at the juxtaparanodes of myelinated axons and is involved in the clustering of potassium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Poliak et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Scott et al., 2019</xref>). In mice, <italic>in vitro</italic> work suggests that Caspr2 may also play a role in AMPAR trafficking and cell morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Anderson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Gdalyahu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Varea et al., 2015</xref>), and <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies indicate that it can control cell excitability and circuit synchronicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Martin-de-Saavedra et al., 2022</xref>). Caspr2 is important during neurodevelopment and has been implicated in neuronal migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Penagarikano et al., 2011</xref>), the maturation and function of parvalbumin-positive GABAergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Penagarikano et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Scott et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Vogt et al., 2018</xref>), and the timing of myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Scott et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>CNTNAP2</italic> mutations in people lead to a neurodevelopmental syndrome that can include language disorders, epilepsy, obsessive compulsive disorder, and ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Penagarikano &amp; Geschwind, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Rodenas-Cuadrado et al., 2014</xref>). A mouse model of this syndrome, <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup>,</italic> has been shown to exhibit good face validity for ASD-relevant social and motor behavior alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Brunner et al., 2015</xref>; Dawes et al., 2018; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Penagarikano et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Scott et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the impact of <italic>Cntnap2</italic> loss on striatal synaptic physiology and excitability and corticostriatal-dependent behaviors has not been comprehensively assessed.</p>
<p>The striatum is primarily composed of GABAergic striatal projection neurons (SPNs), which make up two functionally distinct output pathways: the D1-receptor expressing cells of the direct pathway (dSPNs), which project to substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), and the D2- receptor expressing cells of the indirect pathway (iSPNs), which project to external globus pallidus (GPe) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Calabresi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Gerfen &amp; Surmeier, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Kravitz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Tai et al., 2012</xref>). The two types of SPNs are intermixed throughout the striatum and receive excitatory glutamatergic inputs from cortex and thalamus, as well as dopaminergic input from the midbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ding et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Doig et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Gerfen &amp; Surmeier, 2011</xref>). Coordinated activity between the populations of SPNs in response to these inputs mediates action selection, motor learning and habit formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Hawes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Santos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Yin et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">2006</xref>). Although SPNs comprise upwards of 95% of the cells in striatum, there are a wide range of distinct interneurons, primarily GABAergic, that contribute significantly to the inhibitory circuitry of the striatum. Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons, which make up â¼2% of the cells in striatum, provide the largest feedforward inhibition onto SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Burke et al., 2017</xref>). Changes in the number and/or function of PV interneurons have been identified in several ASD mouse models, including <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice, implicating PV circuitry as a potential common alteration across ASD mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Filice et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Juarez &amp; Martinez Cerdeno, 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine how loss of <italic>Cntnap2</italic> affects striatal function, we assessed the physiology of SPNs and striatal PV-interneurons in the dorsolateral striatum and utilized a range of assays to assess striatum-associated behaviors in <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. We find that SPNs of both the direct and indirect pathways exhibit increased corticostriatal drive, despite unchanged excitatory cortical input onto these cells. Although decreased inhibitory function has been identified in other brain regions in <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice, we find no deficit in broad or PV-specific inhibitory input onto SPNs in the case of <italic>Cntnap2</italic> loss. Instead, we identify a significant increase in the intrinsic excitability of SPNs in <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, in particular in dSPNs, which likely underlies the increased corticostriatal drive of these cells. Behaviorally, we find that <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice exhibit RRB-like behaviors including increased grooming, marble burying and nose poking in the holeboard assay. <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice also exhibit increased motor routine learning in the accelerating rotarod, and cognitive inflexibility in an odor-based reversal learning task. Taken together, these findings suggest that enhanced direct pathway drive may play a role in the spontaneous and learned repetitive behaviors exhibited by these mice.</p>

<p>Emerging evidence suggests that corticostriatal synapses are a common site of alteration in mouse models of ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Li &amp; Pozzo-Miller, 2020</xref>). To test whether mice with loss of <italic>Cntnap2</italic> exhibit changes in corticostriatal connectivity, we crossed <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice to <italic>Thy1-</italic> ChR2-YFP mice, which express channelrhodopsin in a subset of layer V pyramidal neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Arenkiel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Poliak et al., 1999</xref>). These mice were crossed to a D1-tdTomato reporter line to visually identify dSPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ade et al., 2011</xref>). We recorded from SPNs in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS), as this sensorimotor striatal subregion is implicated in the acquisition of habitual and procedural behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Packard &amp; Knowlton, 2002</xref>). Changes in physiological function in this area may be connected to the acquisition of repetitive motor behaviors in ASD (APA, 2022; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Fuccillo, 2016</xref>). To simulate a train of cortical inputs, we applied ten pulses of blue light over the recording site in DLS and measured the number of action potentials (APs) fired by SPNs in the absence of synaptic blockers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). We altered the light intensity to vary the probability of eliciting subthreshold depolarizations or AP firing. dSPNs were identified using tdTomato fluorescence, and tdTomato negative neurons were designated putative iSPNs.</p>

<p>We quantified the number of evoked APs at different light intensities and found that both dSPNs and iSPNs in young adult <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice exhibited significantly increased spike probability compared to wild-type (WT) SPNs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-E</xref>). This suggests increased corticostriatal drive, consistent with findings in another mouse model with loss of function of the ASD-risk gene <italic>Tsc1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Benthall et al., 2021</xref>). To test whether the enhanced spiking probability was due to a change in the synaptic excitability of <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic>SPNs, we applied blue light of varying intensity over the recording site in DLS to evoke AMPAR-driven excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs). We found that the average optically-evoked EPSC amplitude was not significantly different across a range of light intensities in <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic>dSPNs or iSPNs compared to WT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F-I</xref>).</p>
<p>To further assess synaptic inputs, we measured the number of dendritic spines in <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and WT SPNs, which are typically the sites of cortical synaptic innervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bouyer et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Xu et al., 1989</xref>). To visualize spines, we injected neonate <italic>Cntnap2;Drd1a</italic>-tdTomato mice with AAV5-<italic>Syn1</italic>-GFP virus to sparsely label dSPNs and iSPNs in the DLS (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Keaveney et al., 2018</xref>). We found that <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> SPNs in adult mice had similar spine density as WT (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>), suggesting no overall change in synapse number. Together, these results show that dSPNs and iSPNs in <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice exhibit enhanced cortically-driven spiking.</p>
<p>However, this is not due to a change in corticostriatal synaptic strength or overall synapse density.</p>
<p>Increased corticostriatal drive in <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice is not due to reduced inhibition Previous work has indicated a reduction in the number and/or function of fast-spiking parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons across multiple brain regions in <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ahmed et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Antoine et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Jurgensen &amp; Castillo, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Paterno et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Penagarikano et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Vogt et al., 2018</xref>). While inhibitory deficits have been identified in the cortex and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Antoine et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Jurgensen &amp; Castillo, 2015</xref>), and the number of PV interneurons has been reported to be decreased in striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Penagarikano et al., 2011</xref>), a comprehensive assessment of inhibitory synaptic function has yet to be completed in the striatum of <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. We first determined whether there were global deficits in inhibition onto SPNs in <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice using intrastriatal electrical stimulation to evoke inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). In <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> dSPNs, the average electrically-evoked IPSCs across a range of stimulation intensities were not different from WT dSPNs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B,C</xref>). However, in <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> iSPNs, IPSCs were, on average, slightly larger than those in WT iSPNs, although we note that the responses were variable across cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D,E</xref>).</p>

<p>Given that the increased cortical drive onto <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic>SPNs could not be explained by changes in excitatory or inhibitory synaptic function, we tested whether it could be due to a change in the intrinsic excitability of SPNs. To measure this, we recorded from dSPNs and iSPNs in <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic>;D1-tdTomato mice and injected current steps of increasing amplitude. We found that <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> SPNs exhibited significantly increased intrinsic excitability compared to WT SPNs, which was most pronounced for dSPNs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-L</xref>). <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> dSPNs, but not iSPNs,</p>
<p>also had reduced rheobase current (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>), the minimum current required to evoke an AP, as well as increased membrane resistance (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>).

<title><italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice exhibit increased repetitive behaviors</title>
<p>RRBs comprise one of the primary symptom domains of ASD (APA, 2022). Alterations in striatal circuits are thought to be involved in the manifestation of RRBs, given the striatumâs role in action selection and motor control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Estes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Fuccillo, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hollander et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Langen et al., 2014</xref>). To determine whether changes in motor behavior accompanied the altered striatal physiology in <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, we assessed locomotor activity and spontaneous repetitive behaviors using the open field, marble burying, and holeboard assays (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-D</xref>).

<p>To further assess motor behaviors in <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, we utilized the marble burying assay (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>), which takes advantage of a mouseâs natural tendency to dig or bury. The number of marbles buried is used as a measure of persistent or repetitive behavior (Angoa- Perez et al., 2013). We found that <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice buried significantly more marbles on average than WT controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4J</xref>). Another measure of repetitive behavior, which is based on the natural exploratory behavior of mice is the holeboard assay (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). In this task, the number of nose pokes made into unbaited holes is recorded. We found that <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice made significantly more nose pokes within a 10-minute period than WT mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4K</xref>). This was largely due to increased poking during the last 5 minutes of the test (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4L-M</xref>), indicating persistent poking behavior in <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. Together with the increased grooming identified in the open field, increased marble burying and nose poking indicate an increase in RRBs in <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice.

<p>To gain further insight into the spontaneous behavior profile of <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice, we utilized a combination of DeepLabCut and Keypoint-MoSeq to perform unbiased, machine learning-based assessment of general locomotion and behavior in an additional cohort of <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4N-P</xref>, S5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Mathis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Wiltschko et al., 2020</xref>). Again, we found that <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice did not exhibit major changes in general locomotor activity compared to WT littermates (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A</xref>). Analysis of movement âsyllablesâ using Keypoint-MoSeq revealed that across the 25 most frequently performed syllables, two syllables associated with grooming were performed with significantly increased frequency in <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5N</xref>). <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice also had an increase in the total number of grooming bouts (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5B</xref>), replicating the findings in the manually scored cohort (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I</xref>).

<p>A measure of the entropy of syllable transitions revealed that <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice exhibited less entropy, suggesting less variability in the transition from one movement syllable to the next (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4O</xref>). This rigidity in motor sequence may be indicative of more restricted motor behavior overall. Finally, we tested whether a trained decoder could accurately distinguish WT and <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice using information about movement, syllable usage, or syllable transitions. The decoding models performed significantly better than chance at identifying WT and <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice based on their syllable usage and transitions, but not general locomotor activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4P</xref>). Together, this analysis demonstrates that while overall locomotor activity is not strongly affected in <italic>Cnantp2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, the behavior patterns of these mice are distinct from WT, reflecting enhanced presence of RRBs.</p>

<p>The accelerating rotarod is a striatal-dependent measure of motor coordination and learning that has been used across a range of ASD mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cording &amp; Bateup, 2023</xref>). Changes in corticostriatal circuits have been identified in mouse models of ASD with altered performance in the task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cording &amp; Bateup, 2023</xref>). Given the altered corticostriatal drive in <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, we tested whether motor coordination and learning were affected in these mice. In the rotarod test, mice learn to walk and then run to stay on a rotating rod as it increases in speed over the course of five minutes. Mice perform three trials a day for four days. In trials one through six, the rod increases in speed from five to 40 revolutions per minute (RPM), while in trials seven through 12 the rod increases from 10 to 80 RPM (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Learning occurs over trials within a day, as well as across days, as the mouse develops and hones a stereotyped motor pattern to stay on the rod for increasing amounts of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Rothwell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Yin et al., 2009</xref>). We found that <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice performed significantly better than WT mice in this task, in particular, in the later trials when the rod rotates at the faster 10 to 80 RPM speed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p>
<p>Initial performance (terminal velocity on trial one) was not significantly different between WT and <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>), but the learning rate from trial one to trial 12 was increased in <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>).

<title><italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice exhibit cognitive inflexibility</title>
<p>RRBs include not just stereotyped movements, but also insistence on sameness and perseverative interests (APA, 2022). Cognitive inflexibility, a deficit in the ability to flexibly adapt to changes in the environment and update behavior, is a manifestation of ASD and some other psychiatric disorders, which are associated with striatal dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Fuccillo, 2016</xref>). Indeed, in individuals with ASD, the severity of RRBs is associated with measures of cognitive inflexibility, and evidence from imaging studies suggests that altered corticostriatal connectivity may be present in the case of both repetitive behaviors and cognitive inflexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Uddin, 2021</xref>). To assess cognitive flexibility in <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice, we utilized a four-choice odor-based reversal learning assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Lin et al., 2022</xref>). Briefly, mice are trained to dig for a reward in one of four pots containing scented wood shavings (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). On the first day of the task (acquisition), the rewarded pot is scented with odor one (O1). Mice reach criterion when they have chosen O1 for at least eight of 10 consecutive trials. On day two, mice are given a recall test in which the rewarded pot is again scented with O1. After reaching criterion, the reversal trials begin, and the rewarded pot is scented with the previously unrewarded odor two (O2). To reach criterion, mice must learn the new association of O2 and reward and choose O2 for eight of 10 consecutive trials.</p>

<p>During acquisition, <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice performed similarly to WT controls, not differing in the average number of trials needed to reach criterion, the number of quadrant entries made before making a choice, or the latency to choose a pot (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B-D</xref>). On day two, <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice performed similarly to controls during recall, demonstrating successful consolidation of the odor- reward pairing (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). However, we found that <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice exhibited a deficit in reversal learning, requiring significantly more trials on average than WTs to reach criterion once the odor-reward pairing was changed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>). Interestingly, during reversal, <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice made fewer quadrant entries before making a digging choice and exhibited significantly decreased latency to make a choice compared to controls (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G,H</xref>). Even after the first correct choice of O2 during reversal, <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice took more trials to reach criterion than WTs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6I</xref>). In terms of errors, <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice made more reversal errors than WT mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6J</xref>), in particular perseverative (continuing to choose O1) and regressive (choosing O1 after correctly choosing O2 once) errors (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6K</xref>). <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice did not differ from WT controls in choices of the novel (newly introduced during reversal) or irrelevant (never rewarded) odors, or in the number of omitted trials (timing out without making a choice) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6K</xref>). Instead, the persistence in choosing O1, even after at least one correct choice of O2, drove the cognitive inflexibility in these mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6L</xref>). This persistence in choice may be reflective of the broader scope of RRBs in <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we tested whether loss of the ASD risk gene <italic>Cntnap2</italic> results in altered striatal physiology or striatal-dependent behavior. We found that both direct and indirect pathway SPNs exhibited significantly increased cortical drive in <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. This change was likely not due to a change in excitatory or inhibitory synapses, as excitatory cortical input onto SPNs was unchanged and there were no significant deficits in inhibition onto SPNs in these mice. Instead, loss of <italic>Cntnap2</italic> resulted in a significant increase in the intrinsic excitability of SPNs, in particular dSPNs. At the behavioral level, <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice exhibited repetitive behaviors including increased grooming, nose poking, and marble burying. These mice also had enhanced motor learning, performing significantly better than controls in the accelerating rotarod task. Finally, <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice exhibited cognitive inflexibility in the four-choice reversal learning task.</p>

<title>Cellular phenotypes of <italic>Cntnap2</italic> loss</title>
<p>The loss of Caspr2 has a variable impact on intrinsic excitability across brain regions and cell types. The increased intrinsic excitability that we identified in SPNs has also been observed in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Fernandez et al., 2021</xref>) and pyramidal cells of the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Antoine et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cifuentes-Diaz et al., 2023</xref>). However, we note hypoactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Brumback et al., 2018</xref>) or unchanged excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Lazaro et al., 2019</xref>) of pyramidal cells in some cortical regions in <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. Caspr2 is involved in the clustering of voltage-gated potassium channels, in particular at the juxtaparanodes of myelinated axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Poliak et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Poliak et al., 2003</xref>) and the axon initial segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Inda et al., 2006</xref>). Indeed, there are profound deficits in the clustering of Kv1-family channels in <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, particularly Kv1.2 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Scott et al., 2019</xref>). These channels play an important role in regulating the intrinsic excitability of SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Nisenbaum et al., 1994</xref>), and when blocked, result in decreased rheobase and increased firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Shen et al., 2004</xref>). The loss of Caspr2 in <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice may result in improper localization of these channels, which could contribute to the decreased rheobase and increased SPN excitability we observed. While Caspr2 has most often been discussed for this interaction with Kv1-family channels, recent work has shown that it can also play a role in calcium signaling. The extracellular domain of Caspr2, after undergoing cleavage through proteolytic processing, can interact with the calcium extrusion pump PMCA2, promoting calcium export and likely decreasing cell excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Martin-de-Saavedra et al., 2022</xref>). This process, which increases with neuronal activity, may be disrupted in <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, which could also contribute to the increased intrinsic excitability that we found in SPNs.</p>
<p>Prior studies of <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice have identified changes in the number of PV-expressing interneurons in the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Penagarikano et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Vogt et al., 2018</xref>), hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Paterno et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Penagarikano et al., 2011</xref>) and striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Penagarikano et al., 2011</xref>). However, this finding is inconsistent across studies, as others have reported no change in the number of PV interneurons in these regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ahmed et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Lauber et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Scott et al., 2019</xref>). One possible explanation for this disparity is altered PV protein expression in <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice such that immunoreactivity varies in cell counting assessments. This is supported by the finding that the number of Vicia Villosa Agglutinin-positive (VVA+) perineuronal nets that preferentially surround PV cells is unchanged in <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, even when PV immunoreactivity varies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hartig et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Haunso et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Lauber et al., 2018</xref>). Parvalbumin, a Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer, plays an important role in the intrinsic fast-spiking properties of PV interneurons, such that a reduction in PV protein expression is known to change PV intrinsic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Orduz et al., 2013</xref>). However, altered intrinsic properties of PV interneurons has also been variably reported across brain regions and studies of <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, with subtle changes in PV firing properties reported in the developing striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ahmed et al., 2023</xref>) and adult cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Vogt et al., 2018</xref>), but unchanged in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Paterno et al., 2021</xref>) and medial prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Lazaro et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, we find no significant change in the number of PV interneurons or the striatal expression of PV protein in <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice. Following from this, we find no significant deficit in inhibition onto SPNs nor do we find any differences in PV interneuron intrinsic excitability in these mice. Interestingly, we find that broad inhibition measured through intrastriatal stimulation is enhanced specifically onto iSPNs in <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. This change is likely driven by altered function or connectivity of another type of striatal interneuron, or other SPNs, which provide lateral inhibition onto iSPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Burke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Koos et al., 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Loss of <italic>Cntnap2</italic> alters striatal-dependent behaviors</title>
<p>The striatum can be separated into functionally distinct subregions. We focused on the dorsal striatum in this study because of its role in controlling motor and cognitive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Voorn et al., 2004</xref>), which are relevant to ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Fuccillo, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Subramanian et al., 2017</xref>). The dorsal striatum can be further subdivided into the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) and the dorsolateral striatum (DLS), with the former considered an associative region involved in goal- directed action-outcome learning and the latter implicated in the acquisition of habitual or procedural behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Packard &amp; Knowlton, 2002</xref>). We focused on cell function in DLS as stereotyped, perseverative or persistent behaviors likely recruit DLS circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Evans et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Fuccillo, 2016</xref>). In the accelerating rotarod assay, learning and performance in the task has been associated with changes in the DLS. Positive modulation of the firing rate of DLS neurons occurs during rotarod training, in particular in later trials of the task, and synaptic potentiation of DLS SPNs in late training is necessary for intact performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Yin et al., 2009</xref>). In line with this, lesions of the DLS impair both early and late rotarod learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Yin et al., 2009</xref>). We found that <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice had increased rotarod performance, most notably at the later stages when DLS function is strongly implicated. Functionally, we also found increased cortical drive of DLS SPNs in these mice, in particular of dSPNs, a change that was associated with increased rotarod performance in another mouse model with disruption of an ASD-risk gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Benthall et al., 2021</xref>). Together, this supports a connection between the functional change observed in DLS SPN physiology and the increased motor routine learning in <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice.</p>
<p>In terms of restricted, repetitive behaviors, we replicated prior studies showing increased spontaneous grooming in <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Penagarikano et al., 2011</xref>). Early evidence implicates the striatum in the control of the syntax or sequence of movements in a rodent grooming bout, such that very small lesions of DLS are capable of disrupting grooming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Cromwell &amp; Berridge, 1996</xref>). However, recent work has also outlined roles for cellular modulation in DMS and ventral striatal Islands of Calleja in the control of grooming behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Ramirez-Armenta et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice also exhibited increased marble burying and nose poking. The precise neurobiological substrates of these behaviors are yet unclear, but evidence linking increases in these behaviors to changes in cortico-striatal and amygdala-striatal function supports the notion that these behaviors may fit into a broader basal ganglia-associated RRB- like domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Albelda &amp; Joel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Lee et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>In the four-choice reversal learning task, <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice showed no differences during the acquisition phase, suggesting that there were no broad deficits in learning. However, in the reversal stage of the task, <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice took significantly more trials to learn a new odor- reward pairing, owing primarily to continued choice of the previously rewarded odor. The DMS and ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens) have been shown to play an important role in reversal learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Izquierdo et al., 2017</xref>), and in the four choice task specifically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Delevich et al., 2022</xref>). Additionally, decreased dopamine release in the DLS is associated with deficits in reversal learning in this task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kosillo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Lin et al., 2022</xref>). Together, the learning phenotypes seen in <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice in the accelerating rotarod and reversal learning assay share an underlying rigidity in behavioral choice. In both cases, changes in striatal circuits likely underlie the repetitive, stereotyped behaviors.</p>
<p>In summary, our results fit into a model whereby divergent cellular changes in the striatum driven by a functionally diverse set of ASD risk genes similarly enhance corticostriatal drive, in particular, of the direct pathway. This in turn may facilitate striatal-dependent motor routine learning and behavioral perseveration. We speculate that a shared gain-of-function in striatal circuits may play a role in the formation of perseverative or repetitive behaviors in a sub- set of ASDs more broadly.</p>

After rinsing, membranes were blocked in 5% milk in 1x TBS with 1% Tween (TBS-Tween) for 1 hour at RT before being incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 5% milk in TBS-Tween overnight at 4Â° C. The following day, after 3 x 10 min washes with TBS-Tween, membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 hour at RT. Following 6 Ã 10 min washes, membranes were incubated with chemiluminescence substrate (PerkinElmer #NEL105001EA) for 1 min and exposed to Amersham Hyperfilm ECL (VWR, #95017-661).</p>
<p>Bands were quantified by densitometry using ImageJ software. GAPDH was used to normalize protein content and data is expressed as a percentage of control within a given experiment. The following antibodies were used: anti-Caspr2 (1:5000, Abcam, #153856), anti- PV (1:2500, Abcam, #11427), anti-GAPDH (1:5000, Cell Signaling, #51745S), and anti-rabbit goat HRP conjugate (1:5000, BioRad, #1705046).</p>

<title>In situ hybridization</title>
<p>Fluorescent in situ hybridization was performed to quantify <italic>Pvalb</italic> mRNA expression in the striatum of <italic>Cntnap2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice. Mice were briefly anesthetized with isoflurane and brains were harvested, flash-frozen in OCT mounting medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #23-730-571) on dry ice and stored at -80Â° C for up to 6 months. 16 Âµm sections were collected using a cryostat (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Microm HM 550), mounted directly onto Superfrost Plus glass slides (VWR, #48311-703) and stored at -80Â° C for up to 6 months. In situ hybridization was performed according to the protocols provided with the RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent Kit (ACD, #323100). <italic>Drd1a</italic> mRNA was visualized with a probe in channel 2 (ACD, #406491-C2) and <italic>Pvalb</italic> mRNA in channel 3 (ACD, #421931-C3). After incubation, sections were secured on slides using ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Invitrogen, P36935) and 60 x 24 mm rectangular glass coverslips (VWR, #16004-096). Sections were imaged on an Olympus FluoView 3000 confocal microscope using a 10x objective with 1.5x zoom and a step size of 2 Âµm. <italic>Pvalb</italic>-expressing cells were quantified across the entire striatum using the ROI manager tool in ImageJ.

<title>Behavioral analysis</title>
<p>All behavior studies were carried out in the dark phase of the light cycle under red lights (open field) or white lights (marble burying, holeboard, rotarod, and four choice reversal learning). Mice were habituated to the behavior testing room for at least 30 min prior to testing. Mice were given at least one day between different tests. All behavior equipment was cleaned between each trial and mouse with 70% ethanol and rinsed in diluted soap followed by water at the end of the day. If male and female mice were to be tested on the same day, male mice were run first then returned to the housing room, after which all equipment was thoroughly cleaned prior to bringing in female mice for habituation. Behavioral tests were performed with young adult male and female mice (7-11 weeks old). The experimenter was blind to genotype throughout the testing and scoring procedures.</p>

<title>Open field assay</title>
<p>Exploratory behavior in a novel environment and general locomotor activity were assessed by a 60 min session in an open field chamber (40 cm L x 40 cm W x 34 cm H) made of transparent plexiglass. Horizontal infrared photobeams (Stoelting, 60001-02A) were positioned to detect rearing. The mouse was placed in the bottom right-hand corner of the arena and behavior was recorded using an overhead camera and analyzed using ANY-maze software (Stoelting). An observer manually scored self-grooming behavior during the first 20 minutes of the test. A grooming bout was defined as an unbroken series of grooming movements, including licking of body, paws, or tail, as well as licking of forepaws followed by rubbing of face with paws.</p>

<title>Open field assay with DeepLabCut Keypoint-MoSeq analysis</title>
<p>Mice were placed in the open field arena and video recorded with a monochrome camera (FLIR Grasshopper 3, GS3-U3-41C6NIR-C) and a 16 mm wide angle lens (Kowa, LM16HC) placed above the arena from a height of 50 cm. To extract the body part (keypoint) coordinates from the video recordings, DeepLabCut (DLC) 2.3.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Mathis, et al. 2018</xref>; Nath, et al. 2019) was used. Fourteen body parts including nose, head, left ear, right ear, left forelimb, right forelimb, spine 1, spine 2, spine 3, left hindlimb, right hindlimb, tail 1, tail 2, and tail 3 were manually labeled on a small subset of the video frames. A DLC model was then trained using the annotated frames to label those 14 body parts for all videos recorded. The total distance traveled, and number of center entries were calculated using the coordinate of bodypart tail 1.</p>
<p>Discrete behavior syllables were extracted using Keypoint-MoSeq 0.4.4 (Weinreb, et al. 2023). Syllable usage and transition data were obtained using built-in functions of the Keypoint-MoSeq package. Decoding and entropy analysis were performed using customized Python 3.9 script. Code available upon request in Github. Entropy was calculated using the following equation, where <italic>u<sub>i</sub></italic> denotes the frequency of the syllable <italic>i</italic> and <italic>p<sub>i,j</sub></italic> denotes the transition probability from syllable <italic>i</italic> to syllable <italic>j</italic>.:

<title>Marble burying assay</title>
<p>The marble burying assay was used to test for repetitive behavior. 20 black marbles were arranged in an orderly 4 x 5 grid on top of 5 cm of clean corn cob bedding in a standard mouse cage. Overhead room lights were on and white noise was played to induce mild stress. Mice were placed in the cage with the marbles for 30 minutes. The number of unburied marbles (&gt;50% exposed) was recorded after the session.</p>

<title>Holeboard assay</title>
<p>The holeboard assay was used to measure exploratory and repetitive behavior. The holeboard apparatus consisted of a smooth, flat, opaque gray plastic platform, suspended 10 cm from the base by four plastic pegs in each corner. The board contained 16 evenly spaced 2 cm diameter holes and was surrounded by a 30 cm high clear plastic square encasing. During testing, mice were placed into the center of the holeboard. Mice explored the board for 10 minutes while video was recorded from both an above and side-view camera. Videos were used post-hoc to manually count and map the number of nose pokes made during the task. Nose pokes were defined as the mouseâs nose passing through the board barrier when viewed through the side-view camera.</p>

<title>Accelerating rotarod assay</title>
<p>The accelerating rotarod test was used to examine motor coordination and learning.</p>
<p>Mice were trained on a rotarod apparatus (Ugo Basile, #47650) for four consecutive days. Three trials were completed per day with a 5 min break between trials. The rotarod was accelerated from 5-40 revolutions per minute (rpm) over 300 s for trials 1-6 (days 1 and 2), and from 10-80 rpm over 300 s for trials 7-12 (days 3 and 4). On the first testing day, mice were first acclimated to the apparatus by being placed on the rotarod rotating at a constant 5 rpm for 60 s and returned to their home cage for 5 min prior to starting trial 1. Latency to fall, or to rotate off the top of the rotarod barrel, was measured by the rotarod stop-trigger timer.</p>

<title>Four choice odor-based reversal learning test</title>
<p>The four-choice odor-based reversal learning test was used to assess learning and cognitive flexibility. Animals were food restricted for 6 days in total, with unrestricted access to drinking water, and maintained at 90-95% of ad lib feeding body weight. Food was given at the end of the day once testing was completed. Food restriction and introduction to Froot Loop cereal piece (Kelloggâs, Battle Creek, MI) began 48 hours before pre-training. The four-choice test was performed in a custom-made square box (30.5 cm L Ã 30.5 cm W Ã 23 cm H) constructed of clear acrylic. Four internal walls 7.6 cm wide partially divided the arena into four quadrants. A 15.2 cm diameter removable cylinder fit in the center of the maze and was lowered between trials (after a digging response) to isolate the mouse from the rest of the maze. Odor stimuli were presented mixed with wood shavings in white ceramic pots measuring 7.3 cm in diameter and 4.5 cm deep. All pots were sham baited with a piece of Froot Loop cereal secured underneath a mesh screen at the bottom of the pot. This was to prevent mice from using the odor of the Froot Loop to guide their choice. The apparatus was cleaned with 2.5% acetic acid followed by water and the pots were cleaned with 70% ethanol followed by water between mice. The apparatus was cleaned with diluted soap and water at the end of each testing day.</p>
<p>On the first habituation day of pre-training (day 1), animals were allowed to freely explore the testing arena for 30 min and consume small pieces of Froot Loops placed inside empty pots positioned in each of the four corners. On the second shaping day of pre-training (day 2), mice learned to dig to find cereal pieces buried in unscented coarse pine wood shavings (Harts Mountain Corporation, Secaucus, NJ). A single pot was used and increasing amounts of unscented wood shavings were used to cover each subsequent cereal reward. The quadrant containing the pot was alternated on each trial and all quadrants were rewarded equally. Trials were untimed and consisted of (in order): two trials with no shavings, two trials with a dusting of shavings, two trials with the pot a quarter full, two trials with the pot half full, and four trials with the cereal piece completely buried by shavings. The mouse was manually returned to the center cylinder between trials.</p>
<p>On the days for odor discrimination (day 3, acquisition) and reversal (day 4), wood shavings were freshly scented on the day of testing. Anise extract (McCormick, Hunt Valley, MD) was used undiluted at 0.02 ml/g of shavings. Clove, litsea, and eucalyptus oils (San Francisco Massage Supply Co., San Francisco, CA) were diluted 1:10 in mineral oil and mixed at 0.02 ml/g of shavings. Thymol (thyme; Alfa Aesar, A14563) was diluted 1:20 in 50% ethanol and mixed at 0.01 ml/g of shavings. During the discrimination phase (day 3), mice had to discriminate between four pots with four different odors and learn which one contained a buried food reward. Each trial began with the mouse confined to the start cylinder. Once the cylinder was lifted, timing began, and the mouse could freely explore the arena until it chose to dig in a pot. Digging was defined as purposefully moving the shavings with both front paws. A trial was terminated if no choice was made within 3 min and recorded as omission. Criterion was met when the animal completed eight out of ten consecutive trials correctly. The spatial location of the odors was shuffled on each trial. The rewarded odor during acquisition was anise.</p>
<p>The first four odor choices made during acquisition were analyzed to determine innate odor preference by the percentage of choices for a given odor: <italic>Cntnap2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice: 60% thyme, 25% anise, 12.5% clove, and 2.5% litsea. <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice: 47.5% thyme, 45% anise, 7.5% clove, 0% litsea. We note that both <italic>Cntnap2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice exhibited the strongest innate preference for thyme, an unrewarded odor. There were no significant differences in innate odor preference.</p>
<p>The reversal phase of the task was carried out on day 4. Mice first performed the task with the same rewarded odor as the discrimination day to ensure they learned and remembered the task. After reaching criterion on recall (eight out of ten consecutive trials correct), the rewarded odor was switched, and mice underwent a reversal learning test in which a previously unrewarded odor (clove) was rewarded. A novel odor (eucalyptus) was also introduced, which replaced thyme. Perseverative errors were choices to dig in the previously rewarded odor that was no longer rewarded. Regressive errors were choosing the previously rewarded odor after the first correct choice of the newly rewarded odor. Novel errors were choices to dig in the pot with the newly introduced odor (eucalyptus). Irrelevant errors were choices to dig in the pot that had never been rewarded (litsea). Omissions were trials in which the mouse failed to make a digging choice within 3 min from the start of the trial. Total errors were the sum of perseverative, regressive, irrelevant, novel, and omission errors. Criterion was met when the mouse completed eight out of ten consecutive trials correctly. The spatial location of the odors was shuffled on each trial.</p>

<title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title>
<p>Experiments were designed to compare the main effect of genotype. The sample sizes were based on prior studies and are indicated in the figure legend for each experiment.</p>
<p>Whenever possible, quantification and analyses were performed blind to genotype. GraphPad Prism version 10 was used to perform statistical analyses. The statistical tests and outcomes for each experiment are indicated in the respective figure legend. Two-tailed unpaired t tests were used for comparisons between two groups. For data that did not pass the DâAgostino &amp; Pearson normality test, a Mann-Whitney test was used. Two-way ANOVAs were used to compare differences between groups for experiments with two independent variables. Statistical significance was defined in the figure panels as follows: *p &lt; 0.05, **p &lt; 0.01, ***p &lt; 0.001.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> and well-executed study describes how deletion of the autism spectrum disorder risk gene CNTNAP2 in mice increases dorsolateral striatal projection neuron excitability and promotes repetitive behaviors and cognitive inflexibility. The evidence supporting this claim is <bold>solid</bold>, although additional experimental evidence would strengthen claims of how corticostriatal activity is altered and linked to behavioral changes. The study provides a potential cellular explanation for the repetitive and inflexible behavior in Cntnap2 knockout mice and CNTNAP2 disorder in humans, which would interest both basic and translational neuroscientists.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Cording et al. investigated how deletion of CNTNAP2, a gene associated with autism spectrum disorder, alters corticostriatal engagement and behavior. Specifically, the authors present slice electrophysiology data showing that striatal projection neurons (SPNs) are more readily driven to fire action potentials in response to stimulation of corticostriatal afferents, and this is due to increases in SPN intrinsic excitability rather than changes in excitatory or inhibitory synaptic inputs. The authors show that CNTNAP2 mice display repetitive behaviors, enhanced motor learning, and cognitive inflexibility. Overall the authors' conclusions are supported by their data, but a few claims could use some more evidence to be convincing.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The use of multiple behavioral techniques, both traditional and cutting-edge machine learning-based analyses, provides a powerful means of assessing repetitive behaviors and behavioral transitions/rigidity. Characterization of both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic responses in slice electrophysiology experiments offers a broad survey of the synaptic alterations that may lead to increased corticostriatal engagement of SPNs.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors conclude that increased cortical engagement of SPNs is due to changes in SPN intrinsic excitability rather than synaptic strength (either excitatory or inhibitory). One weakness is that only AMPA receptor-mediated responses were measured. Though the holding potential used for experiments in Figure 1F-I wasn't clear, recordings were presumably performed at a hyperpolarized potential that limits NMDA receptor-mediated responses. Because the input-output experiments used to conclude that corticostriatal engagement of SPNs is elevated (Figure 1B-E) were conducted in the current clamp, it is possible that enhanced NMDA receptor engagement contributed to increased SPN responses to cortical stimulation. Confirming that NMDA receptor-mediated EPSC components are not altered would strengthen the main conclusion.</p>
<p>(2) Data clearly show that SPN intrinsic excitability is increased in knockout mice. Given that CNTNAP2 has been linked to potassium channel regulation, it would be helpful to show and quantify additional related electrophysiology data such as negative IV curve responses and action potential hyperpolarization.</p>
<p>(3) As it stands, the reported changes in dorsolateral striatum SPN excitability are only correlative with reported changes in repetitive behaviors, motor learning, and cognitive flexibility.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This is an important study characterizing striatal dysfunction and behavioral deficits in Cntnap2-/- mice. There is growing evidence suggesting that striatal dysfunction underlies core symptoms of ASD but the specific cellular and circuit level abnormalities disrupted by different risk genes remain unclear. This study addresses how the deletion of Cntnap2 affects the intrinsic properties and synaptic connectivity of striatal spiny projection neurons (SPN) of the direct (dSPN) and indirect (iSPN) pathways. Using Thy1-ChR2 mice and optogenetics the authors found increased firing of both types of SPNs in response to cortical afferent stimulation. However, there was no significant difference in the amplitude of optically-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) or spine density between Cntnap2-/- and WT SPNs, suggesting that the increased corticostriatal coupling might be due to changes in intrinsic excitability. Indeed, the authors found Cntnap2-/- SPNs, particularly dSPNs, exhibited higher intrinsic excitability, reduced rheobase current, and increased membrane resistance compared to WT SPNs. The enhanced spiking probability in Cntnap2-/- SPNs is not due to reduced inhibition. Despite previous reports of decreased parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons in various brain regions of Cntnap2-/- mice, the number and function (IPSC amplitude and intrinsic excitability) of these interneurons in the striatum were comparable to WT controls.</p>
<p>This study also includes a comprehensive behavioral analysis of striatal-related behaviors. Cntnap2-/- mice demonstrated increased repetitive behaviors (RRBs), including more grooming bouts, increased marble burying, and increased nose poking in the holeboard assay. MoSeq analysis of behavior further showed signs of altered grooming behaviors and sequencing of behavioral syllables. Cntnap2-/- mice also displayed cognitive inflexibility in a four-choice odor-based reversal learning assay. While they performed similarly to WT controls during acquisition and recall phases, they required significantly more trials to learn a new odor-reward association during reversal, consistent with potential deficits in corticostriatal function.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study provides significant contributions to the field. The finding of altered SPN excitability, the detailed characterization of striatal inhibition, and the comprehensive behavioral analysis are novel and valuable to understanding the pathophysiology of Cntnap2-/- mice.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The approach based on Thy-ChR2 mice has the advantage of overcoming issues caused by injection efficiency and targeting variability. However, the spread of oEPSC amplitudes across mice shown in panels of Figure 1 G/I is very high with almost one order of magnitude difference between some mice. Given this is one of the most important points of the study it will be important to further analyze and discuss what this variability might be due to. Typically, in acute slice recordings, the within-animal variability is larger than the variability across animals. From the sample sizes reported it seems the authors sampled a large number of animals, but with a relatively low number of neurons per animal (per condition). Could this be one of the reasons for this variability?</p>
<p>(2) This is particularly important because the analysis of corticostriatal evoked APs in panels C and E is performed on pooled data without considering the variability in evoked current amplitudes across animals shown in G and I. Were the neurons in panels C/E recorded from the same mice as shown in G/I? If so, it would be informative to regress AP firing data (say at 20% LED) to the average oEPSC amplitude recorded on those mice at the same light intensity. However, if the low number of neurons recorded per mouse is due to technical limitations, then increasing the sample size of these experiments would strengthen the study.</p>
<p>(3) On a similar note, there is no discussion of why iSPNs also show increased corticostriatal evoked firing in Figure 1E, despite the difference in intrinsic excitability shown in Figure 3. This suggests other potential mechanisms that might underlie altered corticostriatal responses. Given the role of Caspr2 in clustering K channels in axons, altered presynaptic function or excitability could also contribute to this phenotype, but potential changes in PPR have not been explored in this study.</p>
<p>(4) Male and female SPNs have different intrinsic properties but the number and/or balance of M/F mice used for each experiment is not reported.</p>
<p>(5) There is no mention of how membrane resistance was calculated, and no I/V plots are shown.</p>
<p>(6) It would be interesting to see which behavior transitions most contribute to the decrease in entropy. Are these caused by repeated or perseverative grooming bouts? Or is this inflexibility also observed across other behaviors? The transition map in Figure S5 shows the overall number of syllables and transitions but not their sequence during behavior. Can this be analyzed by calculating the ratio of individual ð¢ð Ã ðð,ð Ã log2 ðð,ð factors across genotypes?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors analyzed Cntnap2 KO mice to determine whether loss of the ASD risk gene CNTNAP2 alters the dorsal striatum's function.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The results demonstrate that loss of Cntnap2 results in increased excitability of striatal projection neurons (SPNs) and altered striatal-dependent behaviors, such as repetitive, inflexible behaviors. Unlike other brain areas and cell types, synaptic inputs onto SPNs were normal in Cntnap2 KO mice. The experiments are well-designed, and the results support the authors' conclusions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The mechanism underlying SPN hyperexcitability was not explored, and it is unclear whether this cellular phenotype alone can account for the behavioral alterations in Cntnap2 KO mice. No clear explanation emerges for the variable phenotype in different brain areas and cell types.</p>
