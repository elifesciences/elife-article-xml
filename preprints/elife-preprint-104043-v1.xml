<abstract>
<p>The transition from prebiotic chemistry to living systems requires the emergence of a scheme for enzyme-free genetic replication. Here, we analyze a recently proposed prebiotic replication scenario, the so-called Virtual Circular Genome (VCG) [Zhou et al., RNA 27, 1-11 (2021)]: Replication takes place in a pool of oligomers, where each oligomer contains a subsequence of a circular genome, such that the oligomers encode the full genome collectively. While the sequence of the circular genome may be reconstructed based on long oligomers, short oligomers merely act as replication feedstock. We observe a competition between the predominantly error-free ligation of a short oligomer to a long oligomer and the predominantly erroneous ligation of two long oligomers. Increasing the length of long oligomers and reducing their concentration decreases the fraction of erroneous ligations, enabling high-fidelity replication in the VCG. Alternatively, the problem of erroneous products can be mitigated if only monomers are activated, such that each ligation involves at least one monomer. Surprisingly, in such systems, shorter oligomers are extended by monomers more quickly than long oligomers, a phenomenon which has already been observed experimentally [Ding et al., JACS 145, 7504-7515 (2023)]. Our work provides a theoretical explanation for this behavior, and predicts its dependence on system parameters such as the concentration of long oligomers. Taken together, the VCG constitutes a promising scenario of prebiotic information replication: It could mitigate challenges of in non-enzymatic copying via template-directed polymerization, such as short lengths of copied products and high error rates.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In order to delineate possible pathways towards the emergence of life, it is necessary to understand how a chemical reaction network capable of storing and replicating genetic information might arise from prebiotic chemistry. RNA is commonly assumed to play a central role on this path, as it can store information in its sequence and catalyze its own replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. While ribozymes capable of replicating strands of their own length have been demonstrated in the laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>], it remains elusive how enzyme-free self-replication might have worked before the emergence of such complex ribozymes.</p>
<p>One possible mechanism is template-directed primer extension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]: In this process, a primer hybridizes to a template and is extended by short oligonucleotides, thereby forming a (complementary) copy of the template strand. Considerable progress has been made in optimizing template-directed primer extension, but challenges remain: (i) The produced copies are likely to be incomplete. So far, at most 12 nt have been successfully added to an existing primer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Moreover, as the pool of primer strands needs to emerge via random polymerization, the primer is likely to hybridize to the template at various positions, and not only to its 3’-end, leaving part of the 3’-end of the template uncopied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. (ii) Errors in enzyme-free copying are frequent due to the limited thermodynamic discrimination between correct Watson-Crick pairing and mismatches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>] The error probability constrains the length of the genome that can be reliably replicated.</p>
<p>The issue of insufficient thermodynamic discrimination can, in principle, be mitigated by making use of kinetic stalling after the incorporation of a mismatch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. By introducing a competition between the reduced polymerization rate and a characteristic timescale of the non-equilibrium environment, it is possible to filter correct sequences from incorrect ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. To address the challenge of incomplete copies, Zhou <italic>et al</italic>. propose an new scenario of replication, the so-called Virtual Circular Genome (VCG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. In this scenario, genetic information is stored in a pool of oligomers that are shorter than the circular genome they collectively encode: Each oligomer bears a subsequence of the circular genome, such that the collection of all oligomers encodes the full circular genome virtually. Within the pool, each oligomer can act as template or primer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. The oligomers hybridize to each other and form complexes that allow for templated ligation of two oligomers, or for the extension of an oligomer by a monomer. Because the sequences of the ligated strands and the template are part of the genome sequence, most of the products should also retain the sequence of the genome. That way, long oligomers encoding the circular genome are produced at the expense of short oligomers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. The long strands, in turn, can assemble into catalytically active ribozymes. With a continuous influx of short oligomers, the VCG might allow for continuous replication of the virtually encoded circular genome. Importantly, replication in the VCG is expected to avoid the issue of incomplete copies. Since the genome is circular, it does not matter which part of the genome an oligomer encodes, as long as the sequence is compatible with the genome sequence. An additional feature of the VCG scenario is that replication should be achievable without the need of adding many nucleotides to a primer: Provided the concentration of oligomers decreases exponentially with their length, the concentration of each oligomer in the pool can be doubled by extending each oligomer only by a few nucleotides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. The extension of an oligomer by a few nucleotides in a VCG pool has already been demonstrated experimentally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>].</p>
<p>A recent computational study points out that the VCG scenario is prone to loss of genetic information via ”sequence scrambling” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]: If the genome contains identical sequence motifs at multiple different loci, replication in the VCG will mix the sequences of these loci, thus destroying the initially defined genome. More generally, it is currently unclear, which conditions could prevent genome instability of VCGs, such that their genetic information is retained. Length distribution, sequence composition, oligonucleotide concentration and environmental conditions, such as temperature, all affect the stability of complexes and thus the replication dynamics of the VCG pool. Here, we characterize the replication fidelity and yield of VCG pools using a kinetic model, which explicitly incorporates association and dissociation of RNA strands as well as templated ligation. We study a broad spectrum of prebiotically plausible and experimentally accessible oligomer pools, from pools containing only monomers and long oligomers of a single length to pools including a range of long oligomers with uniform or exponential concentration profile. The length of the included oligomers as well as their concentration are free parameters of our model.</p>
<p>We find that, regardless of the details of the pool, there is a competition between three types of template-directed ligation reactions: (i) Ligations of two short oligomers, e.g., monomers, forming oligomers that are too short to specify a unique locus on the genome. (ii) Ligations of a short oligomer to a long oligomer, which form longer oligomers with sequences that are typically compatible to the genome. (iii) Ligations of two long oligomers, which often create oligomers that are incompatible with the genome sequence. Therefore, the fidelity is primarily determined by the competition between the error-free extension of a long oligomer and the erroneous ligation of two long oligomers. The likeli-hood of the latter reaction can be minimized by lowering the relative concentration of long oligomers, even though this increases the fraction of short oligomers that are used up for ligations of the first type. Consequently, the fidelity can be improved at the expense of reducing the yield. The efficiency, meaning the yield attainable at a fixed high fidelity, thus depends on the length distribution of the oligomers in the pool.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the issue of erroneous ligations is solved if only monomers are activated, such that each ligation incorporates only one monomer at a time, as in the experimental study by Ding <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. In this case, the VCG concentration can be chosen arbitrarily large without compromising fidelity. Interestingly, our model predicts an unexpected feature: In the limit of high VCG concentrations, the rate of primer extension is higher for shorter oligomers than for long oligomers, even though, intuitively, complexes containing longer oligomers are expected to be more stable and thus more productive. The same behavior was indeed observed experimentally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. We provide an explanation for this feature, and discuss its dependence on system parameters such as the length and the concentration of long oligomers in the pool.</p>

<title>Model</title>
<p>The VCG is a replication scenario where a circular genome is stored in a pool of oligomers. The oligomers are shorter than the genome that they encode. Each oligomer bears a subsequence of the circular genome, such that, collectively, the oligomers encode the full genome (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). To set up our model for the dynamics of VCG pools, we specify (i) our choice of circular genomes, (ii) how to map the genomes to pools of oligomers, and (iii) which chemical reactions govern the dynamics.</p>

<title>Circular Genomes</title>
<p>For a given genome length, <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub>, there are <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> distinct circular genomes (the factor 1/2<italic>L</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub> accounts for the freedom to select the starting position and to choose the Watson or the Crick strand as reference sequence). A key property of the genome is its minimal unique motif length, <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub>, defined as the shortest length such that all possible subsequences of length <italic>L</italic> ≥ <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub> appear at most once in the genome. In other words, all subsequences of length <italic>L</italic> ≥ <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub> specify a unique locus on the genome. In principle, each circular genome has another length scale, corresponding to the maximal motif length, up to which all possible sequence motifs are contained in the genome. Here, for convenience, we restrict ourselves to genomes in which this length-scale is <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub> − 1, such that all possible subsequences shorter than <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub> are contained in the sequence of the genome. Additionally, we choose only unbiased genomes in which all possible subsequences of length <italic>L</italic> &lt; <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub> are contained at equal frequency.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Construction of VCG Pools</title>
<p>To specify a VCG pool encoding a genomic sequence (chosen as described above), one must select the subsequences to be included in the pool, as well as their concentrations. We consider unbiased pools, where the concentration of subsequences, c(<italic>L</italic>), depends only on their length, <italic>L</italic>, i.e., all subsequences of a given length are included at equal concentration. We refer to the length-dependent concentration profile as the length distribution of the pool. Depending on their length, oligomers fall into two categories (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>): (i) short feedstock oligomers and (ii) long VCG oligomers. Feedstock oligomers are oligomers that are shorter than the unique subsequence length <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub>. Since their sequence appears multiple times on the genome, they do not encode a specific position on the genome. Thus, they serve as feedstock for the elongation of VCG oligomers rather than as information storage. Conversely, the VCG oligomers, which are longer than the unique subsequence length <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub>, have a unique locus on the circular genome. Collectively, the VCG oligomers enable the reconstruction of the full genome.</p>
<p>The full length distribution, c(<italic>L</italic>), can be decomposed into the contributions of feedstock oligomers and VCG oligomers,
<disp-formula id="ueqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v2_ueqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
We assume that both types of oligomers have an exponential length distribution. In our model, the concentration of VCG oligomers can be varied independently of the concentration of feedstock oligomers, and the length scales for the exponential decay (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> vs.<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>) may differ between VCG oligomers and feedstock oligomers. Additionally, we can restrict the set of oligomer lengths included in the pool by setting minimal and maximal lengths for feedstock oligomers and for VCG oligomers individually,
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v2_eqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v2_eqn2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
For any other oligomer length, the concentrations equal zero. This parametrization includes uniform length distributions as a special case (<italic>κ</italic><sub>F</sub> = 0 and <italic>κ</italic><sub>V</sub> = 0), and also allows for concentration profiles that are peaked. Peaked length distributions can emerge from the interplay of templated ligation, (de)hybridization and outflux in open systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. We define the total concentration of feedstock oligomers, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline4.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, as well as the total concentration of VCG oligomers, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline5.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. Their ratio will turn out to be an important determinant of the VCG dynamics.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>(De)hybridization Kinetics</title>
<p>Oligomers can hybridize to each other to form double-stranded complexes, or dehybridize from an existing complex. For simplicity, we do not include self-folding within a strand, which is a reasonable assumption for short oligomers. The stability of a complex is determined by its hybridization energy, with lower hybridization energy indicating greater stability. We use a simplified nearest-neighbor energy model to compute the hybridization energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]: The total energy equals the sum of the energy contributions of all nearest-neighbor blocks in a given complex (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). The energy contribution associated with a block of two Watson-Crick base pairs (matches) is denoted <italic>γ</italic> &lt; 0, and dangling end blocks involving one Watson-Crick pair and one free base contribute <italic>γ</italic>/2. Nearest-neighbor blocks involving mismatches increase the hybridization energy by <italic>γ</italic><sub>MM</sub> &gt; 0 per block, thus reducing the stability of the complex. The rate constants of hybridization and dehybridization are related via
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v2_eqn3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where c<sup>°</sup> = 1 M is the standard concentration, and ΔG is the free energy of hybridization. The association rate constant <italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub> is proportional to the encounter rate constant, <italic>k</italic><sub>enc</sub> = 1/(<italic>c</italic><sup>°</sup>t<sub>0</sub>). The encounter timescale t<sub>0</sub> serves as the elementary time unit of the kinetic model, with all reaction timescales measured relative to it.</p>

<title>Templated Ligation</title>
<p>Two oligomers A and B that are hybridized adjacently to each other on a third oligomer C can produce a new oligomer A-B via templated ligation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Depending on the length of A and B, we distinguish three types of ligation reactions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>): (i) F+F ligations, in which two feedstock oligomers ligate, (ii) F+V ligations, where a VCG oligomer is extended by a feedstock oligomer, and (iii) V+V ligations involving two VCG oligomers. The formation of a covalent bond via templated ligation is not spontaneous, but requires the presence of an activation reaction. Usually, these reactions add a leaving group to the 5’-end of the nucleotide which is cleaved during bond formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. We assume that the concentration of activating agent is sufficiently high for the activation to be far quicker than the formation of the covalent bond, such that activation and covalent bond formation can be treated as a single effective reaction. We consider pools in which all oligomers are activated, as well as pools in which only monomers are activated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Observables</title>
<p>Essentially, templated ligation in the pool produces VCG oligomers at the expense of feed-stock oligomers. To characterize these dynamics, we distinguish between different contributions to the production flux. While the product of an F+V ligation is always a VCG oligomer, F+F ligations can produce feed-stock oligomers or VCG oligomers. In both cases, a produced VCG oligomer can be correct (compatible with the genome) or incorrect (incompatible). V+V ligations always produce VCG oligomers that can be correct or incorrect. We quantify these processes by measuring extension fluxes in units of nucleotides ligated to an existing strand (counting the length of the shorter ligated strand as the number of incorporated bases). In particular, we define the fidelity f as the extension flux resulting in correct VCG oligomers relative to the flux resulting in any VCG oligomer,
<disp-formula id="ueqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v2_ueqn2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
In addition, we introduce the yield y as the proportion of total extension flux that produces VCG oligomers,
<disp-formula id="ueqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v2_ueqn3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
Efficient replication of the VCG requires both, high fidelity and high yield. Hence, we introduce the efficiency of replication <italic>η</italic> as the product of fidelity and yield,

<caption><p>Replication performance of VCG pools containing VCG oligomers of a single length (single-length VCG pools). <bold>A</bold> The pool contains a fixed concentration of monomers, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline135.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> mM, as well as VCG oligomers of a single length, <italic>L</italic><sub>V</sub>, at variable concentration <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline136.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> (the VCG oligomers cover all possible subsequences of the genome and its complement at equal concentration). <bold>B</bold> The yield increases as a function of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline137.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, because dimerizations become increasingly unli<italic>k</italic>ely for high VCG concentrations. <bold>C</bold> The ligation share of different ligation types depends on the total VCG concentration: In the low concentration limit, dimerization (F+F) dominates; for intermediate concentrations, F+V ligations reach their maximum, while, for high concentrations, a substantial fraction of reactions are V+V ligations. The panel depicts the behavior for <italic>L</italic><sub>V</sub> = 6 nt. <bold>D</bold> Replication efficiency is limited by the small yield for small <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline138.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. In the limit of high <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline139.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, replication efficiency decreases due to the growing number of error-prone V+V ligations. Maximal replication efficiency is reached at intermediate VCG concentration. <bold>E</bold> V+V ligations are prone to the formation of incorrect products due to the short overlap between educt strand and template. In general, the probability of correct product formation, <italic>p</italic><sub>corr</sub>, depends on the choice of circular genome and as well as its mapping to the VCG pool. The probabilities listed here refer to a VCG pool with <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub> = 16 nt and <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub> = 3 nt. <bold>F</bold> The optimal equilibrium concentration ratio of free VCG strands to free feedstoc<italic>k</italic> strands, which maximizes replication efficiency, decays as a function of length (continuous line). The analytical scaling law (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">Eq. (4)</xref>, dashed line) captures this behavior. The window of close-to-optimal replication, within which efficiency deviates no more than 1% from its optimum (shaded areas), increases with <italic>L</italic><sub>V</sub>, facilitating reliable replication without fine-tuning to match the optimal concentration ratio. <bold>G</bold> Maximal replication efficiency, which is attained at the optimal VCG concentration depicted in panel E, increases as a function of <italic>L</italic><sub>V</sub> and approaches a plateau of 100%. For high efficiency, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn5">Eq. (5)</xref> provides a good approximation of the length-dependence of <italic>η</italic><sub>max</sub> (dashed lines). The oligomer length at which replication efficiency equals 95% is determined using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn5">Eq.

The length of VCG oligomers, <italic>L</italic><sub>V</sub>, at which the optimal replication efficiency reaches 95% (computed via <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn5">Eq. 5</xref>) exhibits the same logarithmic dependence on <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub>.</p></caption>

<p>These initial VCG pools are evolved in time using a stochastic simulation based on the Gillespie algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. Since the Gillespie algorithm operates on the level of counts of molecules instead of concentrations, we must assign a volume to each system. We choose volumes in the range 1 μm<sup>3</sup> to 10 000 μm<sup>3</sup> (Supplementary Material Section S-I). In addition to the volume, the reaction rate constants need to be chosen appropriately: (i) Experimentally determined association rate constants are typically around 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>], which corresponds to an association timescale of t<sub>0</sub> ≈ 1 μs. (ii) The timescale of dehybridization is computed via <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3">Eq. (3)</xref> using the energy contribution <italic>γ</italic> = −2.5 <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub>T for a matching nearest-neighbor block and <italic>γ</italic><sub>MM</sub> = 25.0 <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub>T in case of mismatches. The high energy penalty of nearest-neighbor blocks involving mismatches, <italic>γ</italic><sub>MM</sub>, is chosen to suppress the formation of mismatches, while the value of <italic>γ</italic> roughly matches the average energy of all matching nearest-neighbor blocks given by the Turner energy model of RNA hybridization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. (iii) For templated ligation, we select a reaction rate constant of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline6.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. This choice of <italic>k</italic><sub>lig</sub> is consistent with ligation rates observed in enzyme-free template-directed primer extension experiments, which range from around 10<sup>−6</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline7.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] to roughly 10<sup>−4</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline8.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], depending on the underlying activation chemistry.</p>
<p>Based on the ligation events observed in the time evolution, we compute the observables introduced above (Model section). Due to the small ligation rate constant, the time evolution can only be simulated for a few ligation time units. Consequently, ligation events are scarce, which leads to high variances in the computed observables. We mitigate this issue by calculating the observables based on the concentration of complexes that are in a productive configuration, even if they do not undergo templated ligation within the time window of the simulation (Supplementary Material Section S-I).</p>
<p>From the ligation events, we obtain the total production flux of VCG oligomers and feedstock oligomers. Our observable <italic>y</italic> (yield) quantifies the fraction of this total flux directed to VCG oligomers. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> shows how the yield depends on the concentration of VCG oligomers, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline9.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, at a fixed total monomer concentration, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline10.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. Here, the data points (with error bars) represent the simulation results with the different colors corresponding to different choices of initial VCG oligomer length, <italic>L</italic><sub>V</sub>. We observe that the yield increases monotonically with the concentration of VCG oligomers, and approaches 100% for high <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline11.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. The concentration at which the pool reaches a yield of 50% depends on the oligomer length <italic>L</italic><sub>V</sub>: Shorter VCG oligomers require higher concentrations for high yield. The concentration dependence of the yield can be rationalized by the types of templated ligations that are involved. For low VCG concentration, most templated ligation reactions are dimerizations (1+1) with the VCG oligomers merely acting as templates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). As dimers are shorter than the unique subsequence length <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub>, their formation does not contribute to the yield, which explains the low yield in the limit of small <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline12.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. Conversely, for high VCG concentration, most of the templated ligations are F+V or V+V ligations, which produce oligomers of length <italic>L</italic> ≥ <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub>, implying high yield.</p>
<p>However, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref> also shows that the relative contribution of V+V ligation increases with increasing <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline13.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, with a large fraction of them producing incorrect products. This reduction in fidelity, f, causes a trade-off between fidelity and yield, which is visible as a peak at intermediate VCG concentrations in the replication efficiency, <italic>η</italic> = <italic>f</italic> · <italic>y</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Using hexamers as an example, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref> illustrates why V+V ligations are prone to forming incorrect oligomers: In order to ensure that two oligomers only ligate if their sequences are adjacent to each other in the true circular genome, both oligomers need to share an overlap of at least <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub> nucleotides with the template oligomer. Otherwise, the product oligomers might form sequences incompatible with the true genome. The probability of forming incorrect products is a consequence of the combinatorics of possible subsequences in the VCG. Specifically, for a genome with <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub> = 16 nt, there are 32 different hexamers. For example, if the left educt hexamer only has one nucleotide of overlap with the template, there are 1/4 · 32 = 8 possible educt oligomers. However, only one out of those 8 hexamers is the correct partner for the right educt hexamer, implying an error probability of 1 − 1/8 = 7/8 (first example in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>).</p>
<p>Characterizing replication efficiency using simulation data is computationally expensive. Depending on the parameters, up to a hundred simulations, each taking a few days, are needed to obtain a single data point in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-D</xref> to sufficient accuracy. To enable rapid computation of the observables of interest over a wide range of parameter values, we introduce an additional approximate approach that relies on (i) the separation of time-scales between (de)hybridization and templated ligation, and (ii) on a coarse-grained representation of the oligomers in the VCG pool. The curves shown together with the simulation data in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> are computed using this “adiabatic approach”. The approach is detailed in Supplementary Material <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5b">Sections S-II</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5c">S-III</xref>, and only outlined briefly in the following: Due to the slow rate of ligation, the (de)hybridization equilibrium is typically reached long before the first ligation event happens. To determine the hybridization equilibrium, we assume oligomers of the same length to have identical concentration, regardless of their sequence. The concentration of complexes comprised of multiple oligomers is calculated using the law of mass action: It equals the product of the individual oligomer concentrations divided by the respective dissociation constant <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub>, which in turn depends on the hybridization energy, Δ<italic>G</italic>. Depending on the length of the hybridization region, one or multiple hybridization partners may be possible based on the oligomer sequences present in the pool. This is accounted for by weighting the complex concentrations by combinatorial multiplicities. For each oligomer length, we impose a mass conservation constraint ensuring that the equilibrium concentration of free oligomers and the concentration of oligomers bound in complexes adds up to the total concentration in the pool. Solving the law of mass action together with the mass conservation equations numerically yields the equilibrium concentrations of free VCG and feedstock strands, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline14.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline15.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, for any given total concentration, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline16.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline17.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. Knowing the equilibrium concentration of free strands allows us to compute concentrations of productive complexes and thus observables characterizing templated ligation.</p>
<p>The results of the adiabatic approach agree well with the data obtained from the simulations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-D</xref>). For instance, the adiabatic approach predicts the same non-monotoneous concentration dependence of replication efficiency as the simulations: VCG pools containing longer oligomers achieve higher maxima in replication efficiency at lower VCG concentration. While the available simulation data only allows for a qualitative description of this trend, the adiabatic approach enables a quantitative analysis. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref> (solid line) shows the equilibrium concentration ratio at which replication efficiency is maximal, as a function of the VCG oligomer length, <italic>L</italic><sub>V</sub>. As expected from the qualitative trend, pools containing longer oligomers reach their maximum for lower concentration of VCG oligomers. The shaded area indicates the range of VCG concentrations within which the pool’s efficiency deviates by no more than one percent from its optimum. We observe that this range of close-to-optimal VCG concentrations increases with <italic>L</italic><sub>V</sub>. Thus, pools containing longer oligomers require less fine-tuning of the VCG concentration for replication with high efficiency.</p>
<p>In addition to the numerical results, we utilize the adiabatic approach to study the optimal equilibrium VCG concentration analytically (Supplementary Material Section S-V). We find that, for any choice of <italic>L</italic><sub>V</sub>, replication efficiency reaches its maximum when the fractions of dimerization (1+1) reactions and erroneous V+V ligations are equal (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref> for <italic>L</italic><sub>V</sub> = 6 nt). This criterion can be used to derive a scaling law for the optimal equilibrium concentration ratio <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline18.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> as a function of the oligomer length <italic>L</italic><sub>V</sub>,
<disp-formula id="eqn4">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v2_eqn4.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
which is shown as a dashed line in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref> (the length-scale Λ<sub>F+F</sub> is defined in Supplementary Material Section S-V). The optimal equilibrium concentration ratio decreases exponentially with <italic>L</italic><sub>V</sub>, while the hybridization energy <italic>γ</italic>/2 sets the inverse length-scale of the exponential decay. Analytical estimate and numerical solution agree well, as long as the hybridization is weak and oligomers are sufficiently short. For strong binding and long oligomers, complexes involving more than three strands play a non-negligible role, but such complexes are neglected in the analytical approximation.</p>
<p><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref> shows how the maximal replication efficiency depends on the VCG oligomer length. Consistent with the qualitative trend observed in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>, longer oligomers enable higher maxima in replication efficiency. Regardless of the choice of <italic>γ</italic>, replication efficiency reaches 100% if <italic>L</italic><sub>V</sub> is sufficiently high. Using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">Eq. (4)</xref>, we find the following approximation for the maximal replication efficiency attainable at a given oligomer length (see dashed lines in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>),
<disp-formula id="eqn5">

</disp-formula>
where <italic>η</italic><sup>°</sup> is a genome-dependent constant (Supplementary Material Section S-VI). This equation provides guidance for the construction of VCG pools with high replication efficiency: Given a target efficiency, the necessary oligomer length and hybridization energy, i.e., temperature, can be calculated. In <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>, we determine the oligomer length necessary to achieve <italic>η</italic><sub>max</sub> = 95% for varying hybridization energies <italic>γ</italic>. At higher temperature (weaker binding), VCG pools require longer oligomers for replication with high efficiency.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn5">Eq. (5)</xref> is not restricted to the example genome of length <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub> = 16 nt introduced previously, but may be applied to genomes of arbitrary length (provided the genomes follow the construction principles outlined in the method section). In such genomes, the minimal unique subsequence length scales logarithmically with the length of the genome, <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub> ∼ ln(<italic>L</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub>). Based on <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub> and <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub>, we can compute the genome-dependent quantities Λ<sub>F+F</sub> and <italic>η</italic><sup>°</sup> via the combinatorial multiplicities of productive complexes, which allow us to compute the characteristic VCG oligomer length at which the system reaches <italic>η</italic><sub>max</sub> = 95%. Just like <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub>, this characteristic VCG oligomer length also increases logarithmically with the genome length (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>), allowing VCG pools with moderate oligomer sizes to encode long circular genomes.</p>

<title>Pools containing VCG oligomers of different lengths are dominated by the long oligomers</title>
<p>In the previous section, we characterized the behavior of pools containing VCG oligomers of a single length. We observed that V+V ligations are error-prone due to insufficient overlap between the educt strands and the template, whereas F+V ligations extend the VCG oligomers with high efficiency. The F+V ligations will gradually broaden the length distribution of the VCG pool, raising the question of how this broadening affects the replication behavior. In principle, introducing multiple oligomer lengths into the VCG pool might even improve the fidelity of V+V ligations, since a long VCG oligomer could serve as a template for the correct ligation of two shorter VCG oligomers.</p>
<p>To analyze this question quantitatively, we first consider the simple case of a VCG pool that only contains monomers, tetramers, and octamers. The concentration of monomers is set to <italic>c</italic>(1) = 0.1 mM, while the concentrations of the VCG oligomers are varied independently (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Replication efficiency reaches its maximum at <italic>c</italic>(8) ≈ 0.1 μM and very low tetramer concentration, <italic>c</italic>(4) ≈ 7.4 pM, effectively resembling a single-length VCG pool containing only octamers. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, the maximal efficiency is surrounded by a plateau of close-to-optimal efficiency. The octamer concentration can be varied by more than one order of magnitude without significant change in efficiency. Similarly, adding tetramers does not affect efficiency as long as the tetramer concentration does not exceed the octamer concentration. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref> illustrates that the plateau of close-to-optimal efficiency coincides with the concentration regime where the ligation of a monomer to an octamer with another octamer acting as template, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline19.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, is the dominant ligation reaction. For high tetramer concentration and intermediate octamer concentration, templated ligation of tetramers on octamer templates, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline20.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, surpasses the contribution of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline21.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> ligations (green shaded area in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). The <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline22.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> reactions give rise to a ridge of increased efficiency, which represents a local maximum, but is small compared to the plateau of close-to-optimal efficiency (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Even though reactions of the type <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline23.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> produce correct products in most cases, they compete with error-prone ligations like <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline24.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline25.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, which reduce fidelity. Increasing the binding affinity, i.e., lowering <italic>γ</italic>, enhances the contribution of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline25a.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> ligations at the expense of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline26.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> ligations, resulting in an increased local maximum in replication efficiency (Supplementary Material <xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9</xref>). However, very strong hybridization energy, <italic>γ</italic> = −5.0 <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub><italic>T</italic>, is necessary for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline27.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> ligations to give rise to similar efficiency as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline28.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> ligations. Thus, in this example, high efficiency replication facilitated by the ligation of short VCG oligomers on long VCG oligomers is in theory possible, but requires unrealistically strong binding affinity. Moreover, this mechanism is only effective if educts and template differ significantly with respect to their length. In case short and long oligomers are similar in size, templated ligation of two short oligomers tends to be error-prone, irrespective of the choice of binding affinity (Supplementary Material <xref rid="figS10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10</xref> and <xref rid="figS11" ref-type="fig">S11</xref>). In that case, F+V ligations remain the most reliable replication mechanism.</p>

<p>We observe similar behavior in VCG pools containing a range of oligomer lengths from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline29.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline30.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), again using <italic>γ</italic> = −2.5 <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub><italic>T</italic> (typical RNA hybridization energy). We maximize replication efficiency with respect to the concentration of VCG oligomers under the assumption that all VCG oligomers of any length have the same concentration (uniform profile). Efficiency again reaches its maximum when F+V ligations of long VCG oligomers are the predominant type of templated ligation (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, which shows the relative contribution of different ligation types in VCG pools with fixed <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline31.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> nt and varying <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline32.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> nt). Adding short VCG oligomers to the pool leaves the relative contributions of the dominant ligation types almost unchanged and increases the fraction of unproductive F+F ligations only marginally. Replication efficiency is governed by the behavior of the long oligomers included in the pool. Decreasing <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline33.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> for fixed <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline34.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> reduces the achievable maximal replication efficiency only slightly. Conversely, lowering the maximal oligomer length, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline35.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, while keeping <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline36.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> fixed causes the efficiency to decrease significantly (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). This is plausible because, for any <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline37.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, replication efficiency is bounded by the replication efficiency of the longest oligomer in the pool (blue curve in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, which corresponds to the orange curve in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). In addition, for small <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline38.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, short and long VCG oligomers are increasingly similar in length, which gives rise to a broad spectrum of erroneous V+V ligations that compete with the error-free F+V ligations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>).</p>

<p>In a realistic prebiotic setup, the concentration profile of the VCG pool would not be uniform. Depending on the mechanism that produces the pool and its coupling to the non-equilibrium environment, it might have a concentration profile that decreases or increases exponentially with length. We use the parameter <italic>κ</italic><sub>V</sub> to control this exponential length dependence (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>): For negative <italic>κ</italic><sub>V</sub>, the concentration increases as a function of length, while exponentially decaying length distributions have positive <italic>κ</italic><sub>V</sub>. We find that replication efficiency is high if the concentration of long VCG oligomers exceeds or at least matches the concentration of short VCG oligomers (see <italic>κ</italic><sub>V</sub> ≤ 0 in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). In that case, replication efficiency is dominated by the long oligomers in the pool, since these form the most stable complexes. As the concentration of long oligomers is decreased further (<italic>κ</italic><sub>V</sub> &gt; 0), the higher stability of complexes formed by longer oligomers is eventually insufficient to compensate for the reduced concentration of long oligomers. Replication efficiency is then governed by short VCG oligomers, which exhibit lower replication efficiency. In the limit <italic>κ</italic><sub>V</sub> → ∞, replication efficiency approaches the replication efficiency of a single-length VCG pool containing only oligomers of length <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline39.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>).</p>

<p><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref> compares the replication efficiency of a pool with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline40.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and without dimers <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline41.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. In both cases, pools that are rich in VCG oligomers exhibit low efficiency of replication. As erroneous V+V ligations are the dominant type of reaction in this limit, the same efficiency is obtained regardless of the presence of dimers. In contrast, when the pool is rich in feedstock, pools with and without dimers behave differently: If only monomers are included, the efficiency approaches zero, as dimerizing monomers do not contribute to the yield, and thus not to the efficiency. However, the presence of dimers enables the ligation of monomers and dimers to form trimers and tetramers, which lead to a non-zero yield. Given the low VCG concentration, dimers are more abundant than VCG oligomers and thus more likely to act as templates. Therefore, educt oligomers can only hybridize to the template with a single nucleotide-long hybridization region. Consequently, many products are incompatible with the circular genome, causing low efficiency.</p>
<p>Replication efficiency reaches its maximum at intermediate VCG concentrations, where replication is dominated by F+V ligations. Notably, the maximal attainable efficiency is significantly lower for ensembles with dimers than without, as dimers increase the number and the stability of complex configurations that can form incorrect products (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). For <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline42.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, ligation products are only incorrect if the overlap between the VCG educt oligomer and template is shorter than the unique subsequence length, <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub>. For <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline43.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, however, dangling end dimers can cause incorrect products even in case of long overlap of educt oligomer and template (see right column in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>).

<title>Monomers preferentially ligate to short VCG oligomers in VCG-rich pools</title>
<p>Efficiency of replication is limited by the same mechanism regardless of the specifics of the underlying VCG pool: Oligomers that have an insufficiently long region of hybridization (shorter than <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub>) to their template are likely to produce an incorrect product upon ligation. In the previous sections, we minimized the contribution of such ligations by fine-tuning the concentration of VCG oligomers. Alternatively, incorrect templated ligations could be suppressed if only monomers are activated, while longer oligomers remain inactive. This scenario has already been investigated experimentally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. In a prebiotic setting, this scenario would emerge, for instance, if activated monomers are produced in the environment by an <italic>in situ</italic> activation chemistry, and subsequently transported into the compartment containing the VCG, while no activation takes place within the compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>].</p>
<p>To explore the replication efficiency of this monomer-only activation scenario, we first consider a pool consisting only of activated monomers as well as non-activated dimers and VCG oligomers of a single length (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). We vary the concentration of VCG oligomers, but keep the feedstock concentrations constant. For small VCG concentrations, we observe low efficiencies (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>), as the ligation of two monomers, or one monomer and one dimer, are most likely. Conversely, high <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline46.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> facilitates the formation of complexes in which VCG oligomers are extended by monomers, which implies high efficiency (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). Note that, unlike in systems where all oligomers are activated, replication efficiency does not decrease for high VCG concentration, as erroneous V+V ligations are impossible.

In this limit, almost all VCG oligomers are part of a duplex. Monomers can bind to these duplexes to form complexes allowing for 1+V ligations. Since almost all VCG oligomers are already part of a duplex, increasing <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline49.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> further does not increase the fraction of VCG oligomers that can be extended by monomers.

In contrast to the more complex case considered further below, here, the asymptotic value does not depend on the length of the VCG oligomers.

This scaling implies that longer oligomers require exponentially lower VCG concentration to achieve a given ratio <italic>r</italic><sub>1+<italic>V</italic></sub> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>), as their greater length allows them to form more stable complexes. This observation implies that pools with longer oligomers will always be more productive than pools with shorter oligomers (at equal VCG concentration).</p>
<p>The behavior becomes more complex in pools containing VCG oligomers of multiple lengths, due to the competitive binding within such heterogeneous pools. To illustrate this, we examine an ensemble containing VCG oligomers ranging from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline51.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline52.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> along with the same feedstock as previously (activated monomers and non-activated dimers, see <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). For simplicity, we assume that the length-distribution of VCG oligomers is uniform. We study the fraction of oligomers in a monomer extension-competent state as a function of oligomer length,

At low VCG concentration, longer oligomers are more likely to be extended by monomers than shorter ones (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). This behavior is intuitive, as longer oligomers tend to form more stable complexes, which lead to higher productivity. Surprisingly, increasing the VCG concentration reverses the length-dependence of the productivity, such that short oligomers are more likely to be extended by monomers than long ones (note the three crossings of the curves in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). For example, 8-mers are more likely to undergo primer-extension than 9-mers once the VCG concentration exceeds correct value ≈ 0.5 μM. We derived a semi-analytical expression for the threshold VCG concentrations at which oligomers of two different lengths have equal productivity (see dashed lines in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>, Supplementary Material Sections S-X and S-XI).</p>

which denotes the fraction of oligomers of length <italic>L</italic><sub>E</sub> that are in a monomer extension-competent complex configuration that uses an template.

Focusing on 8-mers and 9-mers as an example, we observe that complexes utilizing the 9-mer as template cause the inversion of productivity (top two curves in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>): As the VCG concentration increases, the fraction of monomer-extendable 8-mers eventually surpasses the fraction of monomer-extendable 9-mers, i.e., <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline55.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>).

In summary, short oligomers sequester long oligomers as templates to enhance their monomer-extension rate, while long oligomers cannot make use of short oligomers as templates due to the relative instability of the corresponding complexes.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that Ding <italic>et al</italic>. have already observed the inversion of productivity experimentally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. In their study, they included activated monomers, activated imidazolium-bridged dinucleotides and oligomers up to a length of 12 nt, and observed that the primer extension rate for short primers is higher than the extension rate of long primers. Even though our model differs from their setup in some aspects (e.g., different circular genome, no bridged dinucleotides) evaluating our model using parameters similar to those of the experimentally studied system predicts inversion of productivity that qualitatively agrees with the experimental findings (Supplementary Material Section S-XII). We therefore assume that the mechanism underlying inversion of productivity described here also applies to the experimental observations.</p>

Here, we studied a scenario proposed by Zhou <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>] (the ‘Virtual Circular Genome’, VCG) using theoretical and computational approaches. We analyzed the process whereby template-directed ligation replicates the genomic information that is collectively stored in the VCG oligomers. Our analysis revealed a trade-off between the fidelity and the yield of this process: At low concentration of VCG oligomers, most of the ligations produce oligomers that are too short to specify a unique locus on the genome, resulting in a low yield of replication (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-C</xref>). At high VCG concentration, erroneous templated ligations limit the fidelity of replication (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C-D</xref>). We considered two solutions to this trade-off: (i) a VCG pool composition that optimizes its replication behavior within the bounds of the fidelity-yield trade-off, and (ii) breaking the fidelity-yield trade-off by assuming that only monomers are activated.</p>
<p>The first solution maximizes the yield of replication for fixed fidelity. In pools containing only monomers and VCG oligomers of a single length, replication efficiency can be maximized by increasing the length of VCG oligomers and decreasing their concentration (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F-G</xref>). This reduces the likelihood of error-prone templated ligation of long oligomers. When the pool contains VCG oligomers of multiple lengths, replication efficiency is typically governed by the longest oligomer in the pool (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Including dimers as feedstock for the replication increases the error fraction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B-C</xref>), as dimers that bind to a template with a dangling end are prone to form an incorrect product (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>).</p>
<p>The second solution eliminates the error-prone templated ligation of two VCG oligomers by assuming that only monomers are activated. This enables both fidelity and yield to remain high even at high VCG concentrations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>), effectively breaking the fidelity-yield trade-off. Unsurprisingly, longer VCG oligomers are then more likely to be extended than shorter oligomers at equal concentration, (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). However, this is only true for pools with VCG oligomers of a single length — once multiple VCG oligomer lengths compete with each other, shorter oligomers can be more productive than longer ones (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). This feature, which has also been observed experimentally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], is caused by an asymmetry in the productive interaction between short and long oligomers (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>): While short oligomers can sequester longer oligomers as templates for their extension by a monomer, short oligomers are unlikely to serve as templates for longer oligomers (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D-E</xref>).</p>
<p>If the VCG scenario is to close the gap between prebiotic chemistry and ribozyme-catalyzed replication, VCG pools need to be capable of replicating (parts of) ribozymes that play a role in the emergence of life. While there are cases of small ribozymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>] or ribozymes with small active sites, such as the Hammerhead ribozyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>], ribozymes obtained experimentally via <italic>in vitro</italic> evolution are typically more than a hundred nucleotides long [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. In principle, long genomes (e.g., 1000 nt long) could be replicated in VCG pools containing relatively short oligomers (e.g., 10 nt long) with high efficiency (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>). However, this requires a very special sequence composition of the genome. In our analysis, we assumed a clear separation between feedstock and VCG oligomers, defined by a single length scale <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub>, where all possible sequences of length <italic>L</italic> &lt; <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub> are part of the feedstock and occur in the genome sequence, while any sequence of length <italic>L</italic> ≥ <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub> specifies a unique locus on the virtual genome. Such a sequence composition is particularly beneficial for the virtual circular genome scenario. However, the sequence composition of a generic genome sequence is characterized by two distinct length scales <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic>1</sub> and <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic>2</sub>: (i) The former is defined as the largest length <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic>1</sub> such that all possible subsequences of length <italic>L</italic> &lt; <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic>1</sub> are present in the genome, while (ii) <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic>2</sub> is the smallest length such that all subsequences of the genome with length <italic>L</italic> ≥ <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic>2</sub> are unique, i.e., they appear only once in the genome. These two length scales coincide for the specific sequence composition assumed by our analysis, but <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic>2</sub> could be significantly longer than <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic>1</sub> in prebiotically interesting genomes containing ribozyme sequences. Note that <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic>1</sub> will generally scale logarithmically with the genome length, <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic>1</sub> ∼ ln <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub>, while <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic>2</sub> is constrained by the functional requirements of the biomolecules encoded by the genome.</p>
<p>For efficient replication of VCG pools, the second length scale, <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic>2</sub>, of the genome composition will determine the required length <italic>L</italic><sub>V</sub> of the VCG oligomers. Our analysis showed that replication is efficient, if the VCG oligomers are significantly (more than two-fold) longer than <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub>, which is equal to <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic>2</sub> for our idealized genome composition. We expect the interplay of the competing template-directed ligation processes in VCG pools in our idealized scenario to be transferable to the general case, such that genomes with arbitrary <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic>2</sub> can also be efficiently replicated, if the oligomers in the pool are more than two-fold longer than <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic>2</sub>. These sufficiently long oligomers enable the formation of productive complexes, in which the hybridization regions are typically longer than <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic>2</sub>, leading to mostly correct products. On the contrary, if the characteristic length of oligomers in the VCG pool is too short, sequence scrambling leads to a loss of the information of the VCG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>].</p>
<p>Based on this reasoning, it is interesting to note that the virtual circular genome scenario creates a selection pressure for prebiotic genomes to reduce their <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic>2</sub>: A VCG pool encoding a genome containing multiple copies of certain long sequence motifs would replicate less efficiently than a pool for which a shorter motif length already specifies a unique locus on the genome. This comparison assumes all other properties of the two systems being the same, in particular the length distribution of the oligomers in the two pools. As our analysis shows, this length distribution is the key factor determining the replication efficiency for a given genome sequence. The length distribution, in turn, is determined by an interplay between the chemical kinetics of the system and the molecular transport controlled by its physical environment: For example, templated ligation in an open system with continuous in- and outflux of oligomers can lead to a non-monotoneous length distribution with a concentration peak at a characteristic oligomer length, <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>, which is set by the competition between dehybridization and outflux [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Via this emergent length-scale, the environment exerts a selection pressure on replication in the VCG scenario: While a VCG pool replicates its genome with high efficiency if the environment preferentially forms long oligomers, <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> &gt; <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic>2</sub>, replication in environments with small characteristic oligomer length is expected to eliminate repeating sequence motifs that are longer than <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>. Mutational errors could replace long repeated sequence motifs by alternative sequences with shorter unique motifs, which may be functionally equivalent.</p>
<p>Given the broad range of prebiotically plausible non-equilibrium environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>], it is reasonable to expect that some environments provide the required conditions for efficient replication. The constraints formulated in this work can help to guide the search for self-replicating VCG pools, in the vast space of possible concentration profiles and non-equilibrium environments.</p>

<title>Computing replication observables based on the kinetic simulation</title>
<p>We simulate the dynamics of VCG pools using a kinetic simulation that is based on the Gillespie algorithm. In the simulation, oligomers can hybridize to each other to form complexes, or dehybridize from an existing complex. Moreover, two oligomers can undergo templated ligation if they are hybridized adjacent to each other on a third oligomer. At each time t, the state of the system is determined by a list of all single-stranded oligomers and complexes as well as their respective copy number. We refer to the state of the system at the time t as the ensemble of compounds ℰ<sub><italic>t</italic></sub>. Given the copy numbers, the rates r<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> of all possible chemical reactions <italic>i</italic> ∈ ℐ can be computed. To evolve the system in time, we need to perform two steps: (i) We sample the waiting time until the next reaction, <italic>τ</italic>, from an exponential distribution with mean <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline59a.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, and update the simulation time, t → <italic>t</italic> + <italic>τ</italic>. (ii) We pick which reaction to perform by sampling from a categorical distribution. Here, the probability to pick reaction <italic>i</italic> equals <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline59b.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>.The copy numbers are updated according to the sampled reaction, yielding ℰ<sub><italic>t</italic>+<italic>τ</italic></sub>. Steps (i) and (ii) are repeated until the simulation time t reaches the desired final time, <italic>t</italic><sub>final</sub>. A more detailed explanation of the kinetic simulation is presented in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>].</p>
<p>Our goal is to compute observables characterizing replication in the VCG scenario based on the full kinetic simulation. For clarity, we focus on one particular observable (yield) for the derivation. The results for other observables are stated directly, as their derivations follow analogously. Recall the definition of the yield introduced in the main text,
<disp-formula id="ueqn11">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v2_ueqn11.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
As we are interested in the initial replication performance of the VCG, we compute the yield based on the ligation events that take place until the characteristic timescale of ligations <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline60.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> t<sub>0</sub>. We would like to compute the yield based on the templated ligation events that we observe in the simulation. Unfortunately, for reasonable system parameters, it is impossible to simulate the system long enough to observe sufficiently many ligation events to compute y to reasonable accuracy. For example, for a VCG pool containing monomers at a total concentration of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline61.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> mM and VCG oligomers of length <italic>L</italic> = 8 at a total concentration of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline62.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, it would take about 1700 hours of simulation time to reach t = 5·10<sup>12</sup> t<sub>0</sub>. Multiple such runs would be needed to estimate the mean and the variance of the observables of interest, rendering this approach unfeasible.</p>
<p>Instead, we compute the replication observables based on the copy number of complexes that could potentially perform a templated ligation, i.e., complexes, in which two strands are hybridized adjacent to each other, such that they could form a covalent bond. It can be shown analytically that the number of potentially productive complexes is a good approximation for the number of incorporated nucleotides. The number of incorporated nucleotides can be computed as the integral over the ligation flux, weighted by the number of nucleotides that are added in each templated ligation reaction,

As only few ligation events are expected to happen until <italic>τ</italic><sub>lig</sub>, it is reasonable to assume that the ensembles ℰ<sub><italic>t</italic></sub> do not change significantly during <italic>t</italic> ∈ [0, <italic>τ</italic><sub>lig</sub>]. Therefore, the integration over time may be interpreted as a multiplication by <italic>τ</italic><sub>lig</sub>,

where ⟨…⟩ denotes the average over realizations of the ensembles <italic>ℰ</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> within the time interval <italic>t</italic> ∈[<italic>τ</italic><sub>eq</sub>, <italic>τ</italic><sub>lig</sub>]. Note that, at this point, we made the additional assumption that no templated ligations are taking place between [0, <italic>τ</italic><sub>eq</sub>]. This assumption is reasonable, as (i) the equilibration process is very short compared to the characteristic timescale of ligation, and (ii) the number of complexes that might allow for templated ligation during equilibration is lower than in the equilibrium (we start the simulation with an ensemble of single-stranded oligomers), implying that the rate of templated ligation is small.</p>
<p>In order to compute the average over different realizations of ensembles ℰ, we need to sample a set of uncorrelated ensembles that have reached the hybridization equilibrium. For this purpose, we run a full kinetic simulation. The simulation starts with a pool containing only single-stranded oligomers, and reaches the (de)hybridization equilibrium after a time <italic>τ</italic><sub>eq</sub>. We identify this timescale of equilibration by fitting an exponential function to the total hybridization energy of all complexes in the system, ΔG<sub>tot</sub> (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>). In the set of ensembles used to evaluate the average in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqnS1">Eq. (S1)</xref>, we only include ensembles for time <italic>t</italic> &gt; <italic>τ</italic><sub>eq</sub> to ensure that the ensembles have reached (de)hybridization equilibrium. To ensure that the ensembles are uncorrelated, we require that the time between two ensembles that contribute to the average is at least τ<sub>corr</sub>. The correlation time, τ<sub>corr</sub>, is determined via an exponential fit to the autocorrelation function of Δ<italic>G</italic><sub>tot</sub> (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>). Besides computing the expectation value (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqnS1">Eq. S1</xref>), we are also interested in the “uncertainty” of this expectation value, i.e., in the standard deviation of the sample mean <italic>σ</italic><sub>⟨<italic>X</italic>⟩</sub>. (We use X as a short-hand notation for ∑<sub><monospace>C</monospace>∈ℰ</sub> <italic>N</italic> (<monospace>C</monospace>) min(<italic>L</italic><sub>e,1</sub>, <italic>L</italic><sub>e,2</sub>) 𝟙(<monospace>C</monospace> allows for templated ligation).) The standard deviation of the sample mean, <italic>σ</italic><sub>⟨<italic>X</italic>⟩</sub>, is related to the standard deviation of <italic>X, σ</italic><sub><italic>X</italic></sub>, by the number of samples, <italic>σ</italic><sub>⟨<italic>X</italic>⟩</sub> = (<italic>N</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>)<sup>−1<italic>/</italic>2</sup><italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>X</italic></sub>. Moreover, based on the van-Kampen system size expansion, we expect the standard deviation of X to be proportional to <italic>V</italic> <sup>−1<italic>/</italic>2</sup>. Thus, <italic>σ</italic><sub>⟨<italic>X</italic>⟩</sub> ∝ (<italic>N</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub><italic>V</italic>)<sup>−1<italic>/</italic>2</sup>.</p>

Therefore, the variance of the computed observable can be reduced by either increasing the system volume or increasing the number of samples used for averaging. Both approaches incur the same computational cost: (i) Increasing the number of samples, <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>, requires running the simulation for a longer duration, with the additional runtime scaling linearly with the number of samples. (ii) Similarly, the additional runtime needed due to increased system volume, <italic>V</italic>, also scales linearly with <italic>V</italic> (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). One update step in the simulation always takes roughly the same amount of runtime, but the change in simulation time per update step depends on the total rate of all reactions in the system. The total rate is dominated by the association reactions, and their rate is proportional to the volume. Therefore, the change in simulation time per update step is proportional to <italic>V</italic> <sup>−1</sup>. The runtime, which is necessary to reach the same simulation time in a system with volume <italic>V</italic> as in a system with volume 1, is a factor of <italic>V</italic> longer in the larger system. With this in mind, it makes no difference whether the variance is reduced by increasing the volume or the number of samples. For practical reasons (post-processing of the simulations is then less memory- and time-consuming), we opt to choose moderate number of samples, but slightly higher system volumes to compute the observables of interest.

<title>Coarse-grained representation of complexes in the adiabatic approach</title>
<p>It is computationally expensive to evaluate the replication observables via the full kinetic simulation. For this reason, we develop an adiabatic approach, which allows us to compute the replication observables, provided that templated ligation is far slower than (de)hybridization. The adiabatic approach relies on a coarse-grained representation of the oligomers in the pool, which is introduced in this section.</p>
<sec id="s5b1">
<title>Single Strands</title>
<p>In the coarse-grained description, oligomers of identical length are assumed to have equal concentration, irrespective of their sequence. This assumption is justified for two reasons: (i) We initialize the VCG pool without sequence bias, i.e., all oligomers compatible with the genome sequence are included at equal concentration. (ii) Hybridization energy in our simplified energy model (and therefore also the stability of complexes) only depends on the length of the hybridization site, not on its sequence, provided there is no mismatch. Each coarse-grained oligomer is uniquely identified by its length <italic>L</italic>, and it represents a group of oligomers with ℭ (<italic>L</italic>) distinct sequences. We refer to the number ℭ (<italic>L</italic>) as the combinatorial multiplicity of the coarse-grained oligomer. The value of ℭ (<italic>L</italic>) depends on the choice of the encoded genome. By construction (see main text), we assume that all possible oligomer sequences of length <italic>L</italic> &lt; <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub> are included in the genome. For <italic>L</italic> ≥ <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub>, only a subset of all possible 4<sup><italic>L</italic></sup> sequences is included, but no sequence is repeated multiple times across the genome. Therefore, the combinatorial multiplicity equals

<p>Two strands can form a duplex by hybridizing to each other. We refer to the bottom oligomer as ‘Crick” strand C and to the top oligomer as “Watson” strand W. A duplex is uniquely characterized by the lengths of the oligomers, <italic>L</italic><sub>C</sub> and <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>W</italic></sub>, as well as their relative alignment (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A</xref>). The alignment index <italic>i</italic> denotes the position of the Watson strand with respect to the Crick strand. As there needs to be at least one nucleotide of overlap between the strands for a duplex to exist, the alignment index needs lie in the interval <italic>i</italic> ∈ [ − (<italic>L</italic><sub><italic>W</italic></sub> −1), <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>C</italic></sub> − 1]. Using the alignment index, we can also determine if the duplex has a left (or right) dangling end. The corresponding indicator variables are called <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>l</italic></sub> (or <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>),
<disp-formula id="ueqn19">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v2_ueqn19.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>

Moreover, the length of the hybridization region <italic>L</italic><sub>o</sub> can be computed via
<disp-formula id="ueqn20">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v2_ueqn20.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
The hybridization energy of the duplex depends on the length of the hybridization region as well as on the existence/absence of dangling ends. For a hybridization site of length <italic>L</italic><sub>o</sub>, there are <italic>L</italic><sub>o</sub> − 1 nearest-neighbor energy blocks each of which contributes <italic>γ</italic> to the energy. Moreover, each dangling end contributes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline66.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> to the energy,
<disp-formula id="ueqn21">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v2_ueqn21.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
To compute the combinatorial multiplicity for a duplex with fixed <italic>L</italic><sub>C</sub>, <italic>L</italic><sub>W</sub> and alignment index <italic>i</italic>, we need to multiply the combinatorial multiplicity of the Crick strand by the number of possible hybridization partners. We assume that a hybridization partner is possible if its sequence is perfectly complementary to the lower strand within the hybridization region, whereas hybridization partners with mismatches are not accounted for. This is sensible as long as the energetic penalty for mismatches in the full kinetic simulation is sufficiently large to suppress mismatches. The number of possible hybridization partners is determined by the length of the overlap region <italic>L</italic><sub>o</sub>: If <italic>L</italic><sub>o</sub> ≥ <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub>, the pool contains only one oligomer sequence that can act as hybridization partner by construction of the genome. For shorter hybridization regions, multiple hybridization partners might be possible. Their number is set by the combinatorial multiplicity of the Watson oligomer divided by the combinatorial multiplicity of the hybridization region,
<disp-formula id="ueqn22">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v2_ueqn22.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
To avoid double-counting, we only account for complexes in which the Crick strand is at least as long as the Watson strand, <italic>L</italic><sub>C</sub> ≥ <italic>L</italic><sub>W</sub>, and multiply ℭ (<italic>L</italic><sub>W</sub>, <italic>L</italic><sub>C</sub>, <italic>i</italic>) by 1/2 if <italic>L</italic><sub>W</sub> = <italic>L</italic><sub>C</sub>.</p>

<title>Triplexes</title>
<p>Triplexes, i.e., complexes comprised of three strands, are uniquely characterized by the length of the three oligomers, <italic>L</italic><sub>C</sub>, <italic>L</italic><sub>W,1</sub>, <italic>L</italic><sub>W,2</sub>, as well as their respective alignment (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3B</xref>). The alignment index <italic>i</italic> denotes the position of strand <monospace>W1</monospace> relative to strand <monospace>C</monospace>. Analogously, j denotes the relative position of <monospace>W2</monospace> relative to oligomer <monospace>C</monospace>. Two strands that are hybridized to each other need to have a hybridization region of at least one nucleotide. Moreover, the strands <monospace>W1</monospace> and <monospace>W2</monospace> must not occupy the same position on the template strand <monospace>C</monospace>. Taking both requirements together, the alignment indices fall within the intervals,
<disp-formula id="ueqn23">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v2_ueqn23.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
A triplex may have a dangling end not only on its left or right end, but also in the gap between strands <monospace>W1</monospace> and <monospace>W2</monospace>. Three boolean variables are necessary to denote the presence/absence of the respective dangling ends,
<disp-formula id="ueqn24">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v2_ueqn24.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>

The length of the two hybridization regions are given by
<disp-formula id="ueqn25">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v2_ueqn25.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
The hybridization energy depends on the length of the overlap regions as well as on the existence of dangling ends: As in the duplex, each overlap region of length <italic>L</italic><sub>o,1</sub> (or <italic>L</italic><sub>o,2</sub>) comprises <italic>L</italic><sub>o,1</sub> −1 (or <italic>L</italic><sub>o,2</sub> −1) nearest neighbor blocks, each of which contributes <italic>γ</italic> to the total energy. Moreover, every dangling end contributes <italic>γ</italic>/2. Note that the presence of a gap between strands <monospace>W1</monospace> and <monospace>W2</monospace>, i.e., <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> = 1, implies that there are two dangling ends, one for <monospace>W1</monospace> and another for <monospace>W2</monospace>. Gaps in between two complexes contribute <italic>γ</italic>/2 per each dangling end, adding up to <italic>γ</italic>. If there is no gap between the strands, i.e., <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> = 0, there are no dangling end contributions, but a new full nearest neighbor block emerges, which contributes <italic>γ</italic> to the energy. Therefore, the total energy reads,
<disp-formula id="ueqn26">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v2_ueqn26.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
The combinatorial multiplicity of a triplex is computed in the same way as for the duplex: The combinatorial multiplicity of the strand C is multiplied by the number of possible hybridization partners <monospace>W1</monospace> and <monospace>W2</monospace>. Again, the number of possible partners is set by the length of the hybridization regions,
<disp-formula id="ueqn27">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v2_ueqn27.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>

We use 𝟙 to denote the indicator function which returns 1 in case the condition in the bracket is fulfilled and zero otherwise. As all triplexes are asymmetric, there is no need to introduce a symmetry correction factor.</p>

<title>Numerical solution of the (de)hybridization equilibrium in the adiabatic approach</title>
<p>Based on the list of complexes constructed in the previous section, we can compute the equilibrium concentration of strands and complexes reached in the (de)hybridization equilibrium.

Recall that we assumed that all sequences of a given length that are compatible with the circular genome are equally likely in the pool (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5b">Section S-II</xref>). Thus, the concentration of the coarse-grained oligomer and the concentration of an oligomer with specified sequence are related by the combinatorial multiplicity,

In order to compute the concentration of a complex based on the concentration of single strands, we make use of the law of mass action. The concentration of a specific sequence realization of a complex is computed as the product of concentrations of the strands forming the complex divided by the dissociation constant <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub>,

<p>In the adiabatic approach, we study the behavior of the system on timescales that are long enough for the system to reach the (de)hybridization equilibrium, but too short for templated ligation events to take place. Therefore, the length of the oligomers are expected not to change throughout the equilibration process, and we need to introduce a separate mass conservation law for each coarse-grained oligomer, i.e., each oligomer length, that is included in the pool. For each length, the concentration of single-stranded coarse-grained oligomers of length <italic>L</italic> and the concentration of coarse-grained oligomers of length <italic>L</italic> bound in a complex need to add up to their total concentration <italic>c</italic><sup>tot</sup>(<italic>L</italic>) set by the initial condition,

<p>Combining the mass conservation requirement with the mass action law gives a set of coupled polynomial equations. The number of equations equals the number of distinct oligomer lengths included in the pool. The polynomial equations are of degree 4, as tetraplexes are the largest complexes to be accounted for and their concentrations equals the product of the four strands comprising the complex. We determine the equilibrium concentrations by finding the root of this set of fourth-degree polynomial equations using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.</p>

<p>As we are not modeling templated ligation events explicitely in the adiabatic approach, we compute replication observables based on the equilibrium concentration of complexes that are in a configuration which allows for a templated ligation reaction to happen. Templated ligations are possible if two strands in the complex are adjacent to each other, i.e., there is no gap in between two oligomers that are hybridized to the same template strand (<xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7</xref>). Recall that the absence of a gap between two oligomers in the complex implies that the dangling end indicator variable d<sub><italic>m</italic></sub> = 0 (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5b">Section S-II</xref>). The length of the product strand <monospace>P</monospace> is equal to the sum of the lengths of the two educt strands <monospace>E1</monospace> and <monospace>E2</monospace>, <italic>L</italic><sub>P</sub> = <italic>L</italic><sub>E,1</sub> + <italic>L</italic><sub>E,2</sub>. We can use the information about the length of the product strand to compute the yield of replication.

<p>In order to compute the fidelity of replication, we need to distinguish between product oligomers sequences that are compatible with the genomes (correct sequences) and sequences that are incompatible with the genome (false sequences). As we do not know about the details of the sequences due to the coarse-grained representation of the complexes, we need to invoke a combinatorial argument to determine the fraction of correct products. To this end, we compare the number of product sequences that might be produced in a complex of given oligomer lengths and relative oligomer position, to the number of correct products. The combinatorial multiplicity of the products that <bold>could</bold> be produced by a complex of given configuration is set by the combinatorial multiplicity of the possible templates, ℭ (<italic>L</italic><sub>o,1</sub> + <italic>L</italic><sub>o,2</sub>), multiplied by the multiplicity of the educt strands hybridizing to the template with given lengths of the hybridization regions, <italic>L</italic><sub>o,1</sub> and <italic>L</italic><sub>o,2</sub>,

<p>Note that, in principle, the monomer can be added to the 5’- or the 3’-end of the oligomer, leading to two contributions in the numerator, which are identical due to symmetry, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline108.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>Just like in the previous section, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline109.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> denotes the equilibrium concentration of all complexes allowing for the templated ligation of oligomers of length L to oligomers of length M if templated by oligomers of length N. We assume that triplexes are the dominant type of complexes facilitating templated ligation, and write the equilibrium concentration as,
<disp-formula id="ueqn79">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v2_ueqn79.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>

Therefore, the fraction of monomer-extendable oligomers reads,

<graphic xlink:href="603910v2_ueqn80.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
In the limit of high VCG concentration, almost all VCG oligomers form duplexes. Hence, the equilibrium concentration of free oligomers can be approximated by,
<disp-formula id="ueqn81">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v2_ueqn81.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>

implying,

<graphic xlink:href="603910v2_eqnS8.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>

As almost all monomers are free in solution, their equilibrium concentration may be approximated by the total concentration of monomers, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline110.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>From this representation of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline111.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, it is not clear yet why <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline112.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> should be independent of <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>V</italic></sub>.

As illustrated in <xref rid="figS13" ref-type="fig">Fig. S13</xref>, the effective association constant of the triplex may be obtained by multiplying the effective association constant of the duplex by the binding affinity of the monomer. We need to distinguish the contributions of duplexes based on the length of their hybridization region: If the two strands in the duplex form a hybridization region that is as long as the oligomers, there is no free base pair for the monomer to hybridize; such duplexes must be excluded in the computation of the triplex association constant.</p>
<p>Similarly, monomers that hybridize to the end of a strand have a different binding affinity than monomers hybridizing to the center of an oligomer (<xref rid="figS13" ref-type="fig">Fig. S13A</xref> vs. <xref rid="figS13" ref-type="fig">Fig. S13B-C</xref>). All in all, the effective triplex association constant reads,

The notation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline116.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> implies that only complex configurations with a specific overlap length <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>o</italic></sub> are included.

<disp-formula id="ueqn83">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v2_ueqn83.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>

We write the duplex association constants in terms of the binding energy due to their overlap length,
<disp-formula id="ueqn84">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v2_ueqn84.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>

Addition of a single base pair will decrease the energy by the energy of a half nearest neighbor block, i.e., by <italic>γ</italic>/2. Thus, we assign K<sub><italic>d</italic></sub>(1) = exp (−|<italic>γ</italic>|/2), and find,

<title>Analytical solution for equilibrium concentrations in multi-length VCG pools</title>
<p>We consider pools comprised of monomers, dimers and VCG oligomers of multiple lengths. For simplicity, we restrict ourselves to profiles with a uniform distribution of VCG oligomers, such that all VCG oligomers have the same concentration. Assuming that almost all oligomer mass is contained in single strands and duplexes, the mass conservation equations read
<disp-formula id="ueqn87">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v2_ueqn87.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
Note that there is a mass conservation equation for each oligomer length individually, i.e., we are dealing with a set of multiple coupled quadratic equations. We can make the system of equations dimensionless by introducing a dimensionless concentration <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline117.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>,
<disp-formula id="eqnS9">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v2_eqnS9.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
This rescaling is chosen as it is the solution to the (approximative) mass conservation equation in the high concentration limit,
<disp-formula id="ueqn88">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v2_ueqn88.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
under the assumption that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline118.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. The latter assumption is reasonable given the concentration profile is uniform. We expect <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline119.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> to be of order 1 in the high concentration limit.</p>
<p>Writing the full mass conservation equation in terms of the dimensionless concentration yields,
<disp-formula id="ueqn89">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v2_ueqn89.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
We drop all ratios of total concentrations, as we assume that the total concentration is the same for each oligomer length of VCG oligomer (uniform concentration profile),
<disp-formula id="ueqn90">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v2_ueqn90.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
By introducing the dimensionless prefactors,
<disp-formula id="ueqn91">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v2_ueqn91.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
we can rewrite the mass conservation equation,
<disp-formula id="ueqn92">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v2_ueqn92.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
To solve for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline120.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, we make the assumption that the dimensionless equilibrium concentration is close to 1 for any length L. For this reason, we may assume that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline121.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. This assumption is crucial, as it allows us to de-couple the quadratic equations. Therefore, the mass conservation reads,
<disp-formula id="ueqn93">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v2_ueqn93.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
We can use this representation to compute the equilibrium concentrations recursively: We start the recursion with the assumption <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline122.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, and compute <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline123.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> with this assumption,
<disp-formula id="eqnS10">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v2_eqnS10.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
In the first recursion step, we compute <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline124.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, and solve the mass conservation equation for the equilibrium concentration,
<disp-formula id="eqnS11">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v2_eqnS11.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
This scheme can be applied until the approximated values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline125.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> match the true values (obtained via numerical root finding) sufficiently well,
<disp-formula id="ueqn94">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v2_ueqn94.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>

Note that the equilibrium concentration obtained after the (i + 1)-th iteration step <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline126.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> depends on the total concentration c<sup>tot</sup>(L) via the rescaling prefactor as well as via α<sub><italic>L</italic></sub>.

<title>Threshold concentration for the inversion of productivity</title>
<p>In VCG pools that contain VCG oligomers of multiple lengths as well as activated monomers, we observe “inversion of productivity”: The fraction of short VCG oligomers in a monomer extension-capable complex configuration exceeds that of long oligomers. However, this is only the case for sufficiently high concentration of VCG oligomers. The threshold concentration that is necessary for oligomers of length M to exceed the monomer-extension fraction of oligomers of length L (assuming M &lt; L) is set by the condition r<sub>1+V</sub>(L) = r<sub>1+V</sub>(M). To compute r<sub>1+V</sub>(L), we need to account for all possible complexes, in which an oligomer L can be extended by a monomers,
<disp-formula id="ueqn95">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v2_ueqn95.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
As we are considering a uniform concentration profile, all VCG oligomers have the same total concentration, i.e.,c<sup>tot</sup>(L) = c<sup>tot</sup>(M). Thus, we can express the condition for the threshold concentration as
<disp-formula id="ueqn96">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v2_ueqn96.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
We combine this condition with the analytical approximation of the equilibrium concentration up to the first iteration step derived in Section S-X, <italic>cf</italic>. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqnS9">Eqs. S9</xref>-<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqnS11">S11</xref>.

<title>Inversion of productivity using parameters of system studied by Ding <italic>et al</italic></title>
<p>In their experimental study, Ding <italic>et al</italic>. focus on a genome of length L<sub><italic>G</italic></sub> = 12 nt. In the VCG pool encoding the genome, Ding <italic>et al</italic>. include (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Tab. S1</xref> in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>])</p>

<list-item><p>trimers with 20 different sequences, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>tetramers up to 12-mers with 24 different sequences each.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Every oligomer sequence is included with a concentration of 1 μM (so-called 1x profile), adding up to a total concentration of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline128.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. The feedstock for the replication is comprised of activated imidazolium-bridged homo-dinucleotides with a total concentration of 20 mM. Over a timescale of around 4 h, these homo-dinucleotides react with each other to form 6 additional imidazolium-bridged hetero-dinucleotides as well as activated mononucleotides (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref> in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]).</p>
<p>We construct a genome that mimics the properties of the genome used by Ding <italic>et al</italic>., but obeys our genome construction principles outlined in the method section of the main text. To this end, we consider a genome of length <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub> = 12 nt and a minimal unique subsequence length of <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub> = 3 nt. This implies that our VCG pool contains</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>dimers with 16 different sequences, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>trimers up to 12-mers with 24 different sequences.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Our model does not include imidazolium-bridged dinucleotides explicitely. Instead, we assume that the concentration of activated mononucleotides in our model equals the total concentration of activated homo-dinucleotides (20 mM) used in the experimental study. The total concentration of non-activated oligomers is treated as a free parameters.</p>
<p>We find that the system exhibits inversion of productivity: For the entire considered range of concentration of non-activated oligomers, 10-mers are more likely to be extended by a monomer than 12-mers (<xref rid="figS15" ref-type="fig">Fig. S15</xref>). Moreover, 8-mers are more productive than 12-mers (provided the concentration of non-activated oligomers exceeds roughly 0.3 μM), and more productive than 10-mers (provided <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline129.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>). Thus, for the experimentally used concentration of non-activated oligomers (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v2_inline130.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, see vertical dashed line in <xref rid="figS15" ref-type="fig">Fig. S15</xref>), 8-mers are more productive than 10-mers, which are in turn more productive than 12-mers. Unlike in the experimental system, 6-mers are less likely than 8-mers and 10-mers to be extended by a monomer. We suppose that this difference can be attributed to the differences between the experimental setup and our theoretical model: (i) We choose a (slightly) different genome than Ding <italic>et al</italic>.. (ii) We model imidazolium-bridged dinucleotides as mononucleotides, as imidazolium-bridged dinucleotides only incorporate one mononucleotide at a time, just like activated mononucleotides. However, dinucleotides bind more stably to an existing complex than mononucleotides, which will affect the fraction of monomer-extended oligomers predicted.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> theoretical study examines the possibility of encoding genomic information in a collective of short overlapping strands (e.g., the Virtual Circular Genome (VCG) model). The study presents <bold>solid</bold> theoretical arguments, simulations and comparisons to experimental data to point at potential features and limitations of such distributed collective encoding of information. The work should be of relevance to colleagues interested in molecular information processing and to those interested in pre-Central Dogma or prebiotic models of self-replication.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This is an interesting theoretical study examining the viability of Virtual Circular Genome (VCG) model, a recently proposed scenario of prebiotic replication in which a relatively long sequence is stored as a collection of its shorter subsequences (and their compliments). It was previously pointed out that VCG model is prone to so-called sequence scrambling which limits the overall length of such a genome. In the present paper, additional limitations are identified. Specifically, it is shown that VCG is well replicated when the oligomers are elongated by sufficiently short chains from &quot;feedstock&quot; pool. However, ligation of oligomers from VCG itself results in a high error rate. I believe the research is of high quality and well written. However, the presentation could be improved and the key messages could be clarified.</p>
<p>(1) It is not clear from the paper whether the observed error has the same nature as sequence scrambling</p>
<p>
(2) The authors introduce two important lengths LS1 and LS2 only in the conclusions and do not explain enough which each of them is important. It would make sense to discuss this early in the manuscript.</p>
<p>
(3) It is not entirely clear why specific length distribution for VCG oligomers has to be assumed rather than emerged from simulations.</p>
<p>
(4) Furthermore, the problem has another important length, L0 that is never introduced or discussed: a minimal hybridization length with a lifetime longer than the ligation time. From the parameters given, it appears that L0 is sufficiently long (~10 bases). In other words, it appears that the study is done is a somewhat suboptimal regime: most hybridization events do not lead to a ligation. Am I right in this assessment? If that is the case, the authors might want to explore another regime, L0</p>
<p>
Strengths:</p>
<p>High-quality theoretical modeling of an important problem is implemented.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The conclusions are somewhat convoluted and could be presented better.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This important theoretical and computational study by Burger and Gerland attempts to set environmental, compositional, kinetic, and thermodynamic constraints on the proposed virtual circular genome (VCG) model for the early non-enzymatic replication of RNA. The authors create a solid kinetic model using published kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for non-enzymatic RNA ligation and (de)hybridization, which allows them to test a variety of hypotheses about the VCG. Prominently, the authors find that the length (longer is better) and concentration (intermediate is better) of the VCG oligos have an outsized impact on the fidelity and yield of VCG production with important implications for future VCG design. They also identify that activation of only RNA monomers, which can be achieved using environmental separation of the activation and replication, can relax the constraints on the concentration of long VCG component oligos by avoiding the error-prone oligo-oligo ligation. Finally, in a complex scenario with multiple VCG oligo lengths, the authors demonstrate a clear bias for the extension of shorter oligos compared to the longer ones. This effect has been observed experimentally (Ding et al., JACS 2023) but was unexplained rigorously until now. Overall, this manuscript will be of interest to scientists studying the origin of life and the behavior of complex nucleic acid systems.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- The kinetic model is carefully and realistically created, enabling the authors to probe the VCG thoroughly.</p>
<p>
- Fig. 6 outlines important constraints for scientists studying the origin of life. It supports the claim that the separation of activation and replication chemistry is required for efficient non-enzymatic replication. One could easily imagine a scenario where activation of molecules occurs, followed by their diffusion into another environment containing protocells that encapsulate a VCG. The selective diffusion of activated monomers across protocell membranes would then result in only activated monomers being available to the VCG, which is the constraint outlined in this work. The proposed exclusive replication by monomers also mirrors the modern biological systems, which nearly exclusively replicate by monomer extension.</p>
<p>
- Another strength of the work is that it explains why shorter oligos extend better compared to the long ones in complex VCG mixtures. This point is independent of the activation chemistry used (it simply depends on the kinetics and thermodynamics of RNA base-pairing) so it should be very generalizable.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- Most of the experimental work on the VCG has been performed with the bridged 2-aminoimidazolium dinucleotides, which are not featured in the kinetic model of this work. Oher studies by Szostak and colleagues have demonstrated that non-enzymatic RNA extension with bridged dinucleotides have superior kinetics (Walton et al. JACS 2016, Li et al. JACS 2017), fidelity (Duzdevich et al. NAR 2021), and regioselectivity (Giurgiu et al. JACS 2017) compared to activated monomers, establishing the bridged dinucleotides as important for non-enzymatic RNA replication. Therefore, the omission of these species in the kinetic model presented here can be perceived as problematic. The major claim that avoidance of oligo ligations is beneficial for VCGs may be irrelevant if bridged dinucleotides are used as the extending species, because oligo ligations (V + V in this work) are kinetically orders of magnitude slower than monomer extensions (F + V in this work) (Ding et al. NAR 2022). Formally adding the bridged dinucleotides to the kinetic model is likely outside of the scope of this work, but perhaps the authors could test if this should be done in the future by simply increasing the rate of monomer extension (F + V) to match the bridged dinucleotide rate without changing rate of V + V ligation?</p>
<p>
- The kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for oligo binding appear to be missing two potentially important components. First, base-paired RNA strands that contain gaps where an activated monomer or oligo can bind have been shown to display significantly different kinetics of ligation and binding/unbinding than complexes that do not contain such gaps (see Prywes et al. eLife 2016, Banerjee et al. Nature Nanotechnology 2023, and Todisco et al. JACS 2024). Would inclusion of such parameters alter the overall kinetic model? Second, it has been shown that long base-paired RNA can tolerate mismatches to an extent that can result in monomer ligation to such mismatched duplexes (see Todisco et al. NAR 2024). Would inclusion of the parameters published in Todisco et al. NAR 2024 alter the kinetic model significantly?</p>
