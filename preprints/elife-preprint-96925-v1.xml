<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Most human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are not infiltrated with cytotoxic T cells and are highly resistant to immunotherapy. Over 90% of PDAC have oncogenic KRAS mutations, and phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are direct effectors of KRAS. Our previous study demonstrated that ablation of <italic>Pik3ca</italic> in KPC (<italic>Kras</italic><sup>G12D</sup>; <italic>Trp53</italic><sup>R172H</sup>; <italic>Pdx1-Cre</italic>) pancreatic cancer cells induced host T cells to infiltrate and completely eliminate the tumors in a syngeneic orthotopic implantation mouse model. Now, we show that implantation of <italic>Pik3ca</italic><sup>-/-</sup> KPC (named αKO) cancer cells induces clonal expansion of cytotoxic T cells infiltrating the pancreatic tumors. To identify potential molecules that can regulate the activity of these anti-tumor T cells, we conducted an <italic>in vivo</italic> genome-wide gene-deletion screen using αKO cells implanted in the mouse pancreas. The result shows that deletion of propionyl-CoA carboxylase subunit B gene (<italic>Pccb</italic>) in αKO cells (named p-αKO) leads to immune evasion, tumor progression and death of host mice. Surprisingly, p-αKO tumors are still infiltrated with clonally expanded CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells but they are inactive against tumor cells. However, blockade of PD-L1/PD1 interaction reactivated these clonally expanded T cells infiltrating p-αKO tumors, leading to slower tumor progression and improve survival of host mice. These results indicate that <italic>Pccb</italic> can modulate the activity of cytotoxic T cells infiltrating some pancreatic cancers and this understanding may lead to improvement in immunotherapy for this difficult-to-treat cancer.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most aggressive and lethal cancers, and it is expected to be the 2<sup>nd</sup> leading cause of cancer death by 2030, with a five-year survival rate of 12% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Most PDACs are classified as “cold” tumors without infiltrating T cells and are resistant to currently available immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). To convert PDAC into “hot” tumors, researchers have explored multiple strategies to promote immune responsiveness of PDAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). These approaches encompass targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, including PD1, CTLA4, LAG3, and TIGIT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>), suppressing immunosuppressive cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and/or tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), enhancing antigen processing and epitope presentation by promoting MHC class I/II cell surface expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>) and reinstating the expansion and functionality of dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>), targeting key factors implicated in stromal fibrosis to facilitate the infiltration of T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>), and depleting immunosuppressive signals (cytokines and chemokines) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) that hinder the entry and function of T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). However, a previous study showed that a minority of PDAC patients have tumors that already exhibit higher levels of infiltrating cytotoxic T cells and this observation is associated with longer survival of these patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the most commonly dysregulated pathways in PDAC is oncogenic KRAS and G12D is the most common KRAS mutation (46%) in PDAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are direct effectors of KRAS. There are four PI3K catalytic isoforms and our group have previously shown that PIK3CA isoform plays a critical role in the initiation of PDAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>) and mediates immune evasion once the tumors are formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Our group reported that KRAS signaling through PIK3CA can reduce the expression of MHC class I molecules, thus reducing antigen recognition and T cell infiltration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). We showed that genetic ablation of PIK3CA in KPC (<italic>Kras<sup>G12D</sup>;Trp53<sup>R172H</sup>;Pdx1-Cre</italic>) pancreatic tumor cells led to T cell recognition and complete elimination by the host immune system in a syngeneic orthotopic implantation mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Using this well-characterized syngeneic orthotopic implantation mouse model with the αKO (<italic>Kras<sup>G12D</sup>;Trp53<sup>R172H</sup>;Pdx1-Cre;Pik3ca<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) cell line and single-cell sequencing analysis, we found clonal expansion of cytotoxic T cells infiltrating αKO tumors. To investigate potential molecules within αKO cells that affect the activity of host T cells, we performed an <italic>in vivo</italic> genome-wide CRISPR gene-deletion screen using αKO cells and found that deletion of propionyl-CoA carboxylase subunit B (PCCB) could reverse the immune-elimination phenotype. We further discovered that T cells infiltrating the p-αKO (<italic>Kras<sup>G12D</sup>;Trp53<sup>R172H</sup>;Pdx1-Cre;Pik3ca<sup>-/-</sup>;Pccb<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) tumors were suppressed and could not eliminate the tumor cells. However, these exhausted anti-tumor T cells could be reactivated by neutralizing the PD-L1/PD1 axis, restoring the ability of these immune cells to eliminate the pancreatic tumor.</p>

<title>Clonal expansion of cytotoxic T cells infiltrating the pancreatic αKO tumors</title>
<p>In our previous study, we demonstrated that αKO tumors, when implanted in immunocompetent C57BL/6 (B6) mice, are recognized and eliminated by the host immune system, with cytotoxic T cells playing a pivotal role in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). To investigate the status of the cytotoxic T cells infiltrating to the tumor microenvironment (TME), single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was conducted in combination with concurrent T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire sequencing. On day #12 post implantation in two B6 mice, both of the αKO tumors were harvested and dissociated to generate single cell suspensions. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were isolated using microbead preparations, and both the transcriptional expression and TCR repertoire profiles were obtained using 10x genomic protocols (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Following stringent quality control filters (outlined in the Methods section), we successfully obtained gene expression profiles and TCR sequences from the same cytotoxic T cells.</p>

<p>The diverse expression of TCR repertories is crucial for effective adaptive immune responses. Sequencing the TCR repertoire allows us to identify clonotypic diversity and detect clonal expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Analysis of the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells’ clonal size distribution revealed clonal expansions in both αKO tumors, suggesting T cells in both tumors have been activated in response to tumor antigen (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). A clonotype is defined as 3 or more cells with identical TCR sequences. A clonal size of 3 to 49 is defined as small expansion, and a clonal size of 50 or more is designated as large expansion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> displays the TCR sequences for CD8<sup>+</sup> clones with large expansions (clonal size ≥50) in both tumors.</p>
<p>We next analyzed the clonality of these cells with respect to their transcriptomes. The gene expression profiles were visualized using the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). To achieve this, the expression data underwent unsupervised clustering by Seurat. Cell type annotations were determined using ProjectTILs, a computational method that annotates cell types by projecting scRNA-seq data onto reference profiles constructed from well-established canonical cell markers and clinical data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). The Violin Plot in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> illustrates major markers used for cell type annotation by ProjectTILs. Based on the annotation, clusters are annotated as effector memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (Cd8_EffectorMem), naïve-like CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (Cd8_NaiveLike), exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (Cd8_Tex), and precursor exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (Cd8_Tpex). We next mapped the TCR profiling datasets to the single-cell gene expression datasets and then color coded by the size of each clonotype (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). The degree of expansion observed among the clonotypes associated strongly with the phenotypic clusters of T cells, as large clones are mapped to the Cd8_EffectorMem and Cd8_Tex, while nonclonal T cells mapped to the Naïve T cell group (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref> shows the single-cell gene profile distribution of large expansion (clonal size ≥50) clonotype from both tumors. Taken together, these results show that there is a massive expansion of Cd8_EffectorMem clones and these activated anti-tumor T cells are likely are responsible for the immune-mediated elimination of αKO pancreatic tumors.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>A genome-wide CRISPR gene-deletion screen to identify molecules contributing to Pik3ca-mediated pancreatic tumor immune evasion</title>
<p>To identify potential molecules in tumor cells that can regulate the activity of these anti-tumor clonal T cells, we conducted an <italic>in vivo</italic> genome-wide gene-deletion screen using αKO cells implanted in the mouse pancreas. A schema for the CRISPR knockout screen is shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>. Briefly, αKO cells were first infected with the Genome-Scale CRISPR Knockout (GeCKO v2) pooled lentiviral library A, which targets the complete mouse genome of 20,611 genes with three sgRNAs for each gene, as well as four sgRNAs for each of the 1175 miRNAs and 1000 control sgRNAs. Equal portion of the mixed cell pool was implanted into the pancreas of eight immunocompetent B6 mice and tumor progression was monitored longitudinally by an IVIS Lumina III <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging system (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). When implanted in B6 mice, αKO tumors completely regressed. Therefore, cells with genetically deleted molecules that can reverse the immune recognition phenotype should lead to tumor progression. Indeed, 2 out of 8 mice eight weeks after cell implantation exhibited tumor progression, which were labeled as tumor #1 and tumor #2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Tumors were harvested from both mice for further analysis. The remaining mice (6 out 8) exhibited complete tumor regression consistent with the phenotype we previously observed with αKO cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Genomic DNA was prepared from both tumors and subjected to next generation sequencing (NGS) to detect the presence of incorporated sgRNA sequences. Sequenced data was analyzed using Model-based Analysis of Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 Knockout (MAGeCK), and the counts for each sgRNA sequence are shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> (full list shown in the Supplementary File 2). Somewhat surprisingly, four common sgRNA sequences were identified in both tumors. The four targeted genes are <italic>Pccb</italic> (propionyl-CoA carboxylase), <italic>Nr6a1</italic> (nuclear receptor subfamily 6 group A member 1), <italic>Ldoc1l</italic> (leucine-zipper protein 1), and <italic>Adck3</italic> (aarF-domain-containing kinase 3). Tumor #2 has two additional sgRNA sequences targeting two other genes that were not present in Tumor #1. Despite the fact that tumor #1 and tumor #2 grew at different rates and were harvested at different time points, week 7 and week 13 respectively, the detected sgRNAs were highly similar, strongly suggesting that the identified genes play critical roles in <italic>Pik3ca</italic>-mediated immune evasion.</p>

Pooled cells were implanted in the pancreas of eight C57BL/6J mice. <bold>(B)</bold> IVIS imaging was performed to monitor tumor progression in these mice. In two animals, tumors were still present at the end of the screen (annotated as tumor 1 &amp; 2). <bold>(C)</bold> Harvested DNAs prepared from the tumors were subjected to next generation sequencing (NGS) to identify enriched sgRNAs barcodes. Sequences corresponding to only six genes in the mGeCKO v2A library have detectable NGS counts as shown in the table. In both tumors, sgRNA sequences mapping to the <italic>Pccb</italic> gene are most numerous (full list shown in the Supplementary File 2).</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="550301v2_fig2.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>In both tumors, <italic>Pccb</italic> sgRNA sequence MGLibA ID 39695 was detected at many orders of magnitude higher than other three sgRNA sequences (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC) has two subunits PCCA (propionyl-CoA carboxylase subunit A) and PCCB and catalyzes the carboxylation of propionyl-CoA to methylmalonyl-CoA, which is then converted to succinyl-CoA that enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). PCC dysfunction leads to a rare genetic disease called propionic acidemia, which has been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). However, PCCB’s role in cancer and whether it plays a role in the tumor immune response is completely unknown.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Ablation of PCCB reverses the immune recognition of αKO cells</title>
<p>To validate the genetic screen result, we next genetically ablated <italic>Pccb</italic> in αKO cells using CRISPR/Cas9 techniques and generated the PCCB-null p-αKO cell line. PCCB ablation was confirmed by western blotting (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). We then orthotopically implanted p-αKO cells in the head of pancreas of B6 mice and monitored tumor growth by IVIS imaging (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Most of the mice exhibited tumor formation within one week. In some of the host animals, tumor regressed when they were reimaged at week #2. However, in all of the animals, pancreatic tumors eventually progressed and 9 out of 12 mice died by week #8 when the experiment was stopped (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> &amp; C). Postmortem examination showed that the three surviving mice had large pancreatic tumors that were also detectable by IVIS imaging (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). In comparison, while 100% of mice implanted with KPC cells died by week #3, all mice implanted with αKO cells remained tumor free by week #8 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> &amp; D). These results indicate that PCCB loss can reverse immune recognition of αKO cells.</p>

</fig>
<p>In standard 2D culture, p-αKO cells grew at a similar rate compared to αKO cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> – figure supplement 1A). Note that both αKO and p-αKO cell lines exhibited significantly slower growth rate than KPC cells. This reduced growth rate explains, at least in part, the longer survival time of p-αKO implanted mice compared with KPC-implanted mice, where the median survival of KPC was 15.5 days and the median survival of p-αKO 40.5 days (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Immunoblotting showed no changes in phosphorylation of PIK3CA’s downstream effector AKT at both Thr308 and Ser473 residues. As expected, phosphorylation of PRAS40, which is a direct effector of AKT, was also downregulated in both cell lines lacking PIK3CA as compared to KPC cells. PTEN is a negative regulator of the PI3K-AKT pathway, and its expression was not different between the three cell lines (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). In summary, the loss of PCCB did not reverse the changes in PIK3CA-AKT signaling in αKO cells. These results indicate that progression of p-αKO tumors is through a pathway independent of PI3K and AKT. In addition, the mitochondrial function evaluated by measuring the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) with Seahorse, as well as the intracellular glycolysis and TCA metabolite changes measured by untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) both showed comparable levels between αKO and p-αKO cell lines, indicating that the increased growth of p-αKO cells <italic>in vivo</italic> is probably not due to PCCB-related mitochondrial metabolic changes (Figure 3 – figure supplement 1B &amp; E).</p>

<p>Our previous study demonstrated that regression of αKO tumors is due to T cell infiltration and subsequent elimination by the host immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). We performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) to assess the status of infiltrating T cells in p-αKO, αKO, and KPC tumors.

H&amp;E staining confirmed tumor formation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>) and immediate adjacent tissue sections were stained for infiltrating T cells using anti-CD3, CD4 and CD8 antibodies. Unexpectedly, p-αKO tumors were also highly infiltrated with T cells, similar to αKO tumors, and as expected, KPC tumors were mostly devoid of T cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> &amp; B).

<p>As high expression of checkpoint inhibitory receptors is associated with reduced ability to perform cytotoxic functions of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, we examined whether T cell checkpoint inhibitory receptors, including programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT), lymphocyte activating 3 (LAG3), and hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 2 (TIM3) were altered upon PCCB ablation. Tumor tissues harvested from mice implanted with αKO and p-αKO were analyzed by IHC cells positive for the stained markers were quantified (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). In contrast to αKO tumor sections, p-αKO tumors displayed markedly elevated cell counts positive for PD1, CTLA4 and LAG3. However, despite comparable cell counts, the expression levels of TIGIT and TIM3 appeared stronger in p-αKO tumor sections (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>).

<title>Inhibition of PD1/PD-L1 checkpoint leads to elimination of most p-αKO tumors</title>

<p>The TCR sequences of the large expansions (≥50 cells per clonotype) in both groups are shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>. Interestingly, the number of clonotypes with large expansions are much higher in tumors implanted in PD1-null mice. Indeed, the number of clonotypes observed in p-αKO tumors implanted in PD1-null mice are even greater than those found in αKO tumors implanted in WT mice.</p>
<p>Transcriptomic data from all clonal CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were then clustered in an unsupervised fashion and visualized by UMAP (see methods section) and annotated the clusters by ProjecTILs to identify effector memory T cells (EffectorMem), naïve T cells (Tn), exhausted T cells (Tex) and precursor exhausted T cell (Tpex) groups (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Surprisingly, we observed large number of clonal CD8<sup>+</sup> EffectorMem and Tex cells in p-αKO tumors implanted in either WT or PD1-null mice. We next mapped clonotypes with large clonal expansions (≥50 cells) to the transcriptomic data and displayed the results by clonotype (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Again, in both groups large expansion clonotypes mainly mapped to EffectorMem and Tex gene expression profiles. There are many more CD8<sup>+</sup> clonotypes that mapped to the EffectorMem in tumors implanted in PD1-null mice as compared to WT mice. Notably, 856 CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (all 18 large expansion clonotypes) were observed in the EffectorMem group for tumors implanted in PD1-null mice, whereas only 361 cells (from 3 clones) were observed appeared in tumors implanted in WT mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). Indeed, we found more CD8<sup>+</sup> EffectorMem cells in p-αKO tumors implanted in PD1-null mice then αKO tumors implanted in WT mice (856 vs. 559). Taken together, these results suggest that regression of p-αKO tumors implanted in mice with PD1/PD-L1 blockade is due to reactivation of anti-tumor cytotoxic T cells.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The PI3K signaling pathway plays an important role in regulating the immune microenvironment in PDAC, and previous studies have indicated that specific PIK3CA inhibitors hold promise in transforming immune-deficient cold tumors into inflamed, hot tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). Our previous investigations with a PDAC mouse model revealed that downregulation of PIK3CA in tumor cells enhances their recognition and elimination by T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Building on this foundation, our present study demonstrates that implanting αKO cells into B6 mice induces a clonal expansion of cytotoxic T cells within the TME.</p>
<p>Conducting a genome-wide <italic>in vivo</italic> CRISPR screen with αKO cells implanted in the mouse pancreas allowed us to identify key molecules governing the activity of these anti-tumor T cells. Notably, we discovered that the loss of PCCB, a subunit of the mitochondrial enzyme propionyl-CoA carboxylase, can entirely reverse the immune recognition phenotype resulting from PIK3CA downregulation. Deleting PCCB in pancreatic tumor cells lacking PIK3CA leads to immune evasion, tumor progression, and ultimately, the death of the host animal. Despite T cells still infiltrating p-αKO tumor sections, there is an enrichment of immune checkpoint molecules such as PD1. Intriguingly, implanting p-αKO cells into PD1-null mice significantly improved mouse survival, hinting at the partial attribution of immune evasion in p-αKO tumors to elevated PD1 expression on T cells. Furthermore, treatment of p-αKO tumors with an anti-PD1 neutralizing antibody yielded comparable results, highlighting the potential applicability of this approach in PDAC treatment, especially when coupled with a PIK3CA inhibitor. Noteworthy outcomes ensued when interfering with the PD-L1/PD1 axis, resulting in T cell-mediated elimination of p-αKO tumor cells. Single-cell sequencing substantiates these findings by confirming that blocking the PD-L1/PD1 interaction reactivates clonal anti-tumor T cells.</p>
<p>Recent investigations underscore the compelling potential of combination therapy involving both PI3K and PD1 inhibitors in cancer treatment. In a study by Isoyama et al. (2020), improved antitumor effects were observed in melanoma and fibrosarcoma models upon the combination of PI3K inhibitors with PD-1 blockade. This therapeutic strategy raised the levels of tumor-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells thus led to enhanced antitumor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Similarly, Collins et al. (2021) conducted an <italic>in vivo</italic> expression screen with a pool of known oncogenes and identified PIK3CA as a fasctor promoting resistance to anti-PD1 treatment in a colon carcinoma model. Notably, the resistance to immunotherapy was successfully overturned with the administration of a PI3K inhibitor. These findings offer further support to the potential benefits of combining PI3K inhibitors with PD1 blockade for cancer treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). To further validate the efficacy of this drug combination, future studies can explore its application using our orthotopic implantation model and in genetically modified mouse models that spontaneously develop pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This approach ensures a comprehensive understanding of the therapeutic potential in a context that closely mirrors the intricacies of PDAC progression and the TME.</p>
<p>Although the administration of anti-PD1 neutralizing antibody yielded promising results, the treatment alone did not achieve 100% efficacy. Indeed, our scRNA-seq result from PD1-null mice revealed that not all exhausted T cells were reactivated, potentially explaining why some of the mice still succumb to tumor progression despite PD-L1-/PD1 blockade. In addition, to improve survival rates, it is crucial to incorporate other immunotherapies targeting additional checkpoint inhibitory receptors, such as CTLA4, LAG3, and TIGIT. While anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1 are standard treatments for many solid tumors, TIGIT and LAG3 have emerged as promising new targets for cancer immunotherapy. LAG3, although demonstrating limited efficacy as a monotherapy, is frequently used in combination with other checkpoint inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Similarly, while anti-TIGIT antibodies have shown remarkable effectiveness in treating solid tumors, the dual blockade of PD-1 and TIGIT has demonstrated superior clinical benefits in cancer treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Our IHC data notably revealed a significant upregulation of both TIGIT and LAG3 in p-αKO tumors, suggesting that the inclusion of additional immune checkpoint inhibitors, alongside PD1 inhibition, may further improve treatment outcomes. Therefore, future studies that test blocking other immune checkpoints such as TIGIT, LAG3, CTLA4, or TIM3, in combination with anti-PD1, could provide valuable insights.</p>
<p>While our findings highlight the involvement of PCCB in regulating T cell activities, the precise underlying mechanism remains unclear. Previous studies primarily focused on the role of <italic>Pccb</italic> in the genetic disease propionic acidemia (PA), caused by mutations in <italic>Pccb</italic> or <italic>Pcca</italic> subunits, which impair PCC function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Dysfunctional PCC leads to the accumulation of propionyl CoA and other byproducts such as propionylcarnitine (C3), methylcitrate (MC), and 3-hydroxypropionate (3OHPA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). Intracellular metabolite analysis by LC-MS showed elevated MC and C3 levels upon <italic>Pccb</italic> deletion, although the statistical significance was not reach (Figure 3 – figure supplement 1D). Importantly, intracellular propionyl-CoA levels were similar between αKO and p-αKO cells, potentially due to its conversion to MC and C3. However, the precision of propionyl-CoA detection remains challenging due to its limited quantity. Additional intracellular metabolites assessed through non-targeted LC-MS exhibited noteworthy alterations, suggesting their possible involvement in the regulation of PD1 expression on T cells (Figure 3 – figure supplement 1C). However, further experiments are required to obtain a better understanding of how PCCB-regulated metabolic pathways affect T cell function.</p>
<p>Various studies have highlighted the anti-inflammatory properties of propionate, a byproduct of dysfunctional PCC. Smith et al. (2013) demonstrated that propionic acid regulates colonic Treg (cTreg) homeostasis in the gut lumen. Propionic acid supplementation in the drinking water of germ-free (GF) mice increased cTreg frequency and number in the gut lumen, while Tregs in the spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, and thymus remained unaffected. Treatment of cTregs isolated from GF mice with propionate led to increased Foxp3 and IL10 expressions, both of which play important roles in Treg-mediated immune suppression. Additionally, cTregs exhibited a higher proliferation rate when co-cultured with propionate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Another study by Tedelind et al. (2007) reported that propionate suppressed the secretion of TNFα and IL8 from neutrophils, inhibited the NF-kB pathway, and downregulated immune-related genes in a colon cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). Recently, Hogh et al. reported that propionate upregulated the surface expression of the immune stimulatory NKG2D ligands MHC-class-I-related family (MICA/B) on several cancer cells and activated T cells, mediated by mTORC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). These indirect observations suggest a link between <italic>Pccb</italic> and immune responses although the published results are somewhat conflicting.</p>
<p>Additionally, cytokines and other mechanisms within the TME may contribute to the upregulation of PD1 expression on T cells in p-αKO tumors. RNA sequencing of αKO and p-αKO cells revealed substantial changes in several cytokine-related signaling pathways, indicating potential cytokine involvement in regulating PD1 expression on T cells (Figure 3 - figure supplement 2). Moreover, comparing cells grown <italic>in vitro</italic> to tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic> poses challenges due to the complex TME and potential crosstalk between immune cells and the metabolic system. Future studies should conduct single-cell RNAseq analysis of <italic>in vivo</italic> tumor cells present within the TME to uncover the mechanisms of immune evasion upon deletion of <italic>Pccb</italic>.</p>
<p>Our study is the first to report an association between PCCB and PIK3CA. We utilized PIK3CA knockout cells (αKO) instead of conventional PIK3CA inhibitors to avoid off-target effects reported in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>), providing a more specific and accurate assessment of PIK3CA’s role in regulating immune responses in PDAC. We employed an orthotopic mouse model for our CRISPR screen, which more closely mimics the TME of human PDAC. Our genome-wide screen study identified PCCB as a key regulator of antitumor T cell activity. We showed that PCCB regulates immune evasion by promoting increased PD-L1 expression in anti-tumor cytotoxic T cells. Consequently, our findings suggest that the resistance of PDAC to PI3K inhibitors and checkpoint inhibitors could potentially be surmounted by deploying both drugs in combination. This may be a promising avenue for future pre-clinical and clinical studies to directly assess if combining these FDA-approved drugs, possibly in conjunction with other treatment modalities, will improve outcomes for pancreatic cancer patients.</p>

The sublibrary A contains 67,405 sgRNAs targeting 20,611 protein-coding genes, 1175 microRNAs and 1000 control sgRNAs. To ensure no loss of representation, the GeCKO library A was amplified by first electroporating the library to Endura ElectroCompetent cells and then transforming to LB agar plates. The colonies from the LB agar plates were harvested and purified by Maxiprep. To produce lentivirus, the plasmid was used to transfect HEK293FT cells by lipofectamine 2000 plus reagent with packaging plasmids pVSVg and psPAX2. After incubating for 2 days, the lentiviral supernatant from the HEK293FT cells were pooled and filtered to get rid of cellular debris. Then the lentiviral titer was determined through transduction. To calculate the MOI and optimal kill curve, cells were treated with a serial dilution of concentrated virus followed by puromycin selections the next day with titrations of 0, 0.5 mg/ml, 1 mg/ml, and 2 mg/ml. After 48 hours of treatment, cell apoptosis was measured with PI and Hoechst staining to determine the concentrations of viral titer and puromycin that give approximately an MOI of 0.2-0.4 with nearly 100% killing (1:10 dilution). To ensure 350x of library coverage, 1x 10<sup>7</sup> αKO cells were seeded, and infected with 1:10 dilutions of the viral titer aiming for a MOI of 0.2-0.4.</p>

<p>After incubating the transduced αKO cells for 2 days, 7.5x10<sup>5</sup> of the transfected cells in 30ml of PBS were prepared for each mouse and were implanted in the pancreas of 9 immunocompetent wild-type C57BL/6J mice (B6; Stock#000664). To monitor tumor progression, 100 mg/kg RediJect D-Luciferin (PerkinElmer 770504) was injected intraperitoneally into mice followed by imaging on the IVIS Lumina III imaging system (Xenogen) to monitor tumor progression. Data were analyzed using Living Image v4.3.1 software.</p>

<title>Next-generation Sequencing and Data Analysis</title>
<p>Genomic DNA was extracted both from the primary tumor and metastatic sites to perform next generation sequencing in order to identify enriched sgRNAs. Qiagen DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue Kit (#13323) was used to extract DNA according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The concentration of DNA was determined by NanoDrop ND 1000. NGS libraries were prepared by a two-step PCR described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). All PCR reactions were performed with Herculase II Fusion DNA Polymerase (Agilent K3467). The first PCR (PCR1) utilized primers specific to the sgRNA-expression vector to amplify the sgRNA containing region, in order to preserve full complexity of the GeCKO library. To achieve a 350-fold coverage of the sgRNA library, approximately 200 mg of gDNA for each sample was used, and thus approximate 67 PCR1 reactions were performed for each sample (3 μg gDNA/50 μl reaction). The second PCR (PCR2) is performed to add barcoded adaptors—P7 and P5—to the products from the first PCR, so it allows multiplex sequencing on Illumina NextSeq. For our 67,405 mGeCKOa sgRNA library, at least 7 PCR2 reactions were performed (one 100 μl reaction per 10<sup>4</sup> constructs in the library). The primers used for 1<sup>st</sup> round PCR are: PCR1-F: CCCGAGGGGACCCAGAGAG; PCR1-R: GCGCACCGTGGGCTTGTAC. The primers used for the 2<sup>nd</sup> round PCRs are as follows: Fwd: AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT-stagger-barcodes-TCTTGTGGAAAGGACGAAACACCG; Rev: CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATAC- GAGAT-barcode-GTGACTGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCT-stagger-TCTACTATTC- TTTCCCCTGCACTGT. The barcode used for tumor 1 is: AAGTAGAG; and the barcode used for tumor 2 is CGCGCGGT. Before sequencing, DNA quality and quantity were determined by Qubit dsDNA BR Assay Kit and Agilent 2200 TapeStation Analysis. All samples were sequenced on Illumina NextSeq 550 sequencer. The sequencing data was processed for sgRNA representation. The 8bp barcodes were first demultiplexed from the sequencing reads, followed by adapter trimming. The remaining spacer sequences were aligned to the designed sgRNA library by bowtie, with tolerance of a single nucleotide mismatch. The number of mapped sequences were imported into R/RStudio to quantify the total number of reads. Besides, the computational tool MAGeCK (model-based analysis of genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout) was used to confirm the identified mapping counts.</p>

<title>Orthotopic Pancreatic Implantation Mouse Model</title>
<p>All the C57BL/6J mice (#000664) and PD-1<sup>-/-</sup> mice (#028276) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. The orthotopic implantation surgeries have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Briefly, cells were trypsinized and washed twice with PBS, then counted with a cell counter to prepare 5x10<sup>5</sup> cells in 30 μl of PBS per mouse for injection (or 7.5 x10<sup>5</sup> cells for the screen). Mice were anesthetized with a combination of 100 mg/kg ketamine and 10mg/kg xylazine, followed by a small vertical incision made over the left lateral abdominal area. The pancreas was then located with the aid of a light microscope, and the injection was made at the head of pancreas by a sterile Hamilton syringe with a 27-gauge needle. After sutures, mice were given an intraperitoneal injection of 2 mg/kg ketorolac.</p>

<title>Mouse Survival Studies</title>
<p>Mice implanted with tumor cells (KPC, GeCKO treated αKO, αKO cells, and p-αKO cells) were monitored by IVIS imaging weekly. Mice with weight loss &gt; 15% body weight and/or inability to move were euthanized as these were considered the endpoint. For mice implanted with p-αKO cells, week 8 was set as the endpoint of the experiment and any surviving animals were euthanized.</p>

<title>Single Cell Isolation</title>
<p>Pancreas with tumor tissues were harvested from mice on day 12 after tumor implantation. After excluding lymph nodes, tissues were washed with cold PBS and minced with scissors in the hood. The minced tissues were washed with PBS, then digested in 5 ml of 1mg/ml Collagenase type V (Worthington LS005282) solution dissolved in HBSS for 20 minutes at 37 °C. 2ml of Roche Red Blood Cell Lysis Buffer (Millipore Sigma 11814389001) was used per sample to get rid of red blood cells, then passed through 40μm cell strainer to generate single cells.</p>

<title>Enrichment of CD4+ and CD8+ T Cells from Dissociated Tissues</title>
<p>10μl of CD4 (TIL) MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec 130-116-475) and 10μl of CD8 (TIL) MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec 130-116-478) were added to 90μl of single cell suspensions (up to 10 million cells each) and incubated at 4 °C for 15 minutes. After adding the depletion wash buffer to a final volume of 500μl for up to 50 millions cells, the mixture was separated in a LS column (Miltenyi Biotec 130-042-401) by the magnetic field of the MACS Quadro separator. The flow-through were CD4 and CD8 negative cells, and the magnetically labeled cells that were flushed out after removing the magnetic field were CD4 or CD8 positive T cells. The isolated cells were centrifuged at 300xg 4°C for 5 minutes and resuspended in PBS with 0.1% of BSA to generate 1e6/ml of cells.</p>

<title>scRNAseq Library Preparation with 10x Genomics Platform</title>
<p>We followed the manufacturer’s protocol provided by 10x Genomics for the preparation of Chromium NextGEM Single Cell 5’ gene expression libraries. Single cell suspensions at a concentration of 0.7-1.2e6/ml were mixed with reverse transcription (RT) reagents, Gel Beads containing barcoded oligonucleotides, and partitioning oil on a microfluidic chip to form Gel Beads in emulsion (GEMs). Within each GEM, a single cell was lysed and the mRNAs barcoded and reverse transcribed to cDNA, followed by PCR amplification of the barcoded cDNAs. Single cell RNA sequencing and VDJ libraries were prepared using the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5’ Kit v2 (PN-1000265) and the Chromium Single Cell Mouse TCR Amplification kit (PN-1000254) at the Northport VAMC Single Cell Facility. The gene expression and VDJ libraries were pair-end sequenced (PE150) through a commercial supplier (Novogene, Inc.) at a depth of 20,000 and 5,000 reads/cell, respectively.</p>

<title>scRNAseq Data Analysis</title>
<p>The Cell Ranger v7.0.0 pipeline was used to demultiplex and align sequencing data to the “ENSEMBL GRCm39” mouse transcriptome to generate gene expression matrices. The Cell Ranger VDJ pipeline was used to assemble sequences and identify paired clonotypes on the V(D)J libraries. The gene expression matrices were further analyzed by the Seurat R package. Three quality control criteria were employed to filter the matrices to exclude unwanted sources of variations: number of detected transcripts, genes, and percent of reads mapping to mitochondrial genes. Cells with UMIs over the interquartile range of 95% (potential doublets) and under 1000 (potential fragments) or a mitochondrial proportion higher than 20% (potential apoptotic) were removed. Moreover, we used the Doublet Finder R algorithm to further eliminate doublet contamination. After the quality control, we annotated cellular identity using the R package SingleR, which assigns each cell to a reference type that has the most similar expression profile with. In further analysis, sctransform package in Seurat was used to normalize UMI count data. The principal component analysis (PCA) of high-dimensional data was performed to identify highly variable genes in each sample, and the top principal components were selected for unsupervised clustering of cells with a graph-based clustering and visualized with Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP).</p>

<title>Western Blotting</title>
<p>Cells were washed twice by PBS followed by lysis in RIPA buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mM NaF, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP40, 1 mM PMSF, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma P8340). After centrifuge, cell lysates were collected, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE gel followed by semi-dry transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking with 5% milk in tris-buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST), primary antibodies prepared in a 1:1000 dilution with TBST for overnight. After incubating the membrane with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) linked secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific #62-6520 &amp; #31460) in a 1:5000 dilution with TBST, signals were developed by adding ECL reagent or SuperSignal West Femto (Thermo Scientific 34095). Signals were detected by a FluorChem E imager (ProteinSimple). Primary antibodies used: PCCB: Millipore sigma HPA036939; PIK3CA: Cell Signaling #4249S; HSP90: Cell Signaling #4874S; PTEN: Cell Signaling #9559S; pAKT (Thr308): Cell Signaling #9275S; pAKT (Ser473): Cell Signaling #4051S; AKT 1/2/3: Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-377556; actin: Millipore Sigma #A2103; PPRAS40: Cell Signaling #2997S.</p>

<title>LC-MS</title>
<p>To assess the total metabolite levels, cells were plated in 6-well plates in triplicates with equal cell numbers for each well. After cells were washed three times with PBS, a mixture of methanol, acetonitrile, and water with formic acid was quickly added to the dishes. The plates were then placed on ice for 5 minutes, followed by the addition of 15% NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> to neutralize the acetic acid. The cells were collected by scraping the centrifuged, and the resulting supernatant was used for LC-MS analysis. The LC-MS employed hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) coupled with electrospray ionization to a Q Exactive PLUS hybrid quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). A specific LC separation was carried out using an XBridge BEH Amide column, with a gradient of solvent A and solvent B. The gradient varied over a specific time frame, and the flow rate, injection volume, and column temperature were controlled. The metabolite features were extracted using MAVEN software, considering the labeled isotope and a mass accuracy window. The isotope natural abundance and tracer isotopic impurity were corrected using AccuCor. The LC-MS and data analysis was done by Metabolomics Shared Resource at the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive disease that does not respond to immunotherapy. This work represents an extension of the authors' prior observation that PI3Ka deletion in an orthotopic KPC pancreatic tumor model confers susceptibility to immune-mediated elimination. The authors' major claims in the present manuscript are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) PI3Ka (Pik3ca) knockout in KPC pancreatic tumor cells induces clonal T cell expansion.</p>
<p>(2) Genome-wide LOF screen in aKPC cells to identify tumor-intrinsic determinants of PI3Ka-KO-enhanced T cell response identified Pccb.</p>
<p>(3) When Pccb is knocked out in the context of Pi3ka knockout KPC, anti-tumor T cell response is reduced as measured by</p>
<p>
a. Increased tumor progression</p>
<p>
b. Decreased survival</p>
<p>
c. T cells are still clonally expanded but less functional</p>
<p>(4) ICB is able to &quot;reactivate&quot; clonally expanded T cells.</p>
<p>(5) Conclusion: Pccb modulates the activity of T cells in PDAC.</p>
<p>Overall, the experiments were appropriately executed and technically sound, albeit underpowered for single-cell analyses. Upon careful consideration of the data, the biggest weakness of the paper is the authors' interpretations of results, particularly for claims 1 and 4 (see below for details). Much of the data is correlative and does not delve into causation, leaving this reviewer wishing for experiments that would clearly demonstrate that Pccb in tumor cells directly impacts T cell anti-tumor activity.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Tumor intrinsic determinants of intratumoral T cell infiltration in PDAC are less commonly evaluated as combination therapies for ICB. This is a point of conceptual innovation and importance.</p>
<p>(2) A sensitized CRISPR screen to identify mutations that rescue KPC/PI3Ka-KO tumors from immune-mediated killing is an elegant method to better understand the molecular mechanisms contributing to KPC immunosurveillance. Further, one screen candidate (Pccb) was experimentally validated.</p>
<p>(3) Single-cell clonotype analyses hold promise for identifying tumor-reactive T cells (though authors never demonstrated that specific clones were tumor antigen specific).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) &quot;Clonal expansion of cytotoxic T cells infiltrating the pancreatic αKO tumors&quot;</p>
<p>
a. Only two tumor-bearing hosts were evaluated by single-cell TCR sequencing, thus limiting conclusions that may be drawn regarding repertoire diversity and expansion.</p>
<p>
b. High abundance clones in the TME do not necessarily have tumor specificity, nor are they necessarily clonally expanded. They may be clones which are tissue-resident or highly chemokine-responsive and accumulate in larger numbers independent of clonal expansion. Please consider softening language to clonal enrichment or refer to clone size as clonal abundance throughout the paper.</p>
<p>
c. The whole story would be greatly strengthened by cytotoxicity assays of abundant TCR clones to show tumor antigen specificity.</p>
<p>(2) &quot;A genome-wide CRISPR gene-deletion screen to identify molecules contributing to Pik3ca-mediated pancreatic tumor immune evasion&quot;</p>
<p>
a. CRISPR mutagenesis yielded outgrowth of only 2/8 tumors. A more complete screen with an increased total number of tumors would yield much stronger gene candidates with better statistical power. It is unsurprising that candidates were observed in only one of the two tumors. Nevertheless, the authors moved forward successfully with Pccb.</p>
<p>(3) T cells infiltrate p-αKO tumors with increased expression of immune checkpoints</p>
<p>
a. In Figure 4D, cell counts are not normalized to totalCD8+ T cell counts making it difficult to directly compare aKO to p-aKO tumors. Based on quantifications from Figure 4D, I suspect normalization will strengthen the conclusion that CD8+ infiltrate is more exhausted in p-aKO tumors.</p>
<p>
b. Flow cytometric analysis to further characterize the myeloid compartment is incomplete (single replicate) and does not strengthen the argument that p-aKO TME is more immunosuppressive.</p>
<p>
c. It could, however, strengthen the argument that TIL has less anti-tumor potential if effector molecule expression in CD8+ infiltrating cells were quantified.</p>
<p>(4) Inhibition of PD1/PD-L1 checkpoint leads to elimination of most p-αKO tumors</p>
<p>
a. It is reasonable to conclude that p-aKO tumors are responsive to immune checkpoint blockade. However, there is no data presented to support the statement that checkpoint blockade reactivates an existing anti-tumor CD8+ T cell response and does not instead induce a de novo response.</p>
<p>
b. The discussion of these data implies that anti-PD-1 would not improve aKO tumor control, but these data are not included. As such, it is difficult to compare the therapeutic response in aKO versus p-aKO. Further, these data are at best an indirect comparison of the T cell responsiveness against tumor, as the only direct comparison is infiltrating cell count in Figure 4 and there are no public TCR clones with confirmed anti-tumor specificity to follow in the aKO versus p-aKO response.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is generally considered a &quot;cold&quot; tumor type with little T cell infiltration. This group demonstrated previously that deletion of the PIK3CA isoform of PI3K in the orthotopic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma KPC mouse tumor model led to the elimination of tumors by T cells. Here they performed a genome-wide gene-deletion screen in this tumor using CRISPR to determine what was required for this T cell-mediated infiltration and tumor rejection. Deletion of Pccb in the tumors, which encodes propionyl-CoA carboxylase subunit B, allowed for the outgrowth of the PIK3CA-deleted KPC tumors. This was confirmed with the specific deletion of Pccb in the tumor cells. Demonstrating a likely role in tumor progression in human patients as well, high expression of PCCB in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma correlated with lower patient survival. T cells still infiltrated these tumors, but had much higher expression of exhaustion markers. Blockade of PD-1 signaling allowed for the rejection of these tumors. While these are intriguing data demonstrating that loss of PCCB by pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is a mechanism to escape T cell immunity, the mechanism by which this occurs is not determined. In addition, there are a few issues that suggest the conclusions of the manuscript should be tempered.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>In vivo analysis of tumor CRISPR deletion screen.</p>
<p>The study describes a possible novel mechanism by which a tumor maintains a &quot;cold&quot; microenvironment.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) A major issue is that it seems these data are based on the use of a single tumor cell clone with PIK3CA deleted. Therefore, there could be other changes in this clone in addition to the deletion of PIK3CA that could contribute to the phenotype.</p>
<p>(2) The conclusion that the change in the PCCB-deficient tumor cell line is unrelated to mitochondrial metabolic changes may be incorrect based on the data provided. While it is true that in the experiments performed, there was no statistically significant change in the oxygen consumption rate or metabolite levels, this could be due to experimental error. There is a trend in the OCR being higher in the PCCB-deficient cells, although due to a high standard deviation, the change is not statistically significant. There is also a trend for there being more aKG in this cell line, but because there were only 3 samples per cell line, there is no statistically significant difference.</p>
<p>(3) More data are required to make the authors' conclusion that there are myeloid changes in the PCCB-deficient tumor cells. There is only flow data from shown from one tumor of each type.</p>
<p>(4) The previous published study demonstrated increased MHC and CD80 expression in the PIK3CA-deficient tumors and these differences were suggested to be the reason the tumors were rejected. However, no data concerning the levels of these proteins were provided in the current manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Han and co-authors showed that implantation of Pik3ca deficient KPC cells (aKO) induced clonal expansion of CD8 T cells in the tumor microenvironment. Using aKO cells, they conducted an in vivo genome-wide gene-deletion screen, which showed that deletion of propionyl-CoA carboxylase subunit B gene (Pccb) in αKO cells (p-aKO) leads to immune evasion and tumor progression. Eventually, mice injected with p-aKO but not aKO succumbed to their tumors. Similar to the parental aKO cell line, p-aKO tumors were still infiltrated with clonally expanded CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, as shown by the IHC. Further analyses showed that T cells infiltrating p-aKO tumors expressed high levels of exhaustion markers (PD-1, CTLA-4, TIM3, and TIGIT). Furthermore, PD-1 signaling blockade using PD-1 mAb or genetic depletion of PD-1 reactivated the infiltrated T cells, controlling tumor progression and improving the overall mice survival. Thus, the authors concluded in the abstract that &quot;Pccb can modulate the activity of cytotoxic T cells infiltrating some pancreatic cancers.&quot; Although the data clearly showed that the loss of Pccb facilitated the immune evasion of pancreatic cancer cells, there is no clear evidence provided that Pccb deletion can actually modulate the activity of CD8 T cells. One may argue that the deletion of Pccb reduces the immunogenicity of the p-aKO cancer cells, making them less susceptible to killing by normally functional CD8+ T cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>In vivo, Crisper-Cas-9 screen using tumor cell lines.</p>
<p>Identify a gene that could reduce the immunogenicity of cancer cells.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The IHC technique that was used to stain and characterize the exhaustion status of the tumor-infiltrating T cells.</p>

<p>We appreciate the reviewers' detailed feedback, which has highlighted several areas where our study could be strengthened. Although we acknowledge the relatively limited scope of our CRISPR-based gene-deletion screen, we successfully demonstrated the immunogenic role of Pccb in our syngenetic pancreatic cancer mouse model. Specifically, loss of PCCB in our mutant KRAS/p53 PIK3CA-null (αKO) cells blocked host T cell killing of tumor cells.</p>
<p>Furthermore, blocking the PD1/PD-L1 interaction reverses this anti-tumor immunogenic effect. We agree with the reviewers regarding the limitations of our study, such as the sample size in our scTCR sequencing and the lack of direct cytotoxicity assays to confirm tumor-specific T cell clones. However, our results are consistent across multiple experimental approaches that strongly suggest meaningful differences in host T cell response to the three implanted tumor types, KPC, αKO and p-αKO. We agree that future mechanistic studies will be important to determine how PCCB is involved in this immunogenic response. We also agree with the reviewers that future additional studies with other KPC cell lines will strength our conclusion regarding PCCB. Finally, we acknowledge the inherent limitations of IHC techniques to assess the involvement of other T cell checkpoints that might also be involved in this anti-tumor immunogenic effect. In summary, despite these limitations, our findings provide novel insight into the role of PCCB in pancreatic tumor immunogenicity and contribute to the ongoing discussion of how to improve therapeutic strategies for this deadly cancer.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Clonal expansion of cytotoxic T cells infiltrating the pancreatic αKO tumors</p>
<p>a. Only two tumor-bearing hosts were evaluated by single-cell TCR sequencing, thus limiting conclusions that may be drawn regarding repertoire diversity and expansion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that possible repertoire diversity and expansion could be observed by sequencing more tumor-bearing hosts. However, our current data reveal a marked consistency in the transcriptional expression within the two tumors analyzed per group. Importantly, these features are significantly divergent between the αKO and p-αKO groups. While recognizing the limited sample size, the observed within-group consistency and the clear distinction between groups strongly support the validity of the reported trends.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>b. High abundance clones in the TME do not necessarily have tumor specificity, nor are they necessarily clonally expanded. They may be clones which are tissue-resident or highly chemokine-responsive and accumulate in larger numbers independent of clonal expansion. Please consider softening language to clonal enrichment or refer to clone size as clonal abundance throughout the paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that it’s possible that the high abundance clones are not necessarily tumor specific. Our previous work (N. Sivaram 2019) demonstrated the critical role of increased pancreatic CD8+ T cells in αKO tumor regression within B6 mice. Therefore, antigen specific CD8+ T cell clonal expansion within the pancreas is an anticipated observation. However, as the reviewer pointed out, a portion of this expansion may be attributable to factors independent of tumor antigens. While the low T cell infiltration observed in KPC-implanted mice argues against a purely tissue-resident explanation, further investigation is required to definitively establish the tumor specificity of individual clones. We have revised the manuscript to reflect this nuance, replacing &quot;clonal expansion&quot; with &quot;clonal enrichment&quot;.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>c. The whole story would be greatly strengthened by cytotoxicity assays of abundant TCR clones to show tumor antigen specificity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As mentioned above, we agree with the reviewer that future studies are needed to investigate each of the specific clones. Due to the extended timeframe required, it’s beyond the scope of the present study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) A genome-wide CRISPR gene-deletion screen to identify molecules contributing to Pik3camediated pancreatic tumor immune evasion&quot;</p>
<p>a. CRISPR mutagenesis yielded outgrowth of only 2/8 tumors. A more complete screen with an increased total number of tumors would yield much stronger gene candidates with better statistical power. It is unsurprising that candidates were observed in only one of the two tumors. Nevertheless, the authors moved forward successfully with Pccb.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that by including more mice in the CRISPR screen, it’s possible that we could have identified more candidates. Regardless, we have successfully demonstrated PCCB’s role in pancreatic tumorgenicity with our mouse model.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) T cells infiltrate p-αKO tumors with increased expression of immune checkpoint</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>*a. In Figure 4D, cell counts are not normalized to totalCD8+ T cell counts making it difficult to directly compare aKO to p-aKO tumors. Based on quantifications from Figure 4D, I suspect normalization will strengthen the conclusion that CD8+ infiltrate is more exhausted in p-aKO tumors. *</p>
<p>Due to the use of distinct tumor sections for quantifying CD8+ cells and T cell checkpoint inhibitory receptor expression, direct normalization of these counts is challenging. However, we observed comparable CD8+ cell numbers between αKO and p-αKO tumors, with p-αKO tumors exhibiting nearly double the expression of immune checkpoint receptors. Therefore, even accounting for potential normalization discrepancies, we anticipate that p-αKO tumors would still demonstrate a significantly higher percentage of immune checkpoint receptorpositive cells compared to αKO tumors.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>b. Flow cytometric analysis to further characterize the myeloid compartment is incomplete (single replicate) and does not strengthen the argument that p-aKO TME is more immunosuppressive. It could, however, strengthen the argument that TIL has less anti-tumor potential if effector molecule expression in CD8+ infiltrating cells were quantified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that including more tumor samples will strengthen the argument that p-αKO TME is more immunosuppressive. Future studies need to be done to characterize CD8+ T cells.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Inhibition of PD1/PD-L1 checkpoint leads to elimination of most p-αKO tumors</p>
<p>a. It is reasonable to conclude that p-aKO tumors are responsive to immune checkpoint blockade. However, there is no data presented to support the statement that checkpoint blockade reactivates an existing anti-tumor CD8+ T cell response and does not induce a de novo response</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that future studies exploring the clonotypes of T cells infiltrating tumors in PD-1treated mice are necessary to determine whether observed T cell response represents reactivation of existing clones, a de novo response, or a combination of both.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>b. The discussion of these data implies that anti-PD-1 would not improve aKO tumor control, but these data are not included. As such, it is difficult to compare the therapeutic response in aKO versus p-aKO. Further, these data are at best an indirect comparison of the T cell responsiveness against tumor, as the only direct comparison is infiltrating cell count in Figure 4 and there are no public TCR clones with confirmed anti-tumor specificity to follow in the aKO versus p-aKO response.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Since αKO tumors completely regress with 100% animal survival, we deemed anti-PD1 treatment in this group unnecessary. While we did assess anti-PD1 treatment in KPCimplanted mice, no survival benefit was observed (data not shown). The p-αKO tumor model was the only one in which anti-PD1 treatment improved survival. The complexity of the in vivo tumor microenvironment likely contributes to the lack of shared TCR clones between αKO and p-αKO tumors, even within the same tumor group. Future studies aimed at identifying tumorspecific clones may involve transferring in vivo models to in vitro assays or the generation of novel mouse strains expressing identified TCRs. However, these approaches require substantial time and resources and are beyond the scope of the present study.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer 2:</bold></p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) A major issue is that it seems these data are based on the use of a single tumor cell clone with PIK3CA deleted. Therefore, there could be other changes in this clone in addition to the deletion of PIK3CA that could contribute to the phenotype.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have previously tested a different KPC cell line (DT10022) with genetically downregulated PIK3CA and found mice implanted with αKO cells also showed tumor regression. However, we have not tested if deletion of Pccb in the DT10022-aKO cell line will have the same effect.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The conclusion that the change in the PCCB-deficient tumor cell line is unrelated to mitochondrial metabolic changes may be incorrect based on the data provided. While it is true that in the experiments performed, there was no statistically significant change in the oxygen consumption rate or metabolite levels, this could be due to experimental error. There is a trend in the OCR being higher in the PCCB-deficient cells, although due to a high standard deviation, the change is not statistically significant. There is also a trend for there being more aKG in this cell line, but because there were only 3 samples per cell line, there is no statistically significant difference.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Although PCCB is known to cause metabolic changes, in the context of this study, we are comparing PCCB-deficient to PCCB &amp; PIK3CA double-deficient cells. We did not address if PCCB loss alone would cause metabolic alteration. We suspect that is the case.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) More data are required to make the authors' conclusion that there are myeloid changes in the PCCB-deficient tumor cells. There is only flow data from shown from one tumor of each type.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that including more tumor samples will strengthen the argument that p-αKO TME is more immunosuppressive.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The previous published study demonstrated increased MHC and CD80 expression in the PIK3CA-deficient tumors and these differences were suggested to be the reason the tumors were rejected. However, no data concerning the levels of these proteins were provided in the current manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our previous hypothesis for altered MHC and CD80 levels is based on the observation that there is a dramatic increase in the number of infiltrating T cells upon Pik3ca deletion. In this study, similar levels of infiltrating T cells were observed when Pccb was deleted in αKO cells, therefore we do not expect any changes in MHC and CD80 levels since these tumors appears to be still recognized by the T cells. Indeed, we are able detect clonal enrichment in p-αKO tumors.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer 3:</bold></p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The IHC technique that was used to stain and characterize the exhaustion status of the tumorinfiltrating T cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that incorporating multi-color IHC or flow cytometry to characterize the exhaustion status of specific T cell subtypes would provide more comprehensive information. Unfortunately, we do not have the resources to perform these studies currently.</p>
