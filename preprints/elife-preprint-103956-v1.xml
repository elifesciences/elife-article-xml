<title>Abstract</title><p>During sleep, our brain undergoes highly synchronized activity, orchestrated by distinct neural rhythms. Little is known about the associated brain activation during these sleep rhythms, and even less about their functional implications. In this study, we investigated the brain-wide activation underlying human sleep rhythms by employing simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 107 participants during overnight sleep. We identified a significant coupling between slow oscillations (SO) and spindle events during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, particularly at the UP-state of SOs. This coupling was associated with increased activation in the thalamus and hippocampus, showing a brain-wide activation that resembles episodic memory processing, yet is distinctly dissociated from task-related activation. Moreover, this SO-spindle coupling was linked to a selective increase in functional connectivity from the hippocampus to the thalamus, and from the thalamus to the neocortex, particularly the medial prefrontal cortex. These findings suggest that the thalamus plays a crucial role in coordinating the hippocampal-cortical dialogue during sleep.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>During sleep, the human brain engages in highly synchronized activity driven by distinct rhythms. In non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, the emergence and coordination of slow oscillations (SOs) and sleep spindles are key features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Ngo, Fell, &amp; Staresina, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Schreiner et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Staresina et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Staresina et al., 2023</xref>). However, the brain activation patterns associated with these rhythms and their coordination remain largely unexplored, and their functional implications are even less understood.</p>
<p>SOs (∼1 Hz) represent shifts in neuronal membrane potential between periods of silence (’hyperpolarization’, or ‘DOWN’ state) and excitation (’depolarization’,or ‘UP’ state) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Amzica &amp; Steriade, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Steriade, McCormick, &amp; Sejnowski, 1993</xref>). These oscillations originate spontaneously in neocortical regions, particularly the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), during NREM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dang-Vu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Massimini et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Nir et al., 2011</xref>). The depolarization phase of SOs is believed to trigger sleep spindles in the thalamus, producing oscillations in the 11–16 Hz range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fernandez &amp; L üthi, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Mak-McCully et al., 2017</xref>). These spindles align with the excitable UP-states of SOs and synchronize with hippocampal ripples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Buzsáki, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Helfrich et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Joo &amp; Frank, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Ngo, Fell, &amp; Staresina, 2020</xref>). Rodent studies using optogenetics have shown that only thalamic spindles phase-locked with the UP-state of cortical SOs enhance memory consolidation, while those out of phase do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Latchoumane et al., 2017</xref>). This finding is consistent with intracranial evidence from human epilepsy patients, suggesting the thalamus acts as a key relay between the hippocampus and cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Coulon, Budde, &amp; Pape, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ferraris et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Schreiner et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Staresina et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>The triple coupling of SOs, spindles, and ripples is believed to facilitate memory consolidation by synchronizing neuronal activity across brain regions and replaying memory traces from the hippocampus to the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Diekelmann &amp; Born, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Latchoumane et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Singh, Norman, &amp; Schapiro, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Staresina et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Staresina et al., 2023</xref>). However, the exact mechanisms of this inter-regional communication during coordinated sleep rhythms remain unclear.</p>
<p>Understanding the brain-wide activation associated with these rhythms is crucial, as it reveals how information flows among brain regions, especially during the critical time windows when these rhythms align.</p>
<p>Studying these processes in the human brain is challenging because it requires tracking both the transient nature of sleep rhythms and their widespread brain activation simultaneously. Recent advances in simultaneous EEG-fMRI techniques, which allow researchers to model temporal events captured by EEG and explain the associated brain activity observed through fMRI, offer promising opportunities to capture these brain-wide activations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Huang et al., 2024</xref>). In the current study, while directly capturing hippocampal ripples with scalp EEG or fMRI is difficult, we expect to observe hippocampal activation in fMRI whenever SOs-spindles coupling is detected by EEG, if SOs-spindles-ripples triple coupling occurs during human NREM sleep.</p>
<p>Another advantage of identifying sleep rhythm-related brain activation is the potential to infer their potential cognitive functions through open-ended cognitive state decoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yarkoni et al., 2011</xref>). Since performing cognitive tasks during sleep is limited, most neuroimaging studies on human sleep rely on the ‘targeted memory reactivation (TMR)’ paradigm, where participants are re-exposed to sensory cues during sleep to trigger associated memory reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cousins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Oudiette &amp; Paller, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Siefert et al., 2024</xref>). For instance, fMRI studies have shown significant hippocampal activation in response to odour re-exposure during sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Rasch et al., 2007</xref>), while EEG studies suggest that this reactivation is more likely during the UP-state of SOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cousins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Göldi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Xia et al., 2023</xref>). However, this approach provides limited insight into the neural mechanisms underlying natural sleep rhythms.</p>
<p>By using cognitive state decoding, we can infer the functional implications of natural sleep rhythms by comparing their brain activation patterns with known task-related patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yarkoni et al., 2011</xref>). This method offers a promising way to bridge the gap between observed brain activity during sleep and its functional significance, providing new insights into the relationship between sleep and cognition.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated brain-wide activation during sleep using simultaneous EEG and fMRI in 107 participants, combined with cognitive state decoding. Our findings revealed significant coupling between SOs and spindles during NREM sleep, particularly at the transition to UP-state of SOs. This coupling was associated with increased activation in the thalamus and hippocampus, and a brain-wide activation pattern resembling episodic memory processing, yet distinct from task-related activations. Furthermore, SO-spindle coupling was linked to increased functional connectivity from the hippocampus to the thalamus and from the thalamus to the mPFC.</p>
<p>These findings suggest that the thalamus plays a crucial role in coordinating hippocampal-cortical dialogue during human sleep, highlighting the importance of intrinsic brain-wide activation when sleep rhythms align. Understanding these mechanisms paves the way for developing neuromodulation interventions to enhance cognitive function during sleep and treat sleep-related disorders.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Simultaneous EEG-fMRI data during nocturnal sleep were collected from 138 healthy subjects (age, 22.56 ± 0.30; 81 females). After excluding subjects due to excessive head motion (mean framewise displacement &gt; 0.5) or insufficient scanning sleep duration (&lt;10 min), 107 participants (age, 22.40 ± 0.34; 63 females) were retained for subsequent analysis, with an average scanning time of sleep of 3.01 ± 0.14 hours (see Methods). Since NREM sleep predominantly occurs in early sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Carskadon &amp; Dement, 2005</xref>), we conducted our scans during the first half of the night to ensure sufficient coverage of NREM sleep, this is also the period when sleep rhythms are most consistently observed and studied in relation to memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Maingret et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Molle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Schreiner et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Staresina et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Staresina et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Sleep stages and sleep rhythms</title>
<p>The primary objective of the EEG analysis was to examine the intrinsic characteristics of sleep rhythms and to identify the timing of these SO and spindle events for subsequent fMRI analyses.</p>
<p>We first removed MRI gradient noise from the EEG signal (detailed in Methods, see <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>) and then applied an automated sleep staging algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Vallat &amp; Walker, 2021</xref>). The staging results were manually reviewed by two sleep experts to ensure the accurate classification of each sleep stages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). Upon validation, we confirmed that N2/3 stages predominated in the dataset, with a significantly higher proportion of N2/3 sleep (75.77% ± 1.50%) compared to N1 (14.57% ± 1.06%, <italic>t</italic><sub>(106)</sub> = 25.04, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1e-4, paired-samples <italic>t</italic> test) and REM sleep (9.66% ± 0.90%, <italic>t</italic><sub>(106)</sub> = 29.60, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1e-4, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>).</p>

<p>Each sleep stage is characterized by distinct spectral properties and rhythmic waveforms, serving as physiological markers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). As a sanity check, we compared SO and spindle amplitudes and densities across stages. Both were significantly higher during N2/3 sleep (SO: 25.59 ± 1.49 μV, spindle: 7.39 ± 0.27 μV) compared to N1 (SO: 18.87 ± 1.08 μV, spindle: 6.72 ± 0.25 μV) and REM (SO: 16.67 ± 1.14 μV, spindle: 6.23 ± 0.23 μV, all <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1e-4, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). This aligns with the established understanding that N2/3 stages feature more pronounced slow-wave activity and robust spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gaillard &amp; Blois, 1981</xref>). Furthermore, we found that the amplitude of the SO DOWN-state (13.62 ± 0.67 μV) was significantly higher than the UP-state (12.98 ± 0.66 μV, <italic>t</italic><sub>(106)</sub> = 4.82, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1e-4), consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cash et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dang-Vu et al., 2008</xref>). Based on this, we used the DOWN-state to lock the timing of SOs for subsequent EEG-informed fMRI analysis.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>SO-spindle coupling</title>
<p>SO-spindle coupling is considered important for sleep-dependent memory consolidation. In current study, we found that this coupling primarily occurs during N2/3 sleep stages (2.46 ± 0.06 times/min), significantly more than in N1 (2.23 ± 0.09 times/min, <italic>t</italic><sub>(106)</sub> = 2.81, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0059) and REM stages (2.32 ± 0.09 times/min, <italic>t</italic><sub>(106)</sub> = 1.99, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0492, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>), consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Ngo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Staresina et al., 2015</xref>). After extracting all EEG epochs where SO-spindle coupling occurred, we analysed their spectral and phase characteristics. The spindles were most likely to occur during the transition to the UP state of SOs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, e</xref>), aligning with results from both animal studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Maingret et al., 2016</xref>) and human research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Staresina et al., 2015</xref>). In our data, this pattern was consistent across subjects (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>, Rayleigh test: <italic>z</italic> = 9.51, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1e-4), with the peak of the spindle aligned at an SO phase of −41.61 ± 0.86° (the SO UP state peak is 0°).</p>

<p>Interestingly, spindle events coupled with SOs had higher amplitudes (7.69 ± 0.26 μV) compared to those not coupled (7.33 ± 0.25 μV, <italic>t</italic><sub>(106)</sub> = 4.65, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1e-4, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, left). Similarly, SO events coupled with spindles exhibited higher amplitudes (26.28 ± 1.34 μV) than those not coupled (24.56 ± 1.33 μV, <italic>t</italic><sub>(106)</sub> = 6.86, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1e-4, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, right). These findings suggest coordinated neural processing during SO-spindle coupling. Next, we explore the brain-wide activation associated with these sleep rhythms.</p>

<title>Sleep rhythms associated brain activation</title>
<p>To investigate brain-wide activity during sleep rhythms, we modeled the fMRI blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal based on EEG-identified timing of SOs and spindle events during N2/3 sleep stages.

This deactivation of the neocortex, particularly the DMN, at the trough of SOs is intriguing, given that the DMN is thought to encode the internal model of the world or cognitive map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baldassano, Hasson, &amp; Norman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Constantinescu, O’Reilly, &amp; Behrens, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Park, Miller, &amp; Boorman, 2021</xref>).</p>

<p>To understand the functional implications of these sleep rhythm-related brain activation, we performed open-ended cognitive state decoding using the NeuroSynth database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yarkoni et al., 2011</xref>), examining associations between topic terms and regions of interest derived from the activation patterns of the sleep rhythms. Topic terms were ranked by their <italic>z</italic>-scores across the rhythms to assess overall functional relevance (see Methods for details).</p>
<p>For positive activation patterns (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>, right), SOs were linked to patterns associated with declarative memory (<italic>z</italic> = 6.31, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1e-4) and episodic memory (<italic>z</italic> = 5.08, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1e-4), while spindles were most similar to activation patterns related to working memory (<italic>z</italic> = 4.08, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1e-4). SO-spindle coupling aligned most closely with activation patterns related to episodic memory (<italic>z</italic> = 3.66, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0003) and declarative memory (<italic>z</italic> = 2.21, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0271).</p>
<p>For negative (deactivation) patterns (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>, left), SOs were linked to patterns related to declarative memory (<italic>z</italic> = 7.61, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1e-4), while spindles were most similar to task-related activation patterns (<italic>z</italic> = 7.05, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1e-4). SO-spindle coupling showed the strongest similarity to patterns related to task-related activation (<italic>z</italic> = 9.40, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1e-4) and working memory (<italic>z</italic> = 9.15, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1e-4). These findings suggest that brain regions involved in internal memory processing are the most likely to reactivate during SO-spindle coupling events, while task-related activations, such as working memory, are the least likely to occur.</p>

<title>Functional connectivity during SO-spindle coupling</title>
<p>Previous studies have indicated that the hippocampal-cortical dialogue during sleep memory consolidation relies on the thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Coulon, Budde, &amp; Pape, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ferraris et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Latchoumane et al., 2017</xref>).

</fig>
<p>We first examined whole-brain FC (physiological term) in three ROIs: the hippocampus (bilateral, anatomically defined), thalamus (bilateral, anatomically defined), and mPFC (bilateral, functionally defined). The hippocampus-based FC was mainly connected with the DMN, particularly the mPFC (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). The thalamus-based FC was primarily linked to the basal ganglia and ACC (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>), and the mPFC-based FC showed strong connections with the hippocampus and PCC (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>).</p>
<p>Crucially, the interaction between FC and SO-spindle coupling revealed that only the hippocampus -&gt; thalamus FC (ROI analysis, <italic>t</italic><sub>(106)</sub> = 1.86, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0328) and thalamus -&gt; mPFC FC (ROI analysis, <italic>t</italic><sub>(106)</sub> = 1.98, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0251) significantly increased during SO-spindle coupling, with no significant changes in all other FC pathways (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). These findings suggest that the thalamus, likely through thalamic spindles, coordinate hippocampal-cortical communication during human NREM sleep.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Using simultaneous EEG and fMRI during nocturnal sleep in 107 subjects, we identified robust coupling between sleep spindles and the (transition to) UP-state of SOs during N2 and N3 stages of NREM sleep. This coupling was linked to distinct neural activation patterns, including significant thalamic activation during spindle occurrences, reduced activity in the DMN during SOs, and elevated hippocampal activity during SO-spindle events. Moreover, we observed increased functional connectivity from the hippocampus to the thalamus and from the thalamus to the mPFC during these SO-spindle events. Through cognitive state decoding, we found that brain-wide activation during SO-spindle events most closely resembles that of internal memory processing, while deactivation patterns align with those of working memory and task-related representation. These findings offer insights into the brain mechanisms and associated functional implications during human NREM sleep.</p>
<p>We found that spindle amplitude peaks were nested within the transition to the UP-state of SOs in most subjects (83 out of 107), a coupling likely crucial for sleep-dependent memory consolidation. This is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Schreiner et al. (2021)</xref>, showing that memory reactivation is stronger when spindles occur closer to the SO UP-state. When modeling the timing of these sleep rhythms, we observed hippocampal activation during SO-spindle events, which is intriguing as it may indicate the presence of triple coupling, including hippocampal ripples. While our scalp EEG was not sensitive enough to detect hippocampal ripples—key markers of memory replay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Buzsáki, 2015</xref>)—recent intracranial EEG (iEEG) studies have observed ripples during human sleep, showing their coupling with both spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Ngo, Fell, &amp; Staresina, 2020</xref>) and SOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Staresina et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Staresina et al., 2023</xref>). Therefore, the hippocampal involvement during SO-spindle events in our study may reflect memory replay from the hippocampus, propagated via thalamic spindles to distributed cortical regions.</p>
<p>Our observation of reduced DMN activity during SOs is intriguing. SOs, generated in cortical networks, reach subcortical structures like the hippocampus and alternate between DOWN- and UP-states of synchronized neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Nir et al., 2011</xref>). Due to the low temporal resolution of fMRI and the rhythmic pattern of SOs, it is difficult to distinguish the activation patterns of the DOWN- vs. UP-states (see also <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). It is likely that our findings of diminished DMN activity reflect brain activity during the SO DOWN-state, as this state consistently shows higher amplitude compared to the UP-state within subjects, which is why we modelled the SO trough as its onset in the fMRI analysis. The DMN is typically active during wakeful rest and is associated with self-referential processes like mind-wandering, daydreaming, and task representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Yeshurun, Nguyen, &amp; Hasson, 2021</xref>). Its reduced activity during SOs may signal a shift towards endogenous processes such as memory consolidation. Future research using techniques like iEEG, with both temporal and spatial precision, could clarify this possibility.</p>
<p>The thalamus, known to generate spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Halassa et al., 2011</xref>), plays a key role in producing and coordinating sleep rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Coulon, Budde, &amp; Pape, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Crunelli et al., 2018</xref>), while the hippocampus is essential for memory consolidation during sleep, facilitating the transfer of memories to the neocortex for long-term storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Buzsáki, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Diba &amp; Buzsáki, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Singh, Norman, &amp; Schapiro, 2022</xref>). The increased hippocampal and thalamic activity, along with strengthened functional connectivity between the hippocampus, thalamus, and mPFC during SO-spindle events, highlights the hippocampal-thalamic-neocortical information flow during human NREM sleep. This aligns with recent findings that suggest the thalamus orchestrates neocortical oscillations during sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Schreiner et al., 2022</xref>). These results emphasize the central role of thalamus in sleep-related memory consolidation, guiding the routing of information from the hippocampus to the neocortex (e.g., mPFC), a process critical to understanding memory consolidation during sleep.</p>
<p>Our open-ended cognitive state decoding analysis revealed that brain activation patterns linked to different sleep rhythms were associated with distinct cognitive functions. SOs and SO-spindle coupling were strongly connected to declarative and episodic memory, particularly during coupling events. In contrast, brain deactivation patterns were associated with task representations and working memory, reflecting the reduction in DMN activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baldassano, Hasson, &amp; Norman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Smallwood et al., 2021</xref>). It is intriguing to speculate that during SOs, especially when aligned with spindle events, spontaneous replay of past episodic memories may occur, facilitating the consolidation of hippocampal memories into long-term declarative memory in the neocortex. This internal processing contrasts with the brain patterns associated with external tasks, such as working memory. This hypothesis warrants further studies to decode the content of sleep activity, capturing the replay of specific memories during sleep.</p>
<p>Together, our findings provide insights into the neural mechanisms of sleep rhythms, emphasizing their coordination and the roles of the hippocampus and thalamus. They also highlight the importance of the role of thalamus in generating and coordinating sleep rhythms, the implications of reduced DMN activity during SOs, and the temporal dynamics of hippocampal-neocortical communication. Uncovering these brain-wide activation patterns is crucial for understanding the functional implications of sleep activity. These insights will lead to more targeted interventions that improve sleep quality and cognitive performance.</p>

<sec id="s4a">
<title>Participants &amp; Protocol</title>
<p>A total of 138 healthy adults (age: 22.56 ± 0.30; 81 females) were recruited for the study. All participants had either normal vision or vision corrected to normal standards. None had any past psychiatric or neurological disorders. Prior to participation, they were screened for eligibility to undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The experiment received approval from Peking University ethics committee (reference number: #2015-26, #2018-11-05). Every participant provided written informed consent.</p>
<p>At the start of the experiment, subjects arrived early at the laboratory for registration. They signed informed consent forms, washed their hair, changed their clothes, and put on the EEG cap in preparation for the experiment. After these preliminary steps, participants entered the MRI scanning room by around 20:30, settled down for sleep, and data collection began. Given concern for potential data drift and decline in the signal-to-noise ratio due to extended and continuous fMRI scanning, the data acquisition was segmented into several sessions for overnight data collection. A “sleep” session was concluded either when a participant was fully awake (unable to fall asleep again or needed to use the restroom) or after 8192 seconds (the maximum scanning time of the scan, equating to 4096 volumes with 2 seconds TR).</p>
<p>After removing subjects with excessive head movements (mean FD &gt; 0.5) or those whose sleep durations were under 10 minutes, the final participant count for further analyses was 107 (age: 22.40 ± 0.34; 63 females) with a mean scanning duration of sleep of 3.01 ± 0.14 hours.</p>

<title>EEG data acquisition</title>
<p>EEG was recorded simultaneously with fMRI data using an MR-compatible EEG amplifier system (BrainAmps MR-Plus, Brain Products, Germany), along with a specialized electrode cap. The recording was done using 64 channels in the international 10/20 system, with the reference channel positioned at FCz. In order to adhere to polysomnography (PSG) recording standards, six electrodes were removed from the EEG cap: one for electrocardiogram (ECG) recording, two for electrooculogram (EOG) recording, and three for electromyogram (EMG) recording. EEG data was recorded at a sample rate of 5000 Hz, the resistance of the reference and ground channels was kept below 10 kΩ, and the resistance of the other channels was kept below 20 kΩ. To synchronize the EEG and fMRI recordings, the BrainVision recording software (BrainProducts, Germany) was utilized to capture triggers from the MRI scanner.</p>

<title>MRI data acquisition</title>
<p>All MRI data were acquired using a 20-channel head coil on a research-dedicated 3-Tesla Siemens Magnetom Prisma MRI scanner. Earplugs and cushions were provided for noise protection and head motion restriction. For registration purposes, high-resolution T1-weighted anatomical images were acquired using a three-dimensional magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient-echo sequence (sequence specification: number of slices = 192, repetition time (TR) = 2,530 ms, echo time (TE) = 2.98 ms, inversion time = 1,100 ms, voxel size = 0.5 × 0.5 × 1 mm<sup>3</sup>, flip angle (FA) = 7°). The participants were asked to lie quietly in the scanner during data acquisition.</p>
<p>Then, the “sleep” session began after the participants were instructed to try and fall asleep. For the functional scans, whole-brain images were acquired using k-space and steady-state T2*-weighted gradient echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence that is sensitive to the BOLD contrast. This measures local magnetic changes caused by changes in blood oxygenation that accompany neural activity (sequence specification: 33 slices in interleaved ascending order, TR = 2000 ms, TE = 30 ms, voxel size = 3.5 × 3.5 × 4.2 mm<sup>3</sup>, FA = 90°, matrix = 64 × 64, gap = 0.7 mm).</p>

<p>The automated processing was carried out using custom Python scripts and the MNE toolkit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Gramfort et al., 2013</xref>). This encompassed the following procedures: <bold>I</bold>. The raw EEG data were downsampled from 5000 Hz to 2048 Hz. This downsampled rate accelerates subsequent analyses while retaining the necessary precision to distinguish MR noise. <bold>II.</bold> Imaging artifacts were removed using the Average Artefact Subtraction method (Allen et al., 2000). <bold>III.</bold> We then applied 0.1 - 30 Hz band-pass finite impulse response (FIR) filters to all channels. The EEG and EOG electrodes were re-referenced by subtracting the value from the M1 or M2 electrode (whichever was from the opposite hemisphere). The outer EMG electrodes were re-referenced to the middle one. <bold>IV.</bold> The signal space projection algorithm was applied to extract all epochs based on TRs and remove residual MR noise, as well as automatically extracting all heartbeat epochs using ECG electrode data for the removal of BCG noise. <bold>V.</bold> The data were further downsampled to 100 Hz and subjected to Independent Component Analysis (ICA).</p>
<p>Following this, the manual processing is carried out with labelling and removing the physiological artifacts ICs belonging to eye, muscle and residual BCG through the use of custom MATLAB scripts and the EEGLAB toolkit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Delorme &amp; Makeig, 2004</xref>).

<p>First, a reference volume and its skull-stripped version were generated using a custom methodology of <italic>fMRIPrep</italic>. Head-motion parameters with respect to the BOLD reference (transformation matrices, and six corresponding rotation and translation parameters) are estimated before any spatiotemporal filtering using mcflirt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jenkinson et al., 2002</xref>) [FSL 6.0.5.1:57b01774].

These resampled BOLD time-series will be referred to as <italic>preprocessed BOLD in original space</italic>, or just <italic>preprocessed BOLD</italic>. The BOLD reference was then co-registered to the T1w reference using mri_coreg (FreeSurfer) followed by flirt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Jenkinson &amp; Smith, 2001</xref>) [FSL 6.0.5.1:57b01774] with the boundary-based registration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Greve &amp; Fischl, 2009</xref>) cost-function. Co-registration was configured with six degrees of freedom. Several confounding time-series were calculated based on the <italic>preprocessed BOLD</italic>: framewise displacement (FD), DVARS and three region-wise global signals. FD was computed using two formulations following Power (absolute sum of relative motions) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Power et al., 2014</xref>) and Jenkinson (relative root mean square displacement between affines, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jenkinson et al.

FD and DVARS are calculated for each functional run, both using their implementations in <italic>Nipype</italic> (following the definitions by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Power et al. (2014)</xref>). The three global signals are extracted within the CSF, the WM, and the whole-brain masks. Additionally, a set of physiological regressors were extracted to allow for component-based noise correction (<italic>CompCor)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Behzadi et al., 2007</xref>). Principal components are estimated after high-pass filtering the <italic>preprocessed BOLD</italic> time-series (using a discrete cosine filter with 128s cut-off) for the two <italic>CompCor</italic> variants: temporal (tCompCor) and anatomical (aCompCor). tCompCor components are then calculated from the top 2% variable voxels within the brain mask. For aCompCor, three probabilistic masks (CSF, WM and combined CSF+WM) are generated in anatomical space. The implementation differs from that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Behzadi et al. (2007)</xref> in that instead of eroding the masks by 2 pixels on BOLD space, the aCompCor masks are subtracted a mask of pixels that likely contain a volume fraction of GM. This mask is obtained by thresholding the corresponding partial volume map at 0.05, and it ensures components are not extracted from voxels containing a minimal fraction of GM. Finally, these masks are resampled into BOLD space and binarized by thresholding at 0.99 (as in the original implementation). Components are also calculated separately within the WM and CSF masks. For each CompCor decomposition, the <italic>k</italic> components with the largest singular values are retained, such that the retained components’ time series are sufficient to explain 50 percent of variance across the nuisance mask (CSF, WM, combined, or temporal).

<title>EEG sleep rhythms analysis</title>
<p>In line with other studies examining the coordination between SOs and spindles, especially the spatial distribution of these sleep rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Massimini et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Molle et al., 2011</xref>), EEG data from the F3 electrode was used to quantify the occurrence of SOs and spindles. Using the established detection algorithms (detailed below), we identified SOs and sleep spindles for each subject.</p>
<sec id="s4f1">
<title>Detection of SOs</title>
<p>Data underwent a 0.16-1.25 Hz bandpass filtering (Butterworth filter, order 3, bidirectional filtering for zero-phase). After identifying all positive-to-negative zero crossings, potential SOs were determined based on the duration between consecutive zero crossings (ranging from 0.8 s to 3 s). We computed the amplitude range (peak minus trough) for each potential SO. Only those surpassing the 75th percentile in amplitude were marked as SOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Schreiner et al., 2021</xref>). The onsets and durations of these SOs were saved.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4f2">
<title>Detection of sleep spindles</title>
<p>Data underwent a 12-16 Hz bandpass filtering (Butterworth filter, order 3, bidirectional filtering for zero-phase). The root mean square (RMS) of the filtered signal was calculated with a sliding time window of 200 ms. The amplitude threshold for spindles was set at the 75th percentile of RMS values. RMS values exceeding this threshold and lasting between 0.5 s and 3 s were identified as spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Staresina et al., 2015</xref>). We saved all their onsets and durations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4f3">
<title>Detection of SO-spindle couplings</title>
<p>From the detected SOs and spindles, we identified the peak time of each spindle. Within each SO range, we checked for a spindle peak. If detected, it was recorded as an SO-spindle coupling event. For every SO-spindle coupling event, an epoch was created time-locked to the SO trough as the central reference, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Schreiner et al. (2021)</xref>. Data were extracted in a window of [-4 s to 4 s] around this point, forming the epoch for each coupling event. All SO-spindle epochs and their associated spindle peak times were saved.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4f4">
<title>Time-frequency analysis</title>
<p>We performed this analysis on the SO-spindle coupling epochs using the FieldTrip toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Oostenveld et al., 2011</xref>). Fourier analysis was executed on the data, utilizing a sliding time window with a forward shift of 50 ms. The window length was defined as five cycles of the present frequency (frequency range: 1-30 Hz, step size: 1 Hz). Before Fourier analysis, windowed data segments underwent multiplication by a Hanning taper. Subsequently, power values were normalized to z-scores within the time range of [-4 s to 4 s], selecting a longer duration to prevent edge artifacts from low-frequency activity in the target time window of [-1.5 s to 1.5 s].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4f5">
<title>Preferred phase analysis</title>
<p>All SO-spindle coupling epochs were filtered to the SO frequency band (0.16-1.25 Hz, 3rd-order Butterworth filter), and the instantaneous SO phase was determined through the Hilbert transform. Using the saved spindle peak times for each SO-spindle coupling, the preferred phase was deduced. The distribution of these phases across participants was then tested for uniformity using the Rayleigh test.</p>

<title>fMRI GLM analysis</title>
<p>All fMRI GLM analyses were conducted using only data from the N2/3 stages of NREM sleep. Segments of sleep data from these stages were concatenated for each participant. After pre-processing, the fMRI data was smoothed with an 8 mm FWHM kernel. All images underwent a temporal high-pass filter (width of 100 s), and the autocorrelation of the hemodynamic response was modelled via an AR(1) model. We then conducted General Linear Model (GLM) analyses to identify whole-brain activations associated with sleep rhythms and their coupling. We incorporated nuisance regressors estimated during the preprocessing with fMRIprep: six rigid-body motion-correction parameters identified during realignment (comprising three translation and rotation parameters), the mean White Matter, and the mean Cerebral Spinal Fluid signals. The cosine drift model was employed to detect and eliminate data fluctuations, thereby enhancing the accuracy of actual experimental effects. The GLMs were designed to evaluate the influence of experimental conditions on BOLD responses. All whole-brain analyses were thresholded using whole-brain FWE corrected at the cluster level (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), with a cluster-forming voxel threshold of <italic>p</italic><sub>unc.</sub> &lt; 0.001, unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p>The fMRI GLM analysis was designed to look for brain activations pertinent to SO, spindle, and SO-spindle coupling. Drawing from the EEG results concerning the timing of SO and spindle, we identified the trough of the SO as the onset for SO events and the peak of the spindle as the onset for spindle events. We chose the trough of the SO and the peak of the spindle as the onset points, primarily due to the larger amplitudes observed at these moments (thereby more robust to noise). This was also the common choice in previous EEG studies on SO and spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Ngo, Fell, &amp; Staresina, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Staresina et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Staresina et al., 2023</xref>). To model SO-spindle coupling in fMRI, we followed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Schreiner et al. (2021)</xref>, and defining SO-spindle complex as the peak of spindle appeared within 1.5 seconds after SO trough. When such a peak was found, that particular SO was labelled as an SO-spindle event, with its SO trough labelled as the event onset. After convolving these events with the canonical Hemodynamic Response Function (HRF) of SPM and downsampling them to align with the fMRI time resolution, they were integrated as regressors in the design matrix for GLM analysis, allowing us to determine the effects of SO and spindle, as well as the SO-spindle coupling (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b-d</xref>).</p>
<p>We have also conducted a control analysis aimed to distinguish brain activations associated with DOWN- vs. UP state of SOs. Drawing again from EEG data on SO and spindle, we randomly selected half of the SO events using the peak as the onset and the other half using the trough, to reduce collinearity between the two regressors. As with the main analysis, we identified the spindle peak as the onset for spindle events (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>).</p>

<title>ROI analysis</title>
<p>The objective of our ROI analysis was to test the activation of specific brain regions during distinct sleep rhythms. Within each ROI, the beta values at the subject-level were averaged across all voxels to facilitate subsequent statistical inferences (one-sample <italic>t</italic> test). We defined the mDMN and mPFC ROIs functionally based on the meta-analysis results in Neurosynth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yarkoni et al., 2011</xref>), by the keyword “medial default mode network” and “ventromedial prefrontal cortex” respectively. In addition to mDMN and mPFC, we defined other ROIs anatomically, using the high-resolution Harvard-Oxford Atlas probabilistic atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Desikan et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Open-ended Cognitive State Functional Decoding</title>
<p>For functional decoding, we followed the approach in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Margulies et al. (2016)</xref>. We used the NeuroSynth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yarkoni et al., 2011</xref>) meta-analytic database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.neurosynth.org">www.neurosynth.org</ext-link>) to assess topic terms associated with the sleep rhythms activation patterns. ROI masks were created from the whole-brain activation patterns associated with the three sleep rhythms in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b-d</xref>. These activation patterns were binarized using a threshold of <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, forming a brain mask for each sleep rhythm.</p>
<p>For each ROI mask, the analysis output was a z-statistic associated with a feature term, and the terms were ranked based on the weighted sum of their z-scores. The feature terms were derived from the most general set of 50 topic terms available in the NeuroSynth v3 dataset (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/NeuroanatomyAndConnectivity/gradient_analysis/blob/master/gradient_data/neurosynth/v3-topics-50-keys.txt">https://github.com/NeuroanatomyAndConnectivity/gradient_analysis/blob/master/gradient_data/neurosynth/v3-topics-50-keys.txt</ext-link>).</p>
<p>From the 50 topics, 16 exceeded the threshold of <italic>z</italic> &gt; 1.96 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Two terms were removed as they did not represent coherent cognitive functions, leaving 14 relevant topic terms (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). These included: episodic memory, declarative memory, working memory, task representation, language, learning, faces, visuospatial processing, category recognition, cognitive control, reading, cued attention, inhibition, and action.</p>

<title>PPI analysis</title>
<p>PPI (psychophysiological interaction) analysis is designed to quantify context-dependent alterations in effective connectivity between brain regions. For instance, it can determine whether hippocampus-based functional connectivity with the thalamus varies based on the occurrence of an SO-spindle coupling event. We conducted three whole-brain PPI analyses with <italic>nilearn</italic> to investigate interactions based in the hippocampus, thalamus or mPFC during SO-spindle coupling, utilizing the same ROIs.</p>
<p>Both the main effects of physiological and physiological condition, as well as their interaction were modelled in the design matrix for PPI analysis. The main effect of physiological term produced functional connectivity maps of the entire brain in relation to the specified ROI (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b, c, d</xref>). While the interaction term asked for the <italic>change</italic> of functional connectivity along with the SO-spindle coupling (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>).</p>

<p>The study reports <bold>valuable</bold> findings from a very rich EEG-fMRI dataset including 107 participants, which was collected during nocturnal naps. The authors link activity in memory-related brain regions (e.g., hippocampus, thalamus, and medial prefrontal cortex), and their functional connectivity, to the occurrence of canonical sleep rhythms, namely spindles and slow oscillations in non-rapid eye movement sleep. This work could contribute to further understanding of sleep neural dynamics, although the evidence for some of the main claims is <bold>incomplete</bold> at present.</p>

<p>Wang et al., recorded concurrent EEG-fMRI in 107 participants during nocturnal NREM sleep to investigate brain activity and connectivity related to slow oscillations (SO), sleep spindles, and in particular their co-occurrence. The authors found SO-spindle coupling to be correlated with increased thalamic and hippocampal activity, and with increased functional connectivity from the hippocampus to the thalamus and from the thalamus to the neocortex, especially the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). They concluded the brain-wide activation pattern to resemble episodic memory processing, but to be dissociated from task-related processing and suggest that the thalamus plays a crucial role in coordinating the hippocampal-cortical dialogue during sleep.</p>
<p>The paper offers an impressively large and highly valuable dataset that provides the opportunity for gaining important new insights into the network substrate involved in SOs, spindles, and their coupling. However, the paper does unfortunately not exploit the full potential of this dataset with the analyses currently provided, and the interpretation of the results is often not backed up by the results presented.</p>
<p>I have the following specific comments.</p>
<p>(1) The introduction is lacking sufficient review of the already existing literature on EEG-fMRI during sleep and the BOLD-correlates of slow oscillations and spindles in particular (Laufs et al., 2007; Schabus et al., 2007; Horovitz et al., 2008; Laufs, 2008; Czisch et al., 2009; Picchioni et al., 2010; Spoormaker et al., 2010; Caporro et al., 2011; Bergmann et al., 2012; Hale et al., 2016; Fogel et al., 2017; Moehlman et al., 2018; Ilhan-Bayrakci et al., 2022). The few studies mentioned are not discussed in terms of the methods used or insights gained.</p>
<p>(2) The paper falls short in discussing the specific insights gained into the neurobiological substrate of the investigated slow oscillations, spindles, and their interactions. The validity of the inverse inference approach (&quot;Open ended cognitive state decoding&quot;), assuming certain cognitive functions to be related to these oscillations because of the brain regions/networks activated in temporal association with these events, is debatable at best. It is also unclear why eventually only episodic memory processing-like brain-wide activation is discussed further, despite the activity of 16 of 50 feature terms from the NeuroSynth v3 dataset were significant (episodic memory, declarative memory, working memory, task representation, language, learning, faces, visuospatial processing, category recognition, cognitive control, reading, cued attention, inhibition, and action).</p>
<p>(3) Hippocampal activation during SO-spindles is stated as a main hypothesis of the paper - for good reasons - however, other regions (e.g., several cortical as well as thalamic) would be equally expected given the known origin of both oscillations and the existing sleep-EEG-fMRI literature. However, this focus on the hippocampus contrasts with the focus on investigating the key role of the thalamus instead in the Results section.</p>
<p>(4) The study included an impressive number of 107 subjects. It is surprising though that only 31 subjects had to be excluded under these difficult recording conditions, especially since no adaptation night was performed. Since only subjects were excluded who slept less than 10 min (or had excessive head movements) there are likely several datasets included with comparably short durations and only a small number of SOs and spindles and even less combined SO-spindle events. A comprehensive table should be provided (supplement) including for each subject (included and excluded) the duration of included NREM sleep, number of SOs, spindles, and SO+spindle events. Also, some descriptive statistics (mean/SD/range) would be helpful.</p>
<p>(5) Was the 20-channel head coil dedicated for EEG-fMRI measurements? How were the electrode cables guided through/out of the head coil? Usually, the 64-channel head coil is used for EEG-fMRI measurements in a Siemens PRISMA 3T scanner, which has a cable duct at the back that allows to guide the cables straight out of the head coil (to minimize MR-related artifacts). The choice for the 20-channel head coil should be motivated. Photos of the recording setup would also be helpful.</p>
<p>(6) Was the EEG sampling synchronized to the MR scanner (gradient system) clock (the 10 MHz signal; not referring to the volume TTL triggers here)? This is a requirement for stable gradient artifact shape over time and thus accurate gradient noise removal.</p>
<p>(7) The TR is quite long and the voxel size is quite large in comparison to state-of-the-art EPI sequences. What was the rationale behind choosing a sequence with relatively low temporal and spatial resolution?</p>
<p>(8) The anatomically defined ROIs are quite large. It should be elaborated on how this might reduce sensitivity to sleep rhythm-specific activity within sub-regions, especially for the thalamus, which has distinct nuclei involved in sleep functions.</p>
<p>(9) The study reports SO &amp; spindle amplitudes &amp; densities, as well as SO+spindle coupling, to be larger during N2/3 sleep compared to N1 and REM sleep, which is trivial but can be seen as a sanity check of the data. However, the amount of SOs and spindles reported for N1 and REM sleep is concerning, as per definition there should be hardly any (if SOs or spindles occur in N1 it becomes by definition N2, and the interval between spindles has to be considerably large in REM to still be scored as such). Thus, on the one hand, the report of these comparisons takes too much space in the main manuscript as it is trivial, but on the other hand, it raises concerns about the validity of the scoring.</p>
<p>(10) Why was electrode F3 used to quantify the occurrence of SOs and spindles? Why not a midline frontal electrode like Fz (or a number of frontal electrodes for SOs) and Cz (or a number of centroparietal electrodes) for spindles to be closer to their maximum topography?</p>
<p>(11) Functional connectivity (hippocampus -&gt; thalamus -&gt; cortex (mPFC)) is reported to be increased during SO-spindle coupling and interpreted as evidence for coordination of hippocampo-neocortical communication likely by thalamic spindles. However, functional connectivity was only analysed during coupled SO+spindle events, not during isolated SOs or isolated spindles. Without the direct comparison of the connectivity patterns between these three events, it remains unclear whether this is specific for coupled SO+spindle events or rather associated with one or both of the other isolated events. The PPIs need to be conducted for those isolated events as well and compared statistically to the coupled events.</p>
<p>(12) The limited temporal resolution of fMRI does indeed not allow for easily distinguishing between fMRI activation patterns related to SO-up- vs. SO-down-states. For this, one could try to extract the amplitudes of SO-up- and SO-down-states separately for each SO event and model them as two separate parametric modulators (with the risk of collinearity as they are likely correlated).</p>
<p>(13) L327: &quot;It is likely that our findings of diminished DMN activity reflect brain activity during the SO DOWN-state, as this state consistently shows higher amplitude compared to the UP-state within subjects, which is why we modelled the SO trough as its onset in the fMRI analysis.&quot; This conclusion is not justified as the fact that SO down-states are larger in amplitude does not mean their impact on the BOLD response is larger.</p>
<p>(14) Line 77: &quot;In the current study, while directly capturing hippocampal ripples with scalp EEG or fMRI is difficult, we expect to observe hippocampal activation in fMRI whenever SOs-spindles coupling is detected by EEG, if SOs- spindles-ripples triple coupling occurs during human NREM sleep&quot;. Not all SO-spindle events are associated with ripples (Staresina et al., 2015), but hippocampal activation may also be expected based on the occurrence of spindles alone (Bergmann et al., 2012).</p>

<p>In this study, Wang and colleagues aimed to explore brain-wide activation patterns associated with NREM sleep oscillations, including slow oscillations (SOs), spindles, and SO-spindle coupling events. Their findings reveal that SO-spindle events corresponded with increased activation in both the thalamus and hippocampus. Additionally, they observed that SO-spindle coupling was linked to heightened functional connectivity from the hippocampus to the thalamus, and from the thalamus to the medial prefrontal cortex-three key regions involved in memory consolidation and episodic memory processes.</p>
<p>This study's findings are timely and highly relevant to the field. The authors' extensive data collection, involving 107 participants sleeping in an fMRI while undergoing simultaneous EEG recording, deserves special recognition. If shared, this unique dataset could lead to further valuable insights. While the conclusions of the data seem overall well supported by the data, some aspects with regard to the detection of sleep oscillations need clarification.</p>
<p>The authors report that coupled SO-spindle events were most frequent during NREM sleep (2.46 {plus minus} 0.06 events/min), but they also observed a surprisingly high occurrence of these events during N1 and REM sleep (2.23 {plus minus} 0.09 and 2.32 {plus minus} 0.09 events/min, respectively), where SO-spindle coupling would not typically be expected. Combined with the relatively modest SO amplitudes reported (~25 µV, whereas &gt;75 µV would be expected when using mastoids as reference electrodes), this raises the possibility that the parameters used for event detection may not have been conservative enough - or that sleep staging was inaccurately performed. This issue could present a significant challenge, as the fMRI findings are largely dependent on the reliability of these detected events.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Wang et al., examined the brain activity patterns during sleep, especially when locked to those canonical sleep rhythms such as SO, spindle, and their coupling. Analyzing data from a large sample, the authors found significant coupling between spindles and SOs, particularly during the upstate of the SO. Moreover, the authors examined the patterns of whole-brain activity locked to these sleep rhythms. To understand the functional significance of these brain activities, the authors further conducted open-ended cognitive state decoding and found a variety of cognitive processing may be involved during SO-spindle coupling and during other sleep events. The authors next investigated the functional connectivity analyses and found enhanced connectivity between the hippocampus, the thalamus, and the medial PFC. These results reinforced the theoretical model of sleep-dependent memory consolidation, such that SO-spindle coupling is conducive to systems-level memory reactivation and consolidation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>There are obvious strengths in this work, including the large sample size, state-of-the-art neuroimaging and neural oscillation analyses, and the richness of results.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Despite these strengths and the insights gained, there are weaknesses in the design, the analyses, and inferences.</p>
<p>A repeating statement in the manuscript is that brain activity could indicate memory reactivation and thus consolidation. This is indeed a highly relevant question that could be informed by the current data/results. However, an inherent weakness of the design is that there is no memory task before and after sleep. Thus, it is difficult (if not impossible) to make a strong argument linking SO/spindle/coupling-locked brain activity with memory reactivation or consolidation.</p>
<p>Relatedly, to understand the functional implications of the sleep rhythm-locked brain activity, the authors employed the &quot;open-ended cognitive state decoding&quot; method. While this method is interesting, it is rather indirect given that there were no behavioral indices in the manuscript. Thus, discussions based on these analyses are speculative at best. Please either tone down the language or find additional evidence to support these claims.</p>
<p>Moreover, the results from this method are difficult to understand. Figure 3e showed that for all three types of sleep events (SO, spindle, SO-spindle), the same mental states (e.g., working memory, episodic memory, declarative memory) showed opposite directions of activation (left and right panels showed negative and positive activation, respectively). How to interpret these conflicting results? This ambiguity is also reflected by the term used: declarative memory and episodic memories are both indexed in the results. Yet these two processes can be largely overlapped. So which specific memory processes do these brain activity patterns reflect? The Discussion shall discuss these results and the limitations of this method.</p>
<p>The coupling strength is somehow inconsistent with prior results (Hahn et al., 2020, eLife, Helfrich et al., 2018, Neuron). Specifically, Helfrich et al. showed that among young adults, the spindle is coupled to the peak of the SO. Here, the authors reported that the spindles were coupled to down-to-up transitions of SO and before the SO peak. It is possible that participants' age may influence the coupling (see Helfrich et al., 2018). Please discuss the findings in the context of previous research on SO-spindle coupling.</p>
<p>The discussion is rather superficial with only two pages, without delving into many important arguments regarding the possible functional significance of these results. For example, the author wrote, &quot;This internal processing contrasts with the brain patterns associated with external tasks, such as working memory.&quot; Without any references to working memory, and without delineating why WM is considered as an external task even working memory operations can be internal. Similarly, for the interesting results on SO and reduced DMN activity, the authors wrote &quot;The DMN is typically active during wakeful rest and is associated with self-referential processes like mind-wandering, daydreaming, and task representation (Yeshurun, Nguyen, &amp; Hasson, 2021). Its reduced activity during SOs may signal a shift towards endogenous processes such as memory consolidation.&quot; This argument is flawed. DMN is active during self-referential processing and mind-wandering, i.e., when the brain shifts from external stimuli processing to internal mental processing. During sleep, endogenous memory reactivation and consolidation are also part of the internal mental processing given the lack of external environmental stimulation. So why during SO or during memory consolidation, the DMN activity would be reduced? Were there differences in DMN activity between SO and SO-spindle coupling events?</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Wang et al., recorded concurrent EEG-fMRI in 107 participants during nocturnal NREM sleep to investigate brain activity and connectivity related to slow oscillations (SO), sleep spindles, and in particular their co-occurrence. The authors found SO-spindle coupling to be correlated with increased thalamic and hippocampal activity, and with increased functional connectivity from the hippocampus to the thalamus and from the thalamus to the neocortex, especially the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). They concluded the brain-wide activation pattern to resemble episodic memory processing, but to be dissociated from task-related processing and suggest that the thalamus plays a crucial role in coordinating the hippocampal-cortical dialogue during sleep.</p>
<p>The paper offers an impressively large and highly valuable dataset that provides the opportunity for gaining important new insights into the network substrate involved in SOs, spindles, and their coupling. However, the paper does unfortunately not exploit the full potential of this dataset with the analyses currently provided, and the interpretation of the results is often not backed up by the results presented. I have the following specific comments.</p>

<p>Thank you for your thoughtful and constructive feedback. We greatly appreciate your recognition of the strengths of our dataset and findings Below, we address your specific comments and provide responses to each point you raised to ensure our methods and results are as transparent and comprehensible as possible. We hope these revisions address your comments and further strengthen our manuscript. Thank you again for the constructive feedback.</p>

<p>(1) The introduction is lacking sufficient review of the already existing literature on EEG-fMRI during sleep and the BOLD-correlates of slow oscillations and spindles in particular (Laufs et al., 2007; Schabus et al., 2007; Horovitz et al., 2008; Laufs, 2008; Czisch et al., 2009; Picchioni et al., 2010; Spoormaker et al., 2010; Caporro et al., 2011; Bergmann et al., 2012; Hale et al., 2016; Fogel et al., 2017; Moehlman et al., 2018; Ilhan-Bayrakci et al., 2022). The few studies mentioned are not discussed in terms of the methods used or insights gained.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the need for a more comprehensive review of prior EEG-fMRI studies investigating BOLD correlates of slow oscillations and spindles. However, these articles are not all related to sleep SO or spindle. Articles (Hale et al., 2016; Horovitz et al., 2008; Laufs, 2008; Laufs, Walker, &amp; Lund, 2007; Spoormaker et al., 2010) mainly focus on methodology for EEG-fMRI, sleep stages, or brain networks, which are not the focus of our study. Thank you again for your attention to the comprehensiveness of our literature review, and we will expand the introduction to include a more detailed discussion of the existing literature, ensuring that the contributions of previous EEG-fMRI sleep studies are adequately acknowledged.</p>
<p>Introduction, Page 4 Lines 62-76</p>
<p>“Investigating these sleep-related neural processes in humans is challenging because it requires tracking transient sleep rhythms while simultaneously assessing their widespread brain activation. Recent advances in simultaneous EEG-fMRI techniques provide a unique opportunity to explore these processes. EEG allows for precise event-based detection of neural signal, while fMRI provides insight into the broader spatial patterns of brain activation and functional connectivity (Horovitz et al., 2008; Huang et al., 2024; Laufs, 2008; Laufs, Walker, &amp; Lund, 2007; Schabus et al., 2007; Spoormaker et al., 2010). Previous EEG-fMRI studies on sleep have focused on classifying sleep stages or examining the neural correlates of specific waves (Bergmann et al., 2012; Caporro et al., 2012; Czisch et al., 2009; Fogel et al., 2017; Hale et al., 2016; Ilhan-Bayrakcı et al., 2022; Moehlman et al., 2019; Picchioni et al., 2011). These studies have generally reported that slow oscillations are associated with widespread cortical and subcortical BOLD changes, whereas spindles elicit activation in the thalamus, as well as in several cortical and paralimbic regions. Although these findings provide valuable insights into the BOLD correlates of sleep rhythms, they often do not employ sophisticated temporal modeling (Huang et al., 2024), to capture the dynamic interactions between different oscillatory events, e.g., the coupling between SOs and spindles.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The paper falls short in discussing the specific insights gained into the neurobiological substrate of the investigated slow oscillations, spindles, and their interactions. The validity of the inverse inference approach (&quot;Open ended cognitive state decoding&quot;), assuming certain cognitive functions to be related to these oscillations because of the brain regions/networks activated in temporal association with these events, is debatable at best. It is also unclear why eventually only episodic memory processing-like brain-wide activation is discussed further, despite the activity of 16 of 50 feature terms from the NeuroSynth v3 dataset were significant (episodic memory, declarative memory, working memory, task representation, language, learning, faces, visuospatial processing, category recognition, cognitive control, reading, cued attention, inhibition, and action).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out, particularly regarding the use of inverse inference approaches such as “open-ended cognitive state decoding.” Given the concerns about the indirectness of this approach, we decided to remove its related content and results from Figure 3 in the main text and include it in Supplementary Figure 7. We will refocus the main text on direct neurobiological insights gained from our EEG-fMRI analyses, particularly emphasizing the hippocampal-thalamocortical network dynamics underlying SO-spindle coupling, and we will acknowledge the exploratory nature of these findings and highlight their limitations.</p>
<p>Discussion, Page 17-18 Lines 323-332</p>
<p>“To explore functional relevance, we employed an open-ended cognitive state decoding approach using meta-analytic data (NeuroSynth: Yarkoni et al. (2011)). Although this method usefully generates hypotheses about potential cognitive processes, particularly in the absence of a pre- and post-sleep memory task, it is inherently indirect. Many cognitive terms showed significant associations (16 of 50), such as “episodic memory,” “declarative memory,” and “working memory.” We focused on episodic/declarative memory given the known link with hippocampal reactivation (Diekelmann &amp; Born, 2010; Staresina et al., 2015; Staresina et al., 2023). Nonetheless, these inferences regarding memory reactivation should be interpreted cautiously without direct behavioral measures. Future research incorporating explicit tasks before and after sleep would more rigorously validate these potential functional claims.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Hippocampal activation during SO-spindles is stated as a main hypothesis of the paper - for good reasons - however, other regions (e.g., several cortical as well as thalamic) would be equally expected given the known origin of both oscillations and the existing sleep-EEG-fMRI literature. However, this focus on the hippocampus contrasts with the focus on investigating the key role of the thalamus instead in the Results section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your insight regarding the relative emphasis on hippocampal and thalamic activation in our study. We recognize that the manuscript may currently present an inconsistency between our initial hypothesis and the main focus of the results. To address this concern, we will ensure that our Introduction and Discussion section explicitly discusses both regions, highlighting the complementary roles of the hippocampus (memory processing and reactivation) and the thalamus (spindle generation and cortico-hippocampal coordination) in SO-spindle dynamics.</p>
<p>Introduction, Page 5 Lines 87-103</p>
<p>“To address this gap, our study investigates brain-wide activation and functional connectivity patterns associated with SO-spindle coupling, and employs a cognitive state decoding approach (Margulies et al., 2016; Yarkoni et al., 2011)—albeit indirectly—to infer potential cognitive functions. In the current study, we used simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings during nocturnal naps (detailed sleep staging results are provided in the Methods and Table S1) in 107 participants. Although directly detecting hippocampal ripples using scalp EEG or fMRI is challenging, we expected that hippocampal activation in fMRI would coincide with SO-spindle coupling detected by EEG, given that SOs, spindles, and ripples frequently co-occur during NREM sleep. We also anticipated a critical role of the thalamus, particularly thalamic spindles, in coordinating hippocampal-cortical communication.</p>
<p>We found significant coupling between SOs and spindles during NREM sleep (N2/3), with spindle peaks occurring slightly before the SO peak. This coupling was associated with increased activation in both the thalamus and hippocampus, with functional connectivity patterns suggesting thalamic coordination of hippocampal-cortical communication. These findings highlight the key role of the thalamus in coordinating hippocampal-cortical interactions during human sleep and provide new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying sleep-dependent brain communication. A deeper understanding of these mechanisms may contribute to future neuromodulation approaches aimed at enhancing sleep-dependent cognitive function and treating sleep-related disorders.”</p>
<p>Discussion, Page 16-17 Lines 292-307</p>
<p>“When modeling the timing of these sleep rhythms in the fMRI, we observed hippocampal activation selectively during SO-spindle events. This suggests the possibility of triple coupling (SOs–spindles–ripples), even though our scalp EEG was not sufficiently sensitive to detect hippocampal ripples—key markers of memory replay (Buzsáki, 2015). Recent iEEG evidence indicates that ripples often co-occur with both spindles (Ngo, Fell, &amp; Staresina, 2020) and SOs (Staresina et al., 2015; Staresina et al., 2023). Therefore, the hippocampal involvement during SO-spindle events in our study may reflect memory replay from the hippocampus, propagated via thalamic spindles to distributed cortical regions.</p>
<p>The thalamus, known to generate spindles (Halassa et al., 2011), plays a key role in producing and coordinating sleep rhythms (Coulon, Budde, &amp; Pape, 2012; Crunelli et al., 2018), while the hippocampus is found essential for memory consolidation (Buzsáki, 2015; Diba &amp; Buzsá ki, 2007; Singh, Norman, &amp; Schapiro, 2022). The increased hippocampal and thalamic activity, along with strengthened connectivity between these regions and the mPFC during SO-spindle events, underscores a hippocampal-thalamic-neocortical information flow. This aligns with recent findings suggesting the thalamus orchestrates neocortical oscillations during sleep (Schreiner et al., 2022). The thalamus and hippocampus thus appear central to memory consolidation during sleep, guiding information transfer to the neocortex, e.g., mPFC.”</p>

<p>(4) The study included an impressive number of 107 subjects. It is surprising though that only 31 subjects had to be excluded under these difficult recording conditions, especially since no adaptation night was performed. Since only subjects were excluded who slept less than 10 min (or had excessive head movements) there are likely several datasets included with comparably short durations and only a small number of SOs and spindles and even less combined SO-spindle events. A comprehensive table should be provided (supplement) including for each subject (included and excluded) the duration of included NREM sleep, number of SOs, spindles, and SO+spindle events. Also, some descriptive statistics (mean/SD/range) would be helpful.</p>

<p>We appreciate your recognition of our sample size and the challenges associated with simultaneous EEG-fMRI sleep recordings. We acknowledge the importance of transparently reporting individual subject data, particularly regarding sleep duration and the number of detected SOs, spindles, and SO-spindle events. To address this, we will provide comprehensive tables in the supplementary materials, contains descriptive information about sleep-related characteristics (Table S1), as well as detailed information about sleep waves at each sleep stage for all 107 subjects(Table S2-S4), listing for each subject:(1)Different sleep stage duration; (2)Number of detected SOs; (3)Number of detected spindles; (4)Number of detected SO-spindle coupling events; (5)Density of detected SOs; (6)Density of detected spindles; (7)Density of detected SO-spindle coupling events.</p>
<p>However, most of the excluded participants were unable to fall asleep or had too short a sleep duration, so they basically had no NREM sleep period, so it was impossible to count the NREM sleep duration, SO, spindle, and coupling numbers.</p>

<p>Thank you for your comment regarding our choice of the 20-channel head coil for EEG-fMRI measurements. We acknowledge that the 64-channel head coil is commonly used in Siemens PRISMA 3T scanners; however, the 20-channel coil was selected due to specific practical and technical considerations in our study. In particular, the 20-channel head coil was compatible with our EEG system and ensured sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for both EEG and fMRI acquisition. The EEG electrode cables were guided through the lateral and posterior openings of the head coil, secured with foam padding to reduce motion and minimize MR-related artifacts. Moreover, given the extended nature of nocturnal sleep recordings, the 20-channel coil allowed us to maintain participant comfort while still achieving high-quality simultaneous EEG-fMRI data.</p>
<p>We have made this clearer in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(6) Was the EEG sampling synchronized to the MR scanner (gradient system) clock (the 10 MHz signal; not referring to the volume TTL triggers here)? This is a requirement for stable gradient artifact shape over time and thus accurate gradient noise removal.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising this important point. We confirm that the EEG sampling was synchronized to the MR scanner’s 10 MHz gradient system clock, ensuring a stable gradient artifact shape over time and enabling accurate artifact removal. This synchronization was achieved using the standard clock synchronization interface of the EEG amplifier, minimizing timing jitter and drift. As a result, the gradient artifact waveform remained stable across volumes, allowing for more effective artifact correction during preprocessing. We appreciate your attention to this critical aspect of EEG-fMRI data acquisition.</p>

<p>“EEG was recorded simultaneously with fMRI data using an MR-compatible EEG amplifier system (BrainAmps MR-Plus, Brain Products, Germany), along with a specialized electrode cap. The recording was done using 64 channels in the international 10/20 system, with the reference channel positioned at FCz. In order to adhere to polysomnography (PSG) recording standards, six electrodes were removed from the EEG cap: one for electrocardiogram (ECG) recording, two for electrooculogram (EOG) recording, and three for electromyogram (EMG) recording. EEG data was recorded at a sample rate of 5000 Hz, the resistance of the reference and ground channels was kept below 10 kΩ, and the resistance of the other channels was kept below 20 kΩ. To synchronize the EEG and fMRI recordings, the BrainVision recording software (BrainProducts, Germany) was utilized to capture triggers from the MRI scanner. The EEG sampling was synchronized to the MR scanner’s 10 MHz gradient system clock, ensuring a stable gradient artifact shape over time and enabling accurate artifact removal. This was achieved via the standard clock synchronization interface of the EEG amplifier, minimizing timing jitter and drift.”</p>

<p>(7) The TR is quite long and the voxel size is quite large in comparison to state-of-the-art EPI sequences. What was the rationale behind choosing a sequence with relatively low temporal and spatial resolution?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge that our chosen TR and voxel size are relatively long and large compared to state-of-the-art EPI sequences. This decision was made to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and reduce susceptibility-related distortions, which are particularly critical in EEG-fMRI sleep studies where head motion and physiological noise can be substantial. A longer TR allowed us to sample whole-brain activity with sufficient coverage, while a larger voxel size helped enhance BOLD sensitivity and minimize partial volume effects in deep brain structures such as the thalamus and hippocampus, which are key regions of interest in our study. We appreciate your concern and hope this clarification provides sufficient rationale for our sequence parameters.</p>

<p>“Then, the “sleep” session began after the participants were instructed to try and fall asleep. For the functional scans, whole-brain images were acquired using k-space and steady-state T2*-weighted gradient echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence that is sensitive to the BOLD contrast. This measures local magnetic changes caused by changes in blood oxygenation that accompany neural activity (sequence specification: 33 slices in interleaved ascending order, TR = 2000 ms, TE = 30 ms, voxel size = 3.5 × 3.5 × 4.2 mm<sup>3</sup>, FA = 90°, matrix = 64 × 64, gap = 0.7 mm).

<p>(8) The anatomically defined ROIs are quite large. It should be elaborated on how this might reduce sensitivity to sleep rhythm-specific activity within sub-regions, especially for the thalamus, which has distinct nuclei involved in sleep functions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your insight regarding the use of anatomically defined ROIs and their potential limitations in detecting sleep rhythm-specific activity within sub-regions, particularly in the thalamus. Given the distinct functional roles of thalamic nuclei in sleep processes, we acknowledge that using a single, large thalamic ROI may reduce sensitivity to localized activity patterns. To address this, we will discuss this limitation in the revised manuscript, acknowledging that our approach prioritizes whole-structure effects but may not fully capture nucleus-specific contributions.</p>

Third, the use of large anatomical ROIs may mask subregional contributions of specific thalamic nuclei or hippocampal subfields.

<p>(9) The study reports SO &amp; spindle amplitudes &amp; densities, as well as SO+spindle coupling, to be larger during N2/3 sleep compared to N1 and REM sleep, which is trivial but can be seen as a sanity check of the data. However, the amount of SOs and spindles reported for N1 and REM sleep is concerning, as per definition there should be hardly any (if SOs or spindles occur in N1 it becomes by definition N2, and the interval between spindles has to be considerably large in REM to still be scored as such). Thus, on the one hand, the report of these comparisons takes too much space in the main manuscript as it is trivial, but on the other hand, it raises concerns about the validity of the scoring.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your concern regarding the reported presence of SOs and spindles in N1 and REM sleep and the potential implications. Our detection method for detecting SO, spindle, and coupling were originally designed only for N2&amp;N3 sleep data based on the characteristics of the data itself, and this method is widely recognized and used in the sleep research (Hahn et al., 2020; Helfrich et al., 2019; Helfrich et al., 2018; Ngo, Fell, &amp; Staresina, 2020; Schreiner et al., 2022; Schreiner et al., 2021; Staresina et al., 2015; Staresina et al., 2023). While, because the detection methods for SO and spindle are based on percentiles, this method will always detect a certain number of events when used for other stages (N1 and REM) sleep data, but the differences between these events and those detected in stage N23 remain unclear. We will acknowledge the reasons for these results in the Methods section and emphasize that they are used only for sanity checks.</p>

We nevertheless identified and reported the detailed descriptive statistics of these sleep rhythms in all sleep stages, under the same operational definitions, both for completeness and as a sanity check. Within the same subject, there should be more SOs, spindles, and their couplings in N2/N3 than in N1 or REM (see also Figure S2-S4, Table S1-S4).”</p>

<p>(10) Why was electrode F3 used to quantify the occurrence of SOs and spindles? Why not a midline frontal electrode like Fz (or a number of frontal electrodes for SOs) and Cz (or a number of centroparietal electrodes) for spindles to be closer to their maximum topography?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your suggestion regarding electrode selection for SO and spindle quantification. Our choice of F3 was primarily based on previous studies (Massimini et al., 2004; Molle et al., 2011), where bilateral frontal electrodes are commonly used for detecting SOs and spindles. Additionally, we considered the impact of MRI-related noise and, after a comprehensive evaluation, determined that F3 provided an optimal balance between signal quality and artifact minimization. We also acknowledge that alternative electrode choices, such as Fz for SOs and Cz for spindles, could provide additional insights into their topographical distributions.</p>

<p>(11) Functional connectivity (hippocampus -&gt; thalamus -&gt; cortex (mPFC)) is reported to be increased during SO-spindle coupling and interpreted as evidence for coordination of hippocampo-neocortical communication likely by thalamic spindles. However, functional connectivity was only analysed during coupled SO+spindle events, not during isolated SOs or isolated spindles. Without the direct comparison of the connectivity patterns between these three events, it remains unclear whether this is specific for coupled SO+spindle events or rather associated with one or both of the other isolated events. The PPIs need to be conducted for those isolated events as well and compared statistically to the coupled events.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your critical perspective on our functional connectivity analysis and the interpretation of hippocampus-thalamus-cortex (mPFC) interactions during SO-spindle coupling. We acknowledge that, in the current analysis, functional connectivity was only examined during coupled SO-spindle events, without direct comparison to isolated SOs or isolated spindles. To address this concern, we have conducted PPI analyses for all three ROIs(Hippocampus, Thalamus, mPFC) and all three event types (SO-spindle couplings, isolated SOs, and isolated spindles). Our results indicate that neither isolated SOs nor isolated Spindles yielded significant connectivity changes in all three ROIs, as all failed to survive multiple comparison corrections. This suggests that the observed connectivity increase is specific to SO-spindle coupling, rather than being independently driven by either SOs or spindles alone.</p>
<p>Results, Page 14 Lines 248-255</p>
<p>“Crucially, the interaction between FC and SO-spindle coupling revealed that only the functional connectivity of hippocampus -&gt; thalamus (ROI analysis, <italic>t</italic><sub>(106)</sub> = 1.86, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0328) and thalamus -&gt; mPFC (ROI analysis, <italic>t</italic><sub>(106)</sub> = 1.98, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0251) significantly increased during SO-spindle coupling, with no significant changes in all other pathways (Fig. 4e). We also conducted PPI analyses for the other two events (SOs and spindles), and neither yielded significant connectivity changes in the three ROIs, as all failed to survive whole-brain FWE correction at the cluster level (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Together, these findings suggest that the thalamus, likely via spindles, coordinates hippocampal-cortical communication selectively during SO-spindle coupling, but not isolated SOs or spindle events alone.”</p>

<p>(12) The limited temporal resolution of fMRI does indeed not allow for easily distinguishing between fMRI activation patterns related to SO-up- vs. SO-down-states. For this, one could try to extract the amplitudes of SO-up- and SO-down-states separately for each SO event and model them as two separate parametric modulators (with the risk of collinearity as they are likely correlated).</p>

<p>We appreciate your insightful comment regarding the challenge of distinguishing fMRI activation patterns related to SO-up vs. SO-down states due to the limited temporal resolution of fMRI. While our current analysis does not differentiate between these two phases, we acknowledge that separately modeling SO-up and SO-down states using parametric modulators could provide a more refined understanding of their distinct neural correlates. However, as you notes, this approach carries the risk of collinearity, and there is indeed a high correlation between the two amplitudes across all subjects in our results (r=0.98). Future studies could explore more on leveraging high-temporal-resolution techniques. While implementing this in the current study is beyond our scope, we will acknowledge this limitation in the Discussion section.</p>

<p>“An intriguing aspect of our findings is the reduced DMN activity during SOs when modeled at the SO trough (DOWN-state). This reduced DMN activity may reflect large-scale neural inhibition characteristic of the SO trough. The DMN is typically active during internally oriented cognition (e.g., self-referential processing or mind-wandering) and is suppressed during external stimuli processing (Yeshurun, Nguyen, &amp; Hasson, 2021). It is unlikely, however, that this suppression of DMN during SO events is related to a shift from internal cognition to external responses given it is during deep sleep time. Instead, it could be driven by the inherent rhythmic pattern of SOs, which makes it difficult to separate UP- from DOWN-states (the two temporal regressors were highly correlated, and similar brain activation during SOs events was obtained if modelled at the SO peak instead, Fig. S5). Since the amplitude at the SO trough is consistently larger than that at the SO peak, the neural activation we detected may primarily capture the large-scale inhibition from DOWN-state.

We acknowledge that not all SO-spindle events are necessarily accompanied by ripples (Staresina et al., 2015). However, based on previous research, we found that hippocampal ripples are significantly more likely to occur during SO-spindle coupling events. This suggests that while ripple occurrence is not guaranteed, SO-spindle coupling creates a favorable network state for ripple generation and potential hippocampal activation. To ensure accuracy, we will revise the manuscript to delete this misleading sentence in the Introduction section and acknowledge in the Discussion that our results cannot conclusively directly observe the triple coupling of SO, spindle, and hippocampal ripples.</p>

<p>In this study, Wang and colleagues aimed to explore brain-wide activation patterns associated with NREM sleep oscillations, including slow oscillations (SOs), spindles, and SO-spindle coupling events. Their findings reveal that SO-spindle events corresponded with increased activation in both the thalamus and hippocampus. Additionally, they observed that SO-spindle coupling was linked to heightened functional connectivity from the hippocampus to the thalamus, and from the thalamus to the medial prefrontal cortex-three key regions involved in memory consolidation and episodic memory processes.</p>
<p>This study's findings are timely and highly relevant to the field. The authors' extensive data collection, involving 107 participants sleeping in an fMRI while undergoing simultaneous EEG recording, deserves special recognition. If shared, this unique dataset could lead to further valuable insights. While the conclusions of the data seem overall well supported by the data, some aspects with regard to the detection of sleep oscillations need clarification.</p>
<p>The authors report that coupled SO-spindle events were most frequent during NREM sleep (2.46 [plus minus] 0.06 events/min), but they also observed a surprisingly high occurrence of these events during N1 and REM sleep (2.23 [plus minus] 0.09 and 2.32 [plus minus] 0.09 events/min, respectively), where SO-spindle coupling would not typically be expected. Combined with the relatively modest SO amplitudes reported (~25 µV, whereas &gt;75 µV would be expected when using mastoids as reference electrodes), this raises the possibility that the parameters used for event detection may not have been conservative enough - or that sleep staging was inaccurately performed. This issue could present a significant challenge, as the fMRI findings are largely dependent on the reliability of these detected events.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Wang et al., examined the brain activity patterns during sleep, especially when locked to those canonical sleep rhythms such as SO, spindle, and their coupling. Analyzing data from a large sample, the authors found significant coupling between spindles and SOs, particularly during the upstate of the SO. Moreover, the authors examined the patterns of whole-brain activity locked to these sleep rhythms. To understand the functional significance of these brain activities, the authors further conducted open-ended cognitive state decoding and found a variety of cognitive processing may be involved during SO-spindle coupling and during other sleep events. The authors next investigated the functional connectivity analyses and found enhanced connectivity between the hippocampus, the thalamus, and the medial PFC. These results reinforced the theoretical model of sleep-dependent memory consolidation, such that SO-spindle coupling is conducive to systems-level memory reactivation and consolidation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>There are obvious strengths in this work, including the large sample size, state-of-the-art neuroimaging and neural oscillation analyses, and the richness of results.</p>

We are delighted that you recognize our advanced analysis methods and rich results of neuroimaging and neural oscillations as well as the large sample size data. In the following sections, we provide detailed responses to each of your comments.

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) A repeating statement in the manuscript is that brain activity could indicate memory reactivation and thus consolidation. This is indeed a highly relevant question that could be informed by the current data/results. However, an inherent weakness of the design is that there is no memory task before and after sleep. Thus, it is difficult (if not impossible) to make a strong argument linking SO/spindle/coupling-locked brain activity with memory reactivation or consolidation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your suggestion regarding the lack of a pre- and post-sleep memory task in our study design. We acknowledge that, in the absence of behavioral measures, it is hard to directly link SO-spindle coupling to memory consolidation in an outcome-driven manner. Our interpretation is instead based on the well-established role of these oscillations in memory processes, as demonstrated in previous studies. We sincerely appreciate this feedback and will adjust our Discussion accordingly to reflect a more precise interpretation of our findings.</p>

<p>(2) Relatedly, to understand the functional implications of the sleep rhythm-locked brain activity, the authors employed the &quot;open-ended cognitive state decoding&quot; method. While this method is interesting, it is rather indirect given that there were no behavioral indices in the manuscript. Thus, discussions based on these analyses are speculative at best. Please either tone down the language or find additional evidence to support these claims.</p>
<p>Moreover, the results from this method are difficult to understand. Figure 3e showed that for all three types of sleep events (SO, spindle, SO-spindle), the same mental states (e.g., working memory, episodic memory, declarative memory) showed opposite directions of activation (left and right panels showed negative and positive activation, respectively). How to interpret these conflicting results? This ambiguity is also reflected by the term used: declarative memory and episodic memories are both indexed in the results. Yet these two processes can be largely overlapped. So which specific memory processes do these brain activity patterns reflect? The Discussion shall discuss these results and the limitations of this method.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your critical assessment of the open-ended cognitive state decoding method and its interpretational challenges. Given the concerns about the indirectness of this approach, we decided to remove its related content and results from Figure 3 in the main text and include it in Supplementary Figure 7.</p>
<p>Due to the complexity of memory-related processes, we acknowledge that distinguishing between episodic and declarative memory based solely on this approach is not straightforward. We will revise the Supplementary Materials to explicitly discuss these limitations and clarify that our findings do not isolate specific cognitive processes but rather suggest general associations with memory-related networks.</p>

<p>“To explore functional relevance, we employed an open-ended cognitive state decoding approach using meta-analytic data (NeuroSynth: Yarkoni et al. (2011)). Although this method usefully generates hypotheses about potential cognitive processes, particularly in the absence of a pre- and post-sleep memory task, it is inherently indirect. Many cognitive terms showed significant associations (16 of 50), such as “episodic memory,” “declarative memory,” and “working memory.” We focused on episodic/declarative memory given the known link with hippocampal reactivation (Diekelmann &amp; Born, 2010; Staresina et al., 2015; Staresina et al., 2023). Nonetheless, these inferences regarding memory reactivation should be interpreted cautiously without direct behavioral measures. Future research incorporating explicit tasks before and after sleep would more rigorously validate these potenial functional claims.”</p>

<p>(3) The coupling strength is somehow inconsistent with prior results (Hahn et al., 2020, eLife, Helfrich et al., 2018, Neuron). Specifically, Helfrich et al. showed that among young adults, the spindle is coupled to the peak of the SO. Here, the authors reported that the spindles were coupled to down-to-up transitions of SO and before the SO peak. It is possible that participants' age may influence the coupling (see Helfrich et al., 2018). Please discuss the findings in the context of previous research on SO-spindle coupling.</p>

<p>We appreciate your concern regarding the temporal characteristics of SO-spindle coupling. We acknowledge that the SO-spindle coupling phase results in our study are not identical to those reported by Hahn et al. (2020); Helfrich et al. (2018). However, these differences may arise due to slight variations in event detection parameters, which can influence the precise phase estimation of coupling. Notably, Hahn et al. (2020) also reported slight discrepancies in their group-level coupling phase results, highlighting that methodological differences can contribute to variability across studies. Furthermore, our findings are consistent with those of Schreiner et al. (2021), further supporting the robustness of our observations.</p>
<p>That said, we acknowledge that our original description of SO-spindle coupling as occurring at the &quot;transition from the lower state to the upper state&quot; was not entirely precise. The -π/2 phase represents the true transition point, while our observed coupling phase is actually closer to the SO peak rather than strictly at the transition. We will revise this statement in the manuscript to ensure clarity and accuracy in describing the coupling phase.</p>
<p>Discussion, Page 16 Lines 283-291</p>
<p>“Our data provide insights into the neurobiological underpinnings of these sleep rhythms. SOs, originating mainly in neocortical areas such as the mPFC, alternate between DOWN- and UP-states. The thalamus generates sleep spindles, which in turn couple with SOs. Our finding that spindle peaks consistently occurred slightly before the UP-state peak of SOs (in 83 out of 107 participants), concurs with prior studies, including Schreiner et al. (2021). Yet it differs from some results suggesting spindles might peak right at the SO UP-state (Hahn et al., 2020; Helfrich et al., 2018). Such discrepancies could arise from differences in detection algorithms, participant age (Helfrich et al., 2018), or subtle variations in cortical-thalamic timing. Nonetheless, these results underscore the importance of coordinated SO-spindle interplay in supporting sleep-dependent processes.”</p>

<p>(4) The discussion is rather superficial with only two pages, without delving into many important arguments regarding the possible functional significance of these results. For example, the author wrote, &quot;This internal processing contrasts with the brain patterns associated with external tasks, such as working memory.&quot; Without any references to working memory, and without delineating why WM is considered as an external task even working memory operations can be internal. Similarly, for the interesting results on SO and reduced DMN activity, the authors wrote &quot;The DMN is typically active during wakeful rest and is associated with self-referential processes like mind-wandering, daydreaming, and task representation (Yeshurun, Nguyen, &amp; Hasson, 2021). Its reduced activity during SOs may signal a shift towards endogenous processes such as memory consolidation.&quot; This argument is flawed. DMN is active during self-referential processing and mind-wandering, i.e., when the brain shifts from external stimuli processing to internal mental processing. During sleep, endogenous memory reactivation and consolidation are also part of the internal mental processing given the lack of external environmental stimulation. So why during SO or during memory consolidation, the DMN activity would be reduced? Were there differences in DMN activity between SO and SO-spindle coupling events?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your concerns regarding the brevity of the discussion and the need for clearer theoretical arguments. We will expand this section to provide more in-depth interpretations of our findings in the context of prior literature. Regarding working memory (WM), we acknowledge that our phrasing was ambiguous. We will modify this statement in the Discussion section.</p>
<p>For the SO-related reduction in DMN activity, we recognize the need for a more precise explanation. This reduced DMN activity may reflect large-scale neural inhibition characteristic of the SO trough. The DMN is typically active during internally oriented cognition (e.g., self-referential processing or mind-wandering) and is suppressed during external stimuli processing (Yeshurun, Nguyen, &amp; Hasson, 2021). It is unlikely, however, that this suppression of DMN during SO events is related to a shift from internal cognition to external responses given it is during deep sleep time. Instead, it could be driven by the inherent rhythmic pattern of SOs, which makes it difficult to separate UP- from DOWN-states (the two temporal regressors were highly correlated, and similar brain activation during SOs events was obtained if modelled at the SO peak instead). Since the amplitude at the SO trough is consistently larger than that at the SO peak, the neural activation we detected may primarily capture the large-scale inhibition from DOWN-state.</p>
<p>To address your final question, we have conducted the additional post hoc comparison of DMN activity between isolated SOs and SO-spindle coupling events. Our results indicate that</p>
<p>DMN activation during SOs was significantly lower than during SO-spindle coupling (<italic>t</italic><sub>(106)</sub> = -4.17, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1e-4). This suggests that SO-spindle coupling may involve distinct neural dynamics that partially re-engage DMN-related processes, possibly reflecting memory-related reactivation. We appreciate your constructive feedback and will integrate these expanded analyses and discussions into our revised manuscript.</p>

<p>“Spindles were correlated with positive activation in the thalamus (ROI analysis, <italic>t</italic><sub>(106)</sub> = 15.39, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1e-4), the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and the putamen, alongside deactivation in the DMN (Fig. 3c).

For more detailed activation patterns, see Table S5-S7.

Since the amplitude at the SO trough is consistently larger than that at the SO peak, the neural activation we detected may primarily capture the large-scale inhibition from DOWN-state. Interestingly, no such DMN reduction was found during SO-spindle coupling, implying that coupling may involve distinct neural dynamics that partially re-engage DMN-related processes, possibly reflecting memory-related reactivation.

<p>“Event-related potentials (ERP) analysis. After completing the detection of each sleep rhythm event, we performed ERP analyses for SOs, spindles, and coupling events in different sleep stages. Specifically, for SO events, we took the trough of the DOWN-state of each SO as the zero-time point, then extracted data in a [-2 s to 2 s] window from the broadband (0.1–30 Hz) EEG and used [-2 s to -0.5 s] for baseline correction; the results were then averaged across 107 subjects (see Fig. S2a). For spindle events, we used the peak of each spindle as the zero-time point and applied the same data extraction window and baseline correction before averaging across 107 subjects (see Fig. S2b). Finally, for SO-spindle coupling events, we followed the same procedure used for SO events (see Fig. 2a, Figs. S3–S4).”</p>

<p>(4) What would happen if more stringent parameters were used for event detection? Would the authors still observe a significant number of SO spindles during N1 and REM? Would this affect the fMRI-related results?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this suggestion. Our methods for detecting SOs, spindles, and their couplings were originally developed for N2 and N3 sleep data, based on the specific characteristics of these stages. These methods are widely recognized in sleep research (Hahn et al., 2020; Helfrich et al., 2019; Helfrich et al., 2018; Ngo, Fell, &amp; Staresina, 2020; Schreiner et al., 2022; Schreiner et al., 2021; Staresina et al., 2015; Staresina et al., 2023). However, because this percentile-based detection approach will inherently identify a certain number of events if applied to other stages (e.g., N1 and REM), the nature of these events in those stages remains unclear compared to N2/N3. We nevertheless identified and reported the detailed descriptive statistics of these sleep rhythms in all sleep stages, under the same operational definitions, both for completeness and as a sanity check. Within the same subject, there should be more SOs, spindles, and their couplings in N2/N3 than in N1 or REM (see also Figure S2-S4, Table S1-S4).</p>
<p>Furthermore, in order to explore the impact of this on our fMRI results, we conducted an additional sensitivity analysis by applying different detection parameters for SOs. Specifically, we adjusted amplitude percentile thresholds for SO detection (the parameter that has the greatest impact on the results). We used the hippocampal activation value during N2&amp;N3 stage SO-spindle coupling as an anchor value and found that when the parameters gradually became stricter, the results were similar to or even better than the current results. However, when we continued to increase the threshold, the results began to gradually decrease until the threshold was increased to 80%, and the results were no longer significant. This indicates that our results are robust within a specific range of parameters, but as the threshold increases, the number of trials decreases, ultimately weakening the statistical power of the fMRI analysis.</p>
<p>Thank you again for your suggestions on sleep rhythm event detection. We will add the results in Supplementary and revise our manuscript accordingly.</p>
