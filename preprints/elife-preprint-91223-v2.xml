<title>Abstract</title><p>Telomeres, which are chromosomal end structures, play a crucial role in maintaining genome stability and integrity in eukaryotes. In the baker’s yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the X- and Y’-elements are subtelomeric repetitive sequences found in all thirty-two and seventeen telomeres, respectively. While the Y’-elements serve as a backup for telomere functions in cells lacking telomerase, the function of the X-elements remains unclear. This study utilized the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strain SY12, which has three chromosomes and six telomeres, to investigate the role of X-elements (as well as Y’-elements) in telomere maintenance. Deletion of Y’-elements (SY12<sup>YΔ</sup>), X-elements (SY12<sup>XYΔ+Y</sup>), or both X- and Y’-elements (SY12<sup>XYΔ</sup>) did not impact the length of the terminal TG<sub>1-3</sub> tracks or telomere silencing. However, inactivation of telomerase in SY12<sub>YΔ</sub>, SY12<sub>XYΔ+Y</sub>, and SY12<sub>XYΔ</sub> cells resulted in cellular senescence and the generation of survivors. These survivors either maintained their telomeres through homologous recombination-dependent TG<sub>1-3</sub> track elongation or underwent microhomology-mediated intra-chromosomal end-to-end joining. Our findings indicate the non-essential role of subtelomeric X- and Y’-elements in telomere regulation in both telomerase-proficient and telomerase-null cells and suggest that these elements may represent remnants of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome evolution. Furthermore, strains with fewer or no subtelomeric elements exhibit more concise telomere structures and offer potential models for future studies in telomere biology.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Telomeres, specialized nucleoprotein structures located at the end of linear chromosomes in eukaryotic cells, are crucial for maintaining genomic stability and protecting chromosomal ends from being perceived as DNA breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Wellinger and Zakian, 2012</xref>). In the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, telomeric DNA consists of approximately ∼300±75 base pairs of C<sub>1-3</sub>A/TG<sub>1-3</sub> repeats with a 3’ G-rich single-stranded overhang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Wellinger and Zakian, 2012</xref>). Adjacent to the telomeric TG<sub>1-3</sub> repeats, there are subtelomeric repeat elements known as X- and Y’-elements, which vary between telomeres, as well as strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Chan and Tye, 1983a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Louis, 1995</xref>). The Y’-elements, immediately internal to the telomeric repeats, are present as a tandem array of zero to four copies, they fall into two major size classes, 6.7 kb Y’-long (Y’-L) and 5.2 kb Y’-short (Y’-S) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Chan and Tye, 1983a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">b</xref>). Y’-elements are highly conserved with only ∼2% divergence between strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Louis and Haber, 1992</xref>). One entire Y’-element contains two large open reading frames (ORFs), an ARS consensus sequence (ACS) and a STAR element (Subtelomeric anti-silencing regions) consisting of binding sites for Tbf1 and Reb1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Chan and Tye, 1983a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fourel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Louis and Haber, 1992</xref>). The X-element, a much more heterogeneous sequence abutting Y’-elements or telomeric repeats, contains the 473 bp “core X” sequence and the subtelomeric repeats (STRs) A, B, C and D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Louis and Haber, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Louis et al., 1994</xref>). The STRs are found in some chromosome ends, while the “core X” sequence is shared by all chromosomes. Recent long-read sequencing shows that subtelomerice regions display high evolutionary plasticity and are rich in a varies of structure variants such as reciprocal translocations, transpositions, novel insertions, deletions and duplications (O’Donnell et al., 2023).</p>
<p>Telomeric DNA elongation primarily relies on telomerase, an enzyme comprising a reverse transcriptase, an RNA component, and accessory factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Palm and de Lange, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Wellinger and Zakian, 2012</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the telomerase holoenzyme consists of the reverse transcriptase Est2, the RNA template TLC1, and accessory factors Est1, Est3, Pop1/Pop6/Pop7 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lemieux et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lendvay et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lundblad and Szostak, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Singer and Gottschling, 1994</xref>). In the absence of telomerase, homologous recombination can take place to replicate telomeres, resulting in telomerase-deficient “survivors” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lundblad and Blackburn, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Teng and Zakian, 1999</xref>). These survivors are broadly categorized into Type I and Type II based on distinct telomere structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lundblad and Blackburn, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Teng and Zakian, 1999</xref>). Type I survivors possess tandem amplified Y’-elements (both Y’-L and Y’-S) and very short TG<sub>1-3</sub> tracts, indicating that Y’-elements serve as substrates for homologous recombination. Type II survivors display long heterogeneous TG<sub>1-3</sub> tracts. On solid medium, approximately 90% of the survivors are Type I, while 10% are Type II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Teng et al., 2000</xref>). However, in liquid culture, Type II survivors grow faster and eventually dominate the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Teng and Zakian, 1999</xref>). The proteins required for Type I and Type II survivor formation appear to be different. Type I survivors depend on Rad51, Rad54, Rad55, Rad57, and Pif1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Le et al., 1999</xref>). while the formation of Type II survivors requires the Mre11/Rad50/Xrs2 (MRX) complex, KEOPS complex, Rad59, Sgs1, and Rad6, most of which are critical for DNA resection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">He et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Johnson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Le et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Louis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Nicolette et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Teng et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Wellinger and Zakian, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). Although Type I and Type II pathway are working independently, Kockler et al. found that the proteins involved in each pathway (Rad51, Rad59/Rad52) can work together via two sequential steps and contribute to a unified ALT (Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres) processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kockler et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>The amplification of Y’-elements represents a significant feature of telomere recombination in telomerase-null Type I survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lundblad and Blackburn, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Teng and Zakian, 1999</xref>), and as a result, extrachromosomal Y’ circular DNAs have been observed in Type I survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Larrivee and Wellinger, 2006</xref>). Additionally, Y’-element acquisition has been observed in the initiation step of pre-senescence, suggesting a potential role for Y’-elements in Type II survivor formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Churikov et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, Y’-elements are mobilized through a transposition-like RNA-mediated process involving Ty1 activity in telomerase-negative survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Maxwell et al., 2004</xref>). Y’-elements also express potential DNA helicases, Y’-Help, in telomerase-null survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Yamada et al., 1998</xref>). Thus, Y’-elements play a significant role as donors in homologous recombination-mediated telomere maintenance. The functions of X- elements, on the other hand, are less clear. The “core X” sequence consists of an ACS element and, in most cases, an Abf1 binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Louis, 1995</xref>), and acts as a protosilencer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lebrun et al., 2001</xref>). In contrast, STRs and Y’-STAR possess anti-silencing properties that limit the spreading of heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fourel et al., 1999</xref>). Interestingly, a previous study demonstrated that telomeres with Χ-only ends (containing only X-elements) were more efficiently elongated compared to those with X-Y’ ends (containing both X- and Y’-elements) in <italic>tel1</italic>Δ <italic>rif1</italic>Δ strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Craven and Petes, 1999</xref>). Moreover, subtelomeric elements (including X-elements) and associated factors like Reb1 and Tbf1 antagonize telomere anchoring at the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hediger et al., 2006</xref>). However, considering that X-elements are present in all telomeres while Y’-elements are not, the specific functions of X- and Y’-elements in genome integrity after the evolution of telomerase have long been a subject of questioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Jager and Philippsen, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Zakian and Blanton, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>In wild-type yeast strain BY4742, there are eight Y’-S and eleven Y’-L elements at the thirty-two telomere loci. Additionally, each telomere locus contains one X-element. The genetic deletion of all X- and Y’-elements to directly investigate the roles of X- and Y’-elements in genome integrity is a challenging and complex task. In this study, we utilized recently reported chromosome-fused budding yeast strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Shao et al., 2018</xref>) to eliminate both X- and Y’-elements completely. This approach allows us to reinvestigate the roles of X- and Y’-elements at telomeres.</p>

<title>Telomere recombination in telomerase-null chromosome-fused yeast strains SY1 to SY12</title>
<p>The functions of Y’-elements have been previously linked to telomere recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Churikov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Larrivee and Wellinger, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lundblad and Blackburn, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Teng and Zakian, 1999</xref>). To further investigate the role of Y’-elements in telomere recombination, we utilized a series of chromosome-fused budding yeast strains derived from the wild-type BY4742 strain, including SY1, SY3, SY5, SY7, SY8, SY9, SY10, SY11, SY12 and SY13 (also referred to as SYn for convenience) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Shao et al., 2018</xref>). The remaining subtelomeric elements in SY8 to SY13 strains are listed in supplementary file 2. We excluded SY14 from these experiments since the presence of circular chromosome was prominent in SY14 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ cells (one fused chromosome) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wu et al., 2020</xref>), We generated haploid SYn <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ <italic>TLC1</italic> strains by deleting the chromosomal copy of the <italic>TLC1</italic> gene and introducing a plasmid-borne wild-type <italic>TLC1</italic> gene (pRS316-<italic>TLC1</italic>). Clones that lost the pRS316-<italic>TLC1</italic> plasmid (containing the <italic>URA3</italic> marker) were identified upon counter-selection on 5’-fluoroorotic-acid (5’-FOA) plates and were subsequently re-streaked on YPD plates for at least 9 cycles for survivor formation (referred to as the “multiple-colony streaking assay” in Methods). The telomere patterns of the survivors were then determined through Southern blotting assay (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-D</xref>).</p>

<p>The canonical telomerase-independent survivors can be broadly categorized into two types: Type I and Type II survivors, based on the restriction fragments generated after XhoI digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lundblad and Blackburn, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Teng and Zakian, 1999</xref>). Type I survivors exhibit tandem duplication of Y’-elements and very short TG<sub>1-3</sub> tracts, while Type II survivors contain long heterogeneous TG<sub>1-3</sub> sequences. Consistent with previous reports, BY4742 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ cells generated both Type I (subtelomeric Y’-element recombination) and Type II (TG<sub>1-3</sub> recombination) survivors (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hu et al., 2013</xref>). Intriguingly, as the number of chromosomes decreased, the frequency of Type II survivors gradually diminished, while Type I survivors became the predominant type (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-D</xref>). Furthermore, non-canonical survivors with distinct patterns from Type I or Type II emerged in SY9 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ (six chromosomes), SY10 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ (five chromosomes), SY11 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ (four chromosomes), SY12 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ (three chromosomes) and SY13 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ (two chromosomes) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref> indicated by triangles at the bottom of the panels). Notably, the Y’-telomere band of ∼1.2 kb was not detected in two clones of SY11 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ cells (clones 2 and 5), the majority of clones of SY12 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ cells (except for clones 9, 14, and 15), and the majority of clones of SY13 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ cells (except for clones 1, 4, 8 and10) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). We speculate that either the Y’-elements have eroded or the chromosomal ends containing Y’-elements have fused with other ends in these non-canonical survivors. These findings suggest that the ratio of survivor types is influenced by the number of chromosomes.</p>

<title>Characterizing the survivor pattern in SY12</title>
<p>To determine the chromosomal end structures of the non-canonical survivors shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, we selected SY12 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ survivors for further analysis. In the SY12 strain, there are six telomeres corresponding to the native chromosomes I-L, X-R, XIII-L, XI-R, XVI-L, and XIV-R. We employed Southern blotting after NdeI digestion to validate the telomere and subtelomere structures (<xref rid="figs2-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The results revealed that, in the SY12 strain used in our study, only the XVI-L telomere contained a single copy of the Y’-element, while all telomeres harbored X-elements (<xref rid="figs2-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). For simplicity, we referred to the chromosomes containing the original I, XIII, and XVI as chromosome 1, 2, and 3, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, left panel).</p>

<p>We conducted a re-examination of telomere recombination upon telomerase inactivation in SY12 cells. Deletion of <italic>TLC1</italic> in SY12 cells resulted in cell senescence, and different clones recovered at various time points in liquid medium (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Telomere Southern blotting analysis showed progressive shrinking of the telomeric XhoI fragments over time, and TG<sub>1-3</sub> recombination occurred to maintain telomeres (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Since the liquid culture contained a mixture of different colonies, we employed a multiple-colony streaking assay and Southern blotting analysis to examine the telomere patterns of fifty independent SY12 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ survivors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref rid="figs2-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Among these survivors, eight clones (labeled in red) exhibited the typical Type I telomere structure characterized by Y’-element amplification (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). This was confirmed by Southern blotting analysis using a Y’ probe (<xref rid="figs2-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2— figure supplement 2</xref>). The emerging of Type I survivor in SY12 strain which only contain one Y’ element indicates that multiple Y’-elements in tandem are not strictly required for Type I formation. Clone 1 (labeled in orange) displayed heterogeneous telomeric TG<sub>1-3</sub> tracts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), indicating it was a Type II survivor. This was further confirmed by restoring the telomere length to the level observed in SY12 cells through the re-introduction of the <italic>TLC1</italic> gene into one representative clone (named SY12 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ-T1) and subsequent passaging on yeast complete (YC) medium lacking uracil (Ura-) for 20 cycles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>).</p>
<p>Notably, ten of the examined clones (labeled in blue) displayed no telomere signals associated with canonical Type I or Type II survivors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Their hybridization patterns were strikingly similar to those of SY14 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wu et al., 2020</xref>), which survived through intra-chromosomal circularization. To investigate whether the three chromosomes in these SY12 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ survivors had undergone intra-chromosomal fusions, we selected a clone, namely SY12 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ-C1 and performed PCR-mapping assay to determine the erosion points of each chromosome end, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). A PCR product of the predicted length would be obtained only if the corresponding chromosome region was intact. The PCR-mapping assay precisely identified the borders of telomere erosion for the three chromosomes in SY12 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ-C1 cells. For chromosome 1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, left panel), the chromosome regions approximately 3.3 kb and 1.9 kb proximal to telomere I-L and X-R, respectively, had been lost (<xref rid="figs2-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> and supplementary file 3). Regarding chromosome 2, the terminal ∼3.8 kb of telomere XIII-L and ∼2.5 kb of telomere XI-R remained intact (<xref rid="figs2-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2— figure supplement 3</xref> and supplementary file 3). For chromosome 3, the terminal ∼0.1 kb of telomere XVI-L was intact, while the terminal ∼3.4 kb of telomere XIV-R was preserved (<xref rid="figs2-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> and supplementary file 3). To confirm the chromosome fusion events, we performed PCR-sequencing analysis. If a given pair of primers, oriented to different chromosome ends, produced PCR products, it indicated that the corresponding arms had fused. The results revealed that the three chromosomes in SY12 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ-C1 cells had undergone intra-chromosomal fusions through microhomology sequences, resulting in the formation of circular chromosomes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref> and supplementary file 3). Notably, the fusion junctions of the three chromosomes in SY12 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ-C1 cells differed in nucleotide sequence and length (22 bp, 8 bp, and 5 bp in chromosomes 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Moreover, the sequences involved in the ends-fusion were not perfectly complementary (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). For example, the fusion sequence of chromosome 3 was 5 bp long and contained one mismatch. To further verify the chromosome structure in the “circular survivors” SY12 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ-C1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2F</xref>), we performed the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis. Control strains included SY12 (three linear chromosomes) and SY15 (one circular chromosome). The PFGE result confirmed that like the single circular chromosome in SY15 cells, the circular chromosome in the SY12 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ-C1 survivors couldn’t enter the gel, while the linear chromosomes in SY12 were separated into distinct bands, as expected (<xref rid="figs2-4" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Thus, the survivors shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, which displayed an identical hybridization pattern to the SY12 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ-C1 clone, were all likely “circular survivors”. Consistently, the telomere signals detected in the SY12 strain were not observed in the SY12 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ-C1 survivor after reintroducing a plasmid-borne wild-type <italic>TLC1</italic> gene (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>).</p>
<p>Twelve clones of SY12 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ survivors (labeled in green, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>) exhibited no Y’-telomere signals compared to SY12 cells but displayed different lengths of TG<sub>1-3</sub> tracts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Due to their non-canonical telomere structures, characterized by the absence of both Y’ amplification and superlong TG<sub>1-3</sub> sequences, we designated these SY12 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ survivors (labeled in green, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>) as Type X. In Type X survivors, the DNA bands with sizes of approximately 2.3 kb, 5.1 kb, 15.3 kb, 18.5 kb, and 21.9 kb were roughly comparable to the telomeres of XI-R, X-R, I-L, XIII-L, and XIV-R in SY12 cells (indicated on the left in the panel). The newly emerged band at approximately 4.3 kb likely originated from the XVI-L telomere (indicated by the red arrow on the right in the panel) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), where the Y’-elements had been eroded, leaving only the TG<sub>1-3</sub> tracts at the very ends (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, right panel). To verify this notion, we reintroduced the <italic>TLC1</italic> gene into one representative clone (named SY12 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ-X1) and examined the telomere length. As expected, the telomeres of X-R and XI-R were restored to the lengths observed in wild-type SY12 cells, and accordingly, the newly emerged 4.3 kb band was also elongated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). Given that the restriction fragments of telomeres I-L (15.3 kb), XIII-L (18.5 kb), and XIV-R (21.9 kb) were quite long, detecting minor changes in telomere length was challenging under the assay conditions of Southern blotting. To determine the chromosomal end structure of the Type X survivor, we randomly selected a typical Type X survivor, and performed PCR-sequencing analysis. The results revealed the intact chromosome ends for I-L, X-R, XIII-L, XI-R, and XIV-R, albeit with some mismatches compared with the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> S288C genome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yeastgenome.org/">http://www.yeastgenome.org/</ext-link>), which possibly arising from recombination events that occurred during survivor formation. Notably, the sequence of the Y’-element in XVI-L could not be detected, while the X-element remained intact (<xref rid="figs2-5" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). These data indicated that Type X survivors possess linear chromosomes with telomeres terminating in TG<sub>1-3</sub> repeats, while the Y’-element has been eroded (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, right panel). Consistently, no Y’ signals were detected in these twelve Type X survivors (labeled in green, <xref rid="figs2-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that the Y’-element has not been translocated to other telomeres and is not essential for yeast cell viability. In addition to the aforementioned Type I, Type II, circular, and Type X survivors, there were some “atypical” clones (labeled in black, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>) exhibiting non-uniform telomere patterns. We hypothesized that combinations of diverse mechanisms were occurring within each survivor. For instance, in the case of two survivors (clones 9 and 18, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>) in which only one hybridization signal could be detected, pointing to the possibility that two chromosomes underwent intra-chromosomal fusions while one retained its ends through TG<sub>1-3</sub> recombination. However, the sizes of the two telomere restriction fragments on the linear chromosome were too close to be distinguished and separated, resulting in only one hybridization signal. Alternatively, it is also plausible that three chromosomes experienced intra-chromosomal fusions, with one fusion point containing TG<sub>1-3</sub> repeats. Another intriguing observation pertains to SY12 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ clones 4, 5, 7, 15, and 43, which exhibited significant amplification of TG<sub>1-3</sub> sequences, and the telomeres of these survivors did not resolve into distinct bands (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). We hypothesize that the observed telomere patterns in these atypical survivors could be attributed to extensive TG<sub>1-3</sub> recombination. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of coexisting diverse mechanisms within a survivor, such as telomere elongation through TG<sub>1-3</sub> amplification, as well as intra-and inter-chromosomal fusions. All of these mechanisms may contribute to the maintenance of chromosome ends in these clones.</p>
<p>To further determine the genetic requirements for survivors in SY12, we constructed the SY12 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ <italic>rad52</italic>Δ pRS316-<italic>TLC1</italic> strain. The plasmid-borne wild-type <italic>TLC1</italic> gene (pRS316-<italic>TLC1</italic>) was counter-selected on 5’-FOA plates. SY12 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ <italic>rad52</italic>Δ cells were measured by the cell viability assay (see Materials and methods). The results showed double deletion of <italic>TLC1</italic> and <italic>RAD52</italic> in SY12 strain could slightly accelerate senescence, and SY12 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ <italic>rad52</italic>Δ survivors could be generated but took much longer to recover than the SY12 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ survivors (<xref rid="figs2-6" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 6A</xref>), suggesting that Rad52 is not strictly required for survivor generation in the SY12 strain in liquid. We also passaged SY12 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ <italic>rad52</italic>Δ cells on solid medium until survivor emerged. Southern blotting of twenty-five clones revealed that neither Type I nor Type II survivors were found, and instead circular survivors except clone 20 were obtained (labeled in blue, <xref rid="figs2-6" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 6B</xref>). We conclude that a combination of diverse mechanisms contributes to the formation of atypical survivors in the SY12 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ <italic>rad52</italic>Δ strain, and the formation of circular survivors are independent of <italic>RAD52</italic> mediate pathway. Since no Type X survivor was detected in SY12 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ <italic>rad52</italic>Δ strain, we constructed the SY12 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ <italic>rad51</italic>Δ pRS316-<italic>TLC1</italic> and SY12 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ <italic>rad50</italic>Δ pRS316-<italic>TLC1</italic> strain to investigate on which pathway the formation of the Type X survivor relied. After counter-selected on 5’-FOA plates, cells were passaged on solid medium until survivor arose. Southern blotting assay indicated the emergence of Type X survivors even in the absence of Rad51 (labeled in green, clone 2, 5, 11 and 18, <xref rid="figs2-7" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 7A</xref>). In contrast, no Type X survivor was detected in the SY12 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ <italic>rad50</italic>Δ strain (<xref rid="figs2-7" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 7B</xref>). These data suggest that the formation of the Type X survivor depends on Rad50-mediated Type II pathway.</p>
<p>Taken together, our results indicate that telomerase inactivation in SY12 cells leads to cell senescence and the emergence of survivors with diverse telomere patterns, including Y’ amplification (Type I), elongated TG<sub>1-3</sub> tracts (Type II), intra-chromosomal end-to-end joining (circular), Y’ loss (Type X), and inter-chromosomal fusions (uncharacterized).</p>

<title>Deletion of all of the X- and Y’-elements in the SY12 strain</title>
<p>We aimed to determine whether the subtelomeric X-elements are dispensable or not. In the SY12 strain, there are six X-elements distributed among six telomeres (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, left panel). To precisely delete all X- and Y’-elements in SY12 strains, we employed a method that combines the efficient CRISPR-Cas9 cleavage system with the robust homologous recombination activity of yeast, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Shao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Shao et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, the Cas9 nuclease cleaved the unique DNA sequences adjacent to the subtelomeric region (site S1) with the guidance of gRNA1. The resulting chromosome break was repaired through homologous recombination (HR) using the provided chromosome ends which excluding the X- and Y’-elements. Subsequently, the <italic>URA3</italic> marker and the guide RNA expression plasmid (pgRNA) were eliminated by inducing gRNA2 expression on pCas9 using galactose (<xref rid="figs3-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This approach allowed us to initially delete the Y’- element and X-element in XVI-L, generating the SY12<sub>YΔ</sub> strain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and supplementary file 4). Subsequently, through five successive rounds of deletions, we removed all remaining X- elements, resulting in the SY12<sup>XYΔ</sup> strain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and supplementary file 4). To confirm the series of deletions, we performed PCR analysis using a primer located within the deletion region and another primer annealing upstream of the region (indicated by purple arrows in <xref rid="figs3-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3— figure supplement 1</xref>). This analysis verified the complete deletion of the subtelomeric X- and Y’-elements (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, rows 3 to 7). Additionally, we conducted a separate PCR analysis using primers specific to either X- or Y’-elements, which confirmed the absence of both X- and Y’- elements in the SY12<sup>XYΔ</sup> strain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, rows 8). Subsequently, we inserted a Y’-long element (cloned from the native XVI-L sequence, which does not contain the centromere-proximal short telomere sequence) into the left arm of chromosome 3 in the SY12<sup>XYΔ</sup> strain, resulting in the SY12<sup>XYΔ+Y</sup> strain containing a single Y’-element but no X-element (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and supplementary file 4). The successful insertion was confirmed by PCR analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, lane 9).</p>

<title>Subtelomeric X- and Y’-elements are dispensable for cell proliferation, various stress responses, telomere length control and telomere silencing</title>
<p>The SY12<sup>YΔ</sup>, SY12<sup>XYΔ</sup>, and SY12<sup>XYΔ+Y</sup> cells, cultured in YPD medium at 30°C, exhibited the same cell morphology as the parental strains SY12 and BY4742 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). To assess the stability of their genomes, we restreaked several clones of SY12<sup>YΔ</sup>, SY12<sup>XYΔ</sup>, and SY12<sup>XYΔ+Y</sup> strains on YPD plates for a total of 61 times at two-day intervals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Similar to the SY12 strain, the progeny colonies of SY12<sup>YΔ</sup>, SY12<sup>XYΔ</sup>, and SY12<sup>XYΔ+Y</sup> grew robustly on solid medium (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Moreover, SY12<sup>YΔ</sup>, SY12<sup>XYΔ</sup>, and SY12<sup>XYΔ+Y</sup> cells exhibited growth rates comparable to those of SY12 and BY4742 cells in liquid medium (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). FACS analysis revealed that SY12<sup>YΔ</sup>, SY12<sup>XYΔ</sup>, and SY12<sup>XYΔ+Y</sup> had the same 1C and 2C DNA content as wild-type cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>), indicating that the X- and Y’-elements are not necessary for cell proliferation under normal conditions. Additionally, the growth of SY12<sup>YΔ</sup>, SY12<sup>XYΔ</sup>, and SY12<sup>XYΔ+Y</sup> cells at different temperatures (24 and 37°C) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>, upper panel) closely resembled that of SY12 and BY4742 cells. Furthermore, SY12<sup>YΔ</sup>, SY12<sup>XYΔ</sup>, SY12<sup>XYΔ+Y</sup>, SY12, and BY4742 cells exhibited similar sensitivities to various genotoxic agents, including hydroxyurea (HU), camptothecin (CPT), and methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>, lower panel). These results indicate that the X- and Y’-elements are dispensable for cellular responses to cold or heat treatment and DNA damage challenges, consistent with a recent study of “synthetic yeast genome project”, namely SC2.0, showing that thousands of genome-wide edits, including the deletion of subtelomeric repetitive sequences, deletion of introns, and relocation of tRNAs genes, yielded a strain that displays comparable growth with wild type strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Richardson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Zhao et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we examined the effects of X- and Y’-element elimination on telomeres. Southern blotting assay revealed that SY12<sup>YΔ</sup>, SY12<sup>XYΔ</sup>, and SY12<sup>XYΔ+Y</sup> cells maintained stable telomeres at a length of approximately 300 bp, comparable to that in SY12 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), indicating that the X- and Y’-elements are not required for telomere length regulation. To determine whether the deletion of X- and Y’-elements abolishes telomere silencing, we constructed haploid strains of SY12<sup>YΔ</sup> <italic>sir2</italic>Δ, SY12<sup>XYΔ</sup> <italic>sir2</italic>Δ, SY12<sup>XYΔ+Y</sup> <italic>sir2</italic>Δ, SY12 <italic>sir2</italic>Δ, and BY4742 <italic>sir2</italic>Δ. We then performed real-time RT-PCR to quantify the expression of the <italic>MPH3</italic> and <italic>HSP32</italic> genes, located near the subtelomeric region of X-R (X-only end) and XVI-L (X-Y’ end), respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>).

These findings align with previous studies showing that telomeres without an X- or Y’-element exert a position effect on the transcription of neighboring genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aparicio et al., 1991</xref>), and that X- and Y’-elements function as modulators of TPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fourel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lebrun et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ottaviani et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Y’-elements are not strictly required for the formation of survivors</title>
<p>The BY4742 strain harbors nineteen Y’-elements distributed among seventeen telomere loci. Numerous studies have emphasized the significance of Y’-elements in telomere recombination. For instance, Type I survivors exhibit significant amplification of Y’-elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lundblad and Blackburn, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Teng and Zakian, 1999</xref>) and survivors show a marked induction of the potential DNA helicase Y’-Help1 encoded by Y’-elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Yamada et al., 1998</xref>). Additionally, the acquisition of Y’-elements by short telomeres delays the onset of senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Churikov et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate the requirement of Y’-elements in survivor formation, we deleted <italic>TLC1</italic> in SY12<sup>YΔ</sup> cells and conducted a cell viability assay. The results demonstrated that three individual colonies underwent senescence and subsequently recovered at different passages in liquid media (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Further analysis through Southern blotting revealed that the telomeres of SY12<sup>YΔ</sup> <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ cells underwent progressive shortening with each passage until reaching critically short lengths. Subsequently, TG<sub>1-3</sub> recombination occurred, leading to abrupt telomere elongation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we examined the telomere patterns of fifty independent SY12<sup>YΔ</sup> <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ survivors using a multiple-colony streaking assay and Southern blotting analysis. Out of the fifty clones analyzed, no Type I survivors were detected due to the deletion of Y’-elements in SY12<sup>YΔ</sup> strain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Two clones (labeled in orange, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>) displayed heterogeneous telomere tracts. Reintroduction of <italic>TLC1</italic> into a representative clone (named SY12<sup>YΔ</sup> <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ-T1) resulted in telomere length restoration similar to SY12<sup>YΔ</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>), indicating their classification as Type II survivors. Twenty-six clones (labeled in blue, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>) exhibited patterns identical to that of the SY12 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ-C1 cell (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Further mapping of erosion borders and sequencing of fusion junctions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref rid="figs5-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, and supplementary file 3) confirmed that three chromosomes from a randomly selected clone (named SY12<sup>YΔ</sup> <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ-C1) underwent intra-chromosomal fusions mediated by microhomology sequences. The erosion sites and fusion sequences differed from those observed in SY12 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ-C1 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), suggesting the stochastic nature of chromosomal circularization. As expected, the telomere Southern blotting pattern (XhoI digestion) of the SY12<sup>YΔ</sup> <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ-C1 survivor remained unchanged following telomerase reintroduction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). Further PFGE analysis confirmed that the chromosomes in SY12<sup>YΔ</sup> <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ-C1 were circulated (<xref rid="figs2-4" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Additionally, “atypical” survivors similar to those observed in SY12 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>) were also seen (labeled in black, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Further deletion of <italic>RAD52</italic> in the SY12<sup>YΔ</sup> <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ cells affected, but did not eliminate, survivor generation (<xref rid="figs5-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Southern blotting assay confirmed that most of the recovered clones were circular survivors, and two were atypical survivors (clone 9 and 16, labeled in black, <xref rid="figs5-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). These data showed that atypical survivors and circular survivors still emerged when Rad52 pathway was repressed, indicating that the formation of them does not strictly rely on the homologous recombination. Overall, these findings indicate that Y’-elements are not strictly required for Type II survivor formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Churikov et al., 2014</xref>).</p>

<p>Among the SY12<sup>XYΔ+Y</sup> survivors analyzed, twenty-two clones underwent chromosomal circularization (labeled in blue, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). We randomly selected a clone named SY12<sup>XYΔ+Y</sup> <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ-C1, and the results of erosion-border mapping and fusion junction sequencing showed that it had undergone intra-chromosomal fusions mediated by microhomology sequences (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref rid="figs6-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, and supplementary file 3). Subsequently, Southern blotting revealed that the chromosome structure of SY12<sup>XYΔ+Y</sup> <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ-C1 remained unchanged after <italic>TLC1</italic> reintroduction (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>), and PFGE analysis confirmed the circular chromosome structure in SY12<sup>XYΔ+Y</sup> <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ-C1 (<xref rid="figs2-4" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Additionally, seven clones utilized the Type II recombination pathway and exhibited heterogeneous telomeric TG<sub>1-3</sub> tracts (labeled in orange, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Reintroduction of <italic>TLC1</italic> into a representative clone (named SY12<sup>XYΔ+Y</sup> <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ-T1) restored the telomere length to normal (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). These findings indicate that the majority of cells underwent intra-chromosomal circularization or TG<sub>1-3</sub> recombination. While even though there is a Y’-element, no Type I survivors were generated in SY12<sup>XYΔ+Y</sup> <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ survivors (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). We speculated that the short TG<sub>1-3</sub> repeats located centromere-proximal to the Y’-elements play a crucial role in strand invasion and subsequent Y’-recombination. This speculation is consistent with a previous report stating that Type I events are virtually absent in the yeast strain Y55, which lacks TG<sub>1-3</sub> repeats centromere-proximal to the Y’-element (Louis, <sup>2</sup>00<sup>1</sup>). We also observed some clones displayed non-canonical telomere signals like SY12 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ “atypical” survivors (labeled in black, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Overall, these data suggest that X-elements are not strictly necessary for survivor formation.</p>
<p>Among the SY12<sup>XYΔ</sup> survivors, twenty-four displayed a “circular survivor” pattern (labeled in blue, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Additional PCR-sequencing assays and PFGE analysis of the SY12<sup>XYΔ</sup> <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ-C1 cells confirmed the occurrence of intra-chromosomal fusions mediated by microhomology sequences (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref rid="figs6-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref rid="figs2-4" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>, and supplementary file 3). Four of fifty survivors harbored Type II telomere structure (labeled in orange, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Reintroduction of <italic>TLC1</italic> into a representative clone named SY12<sup>XYΔ</sup> <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ-T1 could restore its telomere length to WT level (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). Some of the survivors (labeled in black, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>) were likely “atypical” survivor that were difficult to characterize. Like in SY12 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ cells, Rad52 is not strictly required for the formation of circular survivors and atypical survivors in SY12 <sup>XYΔ</sup> <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ <italic>rad52</italic>Δ and SY12 <sup>XYΔ+Y</sup> <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ <italic>rad52</italic>Δ strains (<xref rid="figs6-4" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 4A</xref> and B). Collectively, the aforementioned data suggest that X-elements, as well as Y’-elements, are not essential for the generation of Type II survivors.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The wild-type yeast strain BY4742, commonly used in laboratories, possesses nineteen Y’-elements at seventeen telomere loci and thirty-two X-elements at thirty-two telomere loci. This abundance of Y’-elements and X-elements poses challenges for loss-of-function studies, highlighting the need for a strain lacking all Y’-elements and X-elements. Fortunately, we have previously constructed the single-chromosome yeast strain SY14, which contains only one copy of Y’-element and two copies of X-element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Shao et al., 2018</xref>), could have been an ideal tool. However, the telomerase-null survivors of SY14 mainly bypassed senescence through chromosomal circularization, providing limited insights into the roles of Y’-and X-elements in telomere maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, in this study, we employed the SY12 strain, which has three chromosomes, to investigate the functions of Y’- and X-elements at telomeres (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, left panel).</p>
<p>We constructed the SY12<sup>YΔ</sup>, SY12<sup>XYΔ+Y</sup>, and SY12<sup>XYΔ</sup> strains, which lack the Y’-element, X- elements, and both X- and Y’-elements, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Surprisingly, the SY12<sup>YΔ</sup>, SY12<sup>XYΔ</sup>, and SY12<sup>XYΔ+Y</sup> strains exhibited minimal defects in cell proliferation, genotoxic sensitivity, and telomere homeostasis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). These results demonstrate, for the first time, that both X- and Y’-elements are dispensable for cellular functions. Thus, the SY12<sup>YΔ</sup>, SY12<sup>XYΔ</sup>, and SY12<sup>XYΔ+Y</sup> strains established in this study, with their simplified telomere structures, are valuable resources for telomere biology research.</p>
<p>Subtelomeric regions are known to be highly variable and often contain species-specific homologous DNA sequences. In the case of fission yeast, subtelomeric regions consist of subtelomeric homologous (SH) and telomere-distal sequences. Previous studies have shown that subtelomeric homologous sequences in fission yeast do not significantly impact telomere length, mitotic cell growth, or stress responses. However, they do play a role in buffering against the spreading of silencing signals from the telomere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tashiro et al., 2017</xref>). Though the “core X” sequence acts as a protosilencer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lebrun et al., 2001</xref>), the X-STRs and Y’-STAR possess anti-silencing properties that limit the spreading of heterochromatin in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fourel et al., 1999</xref>), the telomere position effect remains effective in the strains that lack both X- and Y’- elements (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Given the remarkable differences in both sequence and size between the subtelomeric regions of budding yeast and fission yeast, it is difficult to compare the extent to which subtelomeric elements affect telomere silencing.</p>
<p>Amplification of Y’-element(s) is a characteristic feature of canonical Type I survivors. Type I survivor emerged in SY12 strain indicating that multiple Y’-elements in tandem is not strictly required for type I recombination (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Interestingly, the telomerase-null SY12<sup>YΔ</sup> and SY12<sup>XYΔ</sup> cells, lacking Y’-elements, failed to generate Type I survivors but could generate Type II survivors, indicating that the acquisition of Y’-elements is not a prerequisite for Type II survivor formation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). These observations support the notion that Type I and Type II survivors form independently, although both may utilize a common alternative telomere-lengthening pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kockler et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, a subset of SY12 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ, SY12<sup>YΔ</sup> <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ, SY12<sup>XYΔ+Y</sup> <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ, and SY12<sup>XYΔ</sup> <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ cells could escape senescence and become survivors through microhomology-mediated intra-chromosomal end-to-end fusion (chromosome circularization) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>, labeled in blue). Notably, the survivors with all circular chromosomes were readily recovered from the telomerase-null SY11 to SY14, but not SY1 to SY10 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Several reasons could account for this. First, a smaller number of telomeres provides fewer recombination donors and acceptors, resulting in less efficient inter-chromosomal homologous recombination (e.g., TG<sub>1-3</sub> tracts recombination or Y’-element acquisition). Second, the continuously shortened telomeres of linear chromosomes may trigger another round of senescence, while survivors with circular chromosomes do not encounter end-replication problems and therefore exhibit greater stability. Third, the presence of homologous sequences at both chromosome ends appears to be a minimum requirement for microhomology-mediated intra-chromosomal end-to-end fusion. With fewer homologous sequences, the probability of chromosome circularization decreases, and with more chromosomes, the likelihood of circularizing each chromosome within a cell diminishes. Fourth, in cells with fewer telomeres, intra-chromosomal telomere fusions are more likely to occur, while lethal inter-chromosomal fusions are competed out. However, we can speculate that in telomerase-null cells with eroded chromosome ends, stochastic repair mechanisms such as homologous recombination, microhomology-mediated end joining, and inter-and intra-chromosomal fusions operate simultaneously. Only those survivors that maintain a relatively stable genome and robust growth can be experimentally recovered.</p>
<p><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (budding yeast) and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (fission yeast) are the most commonly used laboratory systems, separated by approximately 1 Gya (billion years ago) according to molecular-clock analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hedges, 2002</xref>). Despite both species having genomes are both over 12 megabases in length, haploid <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> contains 16 chromosomes, while <italic>S. pombe</italic> has only 3 chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Forsburg, 2005</xref>). The telomerase-independent mechanisms for maintaining chromosome ends differ between these two yeasts. In budding yeast, homologous recombination is the primary mode of survival in telomerase-deficient cells, resulting in the generation of Type I or Type II survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">McEachern and Haber, 2006</xref>). Telomerase-and recombination-deficient cells occasionally escape senescence through the formation of palindromes at chromosome ends in the absence of <italic>EXO1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Maringele and Lydall, 2004</xref>). Fission yeast cells lacking telomerase can also maintain their chromosome termini by recombining persistent telomere sequences, and survivors with all intra-circular chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Nakamura et al., 1998</xref>) or intermolecular fusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tashiro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wang and Baumann, 2008</xref>) have been observed. In our research, some SY12 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ cells, which have three chromosomes, also bypassed senescence by circularizing their chromosomes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), suggesting that a lower chromosome number increases the likelihood of recovering survivors containing circular chromosomes.</p>
<p>While most eukaryotes employ telomerase for telomere replication, some eukaryotes lack telomerase and utilize recombination as an alternative means to maintain telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Biessmann and Mason, 1997</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, telomeres are replicated through a retrotransposon mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Levis et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30a">Louis, 2002</xref>). The structure and distribution of Y’-elements in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> suggest their origin from a mobile element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Jager and Philippsen, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Louis and Haber, 1992</xref>), and Y’-elements can be mobilized through a transposition-like RNA-mediated process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Maxwell et al., 2004</xref>). In telomerase-deficient yeast cells, homologous recombination can acts as a backup mechanism for telomere replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lundblad and Blackburn, 1993</xref>), and the reintroduction of telomerase efficiently inhibits telomere recombination and dominates telomere replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Peng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Teng and Zakian, 1999</xref>), These findings suggest that subtelomeric region amplification mediated by recombination and/or transposition may represent ancient telomere maintenance mechanisms predating the evolution of telomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">de Lange, 2004</xref>). Therefore, subtelomeric X- and Y’- elements might be considered as evolutionary “fossils” in the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome, and their elimination has little impact on genome stability.</p>

<p>The FACS analysis was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">He et al., 2019</xref>). Yeast cells were cultured at 30°C until the log phase, and then 1 ml of the cells was harvested. The cells were washed with cold sterile ddH<sub>2</sub>O and fixed with 70% ethanol overnight at 4°C. The following day, the cells were washed with 50 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 7.2) and then digested with 0.25 mg/ml RNase A at 37°C for 2-3 hours, followed by 0.2 mg/ml Protease K at 50°C for 1 hour. Both RNase A and Protease K were diluted in sodium citrate buffer. The cells were resuspended in 500 μl sodium citrate buffer and then sonicated for 45 seconds at 100% power. The DNA of the cells was stained with 20 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) at 4°C overnight or at room temperature for 1 hour. FACS analysis was performed on a BD LSRII instrument.</p>

<title>Serial dilution assay</title>
<p>A single colony per strain was inoculated into 3 ml liquid medium and incubated at 30°C. The cell cultures were then adjusted to a concentration of OD<sub>600</sub> ∼0.5. Five-fold serially diluted cells were spotted on the indicated plates. The plates were incubated at 30°C for the appropriate time prior to photography.</p>

<title>RNA extraction and RT-qPCR</title>
<p>Three independent single colonies of indicated strains were grown to log phase at 30°C. Yeast pellets from a 1 ml cell culture were digested with Zymolyase 20 T (MP Biomedicals, LLC) to obtain spheroplasts. RNA was extracted with RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) followed by reverse transcription using the Fastquant RT kit (Tiangen). Real-time PCR was carried out using SYBR Premix Ex Taq<sup>TM</sup> II (Takara) on the Applied Biosystems StepOne Real-Time PCR System. Primer pairs used in RT-qPCR were listed in supplementary file 1. The gene expression levels were normalized to that of <italic>ACT1</italic> and the wild-type value is arbitrarily set to 1.</p>

<title>Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis</title>
<p>DNA plugs for pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Bio-Rad) and Ishii et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Ishii et al., 2008</xref>). Fresh yeast cells were inoculated in 50 ml YPD and incubated at 30°C until the OD600 reached approximately 1.0. The cells were subsequently harvested, washed twice with cold EDTA buffer (50 mM, pH 8.0), and resuspended in 300 μl of CSB buffer (10 mM pH 7.2 Tris-Cl, 20 mM NaCl, 100 mM pH 8.0 EDTA, 4 mg/ml lyticase) and blended with 300 μl of 2% low-melt agarose (Bio-Rad). Then, 100 μl of resuspended cells were added to each plug and incubated at 4°C for 30 min until the agarose plugs were solidified. The solidified agarose plugs were incubated in lyticase buffer (10 mM pH 7.2 Tris-Cl, 100 mM pH 8.0 EDTA, 1 mg/ml lyticase) at 37°C for 3 hours, followed by incubation in Proteinase K Reaction Buffer (100 mM pH 8.0 EDTA, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, 1% sodium lauryl sarcosine) containing 1 mg/ml Proteinase K at 50°C for 12 hours. The plugs were washed four times in 25 ml of wash buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mM EDTA) for 1 hour each time at room temperature with gentle agitation. The plugs were then fixed into a pulsed field agarose gel (Bio-Rad), and the CHEF-DR II Pulsed Field Electrophoresis System (Bio-Rad) was used for gel electrophoresis. The electrophoresis conditions for separation were as follows: 0.8% agarose gel, 1×TBE buffer, 14°C temperature, first run: initial switch time 1200 s; final switch time 1200 s; run time 24 hours; voltage gradient 2 V/cm; angle 96°; second run: initial switch time 1500 s; final switch time 1500 s; run time 24 hours; voltage gradient 2 V/cm; angle 100°; third run: initial switch time 1800 s; final switch time 1800 s; run time 24 hours; voltage gradient 2 V/cm; angle 106°. The gel was stained with GelstainRedTM nucleic acid dye (US EVERBRIGHT), and PFGE Gels were imaged by Tanon 2500.</p>

<p>The authors have generated a set of yeast S. cerevisiae strains containing different numbers of chromosomes.</p>
<p>
Elimination of telomerase activates homologous recombination (HR) to maintain telomeres in cells containing the original 16 chromosomes. However, elimination of telomerase leads to circularization of cells containing a single or two chromosomes. The authors examined whether the subtelomeric sequences X and Y' promote HR-mediated telomere maintenance using the strain SY12 carrying three chromosomes. They found that the subtelomeric sequences X and Y' are dispensable for cell proliferation and HR-mediated telomere maintenance in telomerase-minus SY12 cells. They conclude that subtelomeric X and Y' sequences do not play essential roles in both telomerase-proficient and telomerase-null cells and propose that these sequences represent remnants of genome evolution.</p>
<p>
Interestingly, telomerase-minus SY12 generate survivors that are different from well-established Type I or Type II survivors. The authors uncover atypical telomere formation which does not depend on the Rad52 homologous recombination pathway.</p>
<p>Strengths: The authors examined whether the subtelomeric sequences X and Y' promote HR-mediated telomere maintenance using the strain SY12 carrying three chromosomes. They show that subtelomeres do not have essential roles in telomere maintenance and cell proliferation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
It is not fully addressed how atypical survivors are generated independently of Rad52-mediated homologous recombination.</p>
<p>
It remains possible that X and Y elements influence homologous recombination, type 1 and type 2 (type X), at telomeres. In particular, the presence of X and Y elements appears to be important for promoting type 1 recombination, although the authors conclude &quot;Elimination of subtelomeric repeat sequences exerts little effect on telomere functions&quot;.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this work, Hu and colleagues investigate telomerase-independent survival in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains engineered to have different chromosome numbers. The authors describe the molecular patterns of survival that change with fewer chromosomes and that differ from the well-described canonical Type I and Type II, including chromosome circularization and other atypical outcomes. They then take advantage of the strain with 3 chromosomes to examine the effect of deleting all the subtelomeric elements, called X and Y'. For most of the tested phenotypes, they find no significant effect of the absence of X- and Y'-element, and show that they are not essential for survivor formation. They speculate that X- and Y'-elements are remnants of ancient telomere maintenance mechanisms.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This work advances our understanding of the telomerase-independent strategies available to the cell by altering the structure of the genome and of the subtelomeres, a feat that was enabled by the set of strains they engineered previously. By using strains with non-standard genome structures, several alternative survival mechanisms are uncovered, revealing the diversity and plasticity of telomere maintenance mechanisms. Overall, the conclusions are well supported by the data, with adequate sample sizes for investigating survivors. The assessment of the genetic requirements for survivors in strains with different chromosome numbers greatly improved the quality of this work. The molecular analyses based on Southern blots are also very well-conducted.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The authors discovered alternative telomerase-independent survival strategies beyond the well-described type I and II (including circularization, type X and atypical, as they called them) at play in the context of reduced number of chromosomes. Their work provides a molecular and a partial genetic characterization of these survival pathways. A more thorough analysis of the frequency of each type of survivors and their genetic requirements would have advanced our understanding or the diversity of survival strategies in the absence of telomerase. However, as noted by the authors, the quantification of the rate of emergence of survivors (and their subtypes) is very difficult to achieve. This comment is therefore not meant as a criticism but rather as a perspective on exciting future research avenues.</p>

<p>This study investigates subtelomeric repetitive sequences in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, known as Y' and X-elements. Taking advantage of yeast strain SY12 that contains only 3 chromosomes and six telomeres (normal yeast strains contain 32 telomeres) the authors are able to generate a strain completely devoid of Y'- and X-elements.</p>
<p>Strengths: They demonstrate that the SY12 delta XY strain displays normal growth, with stable telomeres of normal length that were transcriptionally silenced, a key finding with wide implications for telomere biology. Inactivation of telomerase in the SY12 and SY12 delta XY strains frequently resulted in survivors that had circularized all three chromosomes, hence bypassing the need for telomeres altogether. They show that survivors with fused chromosomes and so-called atypical survivors arise independently of the central recombination protein Rad52. The SY12 and SY12 delta XY yeast strains can become a useful tool for future studies of telomere biology. The conclusions of this manuscript are well supported by the data and are valuable for researchers studying telomeres.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: A weakness of the manuscript is the analysis of telomere transcriptional silencing. They state: &quot;The results demonstrated a significant increase in the expression of the MPH3 and HSP32 upon Sir2 deletion, indicating that telomere silencing remains effective in the absence of X and Y'-elements&quot;. However, for the SY12 strain, their analyses indicate that the difference between the WT and sir2 strains is nonsignificant. In addition, a striking observation is that the SY12 strain (with only three chromosomes) express much less of both MPH3 and HSP32 than the parental strain BY4742 (16 chromosomes), both in the presence and absence of Sir2.</p>

<p>On behalf of my co-authors, I thank you very much for sending our manuscript (# eLifeRP-RA-2023-91223) entitled “Elimination of subtelomeric repeat sequences exerts little effect on telomere functions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae” for review and providing us an opportunity for revision. We also thank the reviewers for their critical and constructive comments and suggestions which have helped us to strengthen our study. We have performed more experiments to address the concerns the reviewers raised, and we have also revised or corrected some of our statements as the reviewers suggested.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1</bold></p>
<p>1. The author’s data indicate that cells with many chromosomes are more dependent on possibly homologous recombination than SY12 cells with three chromosomes. Telomerase-deficient cells exhibit the type I and type II telomere structures, whereas telomerase-deficient SY12 cells often generate different telomere structures (named Type X survivors or atypical survivors). Type I survivor depends on Rad51 possessing tandem Y' elements whereas Type II survivor depends on Rad59 carrying long TG sequences (line 60-70). Both types require Rad52 (line 66-70). At the moment, it is not determined how Type X or atypical survivors are generated in telomerase-deficient SY12 cells.</p>
<p>The authors need to determine whether Type X or atypical survivors depend on other repair pathways from Type I and Type II, and what DNA sequences are retained adjacent to telomeres in Type X or atypical survivors by sequencing analysis (Fig. 2).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer’s valuable comments and suggestions. Atypical survivor is a subtype of survivor that exhibits non-uniform telomere patterns, distinct from those observed in Type I, Type II, Type X, or circular survivors. To further determine its genetic requirements, we deleted RAD52 in SY12 tlc1Δ, SY12YΔ tlc1Δ, SY12XYΔ tlc1Δ, and SY12XYΔ+Y tlc1Δ strains. Southern blotting results showed that neither Type I nor Type II survivors were found in the series of strains; circular survivor was in the predomination; beside circular survivor, some survivors exhibiting non-uniform telomere patterns suggested they were atypical survivor. These results have been presented as Figure 2—figure supplement 6B, Figure 5—figure supplement 2B and Figure 6—figure supplement 4B in the revised version. The results showed that atypical survivors still emerged when Rad52 pathway was repressed, indicating that the formation of atypical survivors does not strictly rely on the homologous recombination.</p>
<p>Given that &quot;atypical&quot; clones exhibit non-uniform telomere patterns, it’s not surprising that their chromosome structures are variable and tanglesome. Consequently, it is hard for us to amplify and sequence the DNA sequences retained adjacent to telomeres.</p>
<p>Since no Type X survivor was detected in SY12 tlc1Δ rad52Δ strain (Author response image 1A), we deleted RAD50 or RAD51 in SY12 tlc1Δ strain to investigate on which pathway the formation of the Type X survivor relied. Results showed that Type X survivor emerged in the absence of Rad51 but not Rad50, suggesting that the formation of Type X survivor depended on Rad50 pathway. These results have been presented as Figure 2—figure supplement 7.</p>
<p>To determine the chromosomal end structure of the Type X survivor, we randomly selected a typical Type X survivor, and performed PCR-sequencing analysis. The results revealed the intact chromosome ends for I-L, X-R, XIII-L, XI-R, and XIV-R, albeit with some mismatches compared with the S. cerevisiae S288C genome, which possibly arising from recombination events that occurred during survivor formation. Notably, the sequence of the Y’-element in XVI-L could not be detected, while the X-element remained intact. Figure 2—figure supplement 5 in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Survivor generation of each type (Type I, Type II, Type X or atypical and circularization) needs to be accurately quantitated. The authors concluded that X or Y' elements are not strictly necessary for survivor formation (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6). However, their removal appears to increase atypical survivor and chromosome circularization (Fig. 2 vs Fig. 5 and 6).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful for the reviewer’s critical and constructive suggestions. According to the reviewer’s requirement, we quantified each type of survivors in SY12 tlc1Δ, SY12YΔ tlc1Δ, SY12XYΔ tlc1Δ and SY12XYΔ+Y tlc1Δ strains (Figure 2D, 5C, 6A and 6B). In SY12 tlc1Δ strain, Type I survivors accounted for 16%, Type II survivors for 2%, Type X survivors for 24%, circular survivors for 20% and atypical survivors for 38%. In SY12YΔ tlc1Δ strain, 4% were Type II survivors, 52% were circular survivors and 44% were atypical survivors.</p>
<p>For the SY12XYΔ tlc1Δ strain, 8% were Type II survivors, 48% were circular survivors and 44% were atypical survivors. In SY12XYΔ+Y tlc1Δ strain, the proportions of Type II, circular and atypical survivors were 14%, 44%, and 42%, respectively (Author response image 1).</p>
<p>In comparing SY12YΔ with SY12XYΔ, we observed a similar ratio of circular and atypical survivors. This result indicates that the remove of X-elements exert little effect on the formation of circular and atypical survivors. Similarly, in SY12XYΔ+Y strain, the proportions of circular and atypical survivors were comparable to those in SY12XYΔ strain, indicating that Y’-elements also have little effect on the formation of circular and atypical survivors. However, due to the unknown frequency of survivor formation, alternative explanations of these data are possible. For example, subtelomeric elements previously suggested to have no impact on the formation of any survivor types might influence every type to similar extents, leading to similar ratios across all survivor types. With our present data, it is still unclear whether the absence of X and Y'-elements enhances the formation of circular and atypical survivors. Therefore, we did not present these results in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>3)The authors asked whether X and Y' elements are required for cell proliferation, stress response, telomere length control and telomere silencing (Fig. 4). Similar studies have been previously carried out by using synthetic chromosomes (see PMID: 28300123). The authors need to discuss this point.</p>

<p>1. The Fig. 7 data support that circular chromosomes do not require Ku-dependent
DNA end protection. This is consistent with the current view that Ku binds and protects DNA ends. This finding by itself does not contribute significantly to our understanding of telomere maintenance. The authors need to more extensively discuss the significance of their findings in SY12 cells compared to wild-type cells with 16 chromosomes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the logic that this reviewer has pointed out. Our results demonstrate that combinatorial deletion of YKU70 and TLC1 caused synthetic lethality in SY12 cells, which possess three linear chromosomes, However, it did not affect the viability of &quot;circular survivors&quot;, supporting the notion that telomere deprotection leads to the synthetic lethality in yku70Δ tlc1Δ double mutants. Nevertheless, this conclusion merely confirms the current view observed in wild-type cells that Ku binds and protects DNA ends.</p>
<p>To avoid confusing readers and maintain the logical flow of the manuscript, we have deleted this section in the revised version.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor issues:</p>
<p>1. Line 112-113: &quot; for SY13, which contains two chromosomes, could also have a high probability of circularizing all chromosomes for survival&quot;: The reference or the supplemental data are required.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank this reviewer for the suggestion. According to the reviewer’s comments, we performed a Southern blotting assay to examine the types of survivors in SY13 tlc1Δ strain. We found that the majority of SY13 tlc1Δ clones exhibited hybridization signal similar to SY14 tlc1Δ circular survivors, pointing to the possibility that two chromosomes in these survivors may undergo intra-chromosomal fusions. This result has been added to figure 1D in the revised version.</p>

We employed mre11Δ as negative control because Mre11 is a member of the RAD52 epistasis group, which is involved in the repair of double-stranded breaks in DNA, and mutants in MRE11 exhibit defects in the repair of DNA damages caused by DNA damage drugs (Krogh and Symington, 2004; Lewis et al., 2004;
Symington, 2002). (p.23 line 420-422)</p>

<p>1. The qualification of survivor types mostly relies on molecular patterns in Southern blots. While this is a valid method for a standard strain, it might be more difficult to apply to the strains used in this study. For example, in SY8, SY11 and SY12, the telomere signal at 1-1.2 kb can be very faint due to the small number of terminal Y' elements left. As another example, for the Y'-less strain, it might seem obvious that no Type I survivor can emerge given that Y' amplification is a signature of Type I, but maybe Type-I-specific molecular mechanisms might still be used. To reinforce the characterization of survivor types, an analysis of the genetic requirements for Type I and Type II survivors (e.g. RAD51, RAD54, RAD59, RAD50) could complement the molecular characterization in specific result sections.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank this reviewer for his/her constructive comments and suggestions. To investigate whether Type-I-specific molecular mechanisms are still utilized in the survivor formation in Y'-less strain, we deleted RAD51 in SY12XYΔ tlc1Δ.  SY12XYΔ tlc1Δ rad51Δ strain was able to generate three types of survivors, including Type II survivor, circular survivor and atypical survivor, similar to the observations in SY12XYΔ tlc1Δ strain. However, the ratios of circular and atypical survivors were 36% and 32%, respectively, lower than the 48% and 44% observed in SY12XYΔ tlc1Δ strain (supplementary file 5). This result indicates that Type-I-specific molecular mechanisms contribute to the survivor formation. Given that our work primarily focuses on the function of subtelomeric elements, we chose not to include this result in our revised manuscript to maintain a coherent logical flow.</p>
<p>To reinforce the characterization of survivor types, we deleted RAD50, RAD51 and RAD52 in SY12 tlc1Δ strain, respectively. Southern blotting assay revealed that in the absence of Rad51, no Type I survivor was detected; in the absence of Rad50, neither Type I nor Type X survivor was detected. However, circular and atypical survivors still emerged in the absence of Rad52, suggesting that the RAD52-mediated homologous recombination is not strictly necessary for the formation of circular and atypical survivors. These results have been presented as Figure 2—figure supplement 6 and Figure 2— figure supplement 7.</p>

<p>1. In the title, the abstract and throughout the discussion, the authors chose to focus on the effect of X- and Y'-element deletion on different phenotypes and on survivor formation, as the main message to convey. While it is a legitimate and interesting message, other important results of this work might benefit from more spotlight. Namely, the observation that strains with different chromosome numbers show different survivor patterns and that several survival strategies beyond Type I and II exist and can reach substantial frequencies depending on the chromosomal context.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your valuable suggestion. While we value your suggestion to highlight additional aspects of our work, we would like to express our perspective on the current emphasis on the effect of X- and Y'-element deletion. We believe that by maintaining this focus, we can present a more coherent and impactful narrative for our readers. Additionally, we recognize that the relationship between chromosome numbers and survivor type frequencies is complex and warrants further experimental validation. We are considering exploring this aspect in more detail in our future projects. However, we fully acknowledge the importance of the observations you raised concerning strains with different chromosome numbers and the diversity of survival strategies.</p>

<p>1. In SY12 strain, while X- and Y'-elements are not essential for survivor emergence, they do modulate the frequency of each type of survivors, with more chromosome circularization events observed for SY12YΔ, SY12XYΔ and SY12XYΔ+Y strains. This result should be stated and discussed, maybe alongside the change in survivor patterns in the other SY strains, to more accurately assess the roles of these subtelomeric elements.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we compared the circular survivor ratios in SY12 tlc1Δ, SY12YΔ tlc1Δ, SY12XYΔ tlc1Δ and SY12XYΔ+Y tlc1Δ strains (supplementary file 5). It appears that the formation of circular survivors is less efficient in the SY12 tlc1Δ, with a ratio of 20%, much lower than that in SY12YΔ tlc1Δ, SY12XYΔ tlc1Δ or SY12XYΔ+Y tlc1Δ strains. However, it should be noted that SY12 tlc1Δ can generate Type I and Type X survivors, potentially decreasing the ratio of circular survivors.</p>
<p>Therefore, we further compared the circular survivor ratios in SY12YΔ tlc1Δ, SY12XYΔ tlc1Δ and SY12XYΔ+Y tlc1Δ strains. In the SY12YΔ tlc1Δ strain, circular survivors accounted for 52% (26/50), comparable to 48% (24/50) in the SY12XYΔ tlc1Δ strain, indicating that X- elements exert little effect on the formation of circular survivor. Additionally, the ratio of circular survivors was 44% (22/50) in SY12XYΔ+Y tlc1Δ strain, also comparable to 48% (24/50) in the SY12XYΔ tlc1Δ strain, suggesting that Y’-element also has little effect on chromosome circularization. However, due to the unknown frequency of survivor formation, alternative explanations of these data are possible. For example, subtelomeric elements previously suggested to have no impact on the formation of any survivor types might influence every type to similar extents, resulting in similar ratios across all survivor types. With our current data, it is still uncertain whether X and Y'-elements modulate the frequency of each type of survivors. Therefore, we did not include these results in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>1. p.18 line 318-320: the deletion of the Y' element also seems to remove the centromere-proximal telomere sequence adjacent to it. Maybe it should be stated as well. Even more importantly, in lines 327-329, the Y'-element that is reintroduced in the strain does not include the centromere-proximal short telomere sequence. This is important to interpret the Southern blots.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this critical suggestion. The deletion of Y'-element including both Y’- and X- element sequence in XVI-L (supplementary file 4), and the Y’element in the XVI-L does not contain the centromere-proximal telomere sequence. The Y'-element reintroduced into the left arm of Chr 3 in SY12XYΔ strain was cloned from native left arm of XVI in SY12 strain which does not contain the centromere-proximal short telomere sequence.

<p>1. p.29 lines 496-497: it seems that X and Y'-elements tend to inhibit formation of circular survivors either directly (by participating in end protection), or by promoting type I and type II, thus reducing the fraction of circular survivors. Maybe this could be added to the conclusion of this section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for his/her comments and have analyzed survivor types in SY12 tlc1Δ, SY12YΔ tlc1Δ, SY12XYΔ tlc1Δ and SY12XYΔ+Y tlc1Δ strains (supplementary file 5). Circular survivor formation appears less efficient in the SY12 tlc1Δ, with a ratio of 20%, significantly lower than SY12YΔ tlc1Δ, SY12XYΔ tlc1Δ or SY12XYΔ+Y tlc1Δ strains. However, it is noteworthy that SY12 tlc1Δ can generate Type I and Type X survivors, potentially impacting the circular survivor ratio.</p>
<p>We further compared circular survivor ratios in SY12YΔ tlc1Δ, SY12XYΔ tlc1Δ and SY12XYΔ+Y tlc1Δ strains. SY12YΔ tlc1Δ had 52% circular survivors, similar to SY12XYΔ tlc1Δ with 48%, indicating minimal impact of X- elements. Additionally, SY12XYΔ+Y tlc1Δ had 44% circular survivors, also similar to SY12XYΔ tlc1Δ, suggesting that Y’-element has little effect on chromosome circularization. However, due to unknown frequency of survivor formation, alternative explanations, like subtelomeric elements affecting all the type of survivor similarly, are possible. With our current data, it remains unclear whether X and Y'-elements are involved in end protection and consequently inhibit the formation of circular survivors.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3</bold></p>
<p>1. A weakness of the manuscript is the analysis of telomere transcriptional silencing. They state: &quot;The results demonstrated a significant increase in the expression of the MPH3 and HSP32 upon Sir2 deletion, indicating that telomere silencing remains effective in the absence of X and Y'-elements&quot;. However, there are no statistical analyses performed as far as I can see. For some of the strains, the significance of the increased expression in sir2 (especially for MPH3) looks questionable. In addition, a striking observation is that the SY12 strain (with only three chromosomes) express much less of both MPH3 and HSP32 than the parental strain BY4742 (16 chromosomes), both in the presence and absence of Sir2. In fact, the expression of both MPH3 and HSP32 in the SY12 sir2 strain is lower than in the BY4742 SIR2+ strain. In addition, relating this work to previous studies of subtelomeric sequences in other organisms would make the discussion more interesting.</p>
<p>First, I enjoyed reading your manuscript. It would be great if you performed the statistical analysis on the RT-qPCR data in figure 4B and addressed the issue of the difference of the BY4742 and SY12 strains. A model could be that this is a titration effect of silencing proteins due to fewer telomeres, which could be investigated by performing the analyses on more SY-strains with variable numbers of telomeres.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We highly appreciate the reviewer’s valuable comments and suggestions, which included a point that has also left us confused. We conducted statistical analyses on the
RT-qPCR data, and the t-test result revealed that upon the deletion of Sir2, SY12YΔ, SY12XYΔ and SY12XYΔ+Y strains exhibited a significant increase in MPH3 expression (located on the right arm of chr X) with a P value &lt; 0.05. In the case of SY12, the deletion of Sir2 resulted in an increase in gene expression (P value &lt; 0.1). Similar tendencies were observed in the BY4742 strain. The statistical analyses of RTqPCR results on XVI-L mirrored those of X-R.</p>
<p>The results demonstrated a significant increase in MPH3 and HSP32 expression upon SIR2 deletion in SY12YΔ, SY12XYΔ and SY12XYΔ+Y strains, leading to the conclusion that telomere silencing remains effective in the absence of X-and Y’-elements. However, as the reviewer has pointed out, no statistically significant differences in MPH3 and HSP32 expression were observed between the SY12 and SY12 sir2Δ strain. For HSP32, this lack of significance may be attributed to the greater distance between HSP32 and telomere XVI-L in SY12 compared to SY12YΔ, SY12XYΔ or SY12XYΔ+Y strains, resulting in a weaker telomere position effect on HSP32 and a non-significant increase in gene expression in SY12. However, this explanation does not apply to MPH3, as SY12YΔ, with a same distance between MPH3 and telomere X-R as in SY12, still exhibits an effective telomere position effect on MPH3. We cannot provide a compelling explanation at this moment, and we suspect that the lack of statistically significant differences may be due to random clonal variation.</p>
<p>Additionally, the SY12 strain (with three chromosomes) exhibited lower expression levels of both MPH3 and HSP32 compared to the parental strain BY4742 (with 16 chromosomes). Notably, it has been reported that the expression of genes coding silencing proteins in SY14 (with one chromosomes) were nearly identical to that of BY4742 (with 16 chromosomes)(Shao et al., 2018). Consequently, with respect to the reduced chromosome numbers, the silencing proteins appeared to be relatively overexpressed. Therefore, as pointed out by the reviewer, this observed phenomenon may be attributed to a titration effect of silencing proteins due to fewer telomeres. We have added the statistical analyses result in Figure 4B.</p>
<p>We have related our work with previous studies of subtelomeric sequences in fission yeast in the discussion part. (p.37 line 655-676)</p>
