<title>Abstract</title>
<p>To build a patient-relevant <italic>in vivo</italic> model of human glioblastoma, we expressed common oncogenic variants including activated human EGFR<sup>viii</sup> and PI3KCA<sup>H1047R</sup> under the control of the radial glial-specific promoter <italic>her4.1</italic> in syngeneic <italic>tp53</italic> loss-of-function mutant zebrafish. Robust tumor formation was observed prior to 45 days of life, with a gene expression signature similar to human glioblastoma of the mesenchymal subtype, along with a strong inflammatory component. Within early stage tumor lesions, and in an intact and endogenous tumor microenvironment, we visualized infiltration of phagocytic cells, as well as internalization of tumor cells by <italic>mpeg1.1</italic>:GFP+ microglia/macrophages, suggesting negative regulatory pressure by pro-inflammatory cell types on tumor growth at early stages of glioblastoma initiation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene targeting of master inflammatory transcription factors <italic>irf7</italic> and <italic>irf8</italic> led to increased tumor formation in the primary context, while suppression of microglial/macrophage activity led to enhanced tumor cell engraftment following transplantation into otherwise immune competent zebrafish hosts. Altogether, we developed a genetically-relevant model of aggressive human glioblastoma and harnessed the unique advantages of zebrafish including live imaging, high-throughput genetic and chemical manipulations to highlight important tumor suppressive roles for the innate immune system on glioblastoma initiation, with important future significance for therapeutic discovery and optimizations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Brain tumors comprise a diverse set of malignancies that develop from brain tissue or from metastatic cancer cells that have spread from other primary sites throughout the body. Glioblastoma represents a common type of primary brain cancer and represents about 50% of all primary brain malignancies in adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Despite intensive treatments including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy (temozolomide, TMZ), the vast majority of patients eventually relapse, with a median survival rate of less than 15 months<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Therapeutic resistance can partly be attributed to a poor understanding of underlying molecular mechanisms, as well as a significant level of genetic heterogeneity between patients. Plasticity among tumor and non-tumor cells within individual patient tumors also contributes to complex tumor cell evolution over time. Heterogeneity within glioblastoma is observed at several levels, including genetic, transcriptional, and DNA methylation, which is increasingly important for classification and characterization of major molecular subtypes including proneural, classical, and mesenchymal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. These categories reflect dominant oncogenic drivers, gene expression profiles, and prognoses, with mesenchymal-type glioblastomas having the poorest outcome, characterized by upregulation of angiogenesis genes and pathways involved in cell invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Interestingly, single cell sequencing has identified the co-existence of different glioblastoma subtypes within individual tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, revealing less distinct separations between molecular subtypes and an underlying cellular flexibility contributing to tumor aggressiveness and drug resistance.</p>
<p>Much of the cellular flexibility in glioblastoma is influenced by the tumor microenvironment (TME), which is highly complex consisting of various resident brain, stroma, and immune cells, as well as cells recruited from the general circulation such as bone marrow-derived immune cells with known tumor suppressive and tumor promoting functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Given emerging opportunities for harnessing the immune system for the treatment of human cancer, there is a growing focus on understanding innate and adaptive immune responses across different subtypes of human malignancies. However, like many other tumors, glioblastoma combines a lack of immunogenicity due to few mutations with a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. In addition to off-target effects of current frontline therapeutic strategies, both tumor and immune cells contribute to immune suppression in and surrounding the TME<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, which could explain the failure of immunotherapy-based clinical trials in glioblastoma. Additionally, lymphocytes are frequently exhausted and dysfunctional and therefore inadequate at exerting an anti-tumor immune response, while tumor-associated myeloid cells are frequently reprogrammed by signaling from tumor cells and the TME to cell states that promote glioblastoma survival, growth and invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Evidence also supports tumor-cell intrinsic mechanisms in response to immune cell attack leading to various evasion mechanisms, including upregulation of myeloid-associated gene expression programs and resistance to interferon signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Altogether, evidence suggests a complexity of inter-cellular signaling pathways that modify the behavior of both tumor and non-tumor cells within the TME, contributing to glioblastoma progression in patients.</p>
<p>Intercellular communication in glioblastoma highlights the importance of faithful <italic>in vivo</italic> models. However, given a historical lack of tractable and immunocompetent vertebrate animal model systems for glioblastoma gene discovery and drug screening, roles for the endogenous TME especially at early stages of tumor initiation, remain poorly understood. Furthermore, live visualization of heterogeneity and tumor cells within the TME is limited in non-transparent rodent genetic models and/or patient-derived tumor xenografted hosts. Therefore, our goal was to develop a patient-relevant model of aggressive human glioma in an intact and immune competent vertebrate animal model system. We developed a novel spontaneous, syngeneic zebrafish model of mesenchymal-like glioblastoma, with high levels of inflammatory immune cell infiltration and anti-tumor associations between microglia/macrophages and tumor cells, suggesting inhibitory roles for inter-cellular interactions during glioblastoma initiation and an effective <italic>in vivo</italic> platform for future biological discovery and drug testing for patients.</p>

<title>Oncogenic MAPK/AKT pathway activation drives glial-derived tumor formation in syngeneic <italic>tp53</italic> mutant zebrafish</title>
<p>The RTK/RAS/PI3K pathway is a key driver of tumorigenesis across human cancers, and 90% of glioblastoma tumors exhibit alterations in core signaling pathway genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Some of the most frequent genetic alterations in glioblastoma include activating mutations and/or amplifications of the Epidermal Growth Factors Receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase; loss of the lipid phosphatase PTEN, which antagonizes the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway; and/or activating mutations in the PI3K catalytic subunit PIK3CA, which altogether drive downstream activation of oncogenic RAS/MAPK and AKT/mTOR signaling pathway activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the TP53 tumor suppressor pathway is altered in 84% of globlastoma patients and 94% of cell lines, with TP53 loss implicated in proliferation, invasion, migration, and stemness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Importantly, single pathway mutations are generally insufficient to transform normal brain tissues, and multiple mutations are required for glioma formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Therefore, to recapitulate human glioblastoma <italic>in vivo</italic>, multiple genetic events should be considered for translational modeling to activate oncogenic signaling pathways involved in the aggressive tumor cell behaviors seen in patients.</p>
<p>To generate a patient-relevant brain tumor model in zebrafish we used the zebrafish <italic>her4.1</italic> promoter to simultaneously over-express constitutively-active human EGFR (EGFR<sup>vIII</sup>) and PI3KCA (PI3KCA<sup>H1047R</sup>) variants in neural progenitors and radial glia of syngeneic <italic>tp53</italic> loss-of-function mutant larvae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Co-injection of linearized <italic>her4.1</italic>:<bold>E</bold>GFR<sup>viii</sup> + <italic>her4.1</italic>:<bold>P</bold>I3KCA<sup>H1047R</sup> + <italic>her4.1</italic>:m<bold>S</bold>carlet transgenes into syngeneic (CG1) <italic>tp53<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant embryos at the one-cell stage led to broad transient mScarlet expression for 2-3 days followed by rare mosaic expression in the anterior CNS (henceforth referred to as p53EPS, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>), as expected from this transient mosaic injection strategy used to express stable concatemers of DNA vectors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Starting at 15 days post fertilization (dpf), this transgene combination led to visible mScarlet-positive brain lesions in the anterior CNS of live zebrafish (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B-D</xref>). Injections of single linearized vector and vector combinations resulted in a maximum incidence of approximately 15-20% affected zebrafish induced by the p53EPS combination by 45 dpf (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). Inter-tumoral variability was observed among p53EPS mosaic-injected zebrafish, with tumors of variable size arising in different brain regions including telecephalon and diencephalon regions (∼28%), and the optic tectum/mesencephalon region (∼72%) (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig 1</xref>). To further define the tissue of origin of zebrafish p53EPS CNS lesions, we co-injected linearized <italic>gfap</italic>:EGFP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> and visualized EGFP expression in 100% of brain masses at 30-40 dpf (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A,B</xref>), supporting glial identity and novel <italic>in vivo</italic> model of malignant glioma.</p>

<p>To test for transformation of p53EPS cells from primary mosaic-injected animals, we harvested bulk tissue from dissected zebrafish brains and transplanted dissociated cells into the hindbrain ventricles of 2 dpf syngeneic <italic>tp53</italic> wild-type (CG1) zebrafish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. At approximately 18 days post-transplant (18 dpt, or 20 dpf), we screened for mScarlet+ fluorescence and visualized her4.1+/gfap+ tumor cell outgrowth in transplanted host (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E,F</xref>), supporting oncogenic transformation and malignant growth <italic>in vivo</italic> of p53EPS cells.

<p>We performed sectioning of primary p53EPS zebrafish and visualized highly proliferative forebrain and optic tectum/mesencephalon lesions that stained positive for phosphorylated-ERK and phosphorylated-AKT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1H-K</xref>), confirming activation of downstream MAPK and AKT signaling pathways, respectively. To validate effects of relevant downstream signaling pathway activation, we co-injected linearized <italic>her4.1</italic>:<bold>K</bold>RAS<sup>G12D</sup> + <italic>her4.1</italic>:<bold>P</bold>I3KCA<sup>H1047R</sup> + <italic>her4.1</italic>:m<bold>S</bold>carlet into CG1<italic>tp53<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos (p53KPS). Starting at 15-20 dpf, we visualized tumor onset and penetrance comparable to p53EPS (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>), suggesting a dominant role for MAPK/AKT pathway activation downstream of RTK signaling in driving tumor formation, and a flexible oncogenic strategy for driving robust brain tumor formation in zebrafish.</p>

<title>RNA expression analysis establishes enrichment of human mesenchymal glioblastoma signatures and gene expression patterns associated with inflammation</title>
<p>To further characterize our novel zebrafish brain tumor models, we performed bulk RNA sequencing (RNAseq) of three independent p53EPS tumor-burdened brains, three independent p53KPS tumor-burdened brains, and three age-matched control-injected zebrafish brains that remained tumor-free at the time of harvesting tissue. Using hierarchical clustering on normalized gene expression, our tumor-free control samples clustered together and apart from p53EPS and p53KPS tumor brains, which displayed a recognizable level of transcriptional variability across principal components (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). Interestingly, p53EPS and p53KPS samples failed to cluster according to oncogenic drivers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>), suggesting molecular similarities as well as inter-tumor heterogeneity reflecting differences in tumor location, size, and contribution of tumor cells to total sample inputs.</p>

<p>Given the increased oncogenic relevance of our p53EPS driver combination to human glioblastoma, we chose to focus the remainder of our molecular analyses on p53EPS samples. Using differential gene expression analysis, we identified a conserved set of differentially expressed (DE) genes in p53EPS tumor brains, with 236 upregulated and 28 downregulated genes, compared to control injected brains at 20-30 dpf (2 &gt; log2foldChange &gt; -2, adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05, Supplementary Table 1, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). Using DE genes, we identified human orthologs (Supplementary Table 2) and performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> comparing our p53EPS zebrafish model to published expression patterns for human glioblastoma subtypes, as well as embryonal brain tumors including designated subtypes of medulloblastoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Among these gene sets, we found a significant enrichment for the mesenchymal subtype of human glioblastoma in p53EPS differentially expressed genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. In contrast, no significant enrichment was found for signatures associated with classical glioblastoma, proneural glioblastoma, Shh, Wnt, Group 3 or Group 4 medulloblastoma (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig 3</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Together with the selected oncogenic drivers used to induce tumor formation <italic>in vivo</italic>, expression data supports significant molecular similarity between our zebrafish p53EPS brain tumor model and human glioblastoma, specifically of the mesenchymal subtype. To further assess potential underlying molecular mechanisms, we also used our p53EPS DE signature to unbiasedly assess Hallmark gene sets available through the Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB, Supplementary Table 3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Interestingly, 7 of the top 13 enriched gene sets (NOM p-value &lt;0.05) related to inflammation or inflammatory signaling pathways, including the Interferon gamma response, TNFA signaling, the Interferon alpha response, and Jak/STAT3 signaling (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>, Supplementary Table 3), suggesting a strong inflammatory component in our model. Additional pathway signatures included those related to RAS signaling, Hypoxia, and Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transitions (EMT) (Supplementary Table 3), suggesting on target oncogenic pathway activation, hypoxia, and invasive properties, consistent with aggressive glioblastoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Zebrafish mesenchymal glioblastoma-like tumors recruit activated mononuclear phagocytes at early stages of tumor formation</title>
<p>Given that p53EPS tumor-burdened brains had strong enrichment for transcriptional signatures associated with inflammation, we were interested in the role for innate immune cells in the earliest stages of p53EPS tumor formation.

Therefore, to define functional roles for Irf7 and Irf8 in p53EPS formation, we used a transient CRISPR/Cas9 gene targeting approach to knock-down <italic>irf7</italic> and <italic>irf8</italic> genes prior to p53EPS tumor formation through co-injection of 2-3 gRNAs targeting <italic>irf7</italic> or <italic>irf8</italic> (Supplementary Table 5), together with Cas9 protein and linearized EPS into one-cell stage <italic>tp53<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos.

To further assess the role for microglia/macrophages during re-initiation of p53EPS following transplantation, we injected p53EPS tumor cells into the hindbrain ventricle of syngeneic host embryos at 2 dpf along with Clodronate liposomes (Clodrosomes), a chemical commonly used to eliminate macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Creating faithful models and discovering tailored treatments for glioblastoma patients has resulted in many different experimental platforms, each with their own unique advantages and experimental challenges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) are widely used for the study of tumorigenesis in a physiological context; however, most cannot fully recapitulate genetic heterogeneity in a timely and cost-effective manner and are therefore limited in the context of preclinical drug testing. Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) resemble patient tumors more closely as they retain mutational heterogeneity; however, PDX models cannot be used to address mechanisms of tumor onset in an intact and endogenous tumor microenvironment given that they are derived from pre-evolved tumor tissue and are either studied <italic>ex vivo</italic> or engrafted into immune-deficient animal hosts. Human stem cell-derived organoids represent a great advance in the field for the study of tumor development and for screening new therapeutic strategies, but the lack of an intact TME excludes both known and unknown inter-cellular interactions, which are increasingly appreciated to influence tumor cell evolution and drug responses in patients.</p>
<p>Zebrafish are a well-established and robust model for studying human cancer pathobiology and are well suited for screening novel targeted therapies <italic>in vivo</italic>. Zebrafish models of human brain tumors have been generated previously using transgenic overexpression of human oncogenes or xenograft transplantation of patient-derived tumor cells into zebrafish larvae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>, and these models have proven useful for defining important molecular pathways in glioma transformation, tumor growth and migration. However, most of these available zebrafish models are induced using single oncogenic drivers driven by a variety of neuronal and/or glial-specific promoters at different time points throughout development, with the use of single oncogenes in a functional <italic>tp53</italic> signaling background likely contributing their inability to model highly aggressive and relapse-like phenotypes <italic>in vivo</italic>. Xenograft transplantations of human glioblastoma cells into zebrafish larvae omits a fully functional immune system, which our work suggests plays an important role on tumor initiation and growth both in the primary context and following p53EPS tumor cell transplantation. Therefore, our zebrafish model of aggressive and transplantable human glioblastoma represents an exciting opportunity to study important aspects related to tumor cell progression and relapse in an intact and endogenous TME. Using widely used markers of innate immune cells and direct visualization of cell infiltration and phagocytic-like behaviors in live animals, we also demonstrate a novel approach to study inter-cellular interactions during glioblastoma initiation, an approach that is not currently feasible in rodent models. In the future, it will be interesting to further assess roles for both the innate and adaptive immune system, as well as associated stroma including endothelial and mesenchymal cells, which can each be effectively studied in our models given the high degree of conservation between zebrafish and human, and the broad availability of validated reporter transgenes.</p>
<p>The contributions of macrophages/microglia to an immunosuppressive TME in glioblastoma and their prevalence within the tumor bulk is well known and has made macrophages an attractive therapeutic target for patients. For example, CSF/CSF-1R interactions have been shown to induce an immunosuppressive M2 phenotype in glioblastoma-associated microglia/macrophages, and blockade of CSF-1R improves survival in tumor burdened mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. However, our data and work from others suggests an equally important tumor-suppressive role for microglial/macrophages based on tumor stage and activation state. For example, serial transplantation of transformed mouse neural stem cells results in strong negative pressure from the immune system in syngeneic mice, leading to activation of tumor cell-intrinsic immune evasion mechanisms that support growth <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. In addition, recent spatial analyses of human glioblastoma tumor samples identified regions of activated (myeloperoxidase, MPO) macrophages that are associated with improved clinical outcomes, suggesting anti-tumorigenic roles for certain macrophage populations in patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Our modeling further supports a strong anti-tumor role for pro-inflammatory microglia/macrophages within the endogenous TME at initiation and following transplantation, which is considered an experimental surrogate for relapse potential. Our data also suggests that the pro-tumorigenic immune niche seen in late-stage gliomas is not already established at initiation stages. Given that the transition to mesenchymal-like glioblastoma is closely linked to immune cell infiltration and an immune-suppressive TME<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>, it will be important to characterize these transitions to better understand anti-tumor mechanisms and their evolution during tumor progression, with the potential for therapeutically harnessing endogenous immune cell types and/or signaling pathways in the future. Altogether, these data suggest an anti-tumor growth but potentially relapse promoting role for therapeutic anti-macrophage approaches, highlighting the importance of future <italic>in vivo</italic> investigations into how inhibition of transitions and/or switching immunosuppressive microglia/macrophages to immune activating states may inhibit glioblastoma growth or prevent relapse for patients.</p>
<p>Finally, it is well known that the type of glioma affects immune responses, implying that tumor-intrinsic factors shape the composition of the TME<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. Therefore, phenotypic differences with respect to glioblastoma-TME interactions in patients and model systems are likely influenced by the genetic background and oncogenic driver events. Human AKT1 over-expression in zebrafish neural cells was previously shown to drive pre-neoplastic lesions in zebrafish larvae and was found to recruit macrophage and microglia populations through the Sdf1b-Cxcr4b signaling pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. In this model, loss of macrophages resulted in decreased oncogenic proliferation, suggesting tumor-promoting functions for macrophages at initiation stages. In contrast to AKT1 expressing pre-neoplastic neurons, we visualized <italic>mpeg1.1</italic>:GFP+ macrophages/microglia very closely associated with and/or engulfing mScarlet+ p53EPS tumor cellular puncta, suggesting an effort to clear cells and/or cellular debris in p53EPS. This anti-tumor role is further supported by our functional analyses showing increased p53EPS tumor initiation in the context of Irf8 gene knock-out and decreased phagocytic cell development <italic>in vivo</italic> in zebrafish larvae. Given that effectively leveraging targeted therapies for glioblastoma will require a deep and individualized understanding of patient-specific tumor cell biology, in the future it will be important to harness the flexibility of our mosaic oncogene over-expression approach and understand different tumor plus environmental factors in the context of different genetic drivers and/or modifiers identified in patients.</p>

<title>Brain Dissection and Dissociation</title>
<p>Animals were euthanized with a lethal 300mg/L dose of tricaine (Sigma-Aldrich, E10521) ∼10-20 minutes before dissection. Fish were decapitated posterior of the gills and the head transferred to sterile-filtered PBS (Wisent Inc., 311-010-CL). Using fine-tipped forceps, brains were carefully extracted from the skull and transferred to a micro centrifuge tube and kept in PBS at 28°C until further processing. 5-10 brains were transferred to 1ml of 28°C pre-warmed Accutase (Stemcell, 07920), followed by incubation at 28°C with gentle rocking for a total of ∼50 minutes. Every 10 minutes, brains were mechanically dissociated with gentle pipetting 15-30 times using a 1mL filter tip. Dissociated tissue were passed through a 40um Cell Strainer (Corning, 352340) into a 50ml conical tube to achieve single cell suspensions. Strained cells were pelleted at approximately 1000 x g for 5 minutes at room temperature and resuspended in PBS.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Zebrafish were fixed overnight in 4% PFA and stored in methanol at -20°C before paraffin embedding and sectioning at the Centre for Chemogenomic Pathology Core Facility. Animal sections were deparaffinized with 2×5 minute washes of Xylenes. Sections were rehydrated with sequential 2×10 minute washes in 100%, 90%, 70% ethanol before sequential rinsing with ddH20, 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2,</sub> and ddH20. Slides were then boiled in 1x Citrate Buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, C999) within a standard microwave and rinsed in ddH20, after cooling for 30 minutes. Sections were blocked with TBST/5% Normal Goat Serum for 1 hour at RT before overnight incubation with primary antibody diluted in Diluent CST (Cell Signaling Technology, 8112) at 4°C. The following day slides were washed once with 3×5 minutes with TBS, TBST, and TBS. Samples were then incubated with secondary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, 8114) for half an hour at room temperature, followed by another 3×5 minute TBS/T wash. Standard DAB development (Thermo Scientific, 34002) was performed for 5-7 minutes, followed by water termination. Samples were Hematoxylin (VWR, 10143-146) stained with a 1:6 diluted solution for 3-5 seconds and rinsed 5x with tap water. Slides were dehydrated sequentially with 70%, 90%, 100% ethanol washes followed by 2×5 minute Xylene washes before being mounted with glass cover slips and Permount (Fisher Scientific, SP15-100). Primary antibodies raised against proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA, Cell Signaling, D3H8P), phosphorylated ERK (Cell Signaling, #9101) and phosphorylated AKT (Cell Signaling, #9271) were used.</p>

<caption><p>Inter-tumoral heterogeneity in p53EPS induced tumors. Sample screens of p53EPS injected fish from three different cohorts showing distinct tumor initiation sites and varying degrees of mScarlet-fluorescent intensity, with intense fluorescence indicative of tumorigenesis. Tumors predominantly arise in the optic tectum/mesencephalon region (21/29) with a distinctive subset appearing in the telencephalon/diencephalon region (8/29). Distinct tumors did not arise in the cerebellum/rhombencephalon regions over the course of our experiments.</p></caption>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors have developed a zebrafish model of glioblastoma and characterized this, with a particular focus on the role of recruited myeloid cells in the tumours. Microglia/macrophages in the tumours are proposed to have an inflammatory phenotype and are engaged in phagocytosis. Knockout of Irf7 and Irf8 genes enhanced tumour initiation. Depleting mature myeloid cell types with chlodronate also enhanced tumour intitiation. It is proposed that in early-stage tumours, microglia/macrophages have tumour suppressive activity.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors have generated a novel glioblastoma model in zebrafish. Two key strengths of the zebrafish model are that early-stage tumours can be studied and in vivo visualization can be readily performed. The authors show a video of microglia/macrophages adopting the ameboid phenotype in tumours (as is observed in human tumours) and engaging in phagocytosis. Video 1 was very impressive in my opinion and shows the model is a very useful tool to study microglia/macrophage:glioblastoma cell interactions. The irf7/irf8 knockdown and the chlodronate experiments are consistent with a role for mature myeloid cells in suppressing tumour initiation, suggesting that the model may also be very valuable in understanding immune surveillance in glioblastoma initiation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
EGFRvIII is mainly associated with the classical subtype, so the mesenchymal subtype might be unexpected here. This could be commented on. Some more histologic characterization of the tumours would be helpful. Are they invasive, do larger tumours show necrosis and microvascular proliferation? This would help with understanding the full potential of the new model. Current thinking in established human glioblastoma is that the M1/M2 designations for macrophages are not relevant, with microglia macrophage populations showing a mixture of pre- and anti-inflammatory features. Ideally, there would be a much more detailed characterization of the intratumoral microglia/macrophage population here, as single markers can't be relied upon. Phagocytosis could have antitumour effects through the removal of live cancer cells, or could be cancer-promoting if apoptotic cancer cells are being rapidly cleared with concomitant activation of an immunosuppressive phenotype in the phagocytes (i.e. efferocytosis). It may be possible to distinguish between these two types of phagocytosis experimentally. Do the irf7/8 and chlodronate experiments distinguish between effects on microglia/macrophages and dendritic cells?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Glioblastoma is a common primary brain cancer, that is difficult to treat and has a low survival rate. The lack of genetically tractable and immunocompetent vertebrate animal models has prevented the discovery of new therapeutic targets and limited efforts for screening pharmaceutical agents for the treatment of the disease. Here Weiss et al., express oncogenic variants frequently observed in human glioblastoma within zebrafish lacking the tumor suppressor TP53 to generate a patient-relevant in vivo model. The authors demonstrate that loss of TP53 and overexpression of EGFR, PI3KCA, and mScarlet (p53EPS) in neural progenitors and radial glia leads to visible fluorescent brain lesions in live zebrafish. The authors performed RNA expression analysis that uncovered a molecular signature consistent with human mesenchymal glioblastoma and identified gene expression patterns associated with inflammation. Live imaging revealed high levels of immune cell infiltration and associations between microglia/macrophages and tumor cells. To define functional roles for regulators of inflammation on specific immune-related responses during tumorigenesis, transient CRISPR/Cas9 gene targeting was used to disrupt interferon regulator factor proteins and showed Inflammation-associated irf7 and irf8 are required to inhibit p53EPS tumor formation. Further, experiments to deplete the macrophages using clodronate liposomes suggest that macrophages contribute to the suppression of tumor engraftment following transplantation. The authors' conclusions are largely supported by the data and the experiments are thoroughly controlled throughout. Taken together, these results provide new insights into the regulation of glioblastoma initiation and growth by the surrounding microenvironment and provide a novel in vivo platform for the discovery of new molecular mechanisms and testing of therapeutics.</p>
<p>Strengths/Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The authors convincingly show that co-injection of activated human EGFRviii, PI3KCAH1047R, and mScarlet into TP53 null zebrafish promotes the formation of fluorescent brain lesions and glioblastoma-like tumor formation. The authors state that oncogenic MAPK/AKT pathway activation drives this glial-derived tumor formation. It would be important to include a wild-type or uninjected control for the pERK and pAKT staining shown in Fig1 I-K to aid in the interpretation of these results. Likewise, quantification of the pERK and pAKT staining would be useful to demonstrate the increase over WT, and would also serve to facilitate comparison with the similar staining in the KPG model (Supp Fig 2D).</p>
<p>The authors use a transplantation assay to further test the tumorigenic potential of dissociated cells from glial-derived tumors. Listing the percentage of transplants that generate fluorescent tumor would be helpful to fully interpret these data. Additionally, it was not clear based on the description in the results section that the transplantation assay was an &quot;experimental surrogate&quot; to model the relapse potential of the tumor cells. This is first mentioned in the discussion. The authors may consider adding a sentence for clarity earlier in the manuscript as it helps the reader better understand the logic of the assay.</p>
<p>The authors nicely show high levels of immune cell infiltration and associations between microglia/macrophages and tumor cells. However, a quantification of the emergence of macrophages over time in relation to tumor initiation and growth would provide significant support to the observations of tumor suppressive activity of the phagocytes. Along these lines, the inclusion of a statement about when leukocytes emerge during normal development would be informative for those not familiar with the zebrafish model.</p>
<p>From the data provided in Figure 4G and Supp Fig 7b, the authors suggest that &quot;increased p53EPS tumor initiation following Ifr gene knock-down is a consequence of irf7 and irf8 loss-of-function in the TME&quot;. Given the importance of the local microenvironment highlighted in this study, spatial information in the form of in situ hybridization to identify the relevant location of the expression change would be important to support this conclusion.</p>
<p>The authors used neutral red staining that labels lysosomal-rich phagocytes to assess enrichment at the early stages of tumor initiation. The images in Figure 3 panel A should be labeled to denote the uninjected controls to aid in the interpretation of the data. In Supplemental Figure 6, the neutral red staining in the irf8 CRISPR-injected larvae looks to be increased, counter to the quantification. Can the authors comment if the image is perhaps not representative?</p>
