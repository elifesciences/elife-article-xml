<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Metabolic disorders are highly prevalent in modern society. Exercise mimetics are defined as pharmacologic compounds that can produce the beneficial effects of fitness. Recently, there has been increased interest in the role of eugenol and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) in improving metabolic health. The aim of this study was to investigate whether eugenol acts as an exercise mimetic by activating TRPV1. Here, we showed that eugenol improved endurance capacity, caused the conversion of fast to slow muscle fibers, and promoted white fat browning and lipolysis in mice. Mechanistically, eugenol promoted muscle fiber type transformation by activating TRPV1-mediated CaN signaling pathway. Subsequently, we identified IL-15 as a myokine that is regulated by the CaN/Nuclear factor of activated T cells cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1) signaling pathway. Moreover, we found that TRPV1-mediated CaN/NFATc1 signaling, activated by eugenol, controlled IL-15 levels in C2C12 myotubes. Our results suggest that eugenol may act as an exercise mimetic to improve metabolic health via activating the TRPV1-mediated CaN signaling pathway.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Due to the lack of regular exercise among many individuals (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Carlson et al., 2010</xref></italic></bold>), metabolic diseases are highly prevalent in modern society (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hoehn et al., 2010</xref></italic></bold>). To address this issue, pharmacological interventions have been considered as potential treatments. Exercise mimetics are pharmacologic compounds that produce fitness benefits (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fan and Evans, 2017</xref></italic></bold>). Although some synthetic exercise mimetics such as AICAR (AMPK activator), GW501516 (PPARδ activator), SRT1720 (SIRT1 activator), and GSK4716 (ERRγ activator) have been used to improve fitness (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Feige et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Narkar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Rangwala et al., 2010</xref></italic></bold>), the safety and health of each drug must be considered. In recent years, plant extracts such as resveratrol, lycium barbarum and epicatechin have demonstrated potential as a new class of low-toxin exercise mimetics (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Meng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Nogueira et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wen et al., 2020</xref></italic></bold>). Therefore, it is of great significance to discover natural medicinal and edible plants that have mimetic effects of exercise.</p>
<p>Based on their metabolism and contractile properties, muscle fibers are commonly divided into slow oxidative fibers (muscle fibers that express myosin heavy chain (MyHC) I) and fast glycolytic/oxidative fibers (muscle fibers that express MyHC IIa, MyHC IIx, or MyHC IIb) (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Schiaffino and Reggiani, 2011</xref></italic></bold>). Different muscle fibers exhibit a high degree of plasticity and are regulated by exercise (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Egan and Zierath, 2013</xref></italic></bold>). The increased proportion of slow muscle fibers contributes to the enhancement of mitochondrial biogenesis and lipid metabolism (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Carlson et al., 2010</xref></italic></bold>). Therefore, one of the benefits of exercise is to treat metabolic disorders by promoting slow muscle fiber remodeling (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Duan et al., 2017</xref></italic></bold>). In addition, it has been increasingly recognized that myokines released by skeletal muscle play an essential role in mediating the benefits of exercise. Myokines are defined as cytokines or peptides that are released from skeletal muscle cells, which exert autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine effects (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Pedersen and Febbraio, 2012</xref></italic></bold>). As a medium of crosstalk between muscles and other organs, myokines exert systemic regulation of exercise by acting on the muscle, fat, liver, pancreas, and other organs, effectively improving insulin resistance, obesity, and metabolic disorders of type 2 diabetes (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Severinsen and Pedersen, 2020</xref></italic></bold>). Therefore, another potential effect of exercise is to induce the release of myokines (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fan and Evans, 2017</xref></italic></bold>). Although many previous studies have discovered plant extracts as exercise mimetics by promoting slow oxidative muscle fiber, few studies have investigated the effect of exercise mimetics on the release of myokines.</p>
<p>Eugenol is a safe natural compound extracted from clove oil and various plant spices such as basil, bay leaves, and cinnamon (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kaur et al., 2010</xref></italic></bold>). Eugenol exhibits a variety of biological activities, including antioxidative (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Magalhães et al., 2019</xref></italic></bold>), antibacterial (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Devi et al., 2010</xref></italic></bold>), anti-inflammatory (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Magalhães et al., 2019</xref></italic></bold>) and anti-cancer activities (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lesgards et al., 2014</xref></italic></bold>). Recent studies have also suggested that eugenol could be a promising therapeutic drug for preventing diabetes and obesity (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Al-Trad et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jung et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Mnafgui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Srinivasan et al., 2014</xref></italic></bold>), indicating its potential as an exercise mimetic. In addition. as a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family, TRP vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), also known as the capsaicin receptor, has been reported to improve endurance capacity and energy metabolism (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Luo et al., 2012</xref></italic></bold>), counter obesity (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Baskaran et al., 2016</xref></italic></bold>), and intervene diabetes (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wang et al., 2012</xref></italic></bold>), making it a potential target protein for discovering exercise mimetics.</p>
<p>Eugenol contains a vanilloyl fragment that may bind to TRPV1 similarly to capsaicin, implying that eugenol might exert its biological activity via TRPV1 (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Harb et al., 2019</xref></italic></bold>). It has been found that eugenol activates TRPV1 in a heterologous expression system and rat trigeminal ganglion neurons (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Xu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Yang et al., 2003</xref></italic></bold>). Furthermore, a recent study demonstrated that eugenol activated TRPV1 in skeletal muscle (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jiang et al., 2022</xref></italic></bold>). TRPV1 is an important Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry pathway contributing to increase intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Nilius et al., 2007</xref></italic></bold>), suggesting that TRPV1 may regulate many biological processes through Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent signaling pathways. As a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent signaling, calcineurin (CaN) is a core signaling to promote fast to slow muscle fiber transformation (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Sakuma and Yamaguchi, 2010</xref></italic></bold>). Additionally, CaN signaling plays an essential role in regulating the expression of myokine IL-6 (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Banzet et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Banzet et al., 2007</xref></italic></bold>). Therefore, we hypothesize that eugenol, as an exercise mimetic, promotes the release of myokines and fast to slow muscle fiber transformation via the TRPV1-mediated CaN signaling pathway. The primary objective of this study is to investigate this hypothesis.</p>

<title>Eugenol promotes fast to slow muscle fiber transformation in mice and in C2C12 myotubes</title>
<p>As depicted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A and B</xref>, eugenol did not have any effect on the body weight or skeletal muscle weight in mice. However, the skeletal muscle in the EUG50 and EUG100 groups exhibited a redder muscle color (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), indicating a shift from fast to slow muscle fiber in these two groups. Further experiments showed that EUG50 and EUG100 increased the expression of slow MyHC and decreased the expression of fast MyHC protein in GAS and TA muscles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D and E</xref>). Additionally, the mRNA expression of <italic>MyHC I</italic>, <italic>MyHC IIa</italic>, <italic>MyHC IIx</italic>, and <italic>MyHC IIb</italic> was generally consistent with protein expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). As our <italic>in vivo</italic> studies demonstrated that the EUG200 group had no effect on muscle fiber type, we suspected that high doses of eugenol may have no impact on muscle fiber type. Therefore, we selected a broad range of eugenol doses (0-200 μM) based on the safe range of eugenol doses determined by the CCK-8 assay (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1</xref>) to treat C2C12 myotubes and replicate these results <italic>in vivo</italic>. As indicated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>, 12.5-50 μM eugenol boosted slow MyHC expression, while 12.5-100 μM eugenol decreased fast MyHC expression. Furthermore, as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>, 100 μM eugenol increased the mRNA expression of <italic>MyHC I</italic>, and 12.5-100 μM eugenol increased the mRNA expression of <italic>MyHC IIa</italic>, whereas 50 μM eugenol decreased the mRNA expression of <italic>MyHC IIb</italic>. Consistent with our in vivo studies, our in vitro findings again suggested that high doses (200 μM) of eugenol had no effect on muscle fiber type. In summary, our results suggest that eugenol promotes a transformation from fast to slow muscle fiber. However, it should be noted that high doses of eugenol may have no effect on muscle fiber type.</p>

<title>Eugenol promotes oxidative metabolism activity, mitochondrial function, and endurance performance</title>
<p>An increase in the proportion of slow muscle fibers is often accompanied by an increase in skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism activity, mitochondrial function, and endurance performance. Therefore, we examined these indicators in our study. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, EUG100 increased the exhaustion time of mice. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, EUG50 and EUG100 decreased LDH activity and increased SDH activity in the GAS muscle. In the TA muscle, LDH activity was decreased in all EUG groups, and EUG100 increased the activities of SDH and MDH. Then, we chose 100 mg/kg eugenol (as the optimal dose) for the exhausting swimming test. In addition, the transcript levels of mitochondrial transcription factors <italic>PGC-1α</italic>, <italic>NRF1</italic>, and <italic>TFAM</italic> and the mRNA expression of components of the mitochondrial electron transport chain were increased in eugenol-treated mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). The protein expression of mitochondrial electron transport complex I and complex V was upregulated in eugenol-treated mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Furthermore, EUG100 improved the mtDNA copy number in the GAS and TA muscle (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>), and 12.5-100 μM EUG increased the mtDNA copy number in C2C12 myotubes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>).</p>

<title>Eugenol promotes lipolysis and browning of fat</title>
<p>Our research has found that both EUG100 and EUG200 promoted average daily feed intake (ADF) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). However, interestingly, there was no change in body weight (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). This indicates that there was an increase in ADF/average daily weight gain (ADG) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). In addition, eugenol decreased iWAT and gWAT weight while promoting BAT weight (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). And eugenol decreased T-CHO and LDL while increasing HDL level in serum (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). These apparent results suggest that eugenol may increase the energy metabolism rate in mice, offsetting the weight gain and increased fat synthesis resulting from increased food intake. Therefore, we further speculate that eugenol may promote lipolysis and fat thermogenesis. As we speculated, we found that eugenol promoted the mRNA expression of the fat synthesis-related genes <italic>PPARγ</italic> and <italic>HSL</italic>, as well as the fatty acid transport gene <italic>FABP4</italic>, in iWAT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). In gWAT, it was found that eugenol promoted the mRNA expression of the <italic>FASN</italic> and <italic>FABP4</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). We further examined the mRNA expression of key genes involved in browning of fat, and found that eugenol promoted the mRNA expression of <italic>CD137</italic>, <italic>TBX1</italic>, <italic>UCP-1</italic>, <italic>PRDM16</italic>, <italic>Dio2</italic>, and <italic>Cidea</italic> in iWAT, while eugenol promoted the mRNA expression of <italic>TMEM26</italic>, <italic>UCP-1</italic>, <italic>PRDM16</italic>, <italic>Dio2</italic>, and <italic>Cidea</italic> in gWAT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). At the protein level, eugenol promoted the expression of the fatty acid transport protein FABP-1, as well as the UCP-1 protein expression in gWAT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). In addition, we also examined the effects of eugenol on the browning-related proteins and mitochondrial complex proteins in BAT. It was found that eugenol promoted the UCP-1 and PGC-1α protein expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>), as well as the mitochondrial electron transport complex III and complex V protein expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). Together, these results indicate that eugenol promotes lipolysis and browning of fat.</p>

<title>Eugenol activates TRPV1-mediated CaN/NFATc1 signaling pathway in skeletal muscle</title>
<p>Based on the gene expression profiling, it was observed that TRPV1 is expressed in all tissues, including adipose and muscle tissues, with the highest expression in skeletal muscle compared to other TRP channels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1A</xref>). qPCR analysis confirmed the expression of TRPV1 and TRPV2 in skeletal muscle, and the mRNA expression of only <italic>TRPV1</italic> was promoted by EUG50 and EUG100 in TA muscle. In C2C12 cells, only TRPV1-4 were expressed, and only <italic>TRPV1</italic> mRNA expression was promoted by 25 and 50 μM eugenol (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Adipose tissue expressed TRPV1 and TRPV2 genes, and EUG100 and EUG200 promoted <italic>TRPV1</italic> mRNA expression, while EUG50 promoted T<italic>RPV2</italic> mRNA expression (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). The effect of eugenol on TRPV1 protein expression was consistent with its effect on <italic>TRPV1</italic> mRNA expression in both skeletal muscle tissue and C2C12 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D-F</xref>). Moreover, taking the TRPV1-capsaicin binding sites (TYR511, SER512, THR550, and GLU570) (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Carnevale and Rohacs, 2016</xref></italic></bold>) as the potential binding pocket, molecular docking analysis showed that eugenol bound at the binding pocket and interacted with THR550, ASN551, LEU553, TYR554, ALA566, ILE569, GLU570, and ILE573 (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 2</xref>). Based on the above results, we conclude that eugenol has the potential to activate TRPV1 in both skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. We further investigated the TRPV1-mediated CaN/NFATc1 signaling pathway in skeletal muscle. CnA is a catalytic subunit of CaN, and its expression level reflects the activity of CaN. Our results showed that EUG50 and EUG100 increased CnA protein expression in the GAS and TA muscles (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4E</xref>), and 12.5-100 μM eugenol promoted CnA protein expression in C2C12 myotubes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). The regulator of calcineurin 1 (MCIP1) is a biomarker to reflect the CaN activity (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Yang et al., 2000</xref></italic></bold>), the mRNA expression of <italic>MCIP1</italic> was increased in EUG100 groups (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 3</xref>). Furthermore, the nuclear translocation of NFATc1 was promoted by EUG50 and EUG100 in the GAS and TA muscles, and by 12.5-50 μM eugenol in C2C12 myotubes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G-I</xref>). In summary, our <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies both suggest that eugenol can activate the TRPV1-mediated CaN/NFATc1 signaling pathway in skeletal muscle. Interestingly, similar to the effects of eugenol on muscle fiber types, we again found that high doses of eugenol have no effect on the signaling pathway.</p>

<title>Eugenol promotes fast to slow muscle fiber transformation by activating TRPV1-mediated CaN/NFATc1 signaling pathway</title>
<p>To further investigate the role of TRPV1 in regulating fast to slow muscle fibers, we treated C2C12 myotubes with 25 μM eugenol and either 1 μM TRPV1 inhibitor AMG-517 or 0.5 μM CaN inhibitor cyclosporine A (CsA).

<title>The myokines regulated by CaN</title>

<title>The myokine IL-15 expression depends on CaN/NFATc1 signaling pathway</title>
<p>Firstly, it was observed that treatment with 0.5 and 1 μM Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore led to upregulation of IL-15 protein expression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Subsequently, we treated C2C12 myotubes with 0.5 μM Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore and 0.5 μM CsA to investigate their effects. We found that Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore treatment upregulated the expression of CnA, NFATc1, and IL-15 proteins, while inhibition of CaN eliminated these effects (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B-D</xref>). Furthermore, Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore treatment increased the expression of slow MyHC and decreased the expresssion of fast MyHC, while CsA blocked this effect (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-figure supplement 1</xref>). Based on the transcription factor motif databases (JASPAR and hIFtarget), it was predicted that a sequence (5’-AATGGAAAA-3’) in the promoter regions of IL-15 was a potential binding site of NFATc1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>), and DNA-protein docking analysis also revealed a high probability of binding between this sequence and the NFATc1 protein (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>). We then performed an EMSA assay to validate the binding of NFATc1 to this sequence. The probes used in the EMSA assay were shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref> and the EMSA results were shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref>. We observed upward migration bands when the C2C12 nuclear protein extract (NE) was incubated with the bio-NFATc1 probe (lanes 2-4), and compared to the control (lane 2) and CsA inhibition group (lane 4), Ca<sup>2+</sup> treatment group showed higher expression of the band (lane 3). Moreover, the use of competing cold-NFATc1 probes showed no upward migration band (lane 5), while using the mut-NFATc1 probe again showed the band (lane 6). These findings suggest that NFATc1 may bind to the promoter of IL-15. We further investigated whether NFATc1 transcriptionally activates IL-15 through luciferase reporter assays. As shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7I</xref>, overexpression of NFATc1 promoted NFATc1 protein expression in HEK293T cells. Additionally, after transfection with the IL-15 reporter plasmid, overexpression of NFATc1 enhanced the relative fluorescence intensity (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7J</xref>), suggesting that the transcriptional activation of IL-15 is regulated by NFATc1.</p>

<title>Eugenol promotes IL-15 level by TRPV1-mediated CaN/NFATc1 signaling pathway</title>
<p>We conducted further experiments to examine the effect of eugenol on IL-15 expression. Our results (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A-C</xref>) showed that EUG50 and EUG100 promoted the mRNA and protein expression of IL-15 in both GAS and TA muscle. Interestingly, in EDL and SOL muscle, which are dominated by fast and slow muscle fibers respectively, EUG100 promoted IL-15 mRNA expression (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>). We also found that the mRNA expression of IL-15 was higher in SOL muscle than in EDL muscle (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>). Moreover, Pearson’s correlation analysis showed that IL-15 expression positively correlated with MyHC I (R=0.714) and MyHC IIa (R=0.774) expression, and negatively correlated with MyHC IIb (R=-0.568) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>). Consistent with the mRNA expression data, the IL-15 protein expression was also higher in SOL muscle than in EDL muscle (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E</xref>). Additionally, EUG50 and EUG100 increased the concentration of IL-15 in the serum (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8F</xref>). These findings suggested that IL-15 was a oxidative muscle fiber type-specific myokine that was promoted by eugenol. Our in vitro experiments showed that 25 and 50 μM eugenol increased the mRNA expression and secretion of IL-15 (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A and B</xref>), which was consistent with our in vivo experiments. In addition, the inhibition of TRPV1 and CaN decreased the upregulation of eugenol on IL-15 mRNA and protein expression (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9C and D</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study reveals that eugenol can serve as an exercise mimetic that promotes remodeling of skeletal muscle fibers and expression of the myokine IL-15 through the TRPV1-mediated CaN/NFATc1 signaling pathway. This expands the traditional biological functions of eugenol and provides a theoretical basis for its potential applications in the food and drug industry. Moreover, we identify a novel TRPV1-mediated CaN/NFATc1 signaling pathway that promotes the transformation of fast to slow muscle fibers. Importantly, we provide the first explanation of the mechanism underlying the release of the myokine IL-15.</p>
<p>TRPV1, like all other TRP channels, assembles as tetramers to form cation-permeable pores (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Clapham, 2003</xref></italic></bold>). Initially identified as a capsaicin receptor and heat-activated ion channel that modulates pain and neurogenic inflammation (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Caterina et al., 1997</xref></italic></bold>), subsequent studies have found that TRPV1 is expressed on many non-neural sites and plays roles in immunity, vasculature, obesity, and thermogenesis (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fernandes et al., 2012</xref></italic></bold>). Previous studies have also shown that capsaicin activated TRPV1 to improve endurance capacity and energy metabolism (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Luo et al., 2012</xref></italic></bold>), counter obesity (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Baskaran et al., 2016</xref></italic></bold>), and intervene diabetes (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wang et al., 2012</xref></italic></bold>). Therefore, TRPV1 is a strong target for the discovery of exercise mimetics, which drove us to search for TRPV1 agonists that may act as exercise mimetics. We focused on eugenol, a healthy and edible plant extract that may be a potential TRPV1 agonist. Since eugenol contains a vanilloyl fragment, it is possible to bind TRPV1 through a similar pattern to capsaicin. Indeed, previous studies have found that eugenol activates TRPV1 in a heterologous expression system and rat trigeminal ganglion neurons (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Xu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Yang et al., 2003</xref></italic></bold>), and a recent study reported that 50 and 100 μM eugenol promoted TRPV1 expression in C2C12 myotubes (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jiang et al., 2022</xref></italic></bold>). In our study, we investigated the mRNA expression profile of TRP channels in C2C12 myotubes and skeletal muscle, and found that only TRPV1 mRNA was upregulated in response to eugenol treatment. Moreover, it was observed that the protein expression of TRPV1 was consistent with the mRNA expression. Our molecular docking results also indicated that eugenol bound to the capsaicin binding pockets of TRPV1. Based on these findings, we propose that eugenol specifically activates TRPV1 in skeletal muscle, rather than other TRP channels. This may be due to the relatively higher expression of TRPV1 in skeletal muscle compared to other TRP channels.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of exercise mimetics for body is to promote the skeletal muscle oxidative phenotype and endurance performance (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fan and Evans, 2017</xref></italic></bold>). Our studies showed that eugenol improved endurance performance and promoted fast-to-slow muscle fiber transformation. Slow muscle fibers are characterized by the improvement in mitochondrial function and oxidative metabolism (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Choi and Kim, 2009</xref></italic></bold>). As expected, eugenol also promoted mitochondrial function and oxidative metabolism capacity in skeletal muscle. In a previous study, capsaicin-induced TRPV1 activation was shown to promote exercise endurance and the skeletal muscle oxidative phenotype (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wang et al., 2012</xref></italic></bold>). The authors suggested that TRPV1 activated calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) by increasing intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and the activation of CaMK further activated PGC-1α, contributing to these effects (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wang et al., 2012</xref></italic></bold>). In skeletal muscle, the CaN signaling pathway is also an important Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated signal that promotes the muscle oxidative phenotype (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Sakuma and Yamaguchi, 2010</xref></italic></bold>). CaN induces the translocation of NFATc1 to the nucleus by dephosphorylating NFATc1, thereby switching fast to slow muscle fibers (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Calabria et al., 2009</xref></italic></bold>). TRPV1 activation has been shown to promote CaN activity in several other cells and tissues (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Ma et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Yang et al., 2018</xref></italic></bold>), but the link between TRPV1 and CaN signaling in skeletal muscle has not yet been established, nor has it been determined whether TRPV1 promotes muscle oxidative phenotype through the CaN/NFATc1 signaling pathway. Therefore, we investigated the role of TRPV1-mediated CaN signaling pathway in the regulation of muscle fiber types. We found that eugenol increased CaN expression through the activation of TRPV1, and that it promoted fast-to-slow muscle fiber transformation via the TRPV1-mediated CaN/NFATc1 signaling pathway. Recent studies have also found that eugenol increases muscle glucose uptake through the TRPV1/CaMK signaling pathway (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jiang et al., 2022</xref></italic></bold>), suggesting that both CaN and CaMK signaling may be involved in TRPV1-facilitated skeletal muscle oxidative phenotype.</p>
<p>Another benefit of exercise mimetics is the alleviation of obesity and improvement of metabolic health. It has been reported that an increase in slow-twitch fiber content is positively associated with reduced obesity and improved metabolic health (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Carlson et al., 2010</xref></italic></bold>). Previous studies have shown that eugenol can reduce blood lipids in rats with hyperlipidemia (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Harb et al., 2019</xref></italic></bold>), lower blood glucose and insulin resistance in diabetic mice (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Al-Trad et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sanae et al., 2014</xref></italic></bold>), and reduce hepatic lipid accumulation in high-fat-fed mice (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rodrigues et al., 2022</xref></italic></bold>), demonstrating its potential in improving glucose and lipid metabolism. In our study, we found that feeding eugenol under standard diet conditions may promote fat thermogenesis and browning to facilitate fat breakdown. Interestingly, it was found that capsaicin alleviated obesity and promoted white fat browning by activating the TRPV1 (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Baskaran et al., 2016</xref></italic></bold>). Our study found that eugenol promoted TRPV1 mRNA expression in adipose tissue, indicating that eugenol may promote white fat browning through TRPV1 activation.</p>
<p>Exercise mimetics may exert beneficial effects on the body by promoting the release of myokines (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fan and Evans, 2017</xref></italic></bold>). Some myokines, such as IL-13 (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Knudsen et al., 2020</xref></italic></bold>), IL-15 (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Quinn et al., 2013</xref></italic></bold>), and neurturin (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Correia et al., 2021</xref></italic></bold>), have been well documented to improve metabolic homeostasis, promote fast to slow muscle fiber transformation, and improve endurance capacity. However, the regulatory mechanisms for myokines expression are largely unclear. Since myokines are usually promoted by muscle contraction, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> is the main signal in muscle contraction, CaN, downstream of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, has been considered to regulate myokine expression. CaN has been reported to regulate the expression of myokine IL-6 (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Banzet et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Banzet et al., 2007</xref></italic></bold>). Additionally, the transcriptional activation activity of myokines IL-4 and IL-13 is thought to be promoted by transcription factor NFATc2, which is downstream of CaN (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jacquemin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zádor, 2008</xref></italic></bold>). Based on the correlation and TFBS analysis, it was found that IL-15 is most likely to be regulated by the CaN/NFATc1 signaling pathway in our study. IL-15 has been reported as a myokine that improves fatty acid utilization, insulin sensitivity, and endurance capacity, and prevents obesity and diabetes (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Nadeau and Aguer, 2019</xref></italic></bold>). In different cell models, CsA-mediated inhibition of CaN decreased the release of IL-15 (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cho et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cho et al., 2007</xref></italic></bold>). Furthermore, an increase in CaN expression in 3T3-L1 cells was accompanied by an increase in IL-15 expression (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Almendro et al., 2009</xref></italic></bold>). Our study found that the CaN/NFATc1 signaling pathway contributes to the eugenol-promoted expression of IL-15. Furthermore, we observed that the expression of IL-15 was higher in the slow-twitch SOL muscle than in the fast-twitch EDL muscle, suggesting that an increase in muscle oxidative phenotype may further promote the release of IL-15. However, the mechanism underlying how IL-15 promotes the muscle oxidative phenotype remains unclear and requires further investigation.</p>
<p>Apparently, an interesting finding throughout our <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> study was that the high doses of eugenol (200 mg/kg for mice and 200 μM eugenol for C2C12 myotubes) had no effect on TRPV1-mediated CaN/NFATc1 signaling pathway, IL-15 expression, and muscle fiber type. We suspected that high doses of eugenol may cause desensitization of TRPV1 in skeletal muscle under our study conditions. This indirectly verified that the activation of TRPV1 does promote IL-15 expression and fast-to-slow muscle fiber transformation type. It is well-known that continuous activation of TRPV1 by capsaicin causes TRPV1 desensitization, which is considered to underlie the analgesic effects of capsaicin (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Koplas et al., 1997</xref></italic></bold>). As previously reported, TRPV1 agonists promoted TRPV1 desensitization in a dose- and time-dependent manner by targeting lysosomes to degrade TRPV1 in HEK293 cells (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Sanz-Salvador et al., 2012</xref></italic></bold>). A hypothetical model suggested that upon TRPV1 opening to allow Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binds to the CaM-binding domain of TRPV1, leading to channel inactivation, and CaN dephosphorylates TRPV1 to desensitize TRPV1 (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hasan and Zhang, 2018</xref></italic></bold>). However, most results on TRPV1 desensitization were obtained by capsaicin treatment of cells, and it is unknown whether high-dose eugenol promotes TRPV1 desensitization through a similar mechanism. Therefore, it is essential to select the appropriate dose of eugenol for the application of TRPV1 activators.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our findings indicate that eugenol can promote the transformation of fast to slow muscle fibers and induce the myokine IL-15 expression through the TRPV1-mediated CaN/NFATc1 signaling pathway. Moreover, our study is the first to demonstrate that the expression of IL-15 is regulated by the CaN/NFATc1 signaling pathway. These results suggest that eugenol may have potential as a novel exercise mimetic and that TRPV1 may represent a promising therapeutic target for metabolic disorders.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Huang et al have investigated the exercise mimetic role of Eugenol (a natural product) in skeletal muscle and whole-body fitness. The authors report that Eugenol facilitates skeletal muscle remodeling to a slower/oxidative phenotype typically associated with endurance. Eugenol also remodels the fat driving browning the WAT. In both skeletal muscle and fat Eugenol promotes oxidative capacity and mitochondrial biogenesis markers. Eugenol also improves exercise tolerance in a swimming test. Through a series of in vitro studies the authors demonstrate that eugenol may function through the trpv1 channel, Ca mobilization, and activation of CaN/NFAT signaling in the skeletal muscle to regulate slow-twitch phenotype. In addition, Eugenol also induces several myokines but mainly IL-15 through which it may exert its exercise mimetic effects. Overall, the manuscript is well-written, but there are several mechanistic gaps, physiological characterization is limited, and some data are mostly co-relative without vigorous testing (e.g. link between Eugenol, IL15 induction, and endurance). Specific major concerns are listed below.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A natural product activator of the TRPV1 channel that could elicit exercise-like effects through skeletal muscle remodeling. Potential for discovering other mechanisms of action of Eugenol.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Figure 1: Histomorphological analysis using immunostaining for type I, IIA, IIX, and IIB should be performed and quantified across different muscle groups and also in the soleus. Fiber type switch measured based on qPCR and Westerns does not sufficiently indicate the extent of fiber type switch. Better images for Fig. 1c should be provided.</p>
<p>(2) Figure 2: Histomorphological analysis for SDH and NADH-TR should be performed and quantified in different muscle groups. Seahorse or oroborous respirometry experiments should be performed to determine the actually increase in mitochondrial respiratory capacity either in isolated mitochondria or single fibers from vehicle and Eugenol-treated mice. Em for mitochondrial should be added to determine the extent of mitochondrial remodeling. The current data is insufficient to indicate the extent of mitochondrial or oxidative remodeling.</p>
<p>(3) Figure 2: Gene expression analysis is limited to a few transcriptional factors. A thorough analysis of gene expression through RNA-seq should be performed to get an unbiased effect of Eugenol on muscle transcriptome. This is especially important because eugenol is proposed to work through CaN/NFAT signaling, major transcriptional regulators of muscle phenotype.</p>

<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in the revision the authors have not addressed any of my comments with new experimental data. For example, some of the histological experiments I suggested are quite easy to do or standardize. Other in vitro experiments could also be conducted to show direct mechanistic link. The current revision does not further improve the manuscript from the 1st submission.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors examined the hypothesis that eugenol promotes myokines release and f skeletal muscles remoulding by activating the TRPV1-Ca2+-calcineurin-NFATc1 signalling pathway. They first showed that eugenol promotes skeletal muscle transformation and metabolic functions in adipose tissues by analysing changes in the expression of mRNA and proteins of relevant representative protein markers. With similar methodologies, they further found that eugenol increases the expression of mRNA and/or proteins of TRPV1, CaN, NFATC1 and IL-15 in muscle tissues. These processes were, however, prevented by inhibiting TRPV1 and CaN. Similar expression changes were also triggered by increasing intracellular Ca2+ with A23187, suggesting a Ca2+-dependent process.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Different proteins markers were used as a readout of the functions of muscles and adipose tissues and mitochondria and analysed at both mRNA and protein levels. The results were mostly consistent. Although the signaling pathway of TRPV1-Ca2+-CaN-NFAT is not new and well documented, they identified IL-15 as a new downstream target of this pathway combined with use of TRPV1 and CaN inhibitors.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Most of the evidence is limited to the molecular level lacking direct functional assays and system analysis. It will be interesting to examine the effect of eugenol on metabolic rate in animals and the role of TRPV1 in this process, as eugenol enhanced food intake without effect on body weight. TRPV1 and CaN inhibition prevented IL-15 expression in C2C12 cells (Fig.9). It remain unknown whether the effect is reproducible in native muscle tissues.</p>
<p>It is also unknown how eugenol enhances TRPV1/CaN expression and alters the expression of many other protein markers in muscle and adipose tissues. Are these effects mediated by activated NFAT or by released IL-15 forming a positive feedback loop? It should at least be discussed.</p>
<p>Many protein blots were presented but no molecular weight markers were shown. It is thus difficult to convince others that the protein bands are the right anticipated positions.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Figure 1: Histomorphological analysis using immunostaining for type I, IIA, IIX, and IIB should be performed and quantified across different muscle groups and also in the soleus. Fiber type switch measured based on qPCR and Westerns does not sufficiently indicate the extent of fiber type switch. Better images for Fig. 1c should be provided.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your suggestion. In fact, we attempted immunofluorescent staining for Slow MyHC and Fast MyHC in GAS muscle. However, for the majority of our results, we only observed positive expression of Slow MyHC in a small portion of the muscle sections (as shown in the figure below), so we did not present this result.</p>
<p>In addition, due to the size limitations on uploading image files to Biorxiv, we had to compress the images, resulting in lower resolution pictures. We have attempted to submit clearer images in Fig. 1C</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Figure 2: Histomorphological analysis for SDH and NADH-TR should be performed and quantified in different muscle groups. Seahorse or oroborous respirometry experiments should be performed to determine the actually increase in mitochondrial respiratory capacity either in isolated mitochondria or single fibers from vehicle and Eugenol-treated mice. Em for mitochondrial should be added to determine the extent of mitochondrial remodeling. The current data is insufficient to indicate the extent of mitochondrial or oxidative remodeling.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>That's a good suggestion. However, we regret to inform you that we are unable to present these results due to a lack of relevant experimental equipment and samples.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Figure 2: Gene expression analysis is limited to a few transcriptional factors. A thorough analysis of gene expression through RNA-seq should be performed to get an unbiased effect of Eugenol on muscle transcriptome. This is especially important because eugenol is proposed to work through CaN/NFAT signaling, major transcriptional regulators of muscle phenotype.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your suggestion. Indeed, we believe that in terms of reliability and accuracy, RNA-seq is not as good as RT-qPCR. The advantage of RNA-seq lies in its high throughput, making it suitable for screening unknown transcription factor regulatory mechanisms. In this study, the signaling pathways regulating myokines and muscle fiber type transformation are known and limited, with only the CaN/NFATc1 and the AMPK pathway. Since eugenol mainly acts through the Ca2+ pathway, we primarily focus on the CaN/NFATc1 signaling pathway.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) I suggest the inclusion of additional exercise or performance testing including treadmill running, wheel running, and tensiometry. Quantification with a swimming test and measurement of the exact intensity of exercise, etc. is limited.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>That's a good suggestion. We apologize for being unable to detect this indicator due to a lack of relevant experimental equipment.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your suggestion. Due to the potential damage that exhaustive swimming tests inflict on mice, the tested mice are subsequently eliminated to avoid potential interference with the experiment. Therefore, this experiment is only suitable for conducting tests at individual time points.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) The authors should also consider measuring adaptation to exercise training with or without Eugenol.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your suggestion. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether eugenol mimics exercise under standard dietary conditions. In our future research, we will consider exploring the effects of eugenol under HFD and exercise conditions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Histomorphological analysis of Wat is also lacking. EchoMRI would give a better picture of lean and fat mass.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>That's a good suggestion. However, we did not collect the slices of WAT tissue, so we are unable to supplement this result, we feel sorry for it. In addition, we apologize for being unable to detect lean and fat mass due to a lack of EchoMRI equipment.</p>

<p>(9) The experiments performed to demonstrate that Eugenol functions through trpv1 are mostly correlational. Some experiments are needed with trpv1 KO or KD instead of inhibitor.

</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your professional suggestion. AMG-517 is a specific inhibitor of TRPV1, with a much greater inhibitory effect on TRPV1 compared to other TRP channels. AMG-517 inhibits capsaicin (500 nM), acid (pH 5.0), or heat (45°C) induced Ca2+ influx in cells expressing human TRPV1, with IC50 values of 0.76 nM, 0.62 nM, and 1.3 nM, respectively. However, the IC50 values of AMG-517 for recombinant TRPV2, TRPV3, TRPV4, TRPA1, and TRPM8 cells are &gt;20 μM (Gavva, 2008). Therefore, we believe that using AMG-517 instead of TRPV1 KO cells is sufficient to demonstrate the involvement of TRPV1 in the function of eugenol.</p>
<p>While this study did not exclude the possibility of other TRP channels' involvement, it was based on the fact that eugenol does not promote mRNA expression of other TRP channels, as shown in Fig4A-C. Indeed, as far as we know, besides TRPV1, the effects of other TRP channels on myofiber type transformation remain unknown. This is an aspect that we plan to investigate in the future.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your suggestion. In the inhibition experiment, we additionally examined the expression of mitochondrial complex proteins as shown in Figure 5C. And the relevant description has been added in lines 178-183 and 764-765.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, previous studies have adequately demonstrated the regulation of skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism by IL-15. The initial aim of this experiment was to investigate the mechanism by which eugenol promotes IL-15 expression. Through inhibition assays, EMSA, and dual luciferase reporter gene experiments, we have thoroughly demonstrated that eugenol promotes IL-15 expression via the CaN/NFATc1 signaling pathway, thus establishing a novel link between CaN/NFATc1 signaling and the myokine IL-15 expression. In the subsequent experiments, we plan to knock out IL-15 in eugenol-treated C2C12 cells to explore whether IL-15 mediates the effects of eugenol. This will be another aspect of our investigation.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>As you suggested, we agree that muscle-specific TRPV1 mice should be used to conduct some experiments with eugenol. In our mice experiments, due to the lack of validation of skeletal muscle-specific TRPV1 knockout, we indeed cannot rule out that eugenol is uniquely mediating its effects through TRPV1. We acknowledge this as a limitation of our study. However, due to limitations in research funding and time, we are currently unable to supplement these experiments. Nevertheless, we believe that our results from in vitro experiments using a TRPV1 inhibitor (which selectively inhibits TRPV1) provide evidence of eugenol's action through TRPV1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Apart from Fig.2A and 2B, they mostly utilised protein expression changes as an index of tissue functional changes. Most of the data supporting the conclusions are thus rather indirect. More direct functional evidence would be more compelling. For example, a lipolysis assay could be used to measure the metabolic function of adipocytes after eugenol treatment in Fig.3. Functional activation of NFAT can be demonstrated by examining the nuclear translocation of NFAT.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your professional suggestion. Indeed, as shown in Figure 4G-I, we detected the expression of NFATc1 in the nucleus to illustrate its nuclear translocation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) To further demonstrate the role of TRPV1 channels in the effects of eugenol, TRPV1-deficient mice and tissues could also be used. Will the improved swimming test in Fig. 2B and increased CaN, NFAT, and IL-15 triggered by eugenol be all prevented in TRPV1-lacking mice and tissues?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your professional suggestion. We agree that muscle-specific TRPV1 mice should be used to conduct some experiments with eugenol. However, due to limitations in research funding and time, we are currently unable to supplement these experiments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Direct evidence of eugenol activation of TRPV1 channels in skeletal muscles is also lacking. The flow cytometry assay was used to measure Ca2+ changes in the C2C12 cell line in Fig. 5A. But this assay is rather indirect. It would be more convincing to monitor real-time activation of TRPV1 channels in skeletal muscles not in cell lines using Ca2+ imaging or electrophysiology.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your professional suggestion. As you suggested, we initially planned to use patch-clamp technique to detect membrane potential changes in skeletal muscle cells under eugenol treatment. However, due to experimental technical limitations, this experiment was not successfully conducted. Therefore, we were compelled to rely solely on flow cytometry to detect Ca2+ levels.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Most of the mRNA and protein data are consistent with each other. However, some of them are not obvious. For example, PGC1a mRNA was increased by eugenol in Fig. 2C but not seen in protein in Fig. 2D. Similarly, Complex I and V mRNA was increased in Fig. 2C but not obvious at protein levels in Fig. 2D, even though they claimed that Complex I and V were both upregulated by eugenol (see: line 123). Another example: IL-15 mRNA was increased by EUG100 but not by EUG50 in the GAS muscle in Fig. 8A. However, EUG50 increased IL-15 protein expression in Fig. 8B. Similar conflict was also seen in IL-15 expression in the TA muscle in Fig. 8A and 8C.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your question. As shown in the table below, by standardizing with β-Actin, our statistical data indeed indicate that eugenol promotes the expression of Complex I and V proteins (although the upregulation is minimal). Additionally, protein and mRNA expression do not always correlate, which may be due to potential post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your correction. As you pointed, MyHC IIa is fast-twitch oxidative muscle fiber. We have replaced ‘slow’ with ‘oxidative’ in line 235.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Fig.9C and 9D show that inhibition of TRPV1 and CaN attenuated the upregulation of IL-15 mRNA and protein by eugenol in C2C12 cell line. This result is important in demonstrating the link of TRPV1 and CaN to IL-15. It will be more interesting and physiologically relevant to perform this experiment in primary skeletal muscle cells isolated from mice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. This is indeed an interesting idea. We will attempt to continue our experiments in mice and primary porcine muscle cells in future studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) It is concerning that 4-week-old male mice were used for the study. The 4-week-old mice are immature. Adult mice over 8 weeks should be used. It is thus unknown whether the findings are broadly applicable to adult age.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your professional question. Age indeed has an impact on the muscle fiber type in mammals. Based on previously observed patterns of muscle fiber changes with age in various mammals (Katsumata et al., 2021; Pandorf et al., 2012; Hill et al., 2020), we believe that changes in muscle fiber types occur more frequently in juvenile mammals, mainly manifesting as a sharp increase in fast muscle fibers. Therefore, interventions during the juvenile stage might be more effective in promoting the transformation of fast to slow muscle fibers. As a result, in most of our group's research using nutritional interventions to regulate muscle fiber types, we tend to start interventions from the age of 4 weeks in mice. If we began intervention at 8 weeks, we speculate that the effectiveness would not be as potent as starting at 4 weeks. Below are the patterns of muscle fiber changes with age in various mammalian models, provided for reference:</p>
<p>(1) Changes in muscle fiber types with age in pigs:</p>
<p>As shown in the following figure, there is a dramatic change in the muscle fiber types 12 days post birth in pigs, especially with a sharp increase in fast muscle fibers, which continues until day 45. After 45 days of age, the changes in muscle fiber types become relatively gradual.</p>
