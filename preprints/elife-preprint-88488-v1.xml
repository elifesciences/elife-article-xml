<title>Abstract</title><p>Cyanobacteria have evolved a remarkably powerful CO<sub>2</sub> concentrating mechanism (CCM), enabling high photosynthetic rates in environments with limited inorganic carbon (Ci). Therefore, this CCM is a promising system for integration into higher plant chloroplasts to boost photosynthetic efficiency and yield. The CCM depends on active Ci uptake, facilitated by bicarbonate transporters and CO<sub>2</sub> pumps, to elevate CO<sub>2</sub> concentration around the active sites of the primary CO<sub>2</sub> fixing enzyme, Rubisco, which is encapsulated in cytoplasmic micro-compartments (carboxysomes). The essential CCM proteins have been identified, but the molecular signals and regulators that coordinate function in response to light, Ci availability and other environmental cues are largely unknown. Here, we provide evidence, based on a novel <italic>in vitro</italic> binding system, for a role of the PII-like SbtB protein in regulating Ci uptake by the bicarbonate transporter, SbtA, in response to the cellular adenylate energy charge (AEC) through dynamic protein-protein interaction. Binding of the SbtA and SbtB proteins from two phylogenetically distant species, <italic>Cyanobium sp</italic>. PCC7001 and <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic> PCC7942, was inhibited by high ATP, and promoted by low [ATP]:[ADP or AMP] ratios <italic>in vitro</italic>, consistent with a sensory response to the AEC mediated through adenylnucleotide ligand-specific conformation changes in SbtB. <italic>In vivo</italic>, cell cultures of S. elongatus showed up to 70% SbtB-dependent down-regulation of SbtA bicarbonate uptake activity specifically in the light activation phase during transitions from dark to low light when low cellular AEC is expected to limit metabolic activity. This suggests SbtB may function as a curfew protein during prolonged low cellular AEC and photosynthetically unfavourable conditions to prevent energetically futile and physiologically disadvantageous activation of SbtA.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The cyanobacterial CO<sub>2</sub> concentrating mechanism (CCM) is one of the most efficient CCMs known to date. It has been fundamental to their adaptability and successful competition in environments providing limited inorganic carbon (Ci) supply for oxygenic photosynthesis and is reflected in an estimated contribution of 30-80% global primary productivity in the oceans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Liu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Field et al., 1998</xref>). Therefore, recent efforts to enhance photosynthetic carbon fixation in crop species have focussed on introducing a synthetic cyanobacterial CCM into chloroplasts, which has been predicted to translate into 36-60% higher crop productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Price et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">McGrath and Long, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Long et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Meyer et al., 2016</xref>). The cyanobacterial CCM enables active uptake of two Ci species, CO<sub>2</sub> and bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>), which leads to accumulation of a cytoplasmic bicarbonate pool as large as 20-40 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Badger and Andrews, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Price and Badger, 1989</xref>). This bicarbonate pool supports carbonic anhydrase (CA)-mediated elevation of the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration around the primary CO<sub>2</sub>-fixing enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphoshate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) inside proteinaceous micro-compartments known as carboxysomes. Consequently, Rubisco carboxylation is enhanced over oxygenation, suppressing energetically costly photorespiration (for review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Badger and Price, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kaplan and Reinhold, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Price et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Espie and Kimber, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Price, 2011</xref>)). To date, five Ci uptake systems have been verified, varying with respect to energization, substrate affinity, flux rates and induction by low Ci conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Price, 2011</xref>). Two light-dependent, thylakoid-located CO<sub>2</sub> pumps or energy-coupled CAs, Ndh-1<sub>3</sub> and Ndh-1<sub>4</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Maeda et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Ohkawa et al., 2002</xref>), convert external and internally recaptured CO<sub>2</sub> to HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, energized by NADPH and reduced ferredoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ogawa et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Maeda et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Price et al., 2008</xref>). Three types of plasma membrane-located bicarbonate transporters, the ATP-dependent BCT1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Omata et al., 1999</xref>) and the HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> symporters BicA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Price et al., 2004</xref>) and SbtA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Shibata et al., 2002</xref>), transfer bicarbonate directly from the external environment into the cytoplasm upon activation by low Ci conditions and light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Sültemeyer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">McGinn et al., 2003</xref>). Of particular interest for a synthetic CCM is SbtA due to its ability to function in nonphotosynthetic <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Du et al., 2014</xref>). SbtA requires a Na<sup>+</sup> gradient directed from the outside to the inside of the cell for activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Shibata et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Price et al., 2004</xref>). Both CO<sub>2</sub> uptake and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transport are activated by light within 5 and 30 s, respectively, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Badger and Andrews, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Price et al., 2011</xref>). Early on, Kaplan <italic>et al</italic>. reported a gradual inactivation of Ci uptake in the dark, suggesting a link to the state of photosynthetic electron transport or a redox signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kaplan et al., 1987</xref>), but the molecular mechanisms regulating the activity of specific bicarbonate transporters are largely unknown.</p>
<p>A highly conserved feature of cyanobacterial genomes is the presence of the <italic>sbtB</italic> gene, encoding the PII-like SbtB protein, in the immediate gene neighbourhood of the <italic>sbtA</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Rae et al., 2011</xref>). Both genes are co-expressed under Ci limitation in <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic> PCC7942 and <italic>Synechocystis sp.</italic> PCC 6803 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Woodger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Schwarz et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting a functional connection between the SbtA and SbtB proteins. This has been supported by evidence from co-expression of several SbtA and SbtB proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic>, where SbtA-mediated bicarbonate uptake was specifically inactivated in the presence of the cognate SbtB protein, and a physical interaction was shown for the SbtA and SbtB proteins from <italic>S. elongatus</italic> PCC7942 (hereafter SbtA<sub>7942</sub> and SbtB<sub>7942</sub>, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Du et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, a study by Selim <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Selim et al., 2018</xref>) indicated SbtA and SbtB from <italic>Synechocystis sp.</italic> PCC6803 (hereafter SbtA<sub>6803</sub> and SbtB<sub>6803</sub>, respectively) interacted in response to Ci availability, which was enhanced by addition of ADP or AMP and diminished by cAMP. It was suggested the cAMP:AMP ratio may indirectly signal intracellular Ci levels and thus regulate SbtA<sub>6803</sub>:SbtB<sub>6803</sub> complex formation, but effects on SbtA activity were not directly assessed. Meanwhile, a broader role for SbtB<sub>6803</sub> in Ci and metabolic sensing has emerged. The same study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Selim et al., 2018</xref>) showed that the <italic>sbtB6803</italic> knockout mutant was impaired in acclimation to high Ci conditions, remaining locked in the high Ci affinity state typical of low Ci acclimation. Moreover, SbtB<sub>6803</sub> was implicated in far red light induced inhibition of photosynthetic oxygen evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Oren et al., 2021</xref>) and in bis-(3′,5′)-cyclic diadenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP) and redox state sensing linked to control of glycogen synthesis and growth performance of cyanobacterial cells during day/night cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Selim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Selim et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Structural evidence for SbtA:SbtB interaction comes from X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy, which resolved trimeric SbtA<sub>6803</sub> bound to SbtB<sub>6803</sub> trimers in the presence of AMP as a ligand to SbtB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, SbtB proteins have been classified as non-canonical PII-like members of the multi-functional PII and PII-like protein superfamily that consists of transcriptional and protein activity regulators, environmental signal transducers or sensors, widely-distributed across bacteria, archaea and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Radchenko et al., 2010</xref>). In cyanobacteria, there is substantial evidence for a central role of PII proteins in sensing and balancing the carbon and nitrogen status of the cell as part of regulatory networks that affect Ci and N acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Forchhammer and Selim, 2020</xref>). In crystals, SbtB proteins form homotrimers typical of PII with clefts between monomers forming binding sites for small effector molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Forchhammer and Lüddecke, 2016</xref>) that may bind in a competitive manner or cooperatively. Common ligands for PII proteins are ATP, ADP, Mg<sup>2+</sup> and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) which impact on protein conformation, particularly the T-loop, and the interaction with target proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Radchenko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Huergo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zeth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Forchhammer and Lüddecke, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Forchhammer and Selim, 2020</xref>). Ligands for cyanobacterial PII-like proteins include ADP and bicarbonate for the carboxysome-associated CPII from <italic>Thiomonas intermedia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Wheatley et al., 2016</xref>), and adenylnucleotides for the SbtB<sub>6803</sub> protein, i.e. ATP, ADP, AMP, cAMP and c-di-AMP(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Selim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Selim et al., 2021</xref>) and the SbtB protein from <italic>Cyanobium sp.</italic> PCC7001 (SbtB<sub>7001</sub>), i.e. cAMP, AMP, ADP, ATP and Ca<sup>2+</sup>ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kaczmarski et al., 2019</xref>). SbtB<sub>6803</sub> and SbtB<sub>7001</sub> share the basic architecture, but differ in ligand-coordinating residues, ligand affinities and ligand-induced conformation changes. Recently, SbtB<sub>6803</sub> was shown to exert apyrase activity, slowly converting ATP ligands to AMP in a redox state-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Selim et al., 2023</xref>). Apyrase activity was tightly linked to the oxidation and disulfide bond formation between cysteines of the C-terminal R-loop, which is an extension that is present on a subset of SbtB proteins but not in SbtB<sub>7001</sub> and SbtB<sub>7942</sub>. Therefore, one may expect fundamental mechanistic differences from SbtB<sub>6803</sub>.</p>
<p>The energy status of living cells is reflected in the relative abundance rather than absolute concentrations of the adenylnucleotides ATP, ADP and AMP and referred to as the cellular adenylate energy charge (AEC), described quantitatively as ([ATP]+0.5[ADP])/([ATP]+[ADP]+[AMP]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chapman et al., 1971</xref>). Intriguingly, SbtB<sub>7001</sub> had 18 to 38-fold higher binding affinities for ATP over ADP, AMP and cAMP in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kaczmarski et al., 2019</xref>), which suggested to us certain SbtB proteins may sense the AEC directly and dynamically interact with SbtA in response to changes in adenylate nucleotide ratios. We propose that the adenylnucleotide ligand-induced structural changes observed for SbtB proteins determine SbtA:SbtB complex formation and control of the SbtA activation state. Here, we demonstrate that the adenylnucleotides ATP, ADP, AMP and cAMP regulate <italic>in vitro</italic> binding of SbtA (SbtA<sub>7001</sub>) from <italic>Cyanobium sp.</italic> PCC7001 and SbtA<sub>7942</sub> to their cognate SbtB proteins, and present <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of SbtB on SbtA activity in cyanobacteria linked to light-induced changes in AEC, consistent with a role of SbtB as AEC sensor and response regulator.</p>

<title>SbtA:SbtB complex formation is affected specifically by adenylnucleotides</title>
<p>For SbtA:SbtB interaction studies, we co-expressed SbtA<sub>7001</sub>, or SbtA<sub>7942</sub>, with their cognate SbtB proteins which were C-terminally tagged with human influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope and 5 or 6 histidines (His) in the <italic>E.coli</italic> strain DH5α (<italic>E. coli</italic>) and in a bicarbonate transporter-deficient <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic> PCC7942 mutant (<italic>Synechococcus</italic> ΔCS). The SbtB<sub>7001</sub> and SbtB<sub>7942</sub> protein were identified immunologically at 13 kDa, consistent with their calculated molecular weights, but the apparent molecular weights of SbtA<sub>7001</sub> and SbtA<sub>7942</sub> monomers (23 kDa and 29 kDa, respectively) were 11 kDa lower than their calculated molecular weights, as is commonly observed for membrane proteins and attributed to altered protein-SDS detergent interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Rath et al., 2009</xref>). Specific binding of SbtA to SbtB proteins was evaluated <italic>in vitro</italic> by metal immobilized chromatography (IMAC) using membrane-enriched, native protein extracts that contained both SbtA and HAHis-tagged SbtB proteins (<bold>Fig. S1</bold>). Only the HAHis-SbtB but no SbtA protein was found to attach to Ni<sup>2+</sup> coated beads which ensured co-elution of SbtA and SbtB from the beads was exclusively due to the interaction of the two proteins. The <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assays without addition of effectors showed that SbtA and SbtB were largely dissociated in native protein extracts (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>, S2</bold>), which led us to focus on the association of SbtA:SbtB complexes in response to a range of potential effector molecules and co-factors reported to interact with PII and PII-like proteins. Based on our previous observation that SbtB<sub>7001</sub> binds ATP, ADP, AMP and cAMP with micromolar affinities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kaczmarski et al., 2019</xref>), we expected SbtA:SbtB complex formation and dissociation be affected by these molecules. Since Ca<sup>2+</sup> enhanced binding of ATP to SbtB<sub>7001</sub> <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kaczmarski et al., 2019</xref>), we also included 200 nM Ca<sup>2+</sup> in binding assays as a potential cofactor, which was equivalent to the basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in cyanobacterial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Leganés et al., 2009</xref>) did not facilitate SbtA:SbtB binding by itself (<bold>Fig. S2</bold>).</p>

<p>In addition, a potential link between stabilization of SbtA:SbtB complexes and photosynthetic activity was tested, but SbtA:SbtB binding was not affected by the Calvin-Benson-Basham (CBB) cycle intermediates ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RUBP), 3-phosphoglycerate (3PGA) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref></bold>). Similarly, 2OG which is generated in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and acts a master regulatory metabolite coordinating carbon and nitrogen metabolism in association with canonical PII proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Huergo and Dixon, 2015</xref>), did not facilitate SbtA:SbtB complex formation (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref></bold>).Combined with ATP or ADP, 2OG had no synergistic effect (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref></bold>), in contrast to the prerequisite binding of Mg<sup>2+</sup>ATP to the <italic>E. coli</italic> PII protein for 2OG to become effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Radchenko et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, we investigated possible substrate-level regulation of SbtA activity via HCO <sup>-</sup>-dependent complex formation with SbtB. HCO <sup>-</sup> had no effect on SbtA:SbtB binding irrespective of combinations with Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Mg<sup>2+</sup>, ATP or AMP (<bold>Fig. S2, S3</bold>). In summary, we observed that small molecule effectors unable to bind to SbtB<sub>7001</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kaczmarski et al., 2019</xref>), were equally ineffective in mediating the binding of either SbtA-SbtB pair.

<title>The AEC simulated by adenylnucleotide ratios determined the SbtA:SbtB complex formation</title>
<p>The fact that SbtA:SbtB complexes were destabilized by ATP and stabilized by either ADP or AMP, strongly suggested complex formation would be impacted by changes in the cellular adenylate energy charge (AEC). Therefore, we simulated defined energy charge environments <italic>in vitro</italic> with different molar ratios of ATP:ADP or ATP:AMP within a constant total adenylnucleotide pool of 2 mM. Both SbtA-SbtB pairs, irrespective of expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> or <italic>Synechococcus</italic> ΔCS, showed decreasing amounts of SbtA bound to SbtB with an increasingly higher proportion of ATP over ADP (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-D</xref></bold>) and AMP (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E,F</xref></bold>). Since both SbtA-SbtB pairs were unbound in the presence of cAMP (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref></bold>), we replaced ATP with cAMP to test whether SbtA:SbtB binding could be affected by the molar ratios of cAMP to ADP or AMP, similar to what has been reported for the SbtA<sub>6803</sub>-SbtB<sub>6803</sub> pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Selim et al., 2018</xref>). It was indeed possible to impair SbtA:SbtB binding with high cAMP:ADP or AMP ratios (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref></bold>). However, to evaluate the effects of cAMP in relation to ATP, it is important to recognize that ATP concentrations up to 2 mM corresponded to the physiological range of intracellular ATP pools measured in several bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Thauer et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Yaginuma et al., 2014</xref>), whereas estimates of cAMP levels in cyanobacterial cells have been up to 1000-fold lower than the intracellular ATP levels, i.e. in the nano- to micromolar range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ohmori and Okamoto, 2004</xref>).

The lowest tested cAMP to ADP or AMP ratio of 0.2 (95 µM cAMP: 1.905 mM ADP or AMP) is within physiologically relevant range and cAMP did not affect the association of either SbtA-SbtB pair. Therefore, changes in cAMP concentrations expected to occur <italic>in vivo</italic> are likely inconsequential compared to the variations in intracellular ATP levels and the AEC.</p>

Comparing the adenylnucleotide ratios supporting 50% (AR<sub>50</sub>) or 10% (AR<sub>10</sub>) of the maximum levels of SbtA bound to SbtB, derived from curve fits in <bold>Fig. S4</bold>, differences between the two SbtA-SbtB pairs and in response to the four different adenylnucleotide combinations tested were statistically not significant (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref></bold>).

<title>SbtA activity <italic>in vivo</italic> is modulated by SbtB and the light-stimulated adenylate energy charge</title>
<p>Inside photosynthetic cyanobacterial cells, SbtA and SbtB proteins are both present when Ci supply is low (<bold>Fig. S1A</bold>). In nonphotosynthetic <italic>E. coli</italic>, SbtA appeared to be constitutively inactivated in the presence of SbtB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Du et al., 2014</xref>), which implied AEC levels were low under those experimental conditions. In cyanobacteria, however, SbtA is active irrespective of SbtB when photosynthesis is fully light-activated and cells operate at high AEC levels (<bold>Figs. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">S6</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">S7</xref></bold>). Therefore, it was of interest to investigate SbtA function in low Ci combined with low AEC states which are prominent during dark-to-low light transitions. Photosynthetic performance and uptake of <sup>14</sup>C-labelled HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in <italic>Synechococcus</italic> ΔCS expressing SbtA<sub>7942</sub> as the only HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake system was compared either with or without SbtB<sub>7942</sub> (SbtAB and SbtA, respectively). Note that concurrent CO<sub>2</sub> uptake by Ndh-1<sub>3/4</sub> complexes was eliminated by addition of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor ethoxyzolamide (EZ), which does not affect SbtA function (<bold>Fig. S5</bold>), and measurements were performed at pH 8.0 where HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> represents 98% of the Ci pool. Under these conditions, the cells fully depended on SbtA activity for inorganic carbon supply. At light intensities above the light compensation point, O<sub>2</sub> evolution rates directly reflected the activity of SbtA<sub>7942</sub>. In Ci-starved cell cultures steady-state photosynthetic rates in response to incremental additions of bicarbonate were essentially the same for SbtA and SbtAB with substrate affinities (<italic>K</italic><sub>0.5Ci</sub>; 9 ± 4 and 30 ± 5 µM Ci, respectively) and maximum rates of photosynthetic O<sub>2</sub> evolution (<italic>V</italic><sub>maxO2</sub>; 164 ± 19 and 167 ± 12 µmol mg Chl<italic>a</italic> <sup>-1</sup> h <sup>-1</sup>, respectively) (<bold>Fig. S6</bold>). Similarly, alternating light intensities between 1400 and 200 µmol photons m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> in the presence of saturating Ci levels (250-500 µM) did not lead to discernible differences between SbtA and SbtAB in steady state HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake or photosynthetic O<sub>2</sub> evolution rates (<bold>Fig. S7</bold>). Together, this suggested SbtB is not required for and does not regulate SbtA<sub>7942</sub> activity once photosynthesis has been fully activated in response to light-intensity driven changes in carboxylation rates and Ci demand.</p>

<p>In contrast, SbtB clearly modulated SbtA function in the initial phase of dark-to-low light transitions. After an hour of dark-adaptation, cells co-expressing SbtA and SbtB were unable to activate SbtA<sub>7942</sub>-dependent photosynthetic O<sub>2</sub> evolution to the same extent as cells expressing SbtA alone during the initially low light phase of light response measurements, when light levels were below or near the light compensation point of 10-15 µmol photons m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref></bold>). Low light activation of <sup>14</sup>C-labelled HCO <sup>-</sup> uptake by SbtA<sub>7942</sub> clearly showed SbtA activation was strongly suppressed in the presence of SbtB<sub>7942</sub> during the first 30-60 s after long-term dark-adaptation, reducing net SbtA activity to 31% and 38% of the activity observed in the absence of SbtB at pH 8 and pH 9, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref></bold>). Since many photosynthetic processes are almost instantaneously inactivated in the dark, we tested whether SbtB affected [<sup>14</sup>C]HCO <sup>-</sup> uptake by SbtA during light to dark transition. Interestingly, SbtA<sub>7942</sub> was fully inactivated within 15 s after cells were shifted from light into the dark without any effect on the inactivation kinetics by the presence of the SbtB<sub>7942</sub> protein (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref></bold>). Altogether this suggests, SbtA activity is regulated at multiple levels, which may be SbtB-independent, but also involve SbtB and AEC coupled regulation of SbtA activity demonstrated by dark-to-light activation kinetics of SbtA.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Allosteric regulation of cyanobacterial bicarbonate transporters has been an unresolved question for quite some time with patchy evidence for diverse mechanisms and co-factors that may be involved. It has already been established that SbtB is capable of exerting negative regulation on SbtA bicarbonate uptake activity in a heterologous expression system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Du et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we provide evidence for regulation of two SbtA bicarbonate transporters by protein-protein interaction with their cognate PII-like SbtB proteins in response to the <italic>in vitro</italic> simulation and <italic>in vivo</italic> modulation of the adenylate energy charge. The SbtA-SbtB pairs originated from the transitional α-cyanobacterium <italic>Cyanobium sp.</italic> PCC7001 and the ẞ-cyanobacterium <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic> PCC7942, which are phylogenetically relatively distant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Rae et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Sánchez-Baracaldo et al., 2019</xref>) but share overall sequence homology at the amino acid level, with 60% identity between the two SbtA (<bold>Fig. S9A, S10</bold>) and 58% identity between the two SbtB (<bold>Fig. S9B, S11</bold>) proteins. Importantly, the modelled structures of SbtA<sub>7001</sub> compared to SbtA<sub>7942</sub> and SbtB<sub>7001</sub> compared to SbtB<sub>7942</sub> are nearly identical based on three-dimensional models (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref></bold>). Together with convincingly similar interaction profiles for both SbtA-SbtB pairs, we concluded they likely share the same overall regulatory mechanisms. It should be noted that about 50% of the cyanobacterial SbtB family, which includes the SbtB proteins studied here, lack a putative redox regulatory domain on the C-terminus, as typically found on SbtB of <italic>Synechocystis sp.</italic> PCC6803 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Selim et al., 2023</xref>). This makes the present two SbtAB pairs a simpler system for studying the nature of the primary signal(s) that direct allosteric inactivation/activation of SbtA.</p>

<title>The AEC rather than cAMP is the probable primary effector determining SbtA:SbtB interactions</title>
<p>Intracellular adenylnucleotide pools invariably contain ATP, ADP, AMP and cAMP, albeit relative concentrations may vary rapidly dependent on metabolic activity in response to environmental and developmental factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">De la Fuente et al., 2014</xref>). In cyanobacteria, cAMP is predominantly a secondary messenger participating in different signalling events, whereas the relative abundances of ATP, ADP and AMP define and communicate the cellular energy status. Notwithstanding, both processes could translate Ci availability and Ci demand into SbtB-mediated regulation of SbtA. In addition, relative abundances of cAMP, ATP and AMP in the adenylate pool are interdependently influenced by the activities of adenylate cyclase and phosphodiesterases which catalyze cAMP synthesis from ATP and hydrolytic degradation to AMP, respectively; depending on the species, adenylate cyclase activity is stimulated by N and P deficiency, osmotic stress, light quality and in some cases also bicarbonate or CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cann, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hammer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Xu and Su, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agostoni and Montgomery, 2014</xref>), potentially linking cAMP and Ci sensing.</p>
<p>Initially, evidence from <italic>Synechocystis sp.</italic> PCC6803 suggested the cAMP:AMP ratios determined formation of SbtA:SbtB complexes and SbtA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Selim et al., 2018</xref>). SbtB<sub>6803</sub> was proposed to be a novel cAMP receptor sensing the Ci status and mediating acclimation of the CCM to high Ci levels, based on impaired acclimation in mutant cell lines lacking SbtB. In that study, high Ci acclimated cells showed the expected general downregulation of Ci uptake alongside relatively higher cAMP levels and cAMP:AMP ratios than in low Ci acclimated cells. However, SbtB<sub>6803</sub> was dissociated from SbtA<sub>6803</sub> which implied SbtA was inactive in its unbound state. Conversely, bicarbonate uptake was upregulated in low Ci acclimated cells with high AMP levels and low cAMP:AMP ratios, which favoured formation of SbtA:SbtB complexes, and therefore suggested SbtA was active when bound to SbtB. Those findings were difficult to reconcile with the simple interaction model for SbtB-mediated SbtA regulation in <italic>E. coli</italic>, where SbtA alone showed activity and co-expression of SbtA and SbtB inhibited SbtA-dependent bicarbonate uptake, including the SbtA<sub>6803</sub>-SbtB<sub>6803</sub> pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Du et al., 2014</xref>). Meanwhile, regulation of SbtA<sub>6803</sub> has been revised based on the finding that SbtB<sub>6803</sub> displays high affinity binding to SbtA only with AMP as ligand and when the R-loop Cys residues are oxidized, which appeared to be the only condition for T-loop conformation that permits binding to SbtA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Selim et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>The binding analyses performed here (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref></bold>), and the fact that the R-loop is absent from SbtB<sub>7001</sub> and SbtB<sub>7942</sub> (<bold>Fig. S9B</bold>), clearly support the view that low levels of ATP and low ATP:ADP and AMP ratios, representing a low AEC, determine the association of SbtA<sub>7001</sub>-SbtB<sub>7001</sub> and SbtA<sub>7942</sub>-SbtB<sub>7942</sub> pairs rather than cAMP levels and redox state of SbtB. Considering, that the cAMP concentrations that effectively prevented the <italic>in vitro</italic> association of SbtA and SbtB were up to 1000-fold higher than physiological levels of CAMP in cyanobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ohmori and Okamoto, 2004</xref>), it seems unlikely the intracellular concentration of cAMP required for effective competition with ATP for binding sites on SbtB would occur <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, the 6-12 times higher binding affinity of SbtB<sub>7001</sub> for ATP over cAMP, ADP or AMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kaczmarski et al., 2019</xref>) is consistent with the proposed AEC-dependent regulation of these SbtA-SbtB pairs. This AEC control of SbtA via binding/unbinding of SbtB might be a feature across many cyanobacteria, but further experimentation is required to confirm this.</p>

Regulatory proteins often sense the AEC through competitive binding of ATP or ADP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Atkinson and Walton, 1967</xref>), which includes PII proteins that regulate target enzyme activity by undergoing specific conformational changes in response to binding ATP or ADP, which alters the interaction between the PII protein and its target and modulates the activity of the target protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Radchenko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zeth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Selim et al., 2019</xref>). This principle also appears to apply to the interaction of the PII-like SbtB proteins with respective SbtA transporters from both cyanobacterial species investigated. More than 90% of SbtA was unbound (proposed active state) at a simulated AEC of 0.74 to 0.91 (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref>, 5</bold>) approximating measured ATP/(ATP+ADP) ratios of 0.8 to 0.9 reported for <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic> (formerly <italic>Anacystis nidulans</italic>) ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Rust et al., 2011</xref>), recalculated from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bornefeld and Simonis, 1974</xref>)) and the thermophile <italic>Synechococcus</italic> strain Y-7c-s in medium light (250-270 µmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kallas and Castenholz, 1982</xref>). This suggests, in the light, photosynthetically active cyanobacterial cells would maintain an almost fully active pool of SbtA, if the AEC was the defining parameter. The fact that SbtA<sub>7942</sub> activity was the same for photosynthetically fully activated <italic>Synechococcus</italic> ΔCS strains expressing either SbtA or SbtA and SbtB (<bold>Fig. S6</bold>, <bold>S7</bold>) supports the notion that SbtB had in fact fully dissociated from SbtA and did not limit SbtA activity at high AEC. Without photosynthetic ATP production in the dark, or during excessive cellular energy demand such as sudden decreases in light intensity and nutrient, pH or temperature stress, the AEC is likely to decrease substantially in cyanobacterial cells. In <italic>S. elongatus</italic>, the ATP:ADP ratio, was reduced to 0.55-0.6 about 10 min after light to dark transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kallas and Castenholz, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Rust et al., 2011</xref>). Based on our <italic>in vitro</italic> binding analysis, this suggests, on average more than 50% of both SbtA7001 and SbtA7942 should be bound to their respective SbtB proteins and form a stably-inactivated SbtA pool in prolonged darkness. During light exposure, after long dark periods, it can take from seconds to minutes for the cellular AEC to reach 0.8-0.9, dependent on light intensity and activation of CO<sub>2</sub> fixation by Rubisco and the CBB cycle enzymes. Indeed, low light (70-100 µmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) did not increase the AEC beyond 0.6 in thermophilic <italic>Synechococcus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kallas and Castenholz, 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>Importantly, when <italic>Synechococcus</italic> ΔCS strains expressing either SbtA or SbtA and SbtB were analysed in dark-to-low light transitions, equivalent to raising AEC ratios from about 0.5 to 0.8-0.9, we detected a transient and marked retardation in SbtA-dependent bicarbonate uptake, decreasing SbtA activity by 60-70% when SbtB was present compared to SbtA alone in the initial low light (30-50 µmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) phase (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, B</bold>). Assuming an AEC of 0.6 in low light, similar to Kallas <italic>et al</italic>., around 50% of SbtA should still have been associated with SbtB (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref>, 5</bold>). In our view, this is a convincing indication that a rise in AEC is needed to displace the inhibitory SbtB curfew protein for SbtA activation during this transition and that this takes a few seconds to achieve. Despite the technical difficulty, future work looking at correlations between time-resolved AEC changes and bicarbonate uptake in <italic>Synechococcus</italic> ΔCS strains should be able to test this further.</p>

<title>Adenylnucleotide-dependent conformation changes of SbtB aligns with regulatory binding to SbtA</title>
<p>Structural information of SbtA:SbtB complexes and binding of adenylate ligands to SbtB strongly support the aforementioned AEC-dependent regulation of the SbtA:SbtB interaction <italic>in vitro</italic>. Inevitably, uncertainty exists in extrapolating from <italic>in vitro</italic> findings to implications for <italic>in vivo</italic> regulation. However, the case of regulation of SbtA by adenylate charge is at least feasible, especially for the significant class of SbtA-SbtB-containing species that lack the putative C-terminal redox regulatory domain on SbtB. The core structures and key amino acids involved in ligand binding that are thought to facilitate SbtA:SbtB interactions are highly conserved between crystal structures of SbtB<sub>6803</sub> and SbtB<sub>7001</sub> and homology models of SbtB<sub>7942</sub> (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figs. 7B,C</xref>, S10</bold>) as well as crystallized SbtA<sub>6803</sub> and homology models of SbtA<sub>7001</sub> and SbtA<sub>7942</sub> (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figs. 7A,C</xref>, S10A, S12</bold>), which lends some validity to propose a generalized model for the regulatory interaction of subsets of those SbtB proteins missing the R-loop and their cognate SbtA proteins. In PII proteins, the surface-exposed, flexible T-loop has been shown to mediate the regulatory interaction with target protein(s). Upon binding small effector molecules, ligand-induced conformation changes determine whether PII binds to its target. For example, binding of ATP to the PII protein from <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic> PCC7942 induced T-loop conformation changes that facilitated association with N-acetyl-glutamate kinase (NAGK) and arginine synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zeth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Selim et al., 2019</xref>), and the ADP-stabilized T-loop of the PII protein GlnK from <italic>E. coli</italic> enable formation of an inactivating complex with the ammonium transporter AMTB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Radchenko et al., 2010</xref>). Crystallographic data support a direct correlation, analogous to PII proteins, between adenylate-ligand induced changes in T-loop conformation of SbtB proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Selim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kaczmarski et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Selim et al., 2023</xref>) and can explain the opposite effects of ATP and ADP or AMP on SbtA:SbtB binding described here. The probability for each adenylate ligand to occupy a nucleotide binding site would depend on the binding affinity and the local concentration of the ligand. At high ATP:ADP or AMP ratios, when predominantly Ca<sup>2+</sup>ATP is likely to occupy the nucleotide binding sites of the SbtB<sub>7001</sub> trimers, the T-loops are probably stabilized (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B,C</xref></bold>) through interactions of specific residues with the γ-phosphate of ATP, in a position close to the core overlapping the binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kaczmarski et al., 2019</xref>). When superimposed onto SbtB<sub>6803</sub> in the trimeric SbtA-SbtB cryo-EM structure, it becomes apparent that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>ATP-induced stable T-loop conformation of SbtB<sub>7001</sub> interferes with binding to SbtA (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref></bold>), which would allow SbtA to be fully active. In contrast, at low ATP:ADP or AMP ratios, occupation of the binding site mostly by ADP or AMP (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B,C</xref></bold>) would leave the T-loops in a disordered or extended conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kaczmarski et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fang et al., 2021</xref>), which would enable formation of inactivated SbtA:SbtB complexes.</p>

<title>A proposed model implicating SbtB in the regulation of SbtA activity in cyanobacteria</title>
<p>For cyanobacteria, it is a selective advantage to maximize photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> fixation and carbon gain for growth in the light. In the dark, photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> fixation ceases making Ci acquisition redundant and energetically futile. Additionally, continued accumulation of large amounts of bicarbonate may disrupt intracellular pH and ion homeostasis, particularly if [Na<sup>+</sup>] were to build up by HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> symport due to SbtA activity. Therefore, the co-ordinated regulation of Ci acquisition and photosynthetic activity may be an imperative for optimal survival and success of cyanobacteria. A hypothetical scenario for the regulation of bicarbonate uptake by SbtA in cyanobacteria is depicted in <bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref></bold>, assuming functional units of both SbtA and SbtB proteins are trimers as indicated by cryo-EM and crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kaczmarski et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fang et al., 2021</xref>). In <italic>Synechococcus</italic>, SbtA function is subject to several regulatory mechanisms operating at different time scales. In constant light and stress-free environments, bicarbonate uptake rates of SbtA are clearly a product of light intensity and Ci availability, independent of the SbtB protein (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6</xref></bold>, <bold>S7</bold>). In light/dark cycles, SbtA is turned on and off within a few seconds (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref></bold>) in sync with the light-induced changes in Ci demand for photosynthetic carboxylation, likely preventing the aforementioned complications associated with bicarbonate and Na<sup>+</sup> over-accumulation. The nature of the signals and signal transduction pathways triggering the fast activation-deactivation kinetics of SbtA may be complex and cannot be precisely known at this stage, but some details can be envisaged. SbtA-mediated bicarbonate uptake is immediately inactivated after a light-dark transition supposedly associated with a drop in the AEC, assuming a similar decrease of the ATP/(ATP+ADP) ratio from 0.85 to about 0.4 observed in <italic>S. elongatus</italic> previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bornefeld and Simonis, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Takano et al., 2015</xref>). If AEC-induced binding of SbtB was the primary inactivation mechanism during the light-to-dark transition, one would expect de-regulation of SbtA activity in the absence of SbtB. Yet, SbtA-mediated bicarbonate uptake ceased within 15 s in the dark irrespective of the presence of SbtB (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref></bold>), which suggested the initial fast inactivation of SbtA may be mediated by any one or a combination of other signals derived from the many dark-induced changes in the cell which may involve the more oxidized redox state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Tamoi et al., 2005</xref>), changes in net availability of ATP, in plasma membrane energization potentially involving Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Torrecilla et al., 2004</xref>), in the transmembrane Na<sup>+</sup> gradient, and in protein post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Spät et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Angeleri et al., 2016</xref>). Many of these changes are likely faster than a possible low-AEC-induced SbtA:SbtB association. On the other hand, we did detect significant differences in the activation of bicarbonate uptake upon transition from dark to light (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), indicating low AEC-induced formation of inactive SbtA:SbtB complexes in the dark delayed activation of SbtA until light-dependent increase in AEC was sufficient to facilitate the dissociation of SbtB and SbtA.</p>

<caption><title>Proposed model for regulation of SbtA bicarbonate transport activity involving SbtB by environmental stimuli and the adenylate energy charge (AEC).</title>
<p>In the light, expression of SbtA and SbtB in <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic> is induced by low Ci availability. The plasma membrane (pm)-integral SbtA trimer(SbtA<sub>3</sub>) actively transports bicarbonate from the external environment (ext) into the cytoplasm (cyto) presumably dissociated from SbtB. SbtA activity depends on Na<sup>+</sup>-symport and requires a cell-inward-directed Na<sup>+</sup> gradient with a probable HCO<sub>3-</sub>:Na<sup>+</sup> symport stoichiometry of 1:1 through each monomer. Light-stimulated photosynthetic electron transport sustains high levels of intracellular ATP over ADP and AMP, i.e. high AEC, which facilitates binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup>ATP to SbtB trimers (SbtB<sub>3</sub>), stabilizing the SbtB T-loops, and SbtB remains dissociated from SbtA. In prolonged darkness, cells operate at a lower AEC. Relatively higher amounts of ADP and AMP replace ATP as ligands in SbtB trimers, which favours open T-loops, and inactive SbtA:SbtB complexes are formed. In such scenario, SbtA reactivation after a transition from dark to light would depend on the rate of increase in AEC and concomitant AEC-dependent dissociation of SbtB.</p></caption>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The adenylate-specific binding of SbtB to SbtA suggests that <italic>in vivo</italic> SbtA trimers become locked into an inactive state when the cellular adenylate energy charge is low, as is the case in low light or darkness. This becomes evident from delay of SbtB-dependent re-activation of SbtA. According to our hypothesis, low AEC-induced binding of SbtB to SbtA provides a curfew mechanism that ensures SbtA activity is tuned to the capacity for photosynthetic C-fixation and tied to the energy resources available. This mechanism may have evolved to override environmental and intrinsic cues that may otherwise induce futile activation/inactivation cycles or activation of SbtA under conditions that demand strategic investment of energy in cell survival rather than maximum growth. Limited light, prolonged nutrient stress or environmental stress may require channelling of resources into maintenance and protective processes instead of maximum photosynthesis and Ci accumulation. It will be of interest to investigate to which extent AEC/SbtB-mediated regulation SbtA has been adopted across cyanobacterial species. The general mechanism of energy charge-sensing via SbtB and its interaction with SbtA is increasingly supported by experimental evidence, however, the precise details are far from being fully understood. Further elucidation of molecular and biochemical mechanisms and further substantiation of the role of the AEC in SbtA:SbtB complex formation <italic>in vivo</italic> under different environmental conditions are challenges for future work. Nonetheless, the link between SbtB as a sensor of the cellular energy status and response regulator of SbtA activity is an important novel insight which may aid development of informed strategies for expression of SbtA-SbtB systems in higher plant chloroplasts.</p>

Immunological detection was performed in Tris-Saline buffer (20 mM Tris, 137 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.5) with 5% (w/v) skim milk powder as blocking reagent. SbtA protein was detected with a polyclonal antibody generated against a conserved 14 amino acid-epitope (Agrisera, Sweden). The HAHis-tagged SbtB proteins were detected with monoclonal antibodies against the HA-epitope (Sigma, USA). Secondary, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibodies (Bio-Rad, USA) were used for fluorometric detection of the immune-reactive bands with the AttoPhos system (Promega, USA). The fluorescence signal was visualized with a ChemiDoc™ MP imaging system (Biorad, USA). The relative signal intensities were quantified based on global background-corrected pixel volumes using ImageLab software (Bio-Rad, USA). Amounts of SbtA protein retained in complexes by binding to SbtB (pixel volumes; y) were plotted against adenylnucleotide ratios (AR; x), using OriginPro v2020 software (OriginLab Corp., USA). The non-linear correlation was fitted by a type 1 sigmoidal-logistic function (<italic>F</italic>(x) = y = A/(1 + e<sup>-<italic>k</italic>*(x-xc)</sup>)), with A as maximum amount of SbtA bound<italic>, k</italic> as rate (binding) coefficient, and xc as the AR at the inflection point. The adenylnucleotide ratios corresponding to 50% (AR<sub>50</sub>) and 10% (AR<sub>10</sub>) of SbtA bound to SbtB were estimated from the sigmoidal logistic fitted curves normalized to residual SbtA detected at AR=1.</p>

<title>Photosynthetic analysis by membrane inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS) measurements</title>
<p>Net photosynthetic O<sub>2</sub> evolution and Ci uptake rates were calculated from changes in the concentrations of dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> in aqueous cyanobacterial cell suspensions measured in a closed custom-built, temperature-controlled cuvette attached to a mass spectrometer (Isoprime IRMS series, Micromass, UK) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Badger and Andrews, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Badger et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Price et al., 2004</xref>). The inside of cuvette was separated from the inlet to the mass spectrometer by a gas permeable membrane. Low Ci-induced cell cultures were harvested by centrifugation (4 min, 4000 <italic>g</italic>, 23 °C), washed once with CO<sub>2</sub>-free BTP (1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane) assay buffer (20 mM BTP buffered modified Bg-11(-NO<sub>3</sub>), 20 mM NaCl, pH 8.0), and resuspended at cell densities equal to 4 µg ml<sup>-1</sup> Chl<italic>a</italic>. Chl<italic>a</italic> content was determined spectrophotometrically in 90% (v/v) methanol extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Porra et al., 1989</xref>). Measurements were performed at 30 °C which is equivalent to the growth temperature for cell cultures. During MIMS measurements, CO<sub>2</sub> uptake was inhibited with 500 µM ethoxyzolamide (EZ). Steady state photosynthetic O<sub>2</sub> evolution in response to light intensity was recorded for cell suspension cultures equilibrated with 1 mM HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> which constitutes &gt; 98% of the available Ci at pH 8. Illumination (KL1500 HAL light source, Schott, Germany) was increased stepwise from 0 to 15, 50, 200, 490, 850 and 1100 µmol photons m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. Respiration rates were estimated from O<sub>2</sub> consumption in the dark. Prior to MIMS measurements of Ci response curves, cell cultures were depleted for Ci by bubbling with N<sub>2</sub> in white light (400 µmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) for at least 10 min and photosynthetic O<sub>2</sub> evolution rates recorded following incremental additions of bicarbonate. Steady state O<sub>2</sub> evolution rates (<italic>V</italic>) normalized to Chl<italic>a</italic> contents were plotted against Ci substrate (S) concentrations, and resulting curves were fitted by the Michaelis-Menten equation, <italic>V</italic> = (<italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> [S])/(<italic>k</italic><sub>0.5</sub> + [S], using OriginPro v2021 software. Maximum O<sub>2</sub> evolution rates (<italic>V</italic><sub>maxO2</sub>) were calculated as an approximation for maximum bicarbonate uptake by SbtA. Affinity of SbtA for HCO <sup>-</sup> was deduced from the Ci concentration supporting half-maximal activity (<italic>k</italic><sub>0.5Ci</sub>). Effects of 300 s-illuminations with high (HL, 1400 µmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) and low (LL, 200 µmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) white light on HCO <sup>-</sup>uptake and steady state O evolution rates were determined in cell cultures that had been equilibrated in the dark after addition of aqueous NaHCO<sub>3</sub> solution to a final concentration of 250 or 500 µM.</p>

<title>Ci uptake measurement by silicon oil centrifugation-filtration</title>
<p>Light- and dark stimulated uptake of active species of [<sup>14</sup>C]HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in cyanobacterial cell cultures was measured using the silicon oil centrifugation-filtration method as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kaplan et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Price and Badger, 1989</xref>). Low Ci-induced cell cultures were prepared as described for MIMS analyses. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation (4 min, 4000 <italic>g</italic>, 23 °C) and resuspended in CO<sub>2</sub>-free BTP at pH 8 or pH 9 at densities equal to 4 µg ml<sup>-1</sup> Chl<italic>a</italic>. Ci uptake was determined in 200 µl aliquots of cells supplemented with 500 µM EZ that were transferred into translucent centrifuge tubes on top of a silicon oil layer (mixture of AR200 : AR20 3.5 : 4 (v/v)) which separated the cells from the kill solution (50% methanol, 2 N NaOH) in the bottom of the tube. For low light (30 µmol photons m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) activation experiments, cells were equilibrated with 500 µM [<sup>14</sup>C]HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> substrate mix (aqueous NaHCO<sub>3</sub> solution spiked with radioactive [<sup>14</sup>C]NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, pH 9.5) for 60 s either in the dark (dark control) or after exposure to low light for 30 or 60 s following a transfer from the dark. Uptake was terminated by rapid filtering of the cells into the kill solution during 20 s centrifugation at set maximum speed (microfuge B, Beckman, USA). For dark-inactivation experiments, cell cultures were depleted of Ci in the light (400 µmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) prior to initiation of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake by adding 500 µM [<sup>14</sup>C]HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> substrate mix, either in the light (400 µmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>), or at various time points in the dark after cells had been transferred from the light into the dark for 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 180 s. Cells were incubated with <sup>14</sup>C-labelled substrate for 30 s, and uptake was terminated by 20 s centrifugation. Tubes were immediately frozen in dry ice. The tips containing the cell pellets were cut off, resuspended in 2 N NaOH and mixed with 5 volumes scintillation fluid (Ultima Gold™ XR, PerkinElmer) for <sup>14</sup>C-CPM counting in a TRI-CARB liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer, USA). Ci uptake rates were calculated based on the specific activity of the [<sup>14</sup>C]HCO <sup>-</sup> substrate mix. To test the inhibitory effect of EZ, cells were incubated with varying concentrations of EZ (0, 250, 375, 500, 750, 1000 µM) for 5 min in the light before adding 500 µM [<sup>14</sup>C]HCO <sup>-</sup> substrate mix for 30 s-uptake measurements.</p>

<p>This study is of <bold>fundamental</bold> importance, addressing the regulation of the carbon concentrating mechanism in cyanobacteria. It is a well-controlled investigation of low affinity regulatory binding of small molecules, processes that are typically difficult to examine. The work provides <bold>compelling</bold> evidence that the adenylate pool, rather than any single metabolite, regulates a key bicarbonate transporter (SbtA) to provide efficient bicarbonate supply while preventing futile cycling that can result from escape of unfixed CO2.</p>

<p>Using an immobilised metal affinity chromatography (IMAC)-based assay coupled with Western blot immunodetection analysis, SbtB, the regulatory protein for SbtA activity, is shown in itself to be regulated by the local adenylate energy charge (AEC), with inhibitory binding of SbtB to SbtA disfavoured at high ATP:ADP ratios. Such conditions are expected to be encountered during steady-state photosynthesis with the associated cellular demand for Ci and SbtA activity.</p>
<p>By homology with ATP-binding PII proteins, ATP is proposed to interact with a loop region of SbtB, changing its conformation on binding and inhibiting the formation of the (inactive) SbtA:SbtB complex. On the basis of this, the authors propose that SbtB acts an AEC-sensing 'curfew' protein for SbtA activity, tuning bicarbonate import by this protein for situations when carbon fixation would be physiologically (and energetically) advantageous. As SbtA is a HCO3-/Na+ symporter, Na+ homeostasis would also be controlled by regulation of this transporter.</p>
<p>The IMAC assay used to monitor SbtA:SbtB complex stability as a function of AEC seems robust, is relatively straightforward and may be of interest to other researchers investigating adenylate-sensing protein reaction partners (with the usual caveats on extrapolating in vitro results to living systems, as noted by the authors).</p>
<p>In this study, SbtA regulation was also investigated in vivo in a Synechococcus HCO3- transporter knockout mutant via measurement of labelled HCO3- uptake and overall photosynthetic performance (MIMS-monitored O2 evolution as a function of PAR). Here, SbtB was inferred to regulate SbtA activity during the induction of photosynthesis (i.e. at low ATP:ADP) and not when photosynthesis was fully activated and in a steady-state condition. SbtA inactivation on a light-dark transition was also demonstrated in vivo irrespective of the presence SbtB, indicative of additional regulatory pathways affecting the activity of this transporter. These conclusions seem to be well-supported by the presented data.</p>

<p>Inorganic carbon (Ci) uptake by autotrophic organisms is often the rate-limiting process in overall photosynthetic productivity. Aquatic autotrophs including the cyanobacteria have evolved elaborate and metabolically expensive, yet very efficient CO2 concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) to over-come this limitation. The work examines the regulation of SbtA, which is a high affinity sodium dependent symporter. Current evidence suggests that this SbtA is highly regulated both at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. For example, the sbtA gene is transcriptionally upregulated under conditions of inorganic carbon limitation and the transport activity of the expressed SbtA protein is apparently regulated allosterically by multiple factors, including those exerted by the binding of the small trimeric protein, SbtB. SbtB is a PII-type regulator that conditionally binds to the cytoplasmic face of the trimeric SbtA to form a hetero-complex apparently inactivating SbtA to which it is bound. The factors affecting this interaction remains to be clarified, but it is already clear that there is considerable complexity that needs to be unraveled since as with other PII proteins, multiple effector molecules act as ligands.</p>
<p>Using a novel protein-protein interaction assay combined with physiological analysis of various mutants, the authors present new information on the regulation of SbtA from Cyanobium sp. PCC7001 and Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942. Because of their novelty, additional validation may be important to establish their validity, yet they do appear to be robust overall..The work builds on earlier studies indicating negative regulation of SbtA and helps clarify other work, including detailed analysis of the orthologous, albeit somewhat more complex protein from Synechocystis PCC6803. The key significance of the present findings is that the energy charge of the adenylate system, a ubiquitous metabolic control mechanism in the biological world, is the prime and perhaps overriding regulatory parameter governing of SbtA activity. Based on this a model for the diurnal control transporter activity was proposed based on energy charge.</p>

<p>The regulation of transporters in many physiological systems is poorly known. Here, Forster and colleagues describe how activity of an inorganic carbon transporter, SbtA, in the bacterial carbon concentrating mechanism is regulated by the PII protein SbtB. Although there is now significant structural knowledge of the system and many potential SbtB-regulating small molecule effectors are known, Forster and colleagues clarify, how the adenylate charge in the cell, rather than any single metabolite, is the important regulatory effector. This is critical for the endogenous function, as the cyanobacterial host undergoes dramatic changes in adenylate charge over the course of a diurnal cycle and this result explains how the channel is regulated to efficiently function in CO2 assimilation. The manuscript is generally clear and the data generally supportive of the conclusions as written. However, there are several instances where additional clarification and/or experiments are needed to confirm the major findings of the paper.</p>
