<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The cardiac <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> ion channel comprises KCNQ1, calmodulin, and KCNE1 in a dodecameric complex which provides a repolarizing current reserve at higher heart rates and protects from arrhythmia syndromes that cause fainting and sudden death. Pharmacological activators of <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> are therefore of interest both scientifically and therapeutically for treatment of <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> loss-of-function disorders. One group of chemical activators are only active in the presence of the accessory KCNE1 subunit and here we investigate this phenomenon using molecular modeling techniques and mutagenesis scanning in mammalian cells. A generalized activator binding pocket is formed extracellularly by KCNE1, the domain-swapped S1 helices of one KCNQ1 subunit and the pore/turret region made up of two other KCNQ1 subunits. A few residues, including K41, A44 and Y46 in KCNE1, W323 in the KCNQ1 pore, and Y148 in the KCNQ1 S1 domain, appear critical for the binding of structurally diverse molecules, but in addition, molecular modeling studies suggest that induced fit by structurally different molecules underlies the generalized nature of the binding pocket. Activation of <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> is enhanced by stabilization of the KCNQ1-S1/KCNE1/pore complex, which ultimately slows deactivation of the current, and promotes outward current summation at higher pulse rates. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation of enhanced <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> currents by these activator compounds and provide a map for future design of more potent therapeutically useful molecules.</p>

<title>Significance Statement</title>
<p>Combined, KCNQ1 and KCNE1 subunits generate the <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> current. Activating <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> has been identified as a promising therapeutic strategy to treat arrhythmogenesis resulting from delayed repolarization. In this study, we uncovered a common drug-induced binding site accessed by two structurally diverse <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> activators, mefenamic acid and DIDS. Located in the extracellular interface where KCNE1 interacts with KCNQ1, we propose that binding of drugs to this location impairs channel closing and leads to enhanced current activation. This is shown to be particularly beneficial at higher pulse rates and explains how such drugs may make an important contribution to the electrical repolarization reserve in the heart.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Potassium ion (K<sup>+</sup>) channel activators are important compounds in human health, as partial or complete loss of function of many K<sup>+</sup> channels may lead to inherited or acquired diseases that have significant morbidity and mortality. The delayed cardiac rectifier potassium current, <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub>, plays an important role, especially at high heart rates, in the physiological shortening of the cardiac action potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sanguinetti et al., 1996</xref>). Unsurprisingly, mutations in both KCNQ1 (α-subunit) and KCNE1 (β-subunit), which when paired together give rise to the <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barhanin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sanguinetti et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bendahhou et al., 2005</xref>), have been implicated in cardiac arrhythmia syndromes such as long QT syndrome (LQTS) and atrial fibrillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jervell and Lange-Nielsen, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Wang et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Eldstrom and Fedida, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Olesen et al., 2014</xref>). With nearly all mutations seen in LQTS patients identified as loss-of-function and 50% of those loss-of-function mutations identified in the KCNQ1 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hedley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ackerman et al., 2011</xref>), enhancing and activating <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> currents has long been suggested as a promising therapeutic approach for treating LQTS. It is a curiosity of <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> channels that the known activators fall into two general groupings: those that work best on the α-subunit, KCNQ1, alone, including zinc pyrithione, L-364,373, and one of the most studied activators, ML277 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Mattmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Yu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Eldstrom et al., 2021</xref>); and those that work best in the presence of the auxiliary β-subunit, KCNE1, compounds like mefenamic acid and DIDS (4,4’-diisothiocyano-2,2’-stilbene disulfonic acid) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abitbol et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Wang et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Using cryo-EM, we recently visualized the binding of ML277 deep in the central core of KCNQ1 channels in a pocket lined inferiorly by the S4-S5 linker, laterally by the S5 and S6 helices of two separate subunits, and above by pore domain residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Willegems et al., 2022</xref>). The location of the binding pocket and its structural inter-relationships help to explain the underlying mechanism of action of ML277, its specificity for KCNQ1, and the lack of efficacy due to steric hindrance in the presence of a β-subunit. However, it is known neither where activators of <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> bind that <italic>require</italic> the presence of the β-subunit, such as phenylboronic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Mruk and Kobertz, 2009</xref>), hexachlorophene, stilbenes such as DIDS and SITS (4-acetamido-4’-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2’-disulfonic acid), and diclofenac acid derivatives such as mefenamic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abitbol et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zheng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), nor how they mediate their activator action. We have some clues for DIDS and mefenamic acid that their binding sites are not in the central channel core, as is the case for ML277, but depend on KCNE1 β-subunit residues at the extracellular surface of the channel, residues 39-43 in KCNE1 for DIDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abitbol et al., 1999</xref>) and K41 for mefenamic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Our recent cysteine scanning data revealed that although other extracellular KCNE1 residues in the same region to varying degrees impacted the effect of mefenamic acid, only the K41C mutation completely abolished mefenamic acid effect up to a concentration of 1 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Previous cross-linking studies have identified key interactions between this extracellular region of KCNE1 and the S1 and S6 transmembrane segments of KCNQ1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Xu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chung et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that residues in either of these regions could also provide important clues to explain mefenamic acid’s mechanism of action.</p>
<p>To further explore the dependence of residues in KCNE1 and those in adjacent KCNQ1 sites on binding of mefenamic acid to <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub>, we first examined the role of K41C in preventing the drug effect. Docking in combination with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of mefenamic acid binding to <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> followed by mutagenesis were used to map out critical KCNE1 and KCNQ1 residues. Further, we expanded on the idea that the stilbene, DIDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abitbol et al., 1999</xref>), which is structurally quite different from mefenamic acid, shares a common binding site. Our results showed that both compounds bind in the same general region formed by elements of the pore and S6 domains of KCNQ1 and the near extracellular region of KCNE1, but depend on different critical residues for their binding stability. Exposure of the channel complex to either compound induces subtle structural changes that subsequently stabilize the conformation of the S1/outer pore/S6 of KCNQ1 and slow the <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> deactivation gating kinetics. The results suggest the existence of a common drug-induced binding site and a mechanism of action for small molecule <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> activators which is distinct from that of specific compounds that activate KCNQ1 alone.</p>

<title>The mefenamic acid binding site on the KCNQ1/KCNE1 complex</title>
<p>Exposure of wild type <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> complexes (4:4 ratio; WT EQ) to 100 µM mefenamic acid transforms the slowly activating <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> current into one with an almost linear waveform and completely inhibits tail current decay at -40 mV (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abitbol et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Unsöld et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). G-V relations obtained from peak initial tail currents show that 100 µM mefenamic acid hyperpolarizes the G-V (ΔV<sub>1/2</sub> = -105.7 mV, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B, 1C</xref>) and decreases the slope (control <italic>k</italic> = 19.4 mV, Mef <italic>k</italic> = 41.3 mV, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We previously showed that introduction of a cysteine mutation at residue K41 in all four KCNE1 subunits (4:4 ratio of mutant K41C-KCNE1 to KCNQ1; K41C-EQ) itself had only a minor effect on the G-V, but prevented changes to currents and the G-V relationship on exposure to 100 µM or 1 mM mefenamic acid (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B, 1C</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). The data suggest that residue K41 in KCNE1 is critical to the action of mefenamic acid, but give no information why K41 is so important, and prompted us to question how this residue and other adjacent residues in KCNE1, and those nearby on KCNQ1 acted together to form a binding pocket for mefenamic acid.</p>

<title>Mefenamic acid binding site predicted by molecular modeling</title>
<p>Initially, to visualise potential drug binding sites and understand how mutation of KCNE1 and KCNQ1 residues might prevent drug action, <italic>in silico</italic> experiments of drug docking with subsequent MD simulations were performed on a model of <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> channels. The <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> model was constructed based on the recent cryo-EM structure of KCNQ1-KCNE3, which is thought to represent the activated-open state of the channel complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Sun and MacKinnon, 2020</xref>). Taking into consideration the sequence similarity of KCNE1 and KCNE3 subunits in their transmembrane segments, it has been suggested that the main interface of these subunits with KCNQ1 is preserved in this region. Our initial data indicated that the extracellular residues of KCNE1 are involved in the action of <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> activators, so we constructed a model where external KCNE3 residues R53-Y58 were substituted with homologous KCNE1 residues, D39-A44 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The resulting 4:4 <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> channel complex was termed pseudo-KCNE1-KCNQ1, ps-<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub>, and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> shows the essential elements of the ps-<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> subunits which form extracellular interface of KCNQ1 and KCNE and served as a basis for drug docking and MD simulations. Details of the docking procedure are described in the Methods section and schematically summarized in <xref rid="fig2_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Briefly, conformational sampling was performed on ps-<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> residues D39-A44, and conformations showing the lowest free energy were selected for docking using a four-dimensional (4D) docking approach to find the best binding pose of the ligand. A conformation with the best docking score (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) shows mefenamic acid binding to the pocket formed between extracellular KCNE1 residues, the external S6 transmembrane helix of one subunit, and the S1 transmembrane domain of the neighboring subunit and the pore turret of a third subunit. The estimated volume of the pocket in the mefenamic acid bound state is ~307 Å<sup>3</sup> with a hydrophobicity value of ~0.65 kcal/mol (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). The free energy of the mefenamic acid-ps-<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> interaction estimated by the MM/GBSA method from 300 ns MD simulations was -39.4 ± 0.3 kcal/mol (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), while a similar value of -31.8 ± 1.46 kcal/mol was calculated using the Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) model. Mefenamic acid in this complex was stabilized by its hydrophobic and van der Waals contacts with KCNQ1 and KCNE1 subunits as well as by two hydrogen bonds formed between the drug and ps-KCNE1 residues Y46 and E43 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, Supplemental movie S1).</p>
<p>The energy decomposition per amino acid using MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA methods revealed several residues in KCNQ1 and psKCNE1 with significant contributions to mefenamic acid coordination (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref rid="fig2_S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 2</xref>). As expected, these are the KCNE1 residues located at the external region of the auxiliary subunit – amino acids K41 to Y46. In addition, residues W323 and V324 located on the S6 helix as well as residues L142, Q147 and Y148 located on the S1 helix exhibited the lowest interaction free energy scores. We focused on functional validation of the KCNE1 residues K41, L42, E43, A44 and Y46, and KCNQ1 residues W323, V324, L142, Q147 and Y148 by mutation to cysteine, alanine and/or tryptophan, and examining the sensitivity of fully saturated EQ channel complexes to 100 µM mefenamic acid.</p>

<p>In the presence of 100 µM mefenamic acid, the waveforms of WT EQ, S6 and pore mutations EQ-V324A, EQ-V324W, EQ-Q147C and EQ-Y148C were all transformed into ones with instantaneous current onset and slowed tail current decay (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Only the EQ-W323A waveform and tail current was largely unaffected by 100 µM mefenamic acid (like K41C-EQ, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The EQ-W323C and A44C-EQ current waveforms were also unchanged by 100 µM mefenamic acid, but their tail current decay was slowed. We interpreted this to mean that mefenamic acid binds to EQ-W323C and A44C-EQ mutant open channels and slows closing, but that the drug-channel complex is less stable and mefenamic acid unbinds during the interpulse interval, which relieves drug action between pulses. The summary of the normalized response of the different mutants to mefenamic acid is shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>. G-V plots were obtained from the tail current amplitudes in the absence and presence of 100 µM mefenamic acid, and unlike WT EQ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), minimal change in the shape and position of the EQ-W323A G-V plot was seen after exposure to 100 µM mefenamic acid (V1/2 shift of -14.1 mV compared with -105.7 mV seen in WT EQ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B, 3E</xref>, and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For the W323C mutation, a less drastic decrease in size compared to alanine, the V1/2 shift seen with 100 µM mefenamic acid increased (EQ-W323C ΔV1/2 = -26.5 mV), suggesting that the size of the W323 residue is important (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, when the neighboring V324 KCNQ1 residue was mutated to a smaller (alanine) or bulkier (tryptophan) residue they both showed the same response to mefenamic acid. Both the V324W and V324A mutations reduced V1/2 shifts caused by 100 µM mefenamic acid to between -14 to -19 mV (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Extracellular S1 residues identified in the MD simulations also proved to be important for mefenamic acid binding, although less so than W323 and K41 residues found in the KCNQ1 extracellular regions of the S6 segment and KCNE1, respectively. Compared to WT, EQ-Y148C reduced the V1/2 shift after exposure to 100 µM mefenamic acid (EQ-Y148C ΔV1/2 = -19.3 mV) and lessened the slope of the G-V relationship (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). The Q147C mutant on the other hand, only partially prevented the V1/2 shift observed after mefenamic acid treatment (EQ-Q147C ΔV<sub>1/2 =</sub> -37.6 mV, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>).</p>
<p>Other KCNE1 residues located at the N-terminal limit of the KCNE1 transmembrane segment (L42, E43, A44, Y46) were also investigated. Unlike with K41C, but similarly to WT EQ, tail current decay was inhibited in the presence of 100 µM mefenamic acid in all of these mutants, reflected by the normalized response (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). In addition, a reduced but statistically significant shift in V<sub>1/2</sub> was observed with 100 µM mefenamic acid compared to control in all mutants tested except K41C. (K41C ΔV<sub>1/2</sub> = -3.8 mV; L42C ΔV<sub>1/2</sub> = -37.1 mV; E43C ΔV<sub>1/2</sub> = -24.4 mV; A44C ΔV<sub>1/2</sub> = -9.7 mV; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Consistent with previous literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gofman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kuenze et al., 2020</xref>), Y46C-EQ in control conditions produced a current with faster activation and a complex GV curve which made analysis and an assignment of slope and V<sub>1/2</sub> difficult, though a small left shift in the GV curve was visible (data not shown). In lieu of Y46C, G-V data from the Y46A-EQ mutant showed a potent effect of mefenamic acid, equivalent to that of WT with a ΔV<sub>1/2</sub> = -106.2 mV (<xref rid="fig7_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-figure supplement 1</xref>). These results suggest that mutation of residues further away from the N-terminus of KCNE1 than K41 has diminishing effects on the activator action of mefenamic acid.</p>

<title>Augmented activation of EQ-L142C in the absence of mefenamic acid</title>
<p>Unlike other mutations, the control EQ-L142C current waveform displayed an almost instantaneous current onset, and tail currents showed no decay with our standard protocol (<xref rid="fig3_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1A</xref>). As the control EQ-L142C current waveform qualitatively resembled WT EQ currents in the presence of 100 µM mefenamic acid, G-V plots at different interpulse intervals were compared. At the standard interval of 15 s, the EQ-L142C G-V plot (blue) closely overlapped that of WT EQ in the presence of Mef (solid grey), and at a 30 s interpulse interval, the position of the WT EQ + Mef (grey open circles) and EQ-L142C plots (green) both depolarized significantly (<xref rid="fig3_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1B</xref>). It appeared that the L142C mutation augmented channel activation as much as 100 µM mefenamic acid on WT channels.</p>

<title>MD simulations of mutant ps-I<sub>Ks</sub> channels exposed to mefenamic acid</title>
<p>To explore the role played by critical residues, <italic>in silico</italic> homologous mutations K41C and W323A were introduced into the mefenamic acid-bound ps-<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> channel (Mef-ps-<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub>) and the stability of the Mef-mutant complexes was assessed during 300 ns MD simulations compared to the WT-Mef complex. Remarkably, mefenamic acid detached from mutant K41C and W323A channels within 120-140 ns of MD simulations in all three independent runs (Supplemental movies S1-S3) performed for each mutant. In contrast, mefenamic acid remained bound during the entire simulation time to WT and Y46C-ps-<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> complexes (Supplemental movie S4). The last mutant was tested as we could not determine the functional effect of mefenamic acid on this residue in electrophysiological experiments. Mefenamic acid unbound from A44C-ps-<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> channel complexes within 80, 100 and 110 ns during three different simulations, changing binding pose several times before doing so.</p>
<p>A significantly <italic>reduced</italic> free interaction energy (ΔG) of ligand binding for all three mutant Mef-ps-<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> complexes was observed compared to WT Mef-ps-<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), and the small but statistically significant change in free energy observed for the Y46C mutant complex indicates that Y46 residue is not as important as K41 and W323 for mefenamic acid binding. Furthermore, the flexibility of the external ps-KCNE1 protein residues of the mutants W323A and K41C ps-<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> channels was analyzed by monitoring their average root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) during the last 100 ns of simulations after the detachment of mefenamic acid from the molecular complex. The RMSF values obtained from the two mutant channels were then compared to that of WT ps-<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> channels where MD simulations of the same duration were conducted after removing the mefenamic acid molecule from the complex (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). The results indicate that W323A and K41C mutations markedly increased the RMSF of D39-A44 ps-KCNE1 residues when compared to the WT ps-<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> channel complex without mefenamic acid bound (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C, 4D</xref>). These results suggest that the side chains of K41 and W323 residues normally stabilize the conformation of the external region of KCNE1, so that mutation of these residues increases random motion and reduces the ability of drugs like mefenamic acid to remain bound at this site.</p>

<title>Mutational impact on I<sub>Ks</sub> current changes induced by DIDS</title>
<p>To establish whether the binding pocket for mefenamic acid can be generalized to other <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> activators, we also examined the binding of the structurally unrelated <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> activator, DIDS.

<p>The ps-<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> construct and docking procedures used previously to explore the binding site of mefenamic acid were used as a basis for DIDS docking and subsequent MD simulations. We found that DIDS also bound to a location formed between extracellular KCNE1 residues, the external S6 transmembrane helix of one subunit, the S1 transmembrane domain of the neighboring subunit, and the pore turret of the opposite subunit (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). DIDS is stabilized by its hydrophobic and van der Waals contacts with KCNQ1 and KCNE1 subunits as well as by two hydrogen bonds formed between the drug and ps-KCNE1 residue L42 and KCNQ1 residue Q147. The energy decomposition per amino acid using MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA methods revealed several residues in KCNQ1 and psKCNE1 with significant contributions to DIDS coordination (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Although residues identified as critical to mefenamic acid binding and action also generally appear to be important for DIDS, especially W323, K41 was noticeably not as critical to DIDS coordination whereas A44 and Y46 were more so.</p>

<p>Similar to mefenamic acid, DIDS stayed bound to WT ps-<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub>, but detached from the W323A mutant during two of three runs, and from Y46C channels in one of three runs after 240 and 122 ns of simulation, respectively (Supplemental movies S5, S7). Interestingly, DIDS did not unbind from K41C mutant ps-<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> channels, even after 250 ns of simulation, although the binding pose did change in one run (Supplemental movie S6). Calculations of free interaction energy shown in <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> using both PBSA and GBSA methods are of mean values before the detachment of the drug if that occurred. If DIDS detachment did not occur during 250 ns MD runs, average free energy was calculated over the duration of the entire MD run for that construct. Only DIDS binding to W323A, and to Y46C in one simulation run, showed significantly lower free energy than DIDS binding to WT, using both methodologies. The small change in free energy and more stable binding of DIDS to K41C suggest that this residue is not as important as W323 or Y46 for DIDS binding.</p>

<p>These model predictions were tested experimentally using fully saturated mutant <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> channel complexes, K41C-EQ, L42C-EQ, A44C-EQ, Y46A-EQ, EQ-W323A, EQ-L142C and EQ-Y148C (e.g. <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Y46 was identified as an important residue for DIDS binding in MD simulations, but as before, the complexity of the GV curve and low functional expression of the Y46C construct led us to substitute Y46A for this mutation in electrophysiology experiments (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> and <xref rid="fig7_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>
<p>K41C-EQ G-V plots were obtained from peak tail current amplitudes in the absence and presence (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>) of 100 µM DIDS. Unlike with mefenamic acid, but in agreement with the modeling, K41C did not prevent the action of DIDS. Treatment of K41C-EQ with 100 µM DIDS hyperpolarized the V1/2 and changed the shape of the G-V relationship compared to control (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B, 7D</xref>, <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The current waveform of K41C-EQ activated more quickly with less sigmoidicity after treatment with DIDS, and tail current decay was slowed as indicated by the normalized response (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B, 7C</xref>). As K41C-EQ remained responsive to DIDS, and L42C responded similarly to K41C-EQ (for K41C-EQ, ΔV<sub>1/2</sub> was -24.7 mV, and for L42C-EQ ΔV<sub>1/2</sub> was -34 mV), we hypothesized that DIDS binding to <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> channel complexes involved KCNE1 residues closer to the transmembrane region as predicted by the ligand interaction map for DIDS (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). In agreement with this idea, A44C showed little response to 100 µM DIDS both in term of current waveform and tail current decay. The shift in V<sub>1/2</sub> was also reduced compared to WT-EQ (A44C-EQ ΔV<sub>1/2</sub> = -18.5 mV; WT EQ ΔV<sub>1/2</sub> = -46.6mV, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C, D</xref>). In Y46A, the effect of DIDS on the current waveform was greatly reduced as was slowing of tail current decay (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A, 7C</xref>). We could only estimate an activation V<sub>1/2</sub> for Y46A as the G-V curve was right shifted to very positive potentials and non-saturating. Nevertheless, hyperpolarization of the V<sub>1/2</sub> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>, <xref rid="fig7_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-figure supplement 1</xref>) in the presence of DIDS was observed, suggesting that unstable and short-lived binding of the drug to the channel complex was sufficient to interfere with channel gating.</p>

<p>The modeling studies (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>) suggested that W323 remained a key residue for <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> activator sensitivity, and in agreement with this, EQ-W323A was only partially responsive to DIDS. In EQ-W323A, the tail current decay was affected but the slowly-activating current waveform was preserved in the presence of DIDS, supporting the idea that the drug dissociates from the channel complex between pulses (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A, 7C</xref>, <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). However, a significant shift in the V1/2 remained (ΔV<sub>1/2</sub> = -27.3 mV; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>, <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Comparable effects observed in EQ-W323A, A44C-EQ, and Y46A-EQ are consistent with the idea that the DIDS binding pocket involves the N-terminal end of S6 and the deeper extracellular surface of the KCNE1 transmembrane segment. In EQ-Y148C, the V<sub>1/2</sub> and the shape of the G-V plot were not altered by 100 µM DIDS (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>, <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), and tail current decay was not markedly slowed (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A, 7C</xref>). This result suggests that unlike mefenamic acid, DIDS binding determinants extend to the S1 region of KCNQ1 and that Y148 is an important contributor.</p>
<p>Notably, as with mefenamic acid, the L142C-EQ G-V plot became voltage-independent after treatment with 100 µM DIDS (data not shown) and so it proved hyper-responsive to both of the <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> activators, DIDS and mefenamic acid.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Mefenamic acid, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), and the structurally distinct stilbenes DIDS and SITS, among other compounds, have previously been identified by numerous groups to enhance <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> currents in various expression systems including canine and guinea-pig ventricular myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Magyar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Toyoda et al., 2006</xref>) as well as heterologous expression systems such as <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes, CHO, COS-7, tsA201 and LM cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Busch et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abitbol et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Unsöld et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Toyoda et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). The extracellular region of KCNE1 between residues 39-44 was found important in mediating the effect of DIDS on <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abitbol et al., 1999</xref>) and residue K41, located on the extracellular end of KCNE1, was found to be critical in mediating mefenamic acid’s activating effect on the fully saturated <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> channel complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with this idea, when all four WT KCNE1 subunits are replaced with mutant K41C-KCNE1, mefenamic acid up to a concentration of 1 mM is largely ineffective (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Unlike in the WT complex, there is little change to the current waveform, slope or V<sub>1/2</sub> of the G-V plot during activator exposure, suggesting that all the drug binding site(s) on the channel complex are impaired, or that the mechanism of action is disabled, or that the mutation causes a combination of these actions. In the present study, we analysed these activator compound actions using molecular modeling approaches, and complementary mutational analysis. Our data describe the formation of a drug binding pocket between the immediate extracellular residues of KCNE1, S1 and pore residues of two KCNQ1 subunits, stabilized by the presence of structurally different activator compounds. The effect of mutations that negate the activator compound actions is to destabilize the binding pocket itself, reduce drug binding and limit activator residency time on the channel complex.</p>

<title>Mefenamic acid binding site in I<sub>Ks</sub></title>
<p>Using data that suggested an extracellular binding site for mefenamic acid was at the KCNE1-channel interface, MD simulations were used to explore drug-channel interactions further. The drug binding pocket was defined as the extracellular space formed by KCNE1, the domain-swapped S1 helices of one KCNQ1 subunit and the pore/turret region made up of two other KCNQ1 subunits (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>; Supplemental movie S1). Docking and molecular simulations identified a binding site made up of several residues across all of these elements (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig2_S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). Mutagenesis revealed that most mutations impacted at least one out of the three mefenamic acid effects: V1/2 shift, GV-plot slope change, and current waveform change related to slowed deactivation. However, only three of the mutants impacted all of the mefenamic acid actions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). These were W323A in KCNQ1, as well as K41C, and A44C in KCNE1, which define key components of the binding pocket for mefenamic acid. That W323 forms an important medial wall of the hydrophobic pocket to which mefenamic acid binds is suggested by data from mutants in which the size of the side chain at this location is systematically made smaller to cysteine then alanine, which results in diminished effectiveness of the drug, particularly with alanine. This mutation resulted in the detachment of mefenamic acid as well as lower interaction energy of drug-channel complexes during MD simulations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>; Supplemental movie S3) particularly loss of interaction strength with KCNE1 (<xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). Likewise, MD simulations revealed detachment of mefenamic acid and reduced interaction energy values for K41C-Mef-<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>ks</italic></sub> complexes (Supplemental movie S2, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>) again accompanied by loss of interaction strength with KCNE1 (<xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). The drug also detached from the A44C complex, another mutant with a reduced response in terms of changes in waveform, V<sub>1/2</sub> and slope. In contrast, while the free interaction energy of the mutant Y46C channel was significantly decreased in comparison to the WT channel complex (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), detachment of mefenamic acid from the mutant channel during 300 ns MD simulations was not observed, though S1 appears to pull away from the pore (Supplemental movie S4). Comparison of energies at specific residues show a loss of interaction with Q147 and Y148 in S1 with this mutant and a small shift towards the turret at S298 and A300 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>; <xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). While we were not able to obtain good electrophysiological data from Y46C, data from Y46A suggested that mefenamic acid still had potent actions on this mutant. The combination of binding studies and electrophysiological data indicate that Y46 was not as important for mefenamic acid binding and action as other KCNE1 N-terminal residues.</p>

<title>Common binding site for I<sub>Ks</sub> activators, mefenamic acid and DIDS</title>
<p>Although it was suggested that DIDS and mefenamic acid have the same binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abitbol et al., 1999</xref>), the extent of overlap was unknown. Initially, we examined the effect of DIDS on WT EQ. Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abitbol et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bollmann et al., 2020</xref>) we confirmed that 100 µM DIDS enhanced WT EQ activity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>) with a V1/2 shift of -46.6 mV and a decrease in the slope of the G-V curve (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). As most <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> activators are dependent on the KCNQ1-KCNE1 stoichiometry, this more potent effect of DIDS seen in our study may be explained by the higher dose we used and our KCNE1-KCNQ1 linked channel constructs, which ensured fully KCNE1-saturated complexes. Furthermore, due to the large size and complex folds found on the surface of oocytes, higher drug concentrations than those used for cultured cells are often required in order to facilitate a similar effect in both expression systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kvist et al., 2011</xref>). All previous studies utilized <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes, whereas in this study transiently transfected tsA201 cells were used.</p>
<p><italic>In silico</italic> DIDS docking revealed that both mefenamic acid and DIDS bind to the same general extracellular inter-subunit interface with some differences in key residues revealed by the electrophysiology data. Mutation Y148 in KCNQ1 to a cysteine (Y148C) or Y46 in KCNE1 to an alanine (Y46A) was found to reduce effects of 100 µM DIDS, particularly in the case of Y148C (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). These data suggest that DIDS resides deeper in the binding pocket formed by KCNE1 residues and the KCNQ1 pore/S6, and so was less dependent on the side chain of K41 to retain the activator on the channel complex (compare Movies S1 and S6). DIDS associated more strongly with the pore of the Y148C mutant, particularly with V324 and T327, and less across the KCNE1/3, S1 and turret regions (<xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). The Y46C mutation resulted in shifts away from KCNE1/3 and towards the S1 domain (T144, E146 and Q147). In the case of A44C and DIDS, the changes were more subtle, with stronger interactions moving from central residues in KCNE1 (K41, L42 and E43) and S1 (V141 and L142; coloured grey in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>) to more peripheral residues (I145, E146 and Q147) and lower in the KCNE TMD (A44 and M45; coloured magenta in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s3c">
<title>Proposed mechanism of action for mefenamic acid and DIDS</title>
<p>Molecular modeling and docking revealed that mefenamic acid and DIDS induce conformational changes in the channel upon binding, to shape a binding pocket formed by residues from the external S1 domain, KCNE1 and the pore domain of I<sub>Ks</sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, Supplemental movies S1, S5). This cryptic binding pocket is not detectable in the absence of the drug (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), which suggests that it has been induced in a similar manner to previous reports of toxin interactions with KcsA-Kv1.3 that induce conformational changes in both the toxin and the channel structure to generate a high-affinity binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lange et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Zachariae et al., 2008</xref>). Given the high modeled binding energy of the channel-drug activated state complexes, ~-39 kcal/mol for mefenamic acid and ~-35 kcal/mol for DIDS, but the relatively low affinities, given the micromolar concentrations required experimentally, we can imagine a dynamic complex where mefenamic acid and DIDS bind/unbind from <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> at high frequency. Slowed deactivation may therefore be the result of these rapid binding/unbinding interactions slowing the dissociation of the S1/KCNE1/pore domain/drug complex by either providing steric hindrance to dissociation or by stabilizing the activated complex. MD simulations suggest the latter is most likely the case. Our data indicate that mutation of residue W323 to an alanine would not only destabilize the external S1/KCNE1/pore domain interface (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) but also eliminate direct hydrophobic contacts which normally occur between the W323 side chain and mefenamic acid, thus facilitating drug dissociation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, Supplemental movie S3).</p>
<p>A reduced interaction with S1 could also conceivably curtail the ability of <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> activators to slow dissociation of the activated complex and restore faster deactivation rates such that there is no longer an enhanced step current in the presence of the drug, as seen in mutants K41C and A44C for mefenamic acid (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>) and A44C, Y46A, W323A and Y148C for DIDS (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Similarly, electrostatic interactions of residue K41, which acts as a lid for the binding pocket for mefenamic acid (Supplemental movie S2), could help stabilize the protein-protein interface at the external region of the channel complex. Mutation of residue K41 to a cysteine may prevent stable <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> activator binding to the channel by increasing the fluctuations of the external KCNE1 region (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>) and by reducing van der Waals contacts with the drug (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). In simulations, mefenamic acid was seen dissociating from mutant K41C, A44C, and W323A channel complexes, and this explains why the electrophysiological effects of <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> activators were prevented by the mutational substitutions at these locations (Supplemental movies S2, S3). Shifts in, and particularly reductions in KCNE1/3 association for both drugs (<xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>) that lead to loss of efficacy suggest that it is the interactions with KCNE1 and S1 that are key to maintaining the activated state. This is similar to the proposal for tight interactions between S1 and KCNE3 in maintaining constitutive activity in KCNE3-associated channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kasuya and Nakajo, 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>In close proximity to this drug-binding pocket are known gain-of function mutations in S1, S140G and V141M, which have previously been reported to slow deactivation in the presence of KCNE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">El Harchi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Peng et al., 2017</xref>). As their current waveforms are qualitatively similar to those seen after exposure of WT EQ to <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> activators, we propose that the same mechanism may underlie the effects of mefenamic acid, DIDS and these <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> S1 mutations. In addition, we find that mutation of the neighboring residue, L142, also produces current waveforms and G-V plots which mirror those seen when WT EQ is treated with 100 µM mefenamic acid (<xref rid="fig3_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1</xref>) or DIDS. In the cryo-EM structure of KCNQ1-KCNE3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Sun and MacKinnon, 2020</xref>), residue L142 interacts with KCNE3, whereas V141 interacts with both KCNE3 and the pore domain. This suggests that both the V141M and L142C mutations could directly alter the interaction of the S1 domain with the pore and/or the position or movement of KCNE1. The co-evolved interface between the extracellular end of S1 and the pore domain is thought to be important for bracing the VSD, to allow efficient force transmission to the pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lee et al., 2009</xref>), but can also impact permeation, as the S140G and V141M mutations also enhance rubidium permeation through <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Peng et al., 2017</xref>). The importance of this S1-pore coupling to channel function is supported by mutational analyses of S1 residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hong et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Campbell et al., 2013</xref>) as well as the L142C mutation examined in this study (<xref rid="fig3_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1</xref>), which all display current waveforms with instantaneous onset. Incidentally, A300, a residue in the pore region of KCNQ1, which also interacts with both mefenamic acid and DIDS in MD simulations (<xref rid="fig2_S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>), has also been implicated in the same gain-of-function cleft as S140G and V141M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Smith et al., 2007</xref>). The V300T mutant has an ~-20 mV shift in V1/2 of activation and faster rates of activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bianchi et al., 2000</xref>), once again showing how a mutation can mirror the effects of the two activators studied here.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Binding of mefenamic acid and DIDS to the extracellular end of KCNE1 and the KCNQ1 S6 and S1 helices is facilitated by a number of key residues. Residue K41 acts as a “lid” holding mefenamic acid in place, while residue W323 impacts the size of the binding pocket. Size reduction mutations of either residue destabilize mefenamic acid binding and ultimately lead to drug detachment from the channel complex. This explains why, when all four <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> subunits are mutated, as in the case of K41C-EQ, EQ-W323A and A44C-EQ, little to no effect of the drug is seen. The larger drug, DIDS, interacts with many of the same residues but those deeper in the pocket appear more important than for mefenamic acid. Furthermore, the qualitative similarities between the S1 mutant channel, EQ-L142C and WT EQ in the presence of 100 µM mefenamic acid suggest that <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> activators most likely cause their effects by modulating interactions between the S1 helix, pore turret, KCNE1 and the S6 helix. Upon binding, both DIDS and mefenamic acid induce conformational changes in an occult binding pocket and stabilize the S1/KCNE1/pore complex, which ultimately slows deactivation. The results indicate that this extracellular inter-subunit interface forms a generalized binding site which different drugs can access and through which induce common effects on channel activation and deactivation. The presence of such a binding site and the variable nature of <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> complex composition may serve as starting points for future drug development projects targeted at discovering therapeutically-useful <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> agonists.</p>

<p>A model of the <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> channel complex – termed pseudo-KCNE1-KCNQ1 (ps-<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub>) – was created based on the cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of KCNQ1-KCNE3 (PDB ID: 6v01) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Sun and MacKinnon, 2020</xref>). In this structure, the extracellular residues of KCNE3, R53-Y58, were substituted with homologous KCNE1 residues D39-A44. Conformational sampling was then performed for substituted residues and the lowest free energy conformations were selected for subsequent docking experiments applying a four-dimensional (4D) docking approach which accounts for the flexibility of the receptor site configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bottegoni et al., 2009</xref>). A receptor ensemble was then created via another round of conformational sampling for the external part of ps-KCNE1 and its KCNQ1 neighborhood (8 Å cut-off distance) and generated conformations were used for a new docking iteration. A ligand-channel conformation with the lowest free energy was chosen from final docking iterations. The docking and conformational sampling experiments as well as <italic>in silico</italic> mutations described in this study were performed with ICM-pro 3.8 software (Molsoft LLC, San Diego) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Neves et al., 2012</xref>). The coordinates of selected mefenamic acid-bound ps-<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> channel complexes with the lowest free energy were then used for MD. To keep the voltage-sensing domain (VSD) in its upstate conformation, we restrained the PIP2 molecule in its crystallographic position during MD simulations. Simulations were performed in a water environment with AMBER20 using a ff14SB force field for proteins and GAFF/AM1-BCC scheme for the ligand parameterization and calculation of the atomic point charges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jakalian et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Case et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Maier et al., 2015</xref>). The complex was solvated with TIP3P water models and Na<sup>+</sup>/Cl<sup>-</sup> at 100 mM concentration. The system was minimized and equilibrated during 10 ns. In all simulations described in this study the Langevin thermostat was set with collision frequency 2 ps<sup>-1</sup>, the reference temperature 310 degrees K, and Monte Carlo barostat with reference pressure at 1 bar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Oliver et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). The long-range electrostatic interactions with a cut-off at 10 Å were treated with the Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method.

The 2D diagrams in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> were generated by ICM pro software. Cut-off values are as follows: hydrophobic contacts 4.5 Å and hydrogen bond strength 0.8. Hydrogen bond strength is a unitless parameter for H-bond calculation in ICM-pro and lower values identify weaker hydrogen bonds. The values do not represent H-bond energy.

G-V plots were fitted with a Boltzmann sigmoid equation to obtain the voltage at half-maximal activation (V<sub>1/2</sub>) and slope (<italic>k</italic>) values (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> to 3). For each EQ mutant, the change in activation V<sub>1/2</sub> (ΔV<sub>1/2</sub>=V<sub>1/2</sub> in the presence of drug-V<sub>1/2</sub> control) was also determined (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3E</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7E</xref>). In some cases, the foot of the G-V curve did not reach 0 (essentially in the presence of drug) and as a result, the V<sub>1/2</sub> was read directly from the plots. Slowing of tail current decay was used as a measure of mefenamic acid and DIDS impact on WT and mutated EQ channel complexes. Specifically, the peak to end difference currents were calculated by subtracting the minimum amplitude of the deactivating current from the peak amplitude of the deactivating current. The difference current in mefenamic acid or DIDS was normalized to the maximum control (in the absence of drug) difference current and subtracted from 1.0 to obtain the normalized response (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3D</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7C</xref>).</p>
<p>GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) was used to analyze all the data. Where applicable, unpaired t-test or one-way ANOVA followed by the Fisher’s least significant difference (LSD) test was used to determine statistical significance. In all figures ****, ***, **, * denotes a significance where p&lt;0.0001, p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.01 and p&lt;0.05, respectively. All data in the figures and tables are shown as mean ± SD or SEM. Bar graphs showing mean ΔV<sub>1/2</sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3E</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7D</xref>) were generated by calculating changes in V<sub>1/2</sub> induced by drug treatment vs. control in separate cells. ΔV<sub>1/2</sub> values reported in the Results were calculated from the mean V<sub>1/2</sub> values shown in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> and <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">3</xref>.</p>

<p>Chan et al. tried identifying the binding sites or pockets for the KCNQ1-KCNE1 activator mefenamic acid. Because the KCNQ1-KCNE1 channel is responsible for cardiac repolarization, genetic impairment of either the KCNQ1 or KCNE1 gene can cause cardiac arrhythmia. Therefore, the development of activators without side effects is highly demanded. Because the binding of mefenamic acid requires both KCNQ1 and KCNE1 subunits, the authors performed drug docking simulation by using KCNQ1-KCNE3 structural model (because this is the only available KCNQ1-KCNE structure) with substitution of the extracellular five amino acids (R53-Y58) into D39-A44 of KCNE1. That could be a limitation of the work because the binding mode of KCNE1 might differ from that of KCNE3. Still, they successfully identified some critical amino acid residues, including W323 of KCNQ1 and K41 and A44 of KCNE1. They subsequently tested these identified amino acid residues by analyzing the point mutants and confirmed that they attenuated the effects of the activator. They also examined another activator, yet structurally different DIDS, and reported that DIDS and mefenamic acid share the binding pocket, and they concluded that the extracellular region composed of S1, S6, and KCNE1 is a generic binding pocket for the IKS activators.</p>
<p>The data are solid and well support their conclusions, although there are a few concerns regarding the choice of mutants for analysis and data presentation.</p>
<p>Other comments:</p>
<p>1. One of the limitations of this work is that they used psKCNE1 (mostly KCNE3), not real KCNE1, as written above. It is also noted that KCNQ1-KCNE3 is in the open state. Unbinding may be facilitated in the closed state, although evaluating that in the current work is difficult.</p>
<p>
2. According to Figure 2-figure supplement 2, some amino acid residues (S298 and A300) of the turret might be involved in the binding of mefenamic acid. On the other hand, Q147 showing a comparable delta G value to S298 and A300 was picked for mutant analysis. What are the criteria for the following electrophysiological study?</p>
<p>
3. It is an interesting speculation that K41C and W323A stabilize the extracellular region of KCNE1 and might increase the binding efficacy of mefenamic acid. Is it also the case for DIDS? K41 may not be critical for DIDS, however.</p>
<p>
4. Same to #2, why was the pore turret (S298-A300) not examined in Figure 7?</p>

<p>The voltage-gated potassium channel KCNQ1/KCNE1 (IKs) plays important physiological functions, for instance in the repolarization phase of the cardiac action potential. Loss-of-function of KCNQ1/KCNE1 is linked to disease. Hence, KCNQ1/KCNE1 is a highlighted pharmacological target and mechanistic insights into how channel modulators enhance the function of the channel is of great interest. The authors have through several previous studies provided mechanistic insights into how small-molecule activators like ML277 act on KCNQ1. However, less is known about the binding site and mechanism of action of other type of channel activators, which require KCNE1 for their effect. In this study, Chan and co-workers use molecular dynamics approaches, mutagenesis and electrophysiology to propose an overall similar binding site for the KCNQ1/KCNE1 activators mefenamic acid and DIDS, located at the extracellular interface of KCNQ1 and KCNE1. The authors propose an induced-fit model for the binding site, which critically engages residues in the N-terminus of KCNE1. Moreover, the authors discuss possible mechanisms of action of how drug binding to this site may enhance channel function.</p>
<p>The authors address an important question, of broad relevance to researchers in the field. The manuscript is generally well written and the text easy to follow. A strength of the work is the parallel use of experimental and simulation approaches, which enables both functional testing and mechanistic predictions and interpretations. For instance, the authors have experimentally assessed the putative relevance of a large set of residues based on simulation predictions. A limitation is that several methods need to be described in more detail to allow for evaluation of the presented data. Also, a more extensive presentation of representative data would be useful, along with discussions on the putative impact on drug effects of the diverse intrinsic properties of tested mutants.</p>

<p>The author is trying to identify the mefenamic (Mef) binding site and DIDS binding site on the KCNQ1 KCNE1 complex. The authors also try to identify the mechanism of interactions using electrophysiological recording, calculating V1/2 of different mutants, and looking at the instantaneous current and the tail current. The contribution of each residue within the binding pocket was analysed using GBSA and PBSA and traditional molecular dynamics simulation. The author is trying to argue that they share the same binding pocket and their mechanism of activation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>1. The effect of the WT channel in the presence of 100 uM Mef is very clear, and such an effect is clearly decreased with the E1-K41C and W323A mutation. The milder effect was observed with Q147C and Y148C mutants.</p>
<p>2. The effect of the WT channel in the presence of 100 uM DIDS is, again, very clear, and such an effect is clearly decreased with the E1-Y46C.</p>
<p>3. The author has indeed achieved their aim in addressing that the binding site for both DIDS and Mef are adjacent to each other and may indeed share a pocket in the S1-E1-pore pocket. This may help the field with drug development, targeting that region in the future.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. The computational aspect of the work is rather under-sampled - Figure 2 and Figure 4. The lack of quantitative analysis on the molecular dynamic simulation studies is striking, as only a video of a single representative replica is being shown per mutant/drug. Given that the simulations shown in the video are extremely short; some video only lasts up to 80 ns. Could the author provide longer simulations in each simulation condition (at least to 500 ns or until a stable binding pose is obtained in case the ligand does not leave the binding site), at least with three replicates per each condition? If not able to extend the length of the simulations due to resources issue, then further quantitative analysis should be conducted to prove that all simulations are converged and are sufficient. Please see the rest of the quantitative analysis in other comments.</p>
<p>2. Given that the protein is a tetramer, at least 12 datasets could have been curated to improve the statistic. It was also unclear how frequently the frames from the simulations were taken in order to calculate the PBSA/GBSA.</p>
<p>3. The lack of labels on several structures is rather unhelpful (Figure 2B, 2C, 4B). The lack of clarity of the interaction map in Figures 2D and 6A.</p>
<p>4. The RMSF analysis is rather unclear and unlabelled thoroughly. In fact, I still don't quite understand why n = 3, given that the protein is a tetramer. If only one out of four were docked and studied, this rationale needs to be explained and accounted for in the manuscript.</p>
<p>5. For the condition that the ligands suppose to leave the site (K42C for Mef and Y46A for DIDS), can you please provide simulations at a sufficient length of time to show that ligand left the site over three replicates? Given that the protein is a tetramer, I would be expecting three replicates of data to have four data points from each subunit. I would be expecting distance calculation or RMSD of the ligand position in the binding site to be calculated either as a time series or as a distribution plot to show the difference between each mutant in the ligand stability within the binding pocket. I would expect all the videos to be translatable to certain quantitative measures.</p>
<p>6. Given that K41 (Mef) and Y46 are very important in the coordination, could you calculate the frequency at which such residues form hydrogen bonds with the drug in the binding site? Can you also calculate the occupancy or the frequency of contact that the residues are making to the ligand (close 4-angstrom proximity etc.) and show whether those agree with the ligand interaction map obtained from ICM pro in Figure 2D?</p>
<p>7. Given that the author claims that both molecules share the same binding site and the mode of ligand binding seems to be very dynamic, I would expect the authors to show the distribution of the position of ligand, or space, or volume occupied by the ligand throughout multiple repeats of simulations, over sufficient sampling time that both ligand samples the same conformational space in the binding pocket. This will prove the point in the discussion - Line 463-464. &quot;We can imagine a dynamic complex... bind/unbind from Its at a high frequency&quot;.</p>
<p>8. I would expect the authors to explain the significance and the importance of the PBSA/GBSA analysis as they are not reporting the same energy in several cases, especially K41 in Figure 2 - figure supplement 2. It was also questionable that Y46, which seems to have high binding energy, show no difference in the EPhys works in figure 3. These need to be commented on.</p>
<p>9. Can the author prove that the PBSA/GBSA analysis yielded the same average free energy throughout the MD simulation? This should be the case when the simulations are converged. The author may takes the snapshots from the first ten ns, conduct the analysis and take the average, then 50, then 100, then 250 and 500 ns. The author then hopefully expects that as the simulations get longer, the system has reached equilibrium, and the free energy obtained per residue corresponds to the ensemble average.</p>
<p>10. The phrase &quot;Lowest interaction free energy fort residues in ps-KCNE1 and selected KCNQ1 domains are shown as enlarged panels (n=3 for each point)&quot; needs further explanation. Is this from different frames? I would rather see this PBSA and GBSA calculated on every frame of the simulations, maybe at the one ns increment across 500 ns simulations, in 4 binding sites, in 3 replicas, and these are being plotted as the distribution instead of plotting the smallest number. Can you show each data point corresponding to n = 3?</p>
<p>11. I cannot wrap my head around what you are trying to show in Figure 2B. This could be genuinely improved with better labelling. Can you explain whether this predicted binding pose for Mef in the figure is taken from the docking or from the last frame of the simulation? Given that the binding mode seems to be quite dynamic, a single snapshot might not be very helpful. I suggest a figure describing different modes of binding. Figure 2B should be combined with figure 2C as both are not very informative.</p>
<p>12. Similar to the comment above, but for figure 4B. I do not understand the argument. If the author is trying to say that the pocket is closed after Mef is removed - then can you show, using MD simulation, that the pocket is openable in an apo to the state where Mef can bind? I am aware that the open pocket is generated through batches of structures through conformational sampling - but as the region is supposed to be disordered, can you show that there is a possibility of the allosteric or cryptic pocket being opened in the simulations? If not, can you show that the structure with the open pocket, when the ligand is removed, is capable of collapsing down to the structure similar to the cryo-EM structure? If none of the above work, the author might consider using PocketMiner tools to find an allosteric pocket (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-36699-3">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-36699-3</ext-link>) and see a possibility that the pocket exists.</p>
<p>13. Figure 4C - again, can you show the RMSF analysis of all four subunits leading to 12 data points? If it is too messy to plot, can you plot a mean with a standard deviation? I would say that a 1-1.5 angstroms increase in the RMSF is not a &quot;markedly increased&quot;, as stated on line 280. I would also encourage the authors to label whether the RMSF is calculated from the backbone, side-chain or C-alpha atoms and, ideally, compare them to see where the dynamical properties are coming from.</p>
<p>14. In the discussion - Lines 464-467. &quot;Slowed deactivation of the S1/KCNE1/Pore domain/drug complex ....... By stabilising the activated complex. MD simulation suggests the latter is most likely the case.&quot; Can you point out explicitly where this has been proven? If the drug really stabilised the activated complex, can you show which intermolecular interaction within E1/S1/Pore has the drug broken and re-form to strengthen the complex formation? The authors have not disproven the point on steric hindrance either. Can this be disproved by further quantitative analysis of existing unbiased equilibrium simulations?</p>
<p>15. Figure 4D - Can you show this RMSF analysis for all mutants you conducted in this study, such as Y46C? Can you explain the difference in F dynamics in the KCNE3 for both Figure 4C and 4D?</p>
<p>16. Line 477: the author suggested that K41 and Mef may stabilise the protein-protein interface at the external region of the channel complex. Can you prove that through the change in protein-protein interaction, contact is made over time on the existing MD trajectories, whether they are broken or formed? The interface from which residues help to form and stabilise the contact? If this is just a hypothesis for future study, then this has to be stated clearly.</p>
<p>17. The author stated on lines 305-307 that &quot;DIDS is stabilised by its hydrophobic and vdW contacts with KCNQ1 and KCNE1 subunits as well as by two hydrogen bonds formed between the drug and ps-KCNE1 residue L42 and KCNQ1 residue Q147&quot; Can you show, using H-bond analysis that these two hydrogen bonds really exist stably in the simulations? Can you show, using minimum distance analysis, that L42 are in the vdW radii stably and are making close contact throughout the simulations?</p>
<p>18. Discussion - In line 417, the author stated that the &quot;S1 appears to pull away from the pore&quot; and supplemented the claim with the movie. This is insufficient. The author should demonstrate distance calculation between the S1 helix and the pore, in WT and mutants, with and without the drug. This could be shown as a time series or distribution of centre-of-mass distance over time.</p>
<p>19. Given that all the work were done in the open state channel with PIP2 bound (PDB entry: 6v01), could the author demonstrate, either using docking, or simulations, or alignment, or space-filling models - that the ligand, both DIDS and Mef, would not be able to fit in the binding site of a closed state channel (PDB entry: 6v00). This would help illustrate the point denoted Lines 464-467. &quot;Slowed deactivation of the S1/KCNE1/Pore domain/drug complex... By stabilising the activated complex. MD simulation suggests the latter is most likely the case.&quot;</p>
<p>20. I struggle with the term &quot;normalised response&quot; on Line 208. What is it being normalised to? Can this be put more explicitly in the text? If normalised to WT, why is WT EQ response only 0.8?</p>
<p>21. The author stated that the binding pose changed in one run (lines 317 to 318). Can you comment on those changes? If the pose has changed - what has it changed to? Can you run longer simulations to see if it can reverse back to the initial confirmation? Or will it leave the site completely?</p>
<p>22. Binding free energy of -32 kcal/mol = -134 kJ/mol. If you try to do dG = -RTlnKd, your lnKd is -52. Your Kd is e^-52, which means it will never unbind if it exists. I am aware that this is the caveat with the methodologies. But maybe these should be highlighted throughout the manuscript.</p>
