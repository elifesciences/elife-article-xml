<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Resistance to anthelmintics, particularly the macrocyclic lactone ivermectin (IVM), presents a substantial global challenge for parasite control. We found that the functional loss of an evolutionarily conserved E3 ubiquitin ligase, UBR-1, leads to IVM resistance in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. Multiple IVM-inhibiting activities, including viability, body size, pharyngeal pumping, and locomotion, were significantly ameliorated in various <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants. Interestingly, exogenous application of glutamate induces IVM resistance in wild-type animals. The sensitivity of all IVM-affected phenotypes of <italic>ubr-1</italic> is restored by eliminating proteins associated with glutamate metabolism or signaling: GOT-1, a transaminase that converts aspartate to glutamate, and EAT-4, a vesicular glutamate transporter. We demonstrated that IVM-targeted GluCls (glutamate-gated chloride channels) are downregulated and that the IVM-mediated inhibition of serotonin-activated pharynx Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity is diminished in <italic>ubr-1</italic>. Additionally, enhancing glutamate uptake in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants through ceftriaxone completely restored their IVM sensitivity. Therefore, UBR-1 deficiency-mediated aberrant glutamate signaling leads to ivermectin resistance in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Anthelmintic resistance (AR) to broad-spectrum antiparasitic macrocyclic lactones (MLs), which include ivermectin (IVM), avermectin (AVM), and doramectin (DOM), has emerged as a critical global concern in veterinary parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). The rise of anthelmintic-resistant nematodes poses a pressing issue, impacting not only livestock production but also animal welfare and human health. Overcoming this challenge requires a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving nematode resistance, which, in turn, will facilitate the development of innovative and effective parasite prevention strategies.</p>
<p>The nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<italic>C. elegans</italic>), owing to its sensitivity to a majority of anthelmintic drugs and conservation of functional genes, serves as a crucial model organism for identifying genes related to IVM resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Mutations in three <italic>C. elegans</italic> glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl) <italic>genes—avr-15</italic>, <italic>avr-14</italic>, and <italic>glc-</italic>1—have collectively demonstrated strong resistance to ivermectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Exogenous expression and crystallization X-ray structural analysis support the premise that these GluCls act as the primary targets of IVM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Further identification of IVM resistance-related genes, including P-glycoprotein transporters (<italic>pgp-1</italic>, <italic>pgp-3</italic>, <italic>pgp-6</italic>, <italic>pgp-9</italic>, <italic>pgp-13</italic>, and <italic>mrp-6</italic>), cytochrome oxidases (<italic>cyp-14, cyp-34/35</italic>), and glutathione S-transferases (<italic>gst-4</italic>, <italic>gst-10</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), has revealed their role in enhancing ivermectin excretion or metabolism. These detoxification genes are thought to be regulated by the ubiquitous transcription factor NHR-8, which encodes a nuclear hormone receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). While these studies have revealed a polygenic mechanism underlying IVM resistance, increasing reports of unknown causes of IVM resistance continue to emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>), suggesting that additional unknown mechanisms are awaiting investigation.</p>
<p>UBR1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase and a pivotal component of the ubiquitin‒ proteasome system, facilitates protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). UBR1 is implicated in substrate-specific recognition and metabolism, primarily through the N-end rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). In humans, loss-of-function mutations in UBR1 result in Johanson-Blizzard syndrome (JBS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a spectrum of developmental and neurological symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). In the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, a single UBR-1 homolog retains all major conserved functional domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). LIN-28 is the sole identified substrate of <italic>C. elegans</italic> UBR-1, acting as an RNA-binding pluripotency factor crucial for seam cell patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). However, the absence of LIN-28 neither replicates nor ameliorates the movement defects observed in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants-stiff body bending during backward movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>).</p>
<p>Our recent research has consistently shown that UBR-1 regulates neural outputs through glutamate homeostasis mechanisms. Loss of UBR-1 leads to elevated glutamate levels in animals, disrupting coordinated motor patterns, likely due to a compensatory decrease in the expression of excitatory glutamate receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutations disturb inherent asymmetric neural activity by activating inhibitory GluCls (GLC-3 and GLC-2/4), which in turn impairs rhythmic defecation motor programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). These observations suggest that aberrant glutamate metabolism resulting from UBR-1 deficiency has a widespread effect on glutamatergic signaling pathways. This leads to the question of whether <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants cause comprehensive changes in IVM-targeted GluCls, thereby contributing to IVM resistance.</p>
<p>To investigate this possibility, we assessed the IVM sensitivity of wild-type and <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutant animals. We found that, in contrast to wild-type N2 animals, loss-of-function <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants present a range of IVM-resistant phenotypes. N2 animals exhibit high fatality rates, abnormal development and motor defects, such as pharyngeal pumping or locomotion disabilities, upon exposure to ivermectin. In contrast, <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants were almost insensitive to IVM. The elimination of the glutamate synthetase GOT-1 and the glutamate transporter EAT-4 completely reversed the IVM sensitivity of <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants, highlighting the critical role of the glutamatergic signaling pathway. Through the use of translational reporters and in situ calcium imaging, we determined that IVM resistance in <italic>ubr-1</italic> is due to the functional downregulation of IVM-targeted GluCls, including AVR-15, AVR-14, and GLC-1. This downregulation is presumably also triggered by the aberrantly elevated glutamate-induced compensatory decrease, as the application of exogenous glutamate in wild-type animals partially replicated the IVM resistance observed in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants. Moreover, pharmacologically reducing glutamate levels via the use of ceftriaxone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>) successfully restored IVM sensitivity in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants. Thus, our study presents multiple lines of evidence for a novel IVM resistance mechanism linked to the deficiency of the ubiquitin ligase UBR-1 via a glutamate metabolism pathway.</p>

<title>Dose- and time-dependence of IVM resistance in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants</title>
<p>To further elucidate the mechanisms of anthelmintic resistance (AR), we employed a simplified assay derived from prior research (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We assessed the survival of nematodes on media infused with antiparasitic macrocyclic lactones (MLs). In essence, synchronized L4-stage worms were placed on NGM plates with OP50 bacteria and treated with various MLs, including ivermectin (IVM, 5 ng/mL), avermectin (AVM, 5 ng/mL), or doramectin (DOM, 5 ng/mL). Twenty hours postexposure, we quantified the surviving worms and calculated the percentage of viability relative to the initial population.</p>

<p>Our observations revealed a significant decline in the viability of wild-type nematodes following ML exposure (IVM 52.0 ± 3.2%, AVM 51.6 ± 2.9%, DOM 52.4 ± 3.4%, in contrast to the vehicle control 100 ± 0.0%), confirming the susceptibility of <italic>C. elegans</italic> to MLs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast, <italic>ubr-1(hp684; lf)</italic> mutants presented remarkable resistance to ML treatments (IVM, <italic>ubr-1</italic> 96.0 ± 1.7% vs vehicle control 100 ± 0.0%) when juxtaposed with their wild-type counterparts (IVM, WT 52.0 ± 3.2%) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). This trend of increased survival was consistently observed with <italic>ubr-1(hp684)</italic> mutants treated with AVM (WT 51.6 ± 2.9% vs <italic>ubr-1</italic> 82.8 ± 2.9%) and DOM (WT 52.4 ± 3.4% vs <italic>ubr-1</italic> 83.6 ± 3.1%). These findings reveal the pronounced ML resistance characteristics of <italic>ubr-1</italic> loss-of-function mutants.</p>
<p>We further investigated the dose- and time-dependent resistance of <italic>ubr-1(hp684)</italic> to select IVM as a proxy for MLs because of its efficiency and common application. We tested a spectrum of IVM concentrations ranging from 1 ng/mL to 11 ng/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1A</xref>). The data revealed that <italic>ubr-1(hp684)</italic> mutants exhibited resistance at all tested doses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), resulting in a doubling of the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) — from 5.7 ng/mL in wild-type N2 worms to 11.6 ng/mL in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants. Time-dependent IVM resistance was also compared between the wild type and <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1B</xref>). The duration of half-maximal inhibition in the wild type was approximately 20.2 hours, which increased to 42.1 hours in the <italic>ubr-1(hp684)</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). To highlight the disparity in IVM resistance, we utilized an assay with 5 ng/mL IVM for a 20-hour period (indicated by the vertical dashed lines in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C and D</xref>) for subsequent experiments, unless otherwise specified.</p>

<title>Additional IVM resistance phenotypes of <italic>ubr-1</italic></title>
<p>In addition to viability, <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants maintained normal growth despite IVM exposure. After 20 hours of IVM, the body size of the wild-type animals significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>), resulting in a marked decrease in the middle line body length (control, 1.07 ± 0.02 mm; IVM, 0.62 ± 0.03 mm) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). In contrast, the size of the <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants (control, 1.08 ± 0.02 mm; IVM, 1.00 ± 0.02 mm) was largely preserved, indicating that the <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants developed into typical young adults (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Notably, while IVM exposure nearly halted pharyngeal pumping in wild-type animals (control 247.4 ± 4.1 min<sup>-1</sup>, IVM 34.6 ± 2.8 min<sup>-1</sup>), <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants sustained considerable pumping activity (control 254.1 ± 5.0 min<sup>-1</sup>, IVM 152.9 ± 3.0 min<sup>-1</sup>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). Motor functions were similarly resistant to IVM in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants (Movie S1). The velocity of free movement under IVM treatment was significantly greater in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants (135.9 ± 7.2 μm/s) than in wild-type animals (23.8 ± 2.1 μm/s) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H, I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1C</xref>). No significant differences in viability, body length, pharyngeal pumping, or locomotion speed were detected between <italic>ubr-1</italic> and wild-type animals in the absence of IVM treatment.</p>
<p>These results collectively indicate that <italic>ubr-1</italic> loss-of-function mutants present a comprehensive spectrum of phenotypes associated with IVM resistance.</p>

<title>Different <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants exhibit consistent IVM resistance</title>
<p>The <italic>ubr-1</italic> gene is functionally conserved from yeast to humans. In nematodes or filarial worms, <italic>ubr-1</italic> also exhibited high sequence similarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2A</xref>). The <italic>hp684</italic> allele contains a premature stop codon, resulting in the truncation of the final 194 amino acids of UBR-1 (Q1864X) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2B</xref>). To validate functional congruence, we expanded our study to include additional <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutant alleles. These alleles, which are genetically predicted to lack one or more critical conserved domains, including <italic>hp865</italic>, which replaces the entire RING finger domain with an SL2-NLS::GFP, and <italic>hp821 hp833</italic> (E34X, E1315X), each introducing stop codons that suggest the absence of all functional domains. All these alleles demonstrated IVM resistance comparable to that of the <italic>hp684</italic> allele. Specifically, the viability of <italic>hp865</italic> (81.6 ± 3.8%) and <italic>hp821 hp833</italic> (76.4 ± 2.6%) increased following IVM treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2C</xref>). Similarly, the body lengths of <italic>hp865</italic> (0.93 ± 0.02 mm) and <italic>hp821 hp833</italic> (0.90 ± 0.02 mm) were not diminished by IVM exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2D</xref>). Pharyngeal pumping and spontaneous movement velocities were also significantly greater in <italic>hp865</italic> (154.2 ± 3.4 min<sup>-1</sup>, 100.2 ± 7.4 μm/s) and <italic>hp821 hp833</italic> (134.9 ± 3.7 min<sup>-1</sup>, 86.1 ± 6.9 μm/s) than in the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2E, F</xref>). These findings demonstrate that various <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants exhibit a consistent IVM-resistant phenotype.</p>

<title>Glutamate induces IVM resistance in wild-type worms</title>
<p>Systemic elevation of glutamate levels in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants has been documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>), prompting an investigation into whether this increase is the key determinant of the observed resistance to IVM.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, we pretreated wild-type N2 animals with glutamate to mimic the excessive glutamate environment in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). During these trials, wild-type larvae were exposed to L-glutamate (20 mM) on NGM plates from the L1 to L4 stages before their transfer to IVM-containing plates. Strikingly, these glutamate-pretreated animals presented a significant increase in IVM resistance (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>

<p>Specifically, the viability of these glutamate-exposed animals increased from 52 ± 3.2% to 77.2 ± 1.5% compared with that of their nonexposed counterparts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). A corresponding increase in body size was noted, from 0.62 ± 0.03 mm to 0.76 ± 0.01 mm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Motor activity similarly improved, with velocities increasing from 23.79 ± 2.1 μm/s to 62.4 ± 7.6 μm/s (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E-F</xref>). These findings clearly demonstrate that the external application of glutamate can induce IVM resistance in wild-type N2 animals. Interestingly, in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants, pretreatment with glutamate did not further increase IVM resistance, implying potential saturation of the glutamate effect in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B-F</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to glutamate, other metabolically related molecules, such as aspartate (Asp), a precursor in glutamate synthesis, and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a product of glutamate metabolism, were also found to be elevated in the <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). However, the cocultivation of wild-type N2 worms with aspartate or GABA did not confer IVM resistance (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-F</xref>), suggesting the glutamate-specific regulation of IVM resistance. This finding highlights the specificity and sufficiency of glutamate in conferring IVM resistance in a wild-type context.</p>

<title>Enhancing glutamate uptake restores IVM sensitivity in <italic>ubr-1</italic></title>
<p>Given the likelihood that elevated glutamate levels underpin IVM resistance in <italic>ubr-1</italic>, mitigating this glutamate surplus could reverse resistance and reinstate IVM sensitivity. To evaluate this premise, we employed ceftriaxone (Cef) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>), which is known for enhancing glutamate uptake by upregulating excitatory amino acid transporter-2 (EAAT2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>), with the aim of reducing glutamate levels.</p>
<p>The results were striking: the IVM resistance typically observed in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants was completely counteracted by Cef treatment. While Cef (50 μg/mL) had a negligible effect on wild-type N2 animals, it fully restored IVM sensitivity in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). Moreover, this restoration followed a dose-dependent pattern, with a half-effect concentration of 5.14 μg/mL (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). Cef treatment resulted in a decrease in the viability of <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants from 96.0 ± 1.7% to 62.8 ± 2.3% in the presence of IVM (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). Additional IVM resistance phenotypes in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants, such as body size, pharyngeal pumping frequency, and locomotion velocity, were fully ameliorated by Cef (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J-L</xref>).</p>
<p>In line with its classification as a beta-lactam antibiotic, Cef effectively reduced the growth of the worm food source <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50, resulting in a reduced bacterial lawn on NGM plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3A, B</xref>). However, simply diminishing the OP50 bacterial quantity on NGM plates without Cef did not restore IVM sensitivity in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3C-F</xref>), suggesting that food scarcity is not a critical factor. Similarly, increasing the number of OP50 bacteria present on NGM plates containing Cef did not affect its ability to restore IVM sensitivity in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3C-F</xref>). These findings indicate that the antimicrobial action of ceftriaxone is not related to its ability to restore IVM sensitivity in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants.</p>
<p>Hence, these results indicate that pharmacologically reducing glutamate levels in <italic>ubr-1</italic> reestablishes IVM sensitivity, leading to the hypothesis that aberrant glutamate metabolism underlies IVM resistance in <italic>ubr-1</italic>.</p>

<title>Restoration of <italic>ubr-</italic>1 IVM sensitivity through glutamatergic signaling pathway regulation</title>
<p>Our previous research revealed the involvement of UBR-1 in regulating glutamate metabolism, which is essential for coordinated reversal bending and rhythmic defecation motor programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). The absence of UBR-1 also leads to perturbations in the balance between the GABAergic and glutamatergic signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, IVM sensitivity is marked by the sustained activation of glutamate-gated chloride channels (GluCls) by IVM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). These glutamate-related findings led us to explore whether the resistance of <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants to IVM could be attributed to alterations in the glutamate signaling pathway.</p>
<p>At glutamatergic synapses, a series of enzymatic reactions link glutamate to neurotransmitter recycling. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminases, or GOT enzymes, facilitate amino group conversion between aspartate and α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) to oxaloacetate (OAA) and glutamate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). We began our exploration by assessing IVM sensitivity following the disruption of GOT-1. While single <italic>got-1</italic> loss-of-function mutants displayed IVM sensitivity similar to that of the wild type, <italic>ubr-1; got-1</italic> double mutants presented a significant increase in IVM sensitivity, reverting to wild-type levels of viability, body length, and motor activity, in stark contrast to <italic>ubr-1</italic> single mutants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B-E</xref>). These findings indicate that impeding glutamate synthesis can effectively restore IVM sensitivity in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants.</p>

<p>Glutamate, a crucial excitatory neurotransmitter, is packed into synaptic vesicles by the vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT) and released into the synaptic cleft to activate postsynaptic receptors.

<p>Notably, the absence of EAT-4 in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants dramatically reversed their IVM resistance, as evidenced by increased viability (<italic>ubr-1; eat-4</italic> 66.8 ± 3.5%), reduced body length (<italic>ubr-1; eat-4</italic> 0.56 ± 0.02 mm), increased pharyngeal pumping (<italic>ubr-1; eat-4</italic> 46.7 ± 3.6 min<sup>-1</sup>), and improved locomotion speed (<italic>ubr-1; eat-4</italic> 83.5 ± 7.4 μm/s) in <italic>ubr-1; eat-4</italic> double mutants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B-E</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, these results underscore the importance of glutamate synthesis and synaptic transport in restoring IVM sensitivity in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants, suggesting a role for synaptic glutamate signaling in the resistance of <italic>ubr-1</italic> to IVM. The IVM resistance phenotypes of wild-type N2 animals were not rescued by ceftriaxone (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I-L</xref>), suggesting that ceftriaxone appears to be effective only against excess glutamate. This discovery is particularly intriguing, as it reveals a previously unexplored role of glutamate metabolism in the regulation of IVM resistance.</p>

<title>UBR-1 appears to regulate IVM resistance from the pharynx</title>
<p>UBR-1 is ubiquitously expressed across a variety of tissues, including the pharynx, body wall muscles, and neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). To pinpoint the critical tissue for the role of UBR-1 in IVM resistance, we conducted tissue-specific rescue assays via a functional plasmid. Our findings revealed that restoring UBR-1 expression under its endogenous promoter attenuated the IVM resistance observed in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants. Notably, when UBR-1 expression was driven by an exogenous pharyngeal muscle-specific promoter, it fully corrected the IVM resistance phenotypes of the <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F-I</xref>). These results imply that although UBR-1 is important in multiple tissues, its role in the pharynx is particularly critical in modulating IVM sensitivity.</p>
<p>To verify the tissue-specific function of UBR-1, we utilized RNA interference (RNAi) to selectively decrease <italic>ubr-1</italic> expression in the pharynx. This precise RNAi application to the pharynx indeed induced IVM resistance in wild-type N2 worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4B-E</xref>). RNAi-mediated knockdown of <italic>ubr-1</italic> in nonpharyngeal tissues, such as neurons and body wall muscles, also elicits an IVM resistance profile. Our research revealed that animals in which <italic>ubr-1</italic> was knocked down specifically in the pharynx presented more pronounced IVM resistance phenotypes than did those in which <italic>ubr-1</italic> was knocked down in other tissues. This phenotype approached the level observed when <italic>ubr-1</italic> was knocked down via its native promoter, underscoring the unique contribution of the pharynx to <italic>ubr-1</italic>-mediated IVM resistance.</p>
<p>Taken together, these results confirm that UBR-1 predominantly regulates IVM resistance through its action in the pharynx.</p>

<title>Downregulation of IVM-targeted GluCls in <italic>ubr-1</italic></title>
<p>What mechanisms underlie the induction of IVM resistance by abnormal glutamate metabolism? Previously, we established that <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants exhibit impaired GLR-1 glutamate receptor function in AVA/AVE interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Three GluCls (<italic>avr-15</italic>, <italic>avr-14</italic>, <italic>glc-1</italic>) are recognized as pivotal for IVM resistance in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). We sought to determine whether compromised IVM-targeted GluCls contribute to IVM resistance in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, we created three transgenic strains with translational reporters for each GluCl under the control of their native promoters (P<italic>avr-15</italic>::AVR-15::GFP, P<italic>avr-14</italic>::AVR-14::GFP, P<italic>glc-1</italic>::GLC-1::GFP). Notably, AVR-15::GFP expression was pronounced in the pharynx, whereas GLC-1::GFP displayed a distinct head expression pattern, particularly concentrated in the head body wall muscles (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Figure S5A</xref>). AVR-14::GFP expression was localized primarily to various head and body neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Figure S5A</xref>). Intriguingly, compared with that in wild-type animals, the fluorescence intensity of these GluCls was markedly lower in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Figure S5A, B</xref>). The modulation of GluCl expression by <italic>ubr-1</italic> seems to be posttranscriptional, given that the RNA levels of the GluCl-encoding genes (<italic>avr-15</italic>, <italic>avr-14</italic>, <italic>glc-1</italic>) did not significantly differ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Figure S5C</xref>).</p>

<p>Crucially, the reduction in pharyngeal AVR-15::GFP fluorescence observed in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants was reversed upon reintroduction of UBR-1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Additionally, eliminating <italic>got-1</italic> and <italic>eat-4</italic> in these mutants mitigated the decrease in AVR-15::GFP expression within the pharynx (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A, B</xref>), suggesting a direct role of glutamate signaling in regulating GluCl expression levels. Notably, ceftriaxone pretreatment effectively reversed the diminished pharyngeal AVR-15::GFP levels in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A, B</xref>. In addition to glutamate pretreatment eliciting IVM resistance in wild-type animals, the application of glutamate markedly diminished the pharyngeal AVR-15::GFP fluorescence in these same wild-type worms (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A, B</xref>).</p>
<p>To further investigate the potential regulatory influence of <italic>ubr-1</italic> on a broader spectrum of synaptic receptors, we selected two distinct categories of receptors that are not activated by glutamate. This reduction was not observed for the excitatory acetylcholine receptor (UNC-29/AChR) or inhibitory GABA receptor (UNC-49/GABA<sub>A</sub>R) (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6</xref>), suggesting that <italic>ubr-1</italic> may selectively affect glutamate-gated receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>).</p>
<p>Collectively, these results demonstrate that aberrant glutamate metabolism in the <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutant leads to the downregulation of IVM-targeted GluCls, which likely contributes to diminished IVM responsiveness, culminating in the IVM resistance observed in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants.</p>

<title>IVM completely suppresses serotonin-evoked pharynx activity in wild-type animals but not in <italic>ubr-1</italic></title>

<p>Interestingly, we observed that 5-HT induced similar Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in both wild-type and <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutant worms. Furthermore, upon application of IVM (3 μM), 5-HT-elicited Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity was profoundly suppressed in the wild-type pharynx (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>), mirroring its effect on pharyngeal pumping. However, <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants exhibited marked resistance to the suppressive effects of IVM, with only a modest decrease in the amplitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Essentially, the capacity of IVM to inhibit 5-HT-driven pharynx activity was significantly compromised in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants. Additionally, consistent with its behavioral impact, IVM dose-dependently suppressed 5-HT-elicited pharynx Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity, with an estimated IVM IC<sub>50</sub> of approximately 0.5 μM for wild-type and 10.1 μM for <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). These findings reveal the functional deficits of IVM-targeted GluCls in <italic>ubr-1</italic>.</p>
<p>In line with our earlier behavioral findings, the restoration of UBR-1 expression successfully reversed the inhibition of 5-HT-induced pharynx Ca<sup>2+ by IVM</sup> in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). This corrective effect was similarly observed in <italic>ubr-1; got-1</italic> and <italic>ubr-1; eat-4</italic> double mutants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G, I</xref>), reinforcing the association between decreased GluCl expression and attenuated IVM inhibition in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants. These results suggest a mechanism whereby elevated glutamate levels in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants may lead to glutamate-induced downregulation of GluCls, ultimately leading to IVM resistance.</p>
<p>To substantiate this proposed mechanism, we evaluated pharyngeal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants pretreated with Cef and in wild-type animals pretreated with glutamate. Consistent with our behavioral data, Cef treatment effectively reversed the inhibitory effect of IVM on 5-HT-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in the pharynx of <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G, I</xref>), whereas glutamate exposure resulted in significant IVM resistance in wild-type animals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H, I</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we identified a crucial role of the E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR-1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, which contributes to IVM resistance. Given the importance of UBR-1 in regulating glutamate metabolism, our research introduces a novel mechanism for IVM resistance that could be applicable to other macrocyclic lactone (ML) anthelmintic resistance scenarios. Notably, this glutamate-based mechanism operates upstream, affecting the expression levels of GluCls, a departure from the previously documented variations in detoxification transporters that facilitate drug efflux. Through detailed investigation, we demonstrated that UBR-1 is instrumental in maintaining physiological glutamate homeostasis, thereby governing the abundance of various glutamate receptors. In <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants, perturbations in glutamate metabolism lead to reduced expression of primary IVM-sensitive GluCls, leading to decreased IVM-induced inhibition of serotonin (5-HT)-evoked pharynx Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and subsequent resistance to IVM.</p>

<title>A working model for UBR-1-mediated IVM resistance in <italic>C. elegans</italic></title>
<p>Building upon our findings, we propose a working model that illustrates the role of the E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR-1 in mediating IVM resistance (Figure 6). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, UBR-1 ensures functional glutamate homeostasis by inhibiting the activity of transaminase GOT-1 through a signaling pathway that has yet to be resolved. A deficiency in UBR-1 leads to uncontrolled production of excess glutamate by GOT-1, which is then packed into synaptic vesicles for release via the vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT/EAT-4. This excess glutamate results in the downregulation of glutamate receptors, including the IVM-targeted GluCls AVR-15, AVR-14, and GLC-1. The consequent reduction in these receptors diminishes the inhibitory effect of IVM on 5-HT-evoked pharynx Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity, highlighting the notable IVM resistance in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants. Furthermore, the exogenous application of glutamate induces IVM resistance in wild-type animals, whereas the pharmacological enhancement of glutamate transporter activity via ceftriaxone mitigates resistance in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants. These observations support the conclusion that IVM resistance in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants is intricately linked with aberrant glutamate metabolism.</p>

<title>Unveiling a novel mechanism of anthelmintic resistance: aberrant glutamate metabolism</title>
<p>Glutamate is a central metabolic hub that connects glucose and amino acid metabolism in neurons and astrocytes. Disruptions in glutamate metabolism can precipitate an overabundance of glutamate, which in turn may trigger activity-dependent modulation of glutamate receptors. This phenomenon has been observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where an increase in presynaptic glutamate concentrations leads to a notable reduction in both the number of glutamate receptors and the size of the synaptic field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). Similarly, glutamate treatments have been shown to cause a loss of postsynaptic glutamate receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). In mammalian systems, prolonged exposure to glutamate has been demonstrated to specifically reduce RNA editing levels of AMPA receptors in primary cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). These findings suggest that a compensatory downregulation mechanism may be responsible for the observed decrease in glutamate receptors in response to excess glutamate.</p>
<p>In our study, we revealed that an overproduction of glutamate resulting from ubr-1 mutations leads to the downregulation of IVM-targeted GluCls, which is subsequently linked to IVM resistance in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. This contrasts with previously elucidated mechanisms of IVM resistance, such as alterations in IVM-receptor binding sites that diminish their affinity, null mutations in IVM-targeted receptors, the upregulation of cellular efflux pumps, and enhanced drug degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Our research introduces a novel metabolic mechanism involving glutamate receptors. We demonstrated that the levels of IVM-targeted receptors are subject to modulation via the glutamate metabolic pathway. This finding highlights the potential for glutamate accumulation, whether through metabolic dysregulation or exogenous administration, to confer IVM resistance, thereby offering fresh perspectives on the mechanisms behind anthelmintic resistance. Our findings therefore reveal a new UBR-1-mediated pathway via GluCls that connects glutamate metabolism with IVM resistance.</p>
<p>Given the high degree of conservation in glutamate signaling pathways between <italic>C. elegans</italic> and parasitic nematodes, the implications of our findings are far-reaching. This highlights the importance of developing new pharmacological agents aimed at modulating glutamate metabolism for the control of parasitic nematodes. Moreover, altering environmental glutamate concentrations—whether through modifications in the physiological environment of nematodes or changes in the host’s diet—may increase the effectiveness of traditional macrocyclic lactone anthelmintics.</p>

<title>Expanding parasitic control through glutamate clearance</title>
<p>The recommendation for combination anthelmintic treatments to slow the emergence of anthelmintic resistance is well established, as they cover a similar range of parasites but act via different mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Our research proposes an innovative approach for parasite prevention: the clearance of glutamate. The use of ceftriaxone, which has been shown to completely recover IVM sensitivity in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants, presents a viable option to mitigate anthelmintic resistance prompted by excess glutamate. A combination treatment that includes ceftriaxone and IVM-like anthelmintics is advisable. Moreover, the concurrent use of ceftriaxone with other antiparasitic drugs may prove effective in treating AR parasites.</p>
<p>This dual-treatment strategy offers several benefits, such as the widespread availability of ceftriaxone, its established FDA approval since 1982 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>), the relatively low dose needed to increase IVM sensitivity, and its cost-effectiveness, particularly in the developing world.</p>
<p>Although the dynamics of anthelmintic resistance may vary among different hosts, our study contributes a fresh outlook by revealing a new mechanism of IVM resistance and advocating alternative preventative measures. We hope that these insights will attract the attention of global health authorities such as the World Health Organization and spark additional research in the realm of parasite control.</p>

<title><italic>C. elegans</italic> Strains and Transgenic Lines</title>
<p><italic>C. elegans</italic> strains were cultured at 22°C on nematode growth medium (NGM) plates seeded with <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 as a food source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). The wild-type Bristol N2 strain was used, and the <italic>ubr-1(hp684)</italic> strains were sourced from an EMS mutagenesis screen.

<title>Ivermectin sensitivity assay</title>
<p>Ivermectin and avermectin (product number: PHR1380/31372) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) and then diluted in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Doramectin (product number: D127678) was purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai, China). A stock solution of 40 mM IVM was prepared in 1 mL of DMSO. Initial ML resistance assays utilized IVM, avermectin, and doramectin at 5 ng/mL. Standard NGM plates with OP50 and 0.03% DMSO were used, with varying IVM concentrations for tests. L4 hermaphrodites were synchronized and exposed to IVM for viability assays. After 20 hours, the body length, pharyngeal pump rate, and locomotion velocity of the survivors were analyzed via a stereomicroscope (Axio Zoom V16, Zeiss). Each experiment was independently replicated at least three times.</p>

<sec id="s4c">
<title>Animal viability and motor analysis</title>
<p>Animal viability was assessed by calculating the relative residual ratio: the number of viable worms after 20 hours of IVM incubation divided by the initial worm count. Viability (%), body length (mm), and velocity (µm/s) were measured via a custom MATLAB script (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>).</p>
<p>For movement analysis, IVM-exposed worms were transferred to fresh OP50 plates. For locomotion velocity analysis, a single hermaphrodite was transferred to a 60 mm imaging plate. One minute after the transfer, a three-minute video of the crawled animal was recorded on a modified stereomicroscope (Axio Zoom V16, Zeiss) with a digital camera (acA2500-60um, Basler). Postimaging analyses utilized an in-house written MATLAB script. The central line was used for tracking. Images for velocity analysis from each animal were divided into 33 body segments. The midpoint was used to calculate the body length and velocity between each frame. The pharyngeal pumping frequency was directly calculated manually via video as pumps per minute (min<sup>-1</sup>).</p>

<title>Pharmacological pretreatment</title>
<p>For glutamate application, glutamate (product number: G1251, Sigma Aldrich) was dissolved in NGM at final concentrations of 0.2 mM, 1 mM, 5 mM, 10 mM, 20 mM, and 40 mM. Wild-type and <italic>ubr-1</italic> animals were exposed to glutamate from the L1 to L4 stages and then assessed after 20 hours on glutamate and IVM plates. The same experimental procedure was used for γ-aminobutyric acid (5 mM, product number: A2129, Sigma Aldrich) and aspartate (5 mM, product number: A6202, Macklin, Shanghai, China).</p>
<p>In parallel, <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants were treated with ceftriaxone sodium (product number: TC6154, Biobomei, Hefei, China) at final concentrations of 0.05 µg/mL, 0.5 µg/mL, 5 µg/mL, 50 µg/mL, and 500 µg/mL. Viability and motor ability were evaluated after L4 worms were transferred to plates containing ceftriaxone and ivermectin (5 ng/mL) for 20 hours.</p>

<title>Molecular biology and RNA interference</title>
<p>All expression and rescue plasmids were generated via the multisite gateway system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Three entry clones (Slot1, Slot2, Slot3) corresponding to the promoter, target gene and fluorescent marker genes were recombined into pDEST™ R4-R3 Vector II via the LR reaction, and expression constructs were subsequently obtained. The expression patterns of <italic>ubr-1</italic>, <italic>avr-15</italic>, <italic>avr-14</italic> and <italic>glc-1</italic> were examined via promoter elements of 1.6 kb, 2.7 kb, 3.0 kb and 1.14 kb, respectively. DNA fragments were PCR-amplified from N2 genomic DNA.</p>
<p>Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) interference technology was used to suppress gene expression in specific tissues. Essential to this process is the expression of dsRNA, which is critical for achieving targeted neuronal or tissue-specific RNAi in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). The plasmid for RNAi was obtained by constructing Slot2 via the BP reaction of a multisite gateway system. The exon-rich region is usually selected as the interfering region (500-700 bp), the sense strand is selected as the target gene for forward interfering sequences (RNAi, sense), and the antisense strand is selected as the target gene for reverse interfering sequences (RNAi, antisense).</p>

<title>RNA sequencing analysis</title>
<p>For RNA-seq analysis, synchronized L4 worms were washed with bath solution at least 3 times and harvested via centrifugation. Total RNA was isolated via the freeze‒thaw method, and different samples were provided to Novogene for RNA-seq analysis. Transcripts per million (TPM), a standard gene expression normalization method that adjusts the expression of a gene to the number of transcripts per million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>), was used to indicate quantitative gene expression. The TPM value takes into account the length of the gene and the sequencing depth and converts the expression of a gene to the number of transcripts per million by dividing the count value of each gene by its length and normalizing appropriately.</p>

<p>The strain SGA616 [P<italic>myo-2</italic>::GCaMP6s::wCherry] was used to facilitate calcium imaging of the pharyngeal muscles. One-day-old adult hermaphrodites were glued, and the terminal bulb was dissected for imaging with a 60x water objective (Nikon, Japan; numerical aperture = 1.0). Serotonin (5-HT, product number: S31021, Yuanye, Shanghai, China) and ivermectin stock solutions were diluted to the desired concentrations via the following bath solution (in mM): NaCl 150; KCl 5; CaCl<sub>2</sub> 5;</p>
<p>MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1; glucose 10; sucrose 5; and HEPES 15, pH 7.3 with NaOH, ∼330 mOsm. The control bath solution, 5-HT alone, or a combination of 5-HT and ivermectin were administered 30 seconds after initiating the recording via a gravity-driven perfusion system (INBIO MPS-3, China). Fluorescence images were acquired with an excitation wavelength LED at 470 nm and a digital sCMOS camera (Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash 4.0V2) under a wide-field microscope (Nikon LV-TV) at a rate of 10 frames per second for 2 minutes. Data were collected from HCImage (Hamamatsu) and analyzed via Image-Pro Plus 6.0 (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA) and ImageJ (National Institutes of Health).

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study will allow for a better understanding of anthelmintic drug resistance in nematodes, a growing concern for public health. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the role of UBR-1 and its underlying mechanism in ivermectin resistance using <bold>convincing</bold> behavioural and genetic experiments with C. elegans. What is not yet clear is how much of this study applies to parasitic nematodes, in which resistance has naturally emerged in different populations. The study will be of relevance to colleagues working on the evolution of drug resistance and to parasitologists in general.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The drug Ivermectin is used to effectively treat a variety of worm parasites in the world, however resistance to Ivermectin poses a rising challenge for this treatment strategy. In this study, the authors found that loss of the E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR-1 in the worm C. elegans results in resistance to Ivermectin. In particular, the authors found that ubr-1 mutants are resistant to the effects of Ivermectin on worm viability, body size, pharyngeal pumping, and locomotion. The authors previously showed that loss of UBR-1 disrupts homeostasis of the amino acid and neurotransmitter glutamate resulting in increased levels of glutamate in C. elegans. Here, the authors found that the sensitivity of ubr-1 mutants to Ivermectin can be restored if glutamate levels are reduced using a variety of different methods. Conversely, treating worms with exogenous glutamate to increase glutamate levels also results in resistance to Ivermectin supporting the idea that increased glutamate promotes resistance to Ivermectin. The authors found that the primary known targets of Ivermectin, glutamate-gated chloride channels (GluCls), are downregulated in ubr-1 mutants providing a plausible mechanism for why ubr-1 mutants are resistant to Ivermectin. Although it is clear that loss of GluCls can lead to resistance to Ivermectin, this study suggests that one potential mechanism to decrease GluCl expression is via disruption of glutamate homeostasis that leads to increased glutamate. This study suggests that if parasitic worms become resistant to Ivermectin due to increased glutamate, their sensitivity to Ivermectin could be restored by reducing glutamate levels using drugs such as Ceftriaxone in a combination drug treatment strategy.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The use of multiple independent assays (i.e., viability, body size, pharyngeal pumping, locomotion, and serotonin-stimulated pharyngeal muscle activity) to monitor the effects of Ivermectin</p>
<p>(2) The use of multiple independent approaches (got-1, eat-4, ceftriaxone drug, exogenous glutamate treatment) to alter glutamate levels to support the conclusion that increased glutamate in ubr-1 mutants contributes to Ivermectin resistance.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The primary target of Ivermectin is GluCls so it is not surprising that alteration of GluCl expression or function would lead to Ivermectin resistance.</p>
<p>(2) It remains to be seen what percent of Ivermectin-resistant parasites in the wild have disrupted glutamate homeostasis as opposed to mutations that more directly decrease GluCl expression or function.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors provide a very thorough investigation of the role of UBR-1 in anthelmintic resistance using the non-parasitic nematode, C. elegans. Anthelmintic resistance to macrocyclic lactones is a major problem in veterinary medicine and likely just a matter of time until resistance emerges in human parasites too. Therefore, this study providing novel insight into the mechanisms of ivermectin resistance is particularly important and significant.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors use very diverse technologies (behavior, genetics, pharmacology, genetically encoded reporters) to dissect the role of UBR-1 in ivermectin resistance. Deploying such a comprehensive suite of tools and approaches provides exceptional insight into the mechanism of how UBR-1 functions in terms of ivermectin resistance.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I do not see any major weaknesses in this study. My only concern is whether the observations made by the authors would translate to any of the important parasitic helminths in which resistance has naturally emerged in the field. This is always a concern when leveraging a non-parasitic nematode to shed light on a potential mechanism of resistance of parasitic nematodes, and I understand that it is likely beyond the scope of this paper to test some of their results in parasitic nematodes.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Li et al propose to better understand the mechanisms of drug resistance in nematode parasites by studying mutants of the model roundworm C. elegans that are resistant to the deworming drug ivermectin. They provide compelling evidence that loss-of-function mutations in the E3 ubiquitin ligase encoded by the UBR-1 gene make worms resistant to the effects of ivermectin (and related compounds) on viability, body size, pharyngeal pumping rate, and locomotion and that these mutant phenotypes are rescued by a UBR-1 transgene. They propose that the mechanism is resistance is indirect, via the effects of UBR-1 on glutamate production. They show mutations (vesicular glutamate transporter eat-4, glutamate synthase got-1) and drugs (glutamate, glutamate uptake enhancer ceftriaxone) affecting glutamate metabolism/transport modulate sensitivity to ivermectin in wild-type and ubr-1 mutants. The data are generally consistent with greater glutamate tone equating to ivermectin resistance. Finally, they show that manipulations that are expected to increase glutamate tone appear to reduce expression of the targets of ivermectin, the glutamate-gated chloride channels, which is known to increase resistance.</p>
<p>There is a need for genetic markers of ivermectin resistance in livestock parasites that can be used to better track resistance and to tailor drug treatment. The discovery of UBR-1 as a resistance gene in C. elegans will provide a candidate marker that can be followed up in parasites. The data suggest Ceftriaxone would be a candidate compound to reverse resistance.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strength of the study is the thoroughness of the analysis and the quality of the data. There can be little doubt that ubr-1 mutations do indeed confer ivermectin resistance. The use of both rescue constructs and RNAi to validate mutant phenotypes is notable. Further, the variety of manipulations they use to affect glutamate metabolism/transport makes a compelling argument for some kind of role for glutamate in resistance.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The proposed mechanism of ubr-1 resistance i.e.: UBR-1 E3 ligase regulates glutamate tone which regulates ivermectin receptor expression, is broadly consistent with the data but somewhat difficult to reconcile with the specific functions of the genes regulating glutamatergic tone. Ceftriaxone and eat-4 mutants reduce extracellular/synaptic glutamate concentrations by sequestering available glutamate in neurons, suggesting that it is extracellular glutamate that is important. But then why does rescuing ubr-1 specifically in the pharyngeal muscle have such a strong effect on ivermectin sensitivity? Is glutamate leaking out of the pharyngeal muscle into the extracellular space/synapse? Is it possible that UBR-1 acts directly on the avr-15 subunit, both of which are expressed in the muscle, perhaps as part of a glutamate sensing/homeostasis mechanism?</p>
<p>The use of single ivermectin dose assays can be misleading. A response change at a single dose shows that the dose-response curve has shifted, but the response is not linear with dose, so the degree of that shift may be difficult to discern and may result from a change in slope but not EC50.</p>
<p>Similarly, in Figure 3C, the reader is meant to understand that eat-4 mutant is epistatic to ubr-1 because the double mutant has a wild-type response to ivermectin. But eat-4 alone is more sensitive, so (eyeballing it and interpolating) the shift in EC50 caused by the ubr-1 mutant in a wild type background appears to be the same as in an eat-4 background, so arguably you are seeing an additive effect, not epistasis. For the above reasons, it would be desirable to have results for rescuing constructs in a wild-type background, in addition to the mutant background.</p>
<p>The added value of the pumping data in Figure 5 (using calcium imaging) over the pump counts (from video) in Figure 1G, Figure 2E, F, K, &amp; Figure 3D, H is not clearly explained. It may have to do with the use of &quot;dissected&quot; pharynxes, the nature/advantage of which is not sufficiently documented in the Methods/Results.</p>
