<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Frizzled (FZD) proteins are the principal receptors of the Wnt signaling pathway. However, whether Wnt ligands induce FZD endocytosis and degradation remains elusive. The transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligases ZNRF3 and RNF43 were reported to promote the endocytosis and degradation of FZD receptors to inhibit Wnt signaling, and their function is antagonized by R-spondin (RSPO) proteins. However, the dependency of RSPO-ZNRF3/RNF43-mediated FZD endocytosis and degradation on Wnt stimulation, as well as the specificity of this degradation for different FZD, remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that Wnt induces FZD5/8 endocytosis and degradation in a ZNRF3/RNF43-dependent manner. ZNRF3/RNF43 selectively targets FZD5/8 for degradation upon Wnt stimulation. RSPO1 enhances Wnt signaling by specifically stabilizing FZD5/8. Wnt promotes the interaction between FZD5 and RNF43. We further demonstrated that DVL proteins promote ligand-independent endocytosis of FZD but are dispensable for Wnt-induced FZD5/8 endocytosis and degradation. Our results reveal a novel negative regulatory mechanism of Wnt signaling at the receptor level and illuminate the mechanism by which RSPO-ZNRF3/RNF43 regulates Wnt signaling, which may provide new insights into regenerative medicine and cancer therapy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The evolutionarily conserved Wnt signaling pathways play pivotal roles in embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Clevers and Nusse, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Nusse and Clevers, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Rim et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Stapornwongkul and Vincent, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Steinhart and Angers, 2018</xref>). There are nineteen Wnt ligands and ten Frizzled (FZD) receptors in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Wnt-FZD complexes activate several intracellular signaling pathways, including the canonical (Wnt/β-catenin) and noncanonical pathways. In the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, certain Wnt-FZD complexes engage and phosphorylate the coreceptors LRP5/6, inhibiting β-catenin phosphorylation and degradation, and stabilized cytosolic β-catenin is translocated to the nucleus, where it activates the TCF/LEF1 transcription factors to induce target gene expression. The noncanonical pathways, mainly the Wnt/PCP and Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> pathways, are activated by Wnt-FZD complexes with the assistance of the coreceptors ROR1/2, VANGL, RYK, and/or PTK7. These pathways regulate cell and tissue polarity, movement and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Niehrs, 2012</xref>). Wnt signaling pathways are tightly regulated at different levels to maintain normal physiological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jiang and Cong, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Rim et al., 2022</xref>). Multiple Wnt pathway mutations have been identified as driver events in human cancers, and several therapeutic strategies have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Anastas and Moon, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bugter et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">O’Brien et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Receptor endocytosis serves as a common regulatory mechanism across multiple signaling pathways. Numerous studies have reported that receptor endocytosis positively influences both the canonical and noncanonical Wnt pathways by facilitating or amplifying intracellular signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Yamamoto et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Yu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Conversely, ligand-induced receptor endocytosis and degradation play critical roles in controlling signal strength and duration and are typical negative regulatory mechanisms in receptor tyrosine kinase pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alexander, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Haglund and Dikic, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Marmor and Yarden, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Sorkin and Waters, 1993</xref>). However, whether Wnt induces FZD receptor endocytosis and degradation remains poorly characterized.</p>
<p>ZNRF3 and RNF43 are closely related transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligases that are induced by Wnt/β-catenin signaling and antagonize Wnt signaling by promoting FZD receptor endocytosis and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bugter et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Koo et al., 2012</xref>). However, how ZNRF3/RNF43 recognize FZD receptors is still controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Farnhammer et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Tsukiyama et al., 2021</xref>). A recent report suggested that ZNRF3/RNF43 ubiquitinates FZD receptors through binding to DVL proteins, which were previously thought to regulate FZD protein endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>). Another study proposed that ZNRF3/RNF43 interact with FZD receptors via their extracellular protease-associated (PA) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Tsukiyama et al., 2015</xref>). R-spondin (RSPO) family proteins of stem cell growth factors were reported to potentiate Wnt signaling by binding to and degrading ZNRF3/RNF43 with the help of LGR4 or LGR5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kazanskaya et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Park et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Xie et al., 2013</xref>). However, recent studies have indicated that RSPO can activate Wnt signaling through ZNRF3/RNF43 independently of LGRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dubey et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lebensohn and Rohatgi, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Szenker-Ravi et al., 2018</xref>). Whether RSPO-ZNRF3/RNF43-mediated regulation of FZD receptors relies on Wnt stimulation and whether there are specificities toward different FZDs remain unclear.</p>
<p>In this study, we first demonstrated that Wnt induces FZD5/8 endocytosis and degradation in a ZNRF3/RNF43-dependent manner. We further demonstrated that DVL proteins promote ligand-independent FZD receptor endocytosis but do not affect Wnt-induced FZD5/8 endocytosis and degradation. Furthermore, we reevaluated the functions of ZNRF3/RNF43 and RSPO1 in regulating Wnt signaling. Our results suggest that RSPO1-ZNRF3/RNF43 specifically regulates FZD5/8 levels in the presence of Wnt ligands. We also showed that Wnt induces the FZD5‒RNF43 interaction at the plasma membrane. Our study reveals a novel mechanism for the regulation of Wnt signaling at the receptor level and provides further insights into the function of RSPO1-ZNRF3/RNF43 in the Wnt signaling pathways.</p>

<title>Wnt induces FZD5/8 endocytosis and degradation</title>
<p>To investigate whether Wnt induces endocytosis and degradation of FZD receptors, HEK293A cells stably expressing each of the ten V5-FZDs (with the V5 tag added to the amino terminus of each FZD after the signal peptide) were treated with control, Wnt3a-conditioned or Wnt5a-conditioned medium (CM), and the FZD levels on the cell surface were examined via flow cytometry with an anti-V5 antibody. Both Wnt3a and Wnt5a dramatically reduced the expression of FZD5 and FZD8 on the cell surface without significantly affecting other FZD receptors (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Immunoblotting revealed that both Wnt3a and Wnt5a reduced the mature protein levels of both FZD5 and FZD8 (the upper bands of FZD5 and FZD8) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Koo et al., 2012</xref>). Treatment with the lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin A1 rescued the mature form of FZD5 that was reduced by Wnt3a and Wnt5a (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting that Wnt induced FZD5 degradation through the lysosomal pathway. We further showed that these phenomena are not specific to 293A cells, as Wnt3a and Wnt5a also induced FZD5/8 endocytosis and degradation in both Huh7 and U2OS cells (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1A-D</xref>). These results suggest that Wnt3a and Wnt5a specifically promote the endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of FZD5/8.</p>

<p>FZD receptors are classified into four clusters, with sequence variations predominantly in the extracellular CRD domain and C-terminal tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Huang and Klein, 2004</xref>). To investigate which domain is required for Wnt-induced FZD5 endocytosis, we generated FZD5 constructs with deletion of the CRD domain (△CRD) or C-terminal tail (△C) and analyzed them via flow cytometry. The results indicated that the CRD domain, but not the C-terminal tail, is crucial for Wnt3a/Wnt5a-induced FZD5 endocytosis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-F</xref>). Additionally, we constructed chimeric FZD proteins with swapped CRD domains, as illustrated in the schematic diagram (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). For example, FZD4CRD-FZD5 consists of the CRD domain of FZD4 and FZD5 lacking the CRD domain. Wnt3a or Wnt5a treatment reduced the cell surface levels of FZD5CRD-FZD4 and FZD5CRD-FZD7 but had little effect on the cell surface levels of FZD4CRD-FZD5 or FZD7CRD-FZD5 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). These results suggest that Wnt-induced FZD5/8-specific endocytosis relies on their CRD domains.</p>
<p>As the commercially available anti-FZD antibodies either cannot detect endogenous proteins or can only recognize the immature form (data not shown), to visualize endogenous FZD5, we generated an FZD5 knock-in HEK293A cell line in which a V5 tag was inserted into the carboxyl terminus of the FZD5 locus before the stop codon via the CRISPR/Cas9 system and homologous recombination. Like V5-FZD5 overexpression, the endogenous FZD5-V5 protein exhibited two major bands on immunoblotting, and both the Wnt3a and Wnt5a treatments reduced the intensity of the upper band representing the mature form of FZD5, which occurred as early as one hour after treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Using the same approach, we generated a FZD7-V5 knock-in cell line and observed that neither Wnt3a nor Wnt5a induced degradation of endogenous FZD7 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Furthermore, treatment with the Porcupine inhibitor IWP-2 increased the level of the endogenous mature FZD5 protein but did not affect FZD7 levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Flow cytometry with anti-FZD5/8 or anti-FZD4 monoclonal antibodies revealed that IWP-2 treatment increased the cell surface levels of FZD5/8 but had little effect on FZD4 levels in HEK293A cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Pan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Sachdev Sidhu, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Steinhart et al., 2017</xref>). IWP-2 treatment also increased the cell surface levels of FZD5/8 in Huh7, MCF7 and 769P cells (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1A-C</xref>). The specificity of the anti-FZD5/8 and anti-FZD4 antibodies was confirmed in HEK293A cells overexpressing all ten FZD receptors (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 2</xref>). These results further indicate that Wnt induces the endocytosis and degradation of endogenous FZD5/8.</p>

<p>(A) Wnt3a or Wnt5a induced the degradation of endogenous FZD5.

<title>Wnt-induced FZD5/8 degradation relies on ZNRF3/RNF43</title>
<p>ZNRF3 and RNF43 are homologous transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligases that have been reported to target FZD receptors for endocytosis and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Farnhammer et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Koo et al., 2012</xref>). We wondered whether Wnt-induced FZD5/8 endocytosis and degradation depend on ZNRF3/RNF43. To address this, we generated a <italic>ZNRF3/RNF43</italic> double-knockout HEK293A cell line (ZRDKO) via the CRISPR/Cas9 technique, which was verified by sequencing (<xref rid="fig2s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-Figure Supplement 3</xref>). Flow cytometry analysis with the anti-FZD5/8 antibody revealed that <italic>ZNRF3/RNF43</italic> double knockout increased FZD5/8 levels on the cell surface (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>), which is consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Koo et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, the membrane levels of FZD4 remained unchanged in ZRDKO cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). We subsequently established an FZD5-V5 knock-in cell line based on ZRDKO. Immunoblotting revealed that neither Wnt3a nor Wnt5a induced the degradation of endogenous mature FZD5 in ZRDKO cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). Additionally, IWP-2 treatment did not further increase mature FZD5 levels in ZRDKO cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>).</p>
<p>RSPO proteins antagonize ZNRF3/RNF43, thereby potentiating Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Xie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Yan et al., 2017</xref>). Given that ZNRF3/RNF43 specifically degrades FZD5/8 in the presence of Wnt, we examined whether RSPO1 treatment could specifically increase FZD5/8 levels. Immunoblotting revealed that RSPO1 significantly increased the level of endogenous mature FZD5 but did not affect the FZD7 level (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>). Moreover, RSPO1 had little effect on FZD5 levels in ZRDKO cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K</xref>). Furthermore, a cell surface biotinylation assay revealed that Wnt3a or Wnt5a induced degradation of cell surface FZD5, which was antagonized by cotreatment with RSPO1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2L</xref>). Flow cytometry analysis of wild-type (WT) HEK293A cells treated with IWP-2 or RSPO1 revealed that both treatments similarly elevated FZD5/8 levels on the cell surface (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2M</xref>). However, RSPO1 treatment did not increase membrane FZD5/8 levels in ZRDKO cells or FZD4 levels in WT cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2N-O</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these results suggest that ZNRF3/RNF43 degrades FZD5/8 under Wnt stimulation, which is antagonized by RSPO.</p>

<title>DVL proteins regulate Wnt-independent FZD endocytosis and are dispensable for Wnt-induced FZD5/8 endocytosis or degradation</title>
<p>DVL proteins have been reported to regulate FZD endocytosis and degradation by binding to ZNRF3/RNF43 and recruiting it to FZD receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Yu et al., 2007</xref>).

<p>To visualize FZD endocytosis dynamics, we performed an antibody-labeled endocytosis assay. WT, DVLTKO and DVLTKO cells re-expressing DVL2 (DVLTKO+DVL2) stably expressing V5-linker-FZD5 were first treated with IWP-2 overnight to inhibit the secretion of endogenous Wnt proteins. The cells were labeled with an anti-V5 antibody and then treated with control, Wnt3a CM or Wnt5a CM for 1 hour (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>), and the internalized antibody was visualized by immunostaining. The linker sequence was used to separate the V5 tag from the FZD5 protein to avoid interference with Wnt5a binding. Compared with WT cells, DVLTKO cells presented fewer FZD5 puncta in the control CM-treated group, and re-expressing DVL2 in DVLTKO cells elevated FZD5 puncta, whereas Wnt3a and Wnt5a increased the number of FZD5 puncta in both WT, DVLTKO and DVLTKO+DVL2 cells, as quantified by the number of FZD5 puncta (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). Compared with WT cells, DVLTKO cells presented decreased FZD7 internalization in control CM, which could also be rescued by re-expressing DVL2, and Wnt3a or Wnt5a CM had no effect on FZD7 endocytosis in WT, DVLTKO or DVLTKO+DVL2 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I-J</xref>). Whole-cell lysates from WT, DVLTKO and DVLTKO+DVL2 cells expressing V5-linker-FZD5 or V5-linker-FZD7 were analyzed by immunoblotting to verify the expression of FZDs and DVL2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>).</p>

<title>ZNRF3/RNF43 promotes the degradation of internalized FZD5 but is dispensable for Wnt-induced FZD5 internalization</title>
<p>We next investigated the role of ZNRF3/RNF43 in the process of Wnt-induced FZD5/8 endocytosis and degradation. We found that Wnt3a or Wnt5a CM treatment reduced the cell surface level of V5-FZD5 in ZRDKO cells, as determined by flow cytometry (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), although they had little effect on the total protein level of FZD5 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), suggesting that Wnt induces FZD5 internalization independent of ZNRF3/RNF43. We further performed an immunostaining assay to visualize the cellular trafficking route of internalized FZD5 after Wnt3a and Wnt5a treatment for various durations. The results revealed that a significant amount of FZD5 was internalized into the intracellular vesicles in both WT and ZRDKO cells after Wnt3a or Wnt5a treatment for one hour, and the FZD5 signals gradually diminished in WT but not ZRDKO cells after Wnt treatment for two and four hours (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-Figure supplement 1A</xref>), indicating that ZNRF3/RNF43 is required for the degradation of internalized FZD5 but not for Wnt-induced FZD5 internalization. Furthermore, cotreatment with RSPO1 prevented FZD5 degradation but had little effect on FZD5 internalization induced by Wnt3a or Wnt5a (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1B</xref>). Under Wnt treatment, internalized FZD5 colocalized with either EEA1, an early endosomal marker, or LAMP1, a lysosomal marker, in WT cells, whereas this colocalization was significantly reduced in ZRDKO cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E-H</xref>). These results suggest that ZNRF3/RNF43 promotes endolysosomal transport and degradation of internalized FZD5, whereas in ZRDKO cells, internalized FZD5 may be recycled back to the plasma membrane for reuse.</p>

<title>Reevaluation of the function of ZNRF3/RNF43 in Wnt signaling</title>
<p>Previous studies have suggested that ZNRF3/RNF43 degrades FZD receptors independently of Wnt ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Farnhammer et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Tsukiyama et al., 2015</xref>). However, our finding that Wnt induces ZNRF3/RNF43-dependent FZD5/8 degradation indicates that the functions of ZNRF3/RNF43 in FZD endocytosis and degradation are modulated by Wnt ligands. These results prompted us to reevaluate the function of ZNRF3/RNF43 in Wnt signaling. Although HEK293A cells stably expressing V5-FZD5 or V5-FZD7 presented significantly higher FZD protein levels on the cell surface than ZRDKO cells did, as measured by flow cytometry with an anti-pan-FZD antibody (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), these cells presented markedly lower cytosolic β-catenin levels than ZRDKO cells did (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). The increase in DVL protein phosphorylation and cytosolic β-catenin observed in <italic>ZNRF3/RNF43</italic> double knockout cells could be reversed by IWP-2 treatment, whereas IWP-2 had a minimal effect on DVL phosphorylation in cells overexpressing V5-FZD5 or V5-FZD7 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). These findings suggest that elevated Wnt signaling in ZRDKO cells cannot be solely attributed to increased FZD protein levels on the cell surface.</p>

However, expressing RNF43 or RNF150 in HEK293A cells stably expressing V5-FZD5 or V5-FZD7 efficiently decreased the levels of the mature forms of FZD5 and FZD7 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). Each of these E3 ligases reduced FZD protein levels on the cell surface of the ZRDKO cells to a comparable degree, as determined by flow cytometry with an anti-pan-FZD antibody (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). Furthermore, each of the four E3 ligases also reduced FZD5/8 levels on the cell surface in ZRDKO cells, with IWP-2 partially restoring the effects of ZNRF3 and RNF43 but not those of RNF130 or RNF150 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>).

To minimize interference from endogenous ZNRF3/RNF43, we employed HEK293A ZRDKO cells stably expressing V5-FZD5-mTB or V5-FZD7-mTB (with miniTurbo biotin ligase fused to the carboxyl terminus of FZD5 or FZD7) alongside RNF43ΔRING-HA (lacking the enzymatic RING domain of RNF43). We confirmed the expression of FZD5/7-mTB and RNF43ΔRING, as well as the biotinylation efficiency, through immunoblotting (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). We subsequently conducted proximity biotin labeling assays with or without Wnt3a, Wnt5a, or IWP-2 treatment. Both Wnt3a and Wnt5a significantly increased the biotinylation of RNF43ΔRING in FZD5-mTB-expressing cells but not in FZD7-mTB-expressing cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). Additionally, IWP-2 treatment reduced the basal biotinylation of RNF43ΔRING in FZD5-mTB-expressing cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). We further replicated the proximity labeling assay in DVLTKO cells, and the results revealed that DVL proteins did not participate in the Wnt3a- or Wnt5a-induced FZD5‒RNF43 interaction (<xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-figure supplement 1A‒B</xref>). These results suggest that Wnt induces DVL-independent interactions between FZD5 and RNF43 at the plasma membrane.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our results demonstrate that Wnt signaling employs a strategy analogous to that of receptor– tyrosine kinase pathways, where ligands bind to and activate receptors while simultaneously inducing receptor endocytosis and degradation to modulate signaling strength and duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alexander, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Sorkin and Waters, 1993</xref>). Our results also illuminate the mechanism by which RSPO-ZNRF3/RNF43 regulates Wnt-induced FZD5/8 endocytosis and degradation and its influence on Wnt signaling. In the presence of ZNRF3/RNF43, Wnt binds to FZD5/8, forming a complex with ZNRF3/RNF43 and facilitating FZD5/8 endocytosis and subsequent lysosomal degradation, and this process occurs independently of DVL proteins. In the absence of ZNRF3/RNF43, Wnt still induces FZD5/8 endocytosis; however, endosomes harboring FZD5/8 fail to merge with lysosomes, leading to the accumulation of mature FZD5/8 within the cell, which may be recycled back to the plasma membrane for reuse to sustain signaling activity (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>).</p>
<p>There are ten FZD proteins in mammals that are classified into five subfamilies on the basis of their sequence similarity. Among them, FZD5/8 was reported to have higher signaling activity and broader Wnt binding and response spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Martin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). A recent study suggested that FZD5 undergoes maturation through specific binding to cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Zheng et al., 2022</xref>). Our current study suggests that Wnt specifically induces FZD5/8 endocytosis and degradation, adding a new feature to the FZD5/8 subfamily. Wnt-induced FZD5/8 endocytosis relies on the CRD domain and is dispensable for the FZD5/8 intracellular carboxyl terminus. It is possible that the Wnt-FZD5/8 complex recruits another unidentified membrane protein that promotes the internalization of the whole complex. Wnt3a and Wnt5a bind to FZD5/8, FZD4, and FZD7 with similar affinities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Li et al., 2023b</xref>) and specifically induce FZD5/8 but not other FZDs endocytosis. Therefore, further characterization and comparison of the structural differences between Wnt-bound CRDs from different FZDs and identification of specific binding proteins of the Wnt-FZD5/8 complex will shed light on the underlying mechanism. Although we showed that Wnt3a, Wnt5a, and endogenously expressed Wnts in 293A cells specifically induce FZD5/8 endocytosis, we cannot exclude the possibility that other Wnts or ligands may induce the endocytosis and degradation of other FZDs in certain biological contexts.</p>
<p>Our results also shed light on the function of DVL proteins in FZD endocytosis. We showed that FZD receptors undergo ligand-independent constant endocytosis that relies on DVL. However, Wnt-induced FZD5/8 endocytosis and degradation occur in the absence of DVL proteins. A previous study reported that DVL proteins interact with ZNRF3/RNF43 and may transport ZNRF3/RNF43 to FZD, thus facilitating FZD endocytosis and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, these results are largely based on flow cytometry assays, which can detect only the internalization but not the degradation of FZDs. Furthermore, they used a ZNRF3/RNF43ΔDIR-DEP fusion protein and showed that expressing this fusion protein efficiently removed FZD proteins from the cell surface. Notably, the DEP domain of DVL also interacts with FZDs, and the ZNRF3/RNF43ΔDIR-DEP fusion protein may function as an anti-FZD “PROTAC” to degrade FZDs. Our results indicated that Wnt-induced FZD5/8 degradation requires ZNRF3/RNF43 but is dispensable for DVL proteins, suggesting that the interaction between DVL and ZNRF3/RNF43 is not required for this process. We cannot exclude the possibility that ZNRF3/RNF43 may regulate ligand-independent FZD endocytosis and degradation under certain circumstances that may rely on the DVL-ZNRF/RNF43 interaction. It is also possible that DVL interacts with ZNRF3/RNF43 to regulate ZNRF3/RNF43 endocytosis. Our results also revealed that overexpressing the membrane RING-type E3 ligases RNF130 and RNF150 reduced membrane FZD levels without affecting cytosolic β-catenin levels, suggesting potential nonspecific effects of ZNRF3/RNF43 in overexpression assays.</p>
<p>Our results suggest that ZNRF3/RNF43 regulates the degradation of internalized FZD5/8 but is not required for Wnt-induced FZD5/8 internalization. Wnt can still induce FZD5 internalization in the absence of ZNRF3/RNF43, and internalized FZD5 accumulates on intracellular vesicles in both ZRDKO cells and WT cells treated with RSPO1. It is well established that internalized membrane proteins are sorted in endosomes either for recycling or for lysosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cullen and Steinberg, 2018</xref>). The ubiquitination of intracellular lysine residues serves as a typical sorting signal that can be recognized by the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) and sorted for lysosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cullen and Steinberg, 2018</xref>). It is conceivable that ZNRF3/RNF43 ubiquitinates FZD5/8 during Wnt-induced FZD5/8 endocytosis and that the internalized ubiquitinated FZD5/8 is then sorted for lysosomal degradation. In the absence of ZNRF3/RNF43 or with RSPO treatment, internalized FZD5/8 is not ubiquitinated and thus is sorted for recycling. However, further investigations are needed to elucidate the detailed mechanism of the intracellular vesicular trafficking of internalized FZDs.</p>
<p>Our results suggest that RSPO-ZNRF3/RNF43 specifically targets Wnt-bound FZD5/8, as <italic>FZD5/8</italic> double knockout largely abolished Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity in ZRDKO cells or WT cells treated with RSPO1. Our results provide an underlying mechanism for a recent study in which the authors reported that FZD5, but not the other FZDs, is crucial for the growth of RNF43-mutated pancreatic tumors and colorectal tumor organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Steinhart et al., 2017</xref>). This mechanism may be crucial for stem cell self-renewal and tissue homeostasis. RSPO proteins, known as stem cell factors, are present in stem cell niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">de Lau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Yan et al., 2017</xref>), while ZNRF3/RNF43 are also expressed in stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Koo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sato et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Yan et al., 2017</xref>). FZD5 is expressed in adult stem cells and is essential for their function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alsaadi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Harada et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Nabhan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Yan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Zheng et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, our study introduces a novel concept in Wnt signaling regulation at the FZD receptor level, clarifies the mechanisms by which RSPO-ZNRF3/RNF43 regulates Wnt signaling, and offers new insights into Wnt signaling-related regenerative medicine and cancer therapy.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The mechanism by which WNT signals are received and transduced into the cell has been the topic of extensive research. Cell surface levels of the WNT receptors of the FZD family are subject to tight control and it's well established that the transmembrane ubiquitin ligases ZNRF3 and RNF43 target FZDs for degradation and that proteins of the R-spondin family block this effect. This manuscript explores the role that WNT proteins play in receptor internalization, recycling and degradation, and the authors provide evidence that WNTs promote interactions of FZD with the ubiquitin ligases. Using cells mutant in all 3 DVL genes, the authors demonstrate that this effect of WNT on FZD is DVL-independent.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, the data are of good quality and support the authors' hypothesis. Strengths of this study is the use of CRISPR-mutated cell lines to establish genetic requirements for the various components. The finding that FZD internalization and degradation is WNT dependent and does not involve DVL is novel.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A weakness of the work includes a heavy reliance on overexpression of FZD proteins. To detect endogenous FZDs, the authors have inserted a V5 tag into the endogenous gene, which may affect their activity(ies).</p>

<p>In this manuscript Luo et al uncover that the ZNRF3/RNF43 E3 ubiquitin ligases participate in the selective endocytosis and degradation of FZD5/8 receptors in response to Wnt stimulation. In my opinion there are three significant findings of this study: 1) Wnt proteins are required for ZNRF3/RNF43 mediated endocytosis and degradation of FZD receptors and this constitutes an important negative regulatory loop. 2) Wnt can induce FZD endocytosis in the absence of ZNRF3/RNF43 but this does not influence total or cell surface levels. 3) The ZNRF3/RNF43 substrate selectivity for FZD5/8 over the other 8 Frizzleds. Of course, many questions remain, and new ones emerge as it is often the case, but these findings challenge our dogmatic view on how the ZNRF3/RNF43 regulate Wnt signaling and emphasize their role in Wnt-dependent Frizzled endocytosis/degradation and beta-catenin signaling.</p>
<p>This is an elegant study employing several CRISPR-edited cell lines to tag endogenous Frizzled receptors and to knockout ZNRF3/RNF43 and all three Dishevelled proteins. One major strength of the study is therefore the careful assessment of the roles of RNF43 and ZNFR3 in endogenous expression contexts. This is especially relevant since overexpression of membrane E3 ligases have been shown to ectopically degrade membrane proteins and could have blurred previous interpretations. A second strength is clarifying the role of Dishevelled proteins in FZD endocytosis. Indeed, although previous studies suggested that the Wnt-promoted interaction between FZD and RNF43/ZNFR3 was mediated through Dvl, the authors clearly show that this is not the case (using Dvl knockout cells and functional assays). Dvl proteins, on the other han,d are still required for ligand-independent FZD-endocytosis.</p>
<p>The only weakness pertains to the difference in signaling outcome, comparing elevated signaling seen when FZD levels are upregulated following ZNFR3/RNF43 KO vs ectopic overexpression. Indeed, the authors suggest that in the absence of RNF43/ZNFR3 the receptors could be recycled back to the PM and thereby contribute to increased signaling seen in the mutant cells. This has not been directly demonstrated.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Because many conclusions are drawn from overexpression studies and from a single cell line (HEK293), it is unclear how general these effects are. In particular, one of the main claims put forth in this manuscript is that of specificity, namely, that FZD5/8, and none of the other FZDs, are uniquely involved in this internalization and degradation. While there are examples of similar specificities, many of these examples can be attributed to a particular cellular context. Without demonstrating that this FZD5/8 specificity is observed in multiple cell lines and contexts, this point remains unconvincing and questionable. One way to address this point of criticism is to omit the word &quot;specifically&quot; in the title and soften the language concerning this idea throughout the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your valuable comments and suggestions. We have removed the word “specifically” from the title and softened the language concerning this idea throughout the manuscript. Moreover, we performed new experiments to show that Wnt3a/5a induces FZD5/8 endocytosis and degradation and that IWP-2 treatment increases the cell surface levels of FZD5/8 in cell lines other than 293A (Figure 1-Figure supplement 1 and Figure 2-Figure supplement 1). These results indicate that Wnt-induced FZD5/8 endocytosis and degradation are not cell specific.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The starting point for these studies is a survey of all 10 FZDs, V5-tagged and overexpressed in HEK293 cells. Here, the authors observed a decline in cell surface levels of only FZD5 and 8 in response to Wnt3a and Wnt5a. As illustrated in the immunoblot (Fig 1B), several FZDs were poorly expressed, including FZD1, 3, 6 and 9, which calls into question that only FZD5 and 8 were affected. Furthermore, total levels of FZD8 don't diminish appreciably, as claimed by the authors, and only FZD5 shows a subtle decline upon WNT treatment. All of these experiments are performed with overexpressed V5-tagged FZD proteins or with endogenously V5-tagged (KI) proteins, and it is possible that overexpression or tagging lead to potentially artifactual observations. Examining the effects of WNTs on FZD protein localization and levels need to be done with endogenously expressed, non-tagged FZDs. In this context, it is somewhat puzzling that the authors don't show such an experiment using the pan- and FZD5/8-specific antibodies, which they use in multiple experiments throughout the manuscript. With these available tools it should be possible to examine FZD levels at the cell surface in response to Wnt3a and Wnt5a, ideally in multiple cell lines.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your valuable comments and suggestions. Figure 1B shows the results of the follow-up study shown in Figure 1A. As shown in Figure 1A, we used flow cytometry analysis to detect the cell surface levels of stably expressed FZDs and found that Wnt3a/5a specifically reduced the levels of FZD5/8 on the cell surface, suggesting that Wnt3a/5a induces FZD5/8 endocytosis. As shown in Figure 1B and C, we performed immunoblotting to examine whether Wnt3a/5a-induced FZD5/8 internalization resulted in FZD5/8 degradation. Notably, most FZDs exhibit two bands on immunoblots, as also suggested by other published studies, and the upper bands represent the mature form that is fully glycosylated and presented to the cell surface (see also new Figure 2L), whereas the lower bands represent the immature form. Our results clearly indicated that Wnt3a/5a treatment reduced the levels of the mature forms of both FZD5 and FZD8, although the immunoblotting signals of the mature form of FZD8 (upper bands) were relatively weak. The immunoblotting signals of the other FZDs varied, and some of them (including FZD1, -3, -6 and -9) were relatively weak; however, according to the results in Figure 1A, all of the FZDs were expressed and present on the cell surface.</p>
<p>Commercially available FZD5/8 antibodies, including those used in published studies, cannot detect endogenous FZD5/8 or can only recognize immature FZD5 in our hands, which is why we have to use the CRISPR-CAS9-based KI technique to introduce a V5 tag to FZD5 and FZD7. Notably, in the overexpression experiments, the V5 tag is on the amino terminus, and in the KI experiments, the V5 tag is on the carboxyl terminus of FZDs, which may minimize the potential artificial effects of the V5 tag on the immunoblotting assays.</p>
<p>The monoclonal antibodies used in this study, such as anti-pan-FZD, anti-FZD5/8, and anti-FZD4 antibodies, are neutralizing antibodies that can compete with Wnt ligands to bind to the FZD CRD. These antibodies have been successfully used to detect the surface levels of FZDs via flow cytometry assays. However, as the binding affinity of the Wnt-FZD CRD is comparable to the binding affinity of the antibody-FZD, we were cautious in using these antibodies to detect the cell surface levels of FZDs when the cells were treated with Wnt3a/5a CM, which contains relatively high concentrations of Wnt3a/5a. As shown in Author response image 1, Wnt3a or Wnt5a treatment dramatically reduced the endogenous cell surface level of FZD5/8, as detected by flow cytometry using the anti-FZD5/8 antibody. However, in another experiment, HEK293A cells were first incubated with cold Wnt3a or Wnt5a CM at 4°C to minimize endocytosis and then analyzed via flow cytometry using the anti-FZD5/8 antibody. The results showed that Wnt3a/5a incubation reduced the floe cytometry signals, suggesting that Wnt3a/5a binding to FZD5/8 might interfere with antibody-FZD5/8 binding, although we cannot exclude the possibility that Wnt3a/5a may induce FZD5/8 endocytosis at 4°C (Author response image 1).</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Several experiments rely on gene-edited clonal cell lines, including knockouts of FZD5/8, RNF43/ZNRF3, and DVL. Gene knockouts were confirmed by genomic DNA sequencing and, for DVL and FZD5/8, by loss of protein expression. While these KO lines are powerful tools to study gene function, there is a concern for clonal variability. Each cell line may have acquired additional changes as a result of gene editing. In addition, there may be compensatory changes in gene expression as a consequence of the loss of certain genes. For example, expression of other FZDs may increase in FZD5/8 DKO cells. To address this critique, the authors should show that re-expression of the knocked-out genes rescues the observed effect. This is done in some instances (Fig 5E, G, H) but not in other instances, such as with the DVL TKO (Fig. 3). Since the authors assert that DVL is important for FZD internalization in the absence of WNT, but not for FZD internalization in the presence of WNT, this particular rescue experiment is important. This is a potentially important finding and it should be confirmed by re-expression of DVL in the TKO line. As an alternative, conditional knockdown using Tet-inducible shRNA expression could address concerns for clonal variability.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your valuable comments and suggestions. We re-expressed DVL2 in DVLTKO cells stably expressing V5-linker-FZD5 or V5-linker-FZD7. As shown in Figure 3G-K, re-expression of DVL2 rescued the decreased Wnt-independent endocytosis of FZD5 and FZD7 caused by DVL1/2/3 knockout.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Given the significant differences in signaling activity by Wnt3a and Wnt5a, it is somewhat surprising that all experiments shown in this manuscript do not identify distinguishing features between Wnt3a and Wnt5a. In addition, it is unclear why the authors switch between Wnt3a and Wnt5a. For example, Figures 1C, 3G-J, 4C-D only use Wnt5a. In contrast, Figures 6E and H use Wnt3a, most likely because b-catenin stabilization is examined, an effect generally not observed with Wnt5a. The choice of which Wnt is examined/used appears to be somewhat arbitrary and the authors never provide any explanations for these choices. In the end, this type of inconsistency becomes puzzling when the authors present, quite convincingly, in Figure 7, that both Wnt3a and 5a promote an interaction between FZD5/8 and RNF43 through proximity biotin labeling.</p>

<p>Although Wnt3a and Wnt5a are significantly different in triggering intracellular signaling pathways, both bind FZD5/8 and induce FZD5/8 endocytosis and degradation similarly. When FZD5 is stably overexpressed, Wnt5a has slightly stronger effects on inducing FZD5 endocytosis and degradation, possibly because the Wnt5a concentration may be higher than the Wnt3a concentration in our CM, which is why we used Wnt5a CM in some experiments when V5-FZD5 was overexpressed. In the revised manuscript, we used both Wnt3a and Wnt5a CM in the experiments as you suggested, as shown in Figure 1C, 3G-K and Figure 4-Figure supplement 1.</p>

<p>Minor Points:</p>
<p>Figure 3G and I: it is curious that individual cells are shown in the &quot;0 h&quot; samples, while the &quot;Con 1 h&quot; and &quot;Wnt5a 1 h&quot; show multiple cells with several making direct contact with each other. This is notable because the V5 staining at sites of cell-cell contact are quite distinct and variable between control and Wnt5a-treated and WT versus DVL TKO cells. Also, sub-cellular localization of FZD5 (V5 tag) puncta is quite distinct between Con and Wnt5a: puncta in Wnt5a-treated cells appear to be more plasma membrane proximal than in Con cells. These points may be easy to address by showing images of cells that are more similar with respect to cell number and density for each condition.</p>

<p>Thank you for your suggestions. We repeated these experiments and added Wnt3a treatment and adjusted the cell density. Images including an individual cell were selected for presentation.</p>

<p>Figure 5E: the following statement is confusing/misleading: &quot;Furthermore, reintroducing ZNRF3 or RNF43 into ZRDKO cells efficiently restored the increase in cytosolic β-catenin levels, whereas the expression of RNF130 or RNF150, two structurally similar transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligases, did not (Fig. 5E).&quot; First, reintroduction of ZNRF3 or RNF43 restores cytosolic b-catenin levels; it does not restore the increase in b-catenin. Second, the claim that RNF130 fails to have this effect is not substantiated since it is barely expressed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestions and comments. We reorganized the language to make the statement clearer. Notably, the expression level of RNF130 was relatively low compared with that of other E3 ligases, but RNF130 was expressed (Figure 5E darker exposure) and could reduce the cell surface levels of FZDs, as shown in Figure 5G.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Given their results the authors conclude that upregulation of Frizzled on the plasma membrane is not sufficient to explain the stabilization of beta-catenin seen in the ZNRF3/RNF43 mutant cells. This interpretation is sound, and they suggest in the discussion that ZNRF3/RNF43-mediated ubiquitination could serve as a sorting signal to sort endocytosed FZD to lysosomes for degradation and that absence or inhibition of this process would promote FZD recycling. This should be relatively easy to test using surface biotinylation experiments and would considerably strengthen the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable suggestions and comments. We performed cell surface biotinylation experiments in HEK293A FZD5KI cells, as shown in Figure 2L. The results indicated that Wnt3a or Wnt5a treatment induced the degradation of FZD5 on the cell surface, which was antagonized by cotreatment with RSPO1. We did not perform a more detailed endocytosis/recycling biotinylation experiment that requires complex reversible biotinylation and multiple washing steps because HEK293A cells are fragile in culture and not easy to handle. Furthermore, the results shown in Figure 4 indicate that knockout of ZNRF3/RNF43 or RSPO1 significantly blocked the degradation of internalized FZD5 and reduced the colocalization of internalized FZD5 with lysosomal markers, suggesting that Wnt3a/5a induced lysosomal degradation of FZD5 in the presence of ZNRF3/RNF43 and that the internalized FZD5 was most likely recycled back to the cell surface when ZNRF3/RNF43 was knocked out or inhibited by RSPO1.</p>

<p>(2) The authors show that the FZD5 CRD domain is required for endocytosis since a mutant FZD5 protein in which the CRD is removed does not undergo endocytosis. This is perhaps not surprising since this is the site of Wnt binding, but the authors show that a chimeric FZD5CRD-FZD4 receptor can confer Wnt-dependent endocytosis to an otherwise endocytosis incompetent FZD4 protein. Since the linker region between the CRD and the first TM differs between FZD5 and FZD4, it would be interesting to understand whether the CRD specifically or the overall arrangement (such as the spacing) is the most important determinant.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our results in Figure 1D-H clearly show that the CRD of FZD5 specifically is both necessary and sufficient for Wnt3a/5a-induced FZD5 endocytosis, as replacing the CRD alone in FZD5 with the CRD from either FZD4 or FZD7 completely abolished Wnt-induced endocytosis, whereas replacing the CRD alone in FZD4 or FZD7 with the FZD5 CRD alone could confer Wnt-induced endocytosis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) I find it surprising that only FZD5 and FZD8 appear to undergo endocytosis or be stabilized at the cell surface upon ZNRF3/RNF43 knockout. Is this consistent with previous literature? Is that a cell-specific feature? These findings should be tested in a different cell line, with possibly different relative levels of ZNRF3 and RNF43 expression.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comments and suggestions. Our finding that ZNRF3/RNF43 specifically regulates FZD5/8 degradation is consistent with recent published studies in which FZD5 is required for the survival of RNF43-mutant PDAC or colorectal cancer cells (Nature Medicine, 2017, PMID: 27869803) and FZD5 is required for the maintenance of intestinal stem cells (Developmental Cell, 2024, PMID: 39579768 and 39579769), and in both cases, FZDs other than FZD5/8 are also expressed but not sufficient to compensate for the function of FZD5. The mechanism by which Wnt3a/5a specifically induces FZD5/8 endocytosis and degradation is currently unknown and needs to be explored in the future. We speculate that Wnt binding to FZD5/8 may recruit another protein on the cell surface to specifically facilitate FZD5/8 endocytosis. On the other hand, we cannot exclude the possibility that Wnts other than Wnt3a/5a may induce the endocytosis and degradation of FZDs other than FZD5/8 since there are 19 Wnts and 10 FZDs in humans. Notably, several previous studies have suggested that ZNRF3/RNF43 may regulate the endocytosis and degradation of all FZDs without selectivity (such as Nature, 2012, PMID: 22575959; Nature, 2012, PMID: 22895187; Mol Cell, 2015, PMID: 25891077). However, their conclusions were drawn mostly on the basis of overexpression studies. According to the results shown in Figure 5E-H, overexpressing a membrane-tethered E3 ligase (such as ZNRF3, RNF43, RNF130, or RNF150) may nonspecifically degrade FZD proteins on the cell surface.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the revised manuscript, we showed that Wnt3a/5a induced FZD5/8 endocytosis and degradation in multiple cell lines, including Huh7, U2OS, MCF7, and 769P cells (Figure 1-Figure supplement 1 and Figure 2-Figure supplement 1), suggesting that these phenomena are not specific to 293A cells.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) If FZD7 is not a substrate of ZNRF3/RNF43 and therefore is not ubiquitinated and degraded, how do the authors reconcile that its overexpression does not lead to elevated cytosolic beta-catenin levels in Figure 5B?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are currently not sure of the mechanism underlying this result. Considering that most FZDs are expressed in 293A cells, we do not know how much of the mature form of overexpressed FZD7 was presented to the plasma membrane.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) For Figure 5B, it would be interesting if the authors could evaluate whether overexpression of FZD5 in the ZNRF3/RNF43 double knockout lines would synergize and lead to further increase in cytosolic beta-catenin levels. As control if the substrate selectivity is clear FZD7 overexpression in that line should not do anything.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. We performed these experiments as suggested, and the results indicated that overexpressing FZD5 further increased cytosolic beta-catenin levels in ZRDKO cells, whereas FZD7 had no effect (Figure 6D).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) In Figure 6G, the authors need to show cytosolic levels of beta-catenin in the absence of Wnt in all cases.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did not add Wnt CM in this experiment. RSPO1 activity, which relies on endogenous Wnt, has been well documented in previous studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Since the authors show that DVL is not involved in the Wnt and ZRNF3-dependent endocytosis they should repeat the proximity biotinylation experiment in figure 7 in the DVL triple KO cells. This is an important experiment since previous studies showed that DVL was required for the ZRNF3/RNF43-mediated ubiqtuonation of FZD.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable suggestions. As you suggested, we performed a proximity biotinylation experiment in DVL TKO cells, and the results showed that Wnt3a/5a could still induce the interaction of FZD5 and RNF43 in DVLTKO cells (Figure 7-figure supplement 1), suggesting that the Wnt-induced FZD5‒RNF43 interaction is DVL independent.</p>
