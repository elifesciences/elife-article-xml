<abstract><p>The major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporters play significant roles in human health and disease. <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium melibiose permease (MelB<sub>St</sub>), which catalyzes the symport of galactosides with Na<sup>+</sup>, H<sup>+</sup>, or Li<sup>+</sup>, is a prototype of this important transporter superfamily. We have published the structures of the inward- and outward-facing conformations of MelB<sub>St</sub> with galactoside or Na<sup>+</sup> bound, determined the binding thermodynamic cycle, and proposed that positive cooperativity between the two co-transported solutes plays a key role in the symport mechanism of MelB<sub>St</sub>. The molecular basis for this core mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we determined the molecular basis for this core symport mechanism through analyzing the structural dynamics of MelB<sub>St</sub> and effects induced by melibiose, Na<sup>+</sup>, or both using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS). We also refined the specific determinants for the sugar recognition in both protein and galactoside molecules by solving the crystal structures of a uniporter D59C MelB<sub>St</sub> bound to melibiose and other sugars, and identified a critical water molecule as part of sugar recognition. Our integrated studies from structure, HDX-MS, and molecular dynamics simulations support the conclusion that sugar-binding affinity is directly correlated with protein dynamics. The binding of the coupling cation at a remote site functions as an allosteric activator to restrain the conformational flexibility of dynamic residues in the sugar-binding site and in the cytoplasmic gating salt-bridge network, thereby increasing sugar-binding affinity allosterically. This study provides a molecular-level schematic of the fundamental symport mechanism via positive cooperativity, which may serve as a general mechanism for cation-coupled symporters.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>1)We conducted four new experiments: the intact cell [3H]raffinose transport assay; the intact cell p-nitrophenol detection to demonstrate α-NPG transport; the ITC binding assay for the D59C mutant; and molecular dynamics simulations to model water in the sugar-binding site and analyze the side chain dynamics in the Na+- and melibiose-binding pockets. The MD simulations were carried out in collaboration with Dr. Ruibin Liang, so we added two other co-authors, Bakhtiiari Amirhossein and Ruibin Liang, to this revised version, and all previous authors in the original submission agreed with this change.
2)We have added a new figure to show the apo state dynamics (the new Fig. 5a,b) and annotated the amino acid residue positions and marked positions in sugar- or Na+-binding pockets.
3)As suggested by reviewer-3, we have moved the individual mapping of ligand effects on HDX data to the main figure, combined with the residual plots, and marked the amino-acid residue positions.
4)We have added more deuterium uptake plots to cover all residues in the sugar- or Na+-binding pockets in the current figure 7 (previously figure 6).
5)We have added a new figure 8 showing the positions at the well-studied cytoplasmic gating salt-bridge network and other loops likely important for conformational changes, along with a membrane topology marked with the HDX data. We have added a new figure 9 from MD simulations.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Solute Carrier (SLC) family of transporters encompasses diverse superfamilies of membrane proteins with various protein folds and employing different transport mechanisms to facilitate the translocation of a wide range of solutes across cell membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). The largest superfamily of SLC transporters is the major facilitator superfamily (MFS)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>), which includes a significant number of cation-coupled secondary active transporters. MFS transporters are responsible for the uptake of a broad spectrum of solutes across cell membranes, playing crucial roles in physiology, pathology, and pharmacokinetics, and are emerging as drug targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Recent rapid advancements in membrane protein research have greatly enhanced our understanding of protein conformation and mechanisms(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>); however, critical details remain lacking. For example, in cation-coupled symport, it is still unclear how the coupling cations facilitate the binding, translocation, and accumulation of the primary substrate.</p>
<p>For MFS secondary active transporters, most members use H<sup>+</sup> as the coupling cation, and a few members use Na<sup>+</sup>, such as the Na<sup>+</sup>-coupled essential lipid transporter (MFSD2A) that is expressed in the major organ barriers, including the blood-brain barrier or blood-retina barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). The Na<sup>+</sup>-coupled melibiose transporter of <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium (MelB<sub>St</sub>), which is a well-characterized representative for the Na<sup>+</sup>-coupled MFS transporters, catalyzes the symport of a galactopyranoside with Na<sup>+</sup>, H<sup>+</sup>, or Li<sup>+</sup>, and is a valuable model system for studying cation-coupled transport mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Two major conformations of MelB<sub>St</sub> have been determined: an outward-facing conformation at the apo or galactoside-bound states(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) and an Na<sup>+</sup>-bound inward-facing conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). The primary substrate-specificity determinant pocket and the cation-specificity determinant pocket have been structurally and functionally characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). All three coupling cations compete for the same binding pocket, and the transport stoichiometry is 1 galactoside: 1 cation (Na<sup>+</sup>, H<sup>+</sup>, or Li<sup>+</sup>). Binding of the primary and coupling substrates is positively cooperative; the sugar affinity depends on the cation identity, with the cooperativity numbers (fold of increase in affinity) being 8, 5, or 2 for Na<sup>+</sup>, Li<sup>+</sup>, and H<sup>+</sup>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). In addition to being sensitive to the binding of the coupling cation and its identity, notably, the sugar-binding affinity is also dependent on MelB<sub>St</sub> conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). By trapping MelB<sub>St</sub> in an inward-facing state using the inward-facing conformation-specific binder nanobody-725 (Nb725), both experimental sugar-binding assays and cryoEM structural analysis support that the sugar-binding pocket at inward-facing conformation is at a low-affinity state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Remarkably, Na<sup>+</sup> binding to the inward-facing conformation remains unchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). These results provide experimental evidence supporting the previously proposed stepped-binding kinetic model for melibiose/Na<sup>+</sup> symport, in which Na<sup>+</sup> binds first and is released after the sugar release on the opposite surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>).</p>
<p>Positive cooperativity of substrate binding has been proposed to be the key symport mechanism in MelB<sub>St</sub>, but the molecular basis for this critical mechanism remains unclear. The structures indicate that the bound sugar and Na<sup>+</sup> have no direct contact, while the two binding pockets are in close proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). The minimum free-energy landscape for sugar translocation, which was simulated based on the structures of the outward- and inward-facing conformations as two starting points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), suggests that the Na<sup>+</sup> contribution to the binding free energy of sugar by direct contact is negligible. Cooperativity occurs through allosteric coupling, likely via electrostatic interactions.</p>
<p>In this study, we further analyzed the sugar-binding site by improving the crystal structure resolution of α-NPG bound at 2.60 Å, which uncovered an important water molecule in the binding site. We also confirmed the sugar specificity determinants in both sugar and MelB<sub>St</sub> by determining the crystal structures in complex with three other α-sugar substrates—melibiose, raffinose, or a-methyl galactoside (α-MG)—that vary in the number of sugar units but all contain an α-galactosyl group. We then examined the structural dynamics of the entire MelB with hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) and the effects of melibiose, Na<sup>+</sup>, or both on MelB<sub>St</sub>. HDX-MS is particularly attractive for dynamic systems, as the provided information yields beyond the stable events within the dynamic repertoire of transporter proteins. By monitoring the HDX rate across a time window, it can provide predictive modeling for overall protein folds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). The resolution of structural information provided by this technique is typically on the peptide level, though. We also performed MD simulations to analyze the side-chain dynamics. Collectively, all results support the notion that the sugar-binding affinity of MelB<sub>St</sub> is coupled to protein structural dynamics and conformational transitions between inward- and outward-facing states, and the coupling cation in this symporter functions as an allosteric activator.</p>

<title>Sugar transport and binding affinity measurements</title>
<p>The sugar analog α-NPG has been determined as a substrate for MelB<sub>Ec</sub> by measuring <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenol production from the cells that expressed both MelB<sub>Ec</sub> and α-galactosidase(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). The same assay was modified to determine the α-NPG translocation mediated by MelB<sub>St</sub> in DW2 cells. Melibiose at 1 mM was added to induce α-galactosidase expression during cell growth, and the washed cells were applied to measure the time-course of <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenol release into the media upon adding 1 mM α-NPG into the induced cells. The detection was for the <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenol, which was resulted from α-NPG transport and hydrolysis. The results showed that both WT MelB<sub>St</sub> and D59C uniport mutant mediated the translocation of α-NPG (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>) at this downhill mode of transport.</p>

ITC measurements were performed at 25 °C under similar buffer conditions: 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.035% UDM detergent. For each experiment, 80 µM of the purified WT MelB<sub>St</sub> or D59C mutant was placed in the reaction cell, and methyl α-D-galactoside (α-MG) or raffinose at 10 mM (against the WT) or 100 mM (against D59C) from the syringe are incrementally titrated to generate the thermograms. The curve fitting is performed with a one-site independent-binding model included in the NanoAnalyze software (version 3.7.5). The thermograms were plotted as baseline-corrected heat rate (µJ/sec; left axis) vs. time (bottom axis) for the titrant to MelB<sub>St</sub> (red for α-MG and blue for raffinose) or to buffer (light blue).

<p>To determine raffinose transport activity, [<sup>3</sup>H]raffinose transport in the <italic>E. coli</italic> DW2 strain was carried out in the absence of Na<sup>+</sup> and Li<sup>+</sup> or the presence of Na<sup>+</sup> or Li<sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). The results showed that raffinose, a trisaccharide formed from melibiose and fructose, is also a substrate and transported by MelB<sub>St</sub>.</p>
<p>Previously, our ITC studies in the presence of Na<sup>+</sup> revealed that the binding affinity, <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values, of the WT and D59C MelB<sub>St</sub> for melibiose were 1.25 mM ± 0.05 mM and 4.96 ± 0.11 mM, respectively, and for α-NPG were 16.46 ± 0.21 µM or 11.97 ± 0.09 µM, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). The same assay was utilized to determine the α-MG and raffinose binding in the presence of Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). By injecting the α-MG or raffinose in a buffer-matched solution into the sample cell containing the WT MelB<sub>St</sub> or the D59C uniporter mutant in the presence of Na<sup>+</sup>, the isotherm curve fitted well, yielding <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values of 0.88 ± 0.04 mM or 3.79 ± 0.53 mM, for α-MG or raffinose, respectively. Raffinose, which has more sugar units, exhibits a poor binding affinity to MelB<sub>St</sub>.</p>

<title>Outward-facing crystal structures of MelB<sub>St</sub> complexed with varied sugar substrates</title>
<p>The uniporter D59C MelB<sub>St</sub> mutant exhibits greater thermostability, making it a valuable tool for structural analysis of sugar binding(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Here we report four crystal structures of D59C MelB<sub>St</sub> with the endogenous sugar substrate melibiose, and two other α-galactosides, α-methyl galactoside (α-MG) with a single sugar unit or raffinose with three sugar units, as well as α-NPG at an improved resolution. The structure statistics were presented in Table S1. All structures adopt a virtually identical outward-facing conformation with RMSD values of less than 0.4 (Fig. S1). This typical MFS-fold transporter with 12 transmembrane helices is organized into two six-helix domains linked by the middle loop between helices VI and VII (Loop<sub>6-7</sub>). There are three cytoplasmic helices at the loop<sub>6-7</sub>, loop<sub>8-9</sub>, and the C-terminal tail or lid (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), named ICH1-3, respectively; and ICH1 and ICH2 run parallel to the membrane bilayer. In all structures, one sugar molecule is bound in the middle of the protein and sandwiched by both N- and C-terminal domains as described previously(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). As indicated by the sliced surface, the binding residues located within the cytoplasmic leaflet of both domains define the edge of the inner barrier, which prevents the sugar from passing across the transporter into the cytoplasm.

A water molecule (Wat 1) was modeled to a positive density, which located at hydrogen-bonding distances from the C4-OH and C6-OH on the galactopyranosyl ring and the Thr373 at helix XI, and also surrounded by Gln372 at helix XI and Asp124 at helix IV, as shown in the stereo-view of a 2Fo-Fc electron density map (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Another three water molecules participated the cytoplasmic gating salt-bridge network between the both bundles (Fig. S2a, b).

Notably, the binding affinity between melibiose and α-NPG differs by a factor of 100; in α-NPG, the hydrophobic phenyl group, positioned at 4 Å distance from the phenyl group of Tyr26, forms a strong stacking interaction. While melibiose has four additional OH groups, the glucosyl ring sits nearly perpendicular to the phenyl ring of Tyr26 (Fig. S3) with no strong polar interaction with the transporter.</p>

Consequently, a set of polar side chains on helix VII (Asn244, Ser247, Asn248, and Asn251), helix VIII (Asn279), and helix V (Ser153) were within 4-5 Å distances to either the glucosyl or fructosyl moieties. Interestingly, the polar interactions from raffinose to MelB<sub>St</sub> are limited to the galactosyl moiety, which are nearly identical to those presented in α-MG, melibiose, or α-NPG, while the Asp19 is at a hydrogen-bonding distance from the OH-4 on the glucosyl moiety.</p>
<p>All four galactosyl moieties align well in the specificity-determinant pocket, regardless of the number of monosaccharide units (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d, e</xref>; Fig. S1), which provided a strong structural support to the previous conclusion that the galactosyl moiety determines the specificity of the primary substrates and the non-galactosyl moiety contributes to the binding affinity.</p>

The shorter peptide 144-150 (helix V) showed protection by melibiose or Na<sup>+</sup> alone, which is statistically significant; however, the magnitude of the change is subtle. In the presence of both, the protection became significant. The Ala152-carrying peptide showed significant protection by melibiose and Na<sup>+</sup>, and peptide 368-273, which covers the sugar-binding residues Gln372 and Thr373 (helix XI), also exhibited significant protection by Na<sup>+</sup> alone or in combination with melibiose. Peptides carrying other sugar-binding residues Asp124, Try128, and Trp342 (helix IV) and Val376/Lys377 (XI) showed poor deuteriation and no significant effects by either melibiose, Na<sup>+,</sup> or both. Overall, the results indicated that the sugar-binding residues in proximity to the cation-binding pocket are rigid with no significant effect by either substrate; in contrary, peptides carrying the sugar-binding residues far from the cation-binding site are dynamic, and their flexibility were significantly inhibited by sugar binding itself, by Na<sup>+</sup> alone, especially by the binding of both, which support that the melibiose affinity is correlated with the conformational flexibility and Na<sup>+</sup> can increase the sugar binding.</p>

<title>The binding recognition and affinity of MelB<sub>St</sub> have been further refined</title>
<p>Dehydration of sugar molecules is expected for binding; however, full or partial dehydration in MelB is unknown. The 2.60 Å resolution α-NPG-bound structure showed a partially dehydrated sugar at the binding site. The bound water connected the OH-4 and OH-6 on the galactopyranosyl ring with Thr373 and Gln372 at helix XI, and it was also surrounded by Asp124 at helix IV. Previous Cys-scanning mutagenesis has shown that the T373C mutant retained most activities. Still, a Cys residue on the Gln372 position significantly decreased the transport initial rate, accumulation, and melibiose fermentation, with little effect on the protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>), which supported the role of Wat-1 in the binding. Notably, the orientation of OH-4 is crucial for distinguishing between galactose and glucose. Previously, the OH-4 has been shown at hydrogen-bonding distances from the carboxyl group of Asp124 and the indole group of Trp128 at Helix IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>), and the identification of Wat-1 in this study added the polar residues Gln372 and Thr373 on helix XI to stabilize the critical OH-4 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Thus, these interactions define the specificity of galactosyl molecules and Wat-1 is likely part of sugar binding. Notably, the OH-4 and OH-6 and Wat 1 are in close proximity to the Na<sup>+</sup>-binding residue Thr121 and the cation-binding important residue Lys377, implying that the Wat-1 is between the two specificity-determining pockets. As shown previously, the OH-3 and OH-2 at the opposite edge of the galactopyranosyl ring form multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions with the charged residues Asp19 and Arg149 at helices I and V, which can be assigned to play a crucial role in stabilizing the recognition of OH-4 and enhancing the binding affinity.</p>

<title>Dynamics of MelB<sub>St</sub> at different regions</title>
<p>HDX-MS is a powerful technique that simultaneously discloses the dynamic information in various areas of a protein. The qualitative method overcomes the drawbacks of most site-specific labeling-based techniques; however, it only provides the conformational dynamic information on the equilibrium of all ensembles. In the current study, we determined the deuterium uptake rates of the full-length MelB<sub>St</sub> in the absence or presence of melibiose and/or Na<sup>+</sup>, identified major dynamic regions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), as well as substrate-induced effects on the substrate-binding sites and structural elements critical for conformational transition, including the cytoplasmic salt-bridge network and the gating areas (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6</xref>-<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>).</p>
    <p>Our studies of HDX compensated with molecular dynamics simulations on side-chain fluctuations showed that the Na<sup>+</sup>-binding pocket and the sugar-binding residues near the Na<sup>+</sup>-binding site at helix IV are conformationally rigid since they exhibited low deuteration level for both unbound and bound states (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5</xref><bold>-</bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>; Tables S3-4), which are consistent to the previous HDX-MS results of conformation transition(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Those rigidities are likely derived from their hosting helices (II and IV). In addition, the Na<sup>+</sup>-binding affinity, different from sugar binding, exhibited little difference between the inward- and outward-facing states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). The conformational freedom of the cation-binding site and most sugar recognition positions was likely restricted in most states to facilitate sugar binding.</p>
<p>The sugar-binding residues, located away from the Na<sup>+</sup>-binding site, are dynamic, exhibiting higher deuterium levels and side-chain fluctuations. Most of those positions are within the six dynamic regions identified from the apo state, including Lys18, Asp19, Ile22, Tyr26, Arg149, Ala152, Gln272, and Thr373 at helices I, V, and XI. Those regions were protected to varying extents by melibiose or Na<sup>+</sup>, and the protection was significantly greater when bound to both substrates (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5</xref>-<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Even their conformational flexibility was restrained by melibiose and Na<sup>+</sup>, but the deuterium uptakes at those regions were still greater than those of peptides covering the cation-binding site (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Notably, substrate-induced protection was also detected in other areas of the hosting helices I and V, as further stressed below.</p>

<sec id="s3a2">
<title>Arg149, a sugar-binding residue in the major dynamic gating area</title>
<p>Abundant peptides covering Arg149 consistently showed protection by melibiose or Na<sup>+</sup>, especially when both were present (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5</xref>-<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Structurally, Arg149 is near to a stretch of charged residues as shown by this peptide 137-DK<sup>137</sup>RER<sup>141</sup>E<sup>142</sup>QLVPFP<bold><underline>R</underline></bold>F-150 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5</xref>-<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), where the Lys138, Arg141, and Glu142 have been determined to play critical roles in the functionally crucial cytoplasmic salt-bridge network (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). The dynamics of Arg149 are likely modulated by this charged network and belongs to a same dynamics group, which provided the structural basis for coupling between the sugar-binding affinity and protein dynamics. At the inward-open structure, this network is deformed, Arg149, as part of this gate, exhibits a large displacement due to an otherwise stereo collision with helix X at the outward-facing state (Fig. S6). The sugar-binding affinity at this inward-facing state was reduced by ∼30-fold due to the broken binding pocket and the displacement of Arg149 and Gln372. Functionally, the single-site R149C mutant inhibited but did not eliminate the melibiose transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), and single-Cys149 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>) also fermented melibiose with intact cells. The neighboring P148L mutant decreased transport <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> with a better <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). All data showed that the dynamics of this charged network and sugar-binding affinity are interconnected.</p>
<p>This cytoplasmic gating salt-bridge network has a rigid center dictated by helix XI and dynamic surroundings from helices V, IX, XI, loops 4-5, 8-9, 6-7, 10-11, and those dynamic positions were significantly inhibited by melibiose, Na<sup>+</sup>, especially the binding of both. Notably, Nb725 binding to the inward-facing conformation also inhibited the dynamics of the similar regions as shown by peptides 137–150, 284–289, and 364–368 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). The similar HDX profiles from all testing conditions suggested the protein motions followed a similar pathway of the conformational transition. Thus, the dynamics of Arg149 are linked to motion and conformational transitions, as well as sugar-binding affinity. Connectively, it is postulated that Na<sup>+</sup> binding between helices II and IV stabilizes the dynamics of the gating salt-bridge network and the flexibility of Arg149 and Asp19, which are located more than 10 Å away, thus switching the primary substrate-binding site to the higher-affinity state allosterically.</p>
<p>The binding of sugar further stabilizes this network and promotes Na<sup>+</sup> binding by preventing Na<sup>+</sup> from leaving the cation-binding pocket, thus increasing Na<sup>+</sup>-binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Therefore, the cooperative binding of sugar and Na<sup>+</sup> is part of the substrate-induced conformational allostery, and all functions together.</p>
<p>There are a few regions with substrate-induced deprotections. Two gating areas were deprotected by melibiose and Na<sup>+</sup>, including the cytoplasmic ICH2 and Loop<sub>1-2</sub>, which suggested the structural arrangements. Notably, ICH2 is linked with Arg295 at one end of the salt-bridge network, and the dynamics of this area could influence the stability of the gating network, which might trigger the separation and conformational transition to the inward-open state. Thus, the increased dynamics of loop<sub>1-2</sub> and Loop<sub>8-9</sub> at both gating areas by melibiose, especially with Na<sup>+</sup>, can be interpreted as the tendency to form a transition-competent conformation with closing at the periplasmic gate and opening at the cytoplasmic gate. A region at loop<sub>6-7</sub> responding to the ligand binding identified by the atomic force microscopy was not observed in this HDX study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>).</p>
<p>The symporter H<sup>+</sup>-coupled lactose permease LacY and xylose permease XylE also show protonation dependence of sugar-binding affinity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>), with separate cation- and sugar-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). Both transporters favored inward-facing conformation and substrate binding induced outward-facing conformation, as indicated by the extensive HDX analysis with XylE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>) and a bunch of biophysical measurements of LacY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). Notably, several dynamic regions in MelB<sub>St</sub> were also identified in XylE; both proteins showed binding-induced structural changes in their loop<sub>1-2</sub> and loop<sub>8-9</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). In MelB<sub>St</sub>, while no quantified information on the ensembles, all experimental results and molecular simulations on the minimum free-energy landscape for sugar translocation suggest that the apo MelB favors the outward-facing conformation, and the outward-facing conformation is further preferred when bound with melibiose and Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>).</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>Our studies on structure, HDX, and MD simulations allow us to conclude that the sugar-binding affinity of MelB<sub>St</sub> is coordinated with protein structural motions and conformational transition between inward- and outward-facing states. Na<sup>+</sup> binding restrains the dynamics of remote sugar-binding residues via stablizing the dynamic cytoplasmic salt-bridge network, thereby increasing sugar-binding affinity allosterically. The conclusion provides insightful knowledge to understand cooperative binding and symport mechanisms.</p>

MelB<sub>St</sub> was prepared at 50.0 μM in a Na<sup>+</sup>-free buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM choline chloride, 10% glycerol, 0.035% UDM in H<sub>2</sub>O), either in the absence of a substrate (apo) or in the presence of 100 mM melibiose, 100 mM NaCl, or both. The hydrogen/deuterium exchange reaction as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>).

<p>At each designated time point, reaction was quenched by adding an equal volume of ice-cold quench buffer (6 M urea, 100 mM citric acid, pH, 2.3 in H<sub>2</sub>O) for 180 seconds at 0 °C and immediately subjected to a lipid filtration module integrated on the LEAP PAL system.

<p>LC/MS bottom-up HDX was performed using a Thermo Scientific™ Ultimate™ 3000 UHPLC system and Thermo Scientific<sup>TM</sup> Orbitrap Eclipse<sup>TM</sup> Tribrid<sup>TM</sup> mass spectrometer. Samples were digested with a Nepenthesin-2 (Affipro, Czech Republic) column at 8 °C and then trapped in a 1.0 mm x 5.0 mm, 5.0 µm trap cartridge for desalting over 180 sec.

<p>After system assembly, energy minimization was carried out with harmonic restraints (1000 kJ/mol/Å²) on protein and lipid’s heavy atoms for 40,000 steps. This was followed by 200 ps of equilibration in the constant NVT ensemble at 300 K and 1 ns of NPT equilibration with gradually decreased force constants in the harmonic restraints. Five independent replicas of production simulations in the constant NPT ensemble were initiated from different snapshots in the NVT trajectory. For each replica, a trajectory was propagated for ∼400 ns at 300 K and 1 atm. The total sampling time for each system was ∼2 μs. The temperature was controlled with a Langevin thermostat(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>) with a friction coefficient of 1 ps<sup>-1</sup> and pressure with a Berendsen barostat(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>) using anisotropic scaling with a relaxation time of 1 ps. Long-range electrostatics were treated with the Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>) (tolerance 5 × 10<sup>-4</sup>), and van der Waals interactions were truncated using a 12 Å cutoff distance. A 2 fs timestep was used throughout all simulations. The SHAKE algorithm(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>) was employed to constrain the lengths of all hydrogen-containing covalent bonds. All MD simulations were performed with the AMBER24 software package.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>)</p>
<p>Water-1 occupancy identified in the α-NPG-bound crystal structure was evaluated by monitoring interactions of water molecules with four coordinating residues. For each frame, a water molecule was defined as located in the sugar-binding pocket if the distances from its oxygen (O) atom to a few neighboring residues and the melibiose molecule satisfied the following rules. First, four pairs of heavy atoms on the melibiose molecule and neighboring residues were defined: O5 on the galactosyl ring and NE2 on Gln372, O5 and OG1 on Thr373, O6 and NE2 on Gln372, as well as O6 and OG1 on Thr373. Second, for each pair of the above-defined heavy atoms, the distance between the water oxygen atom (O) and each of the two heavy atoms in the pair was calculated. Third, out of all four pairs, if at least in one of them both distances were within 4 Å and at least one distance was below 3.5 Å, the water molecule was defined as occupying the sugar-binding site. The water-1 occupancy in the sugar-binding site was then computed as the fraction of frames containing at least one occupying water molecule over the total number of frames in all replicas of the trajectories.</p>
<p>The side-chain heavy-atom root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) of all residues in the sugar- and cation-binding pockets were determined using CPPTRAJ.</p>

<p>While the structure of the melibiose permease in both outward and inward-facing forms has been solved previously, there remains unanswered questions regarding its mechanism. Hariharan et al set out to address this with further crystallographic studies complemented with ITC and hydrogen deuterium exchange (HDX) mass spectrometry.

<p>The results from the crystallography appear sensible, though the resolution of the data is low with only the structure with NPG better than 3Å. Support for the conclusion of the water molecule in the binding site, as interpreted from the density, is given by MD studies.</p>
<p>The HDX also appears to be well done and is explained reasonably well in the revision.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The melibiose permease from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (MelBSt) is a member of the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS). It catalyzes the symport of a galactopyranoside with Na⁺, H⁺, or Li⁺, and serves as a prototype model system for investigating cation-coupled transport mechanisms. In cation-coupled symporters, a coupling cation typically moves down its electrochemical gradient to drive the uphill transport of a primary substrate; however, the precise role and molecular contribution of the cation in substrate binding and translocation remain unclear. In a prior study, the authors showed that the binding affinity for melibiose is increased in the presence of Na+ by about 8-fold, but the molecular basis for the cooperative mechanism remains unclear. The objective of this study was to better understand the allosteric coupling between the Na+ and melibiose binding sites. To verify the sugar-recognition specific determinants, the authors solved the outward-facing crystal structures of a uniport mutant D59C with four sugar ligands containing different numbers of monosaccharide units (α-NPG, melibiose, raffinose, or α-MG). The structure with α-NPG bound has improved resolution (2.7 Å) compared to a previously published structure and to those with other sugars. These structures show that the specificity is clearly directed toward the galactosyl moiety. However, the increased affinity for α-NPG involves its hydrophobic phenyl group, positioned at 4 Å-distance from the phenyl group of Tyr26 forms a strong stacking interaction. Moreover, a water molecule bound to OH-4 in the structure with α-NPG was proposed to contribute to the sugar recognition and appears on the pathway between the two specificity-determining pockets. Next, the authors analyzed by hydrogen-to-deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) the changes in structural dynamics of the transporter induced by melibiose, Na+, or both. The data support the conclusion that the binding of the coupling cation at a remote location stabilizes the sugar-binding residues to switch to a higher-affinity state. Therefore, the coupling cation in this symporter was proposed to be an allosteric activator.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript is generally well written.</p>
<p>(2) This study builds on the authors' accumulated knowledge of the melibiose permease and integrates structural and HDX-MS analyses to better understand the communication between the sodium ion and sugar binding sites. A high sequence coverage was obtained for the HDX-MS data (86-87%), which is high for a membrane protein.</p>
<p>The revised manuscript shows clear improvement, and the authors have addressed my concerns in a satisfactory manner. Of note, I noticed two mistakes that should be corrected:</p>
<p>- page 11. Unless I am mistaken, the sentence &quot;In contrast, Na+ alone or with melibiose primarily caused deprotections&quot; should be corrected with &quot;protections&quot;. The authors may wish to verify this sentence and also the previous one in the main text.</p>
<p>- Figure 8 displays two cytoplasmic gates (one of them should be periplasmic)</p>

<p>This manuscript presents useful insights into the molecular basis underlying the positive cooperativity between the co-transported substrates (galactoside sugar and sodium ion) in the melibiose transporter MelB. Building on years of previous studies, this work improves on the resolution of previously published structures and reports the presence of a water molecule in the sugar binding site that would appear to be key for its recognition, introduces further structures bound to different substrates, and utilizes HDX-MS to further understand the positive cooperativity between sugar and the co-transported sodium cation. Although the experimental work is solid, the presentation of the data lacks clarity, and in particular, the HDX-MS data interpretation requires further explanation in both methodology and discussion, as well as a clearer description of the new insight that is obtained in relation to previous studies. The work will be of interest to biologists and biochemists working on cation-coupled symporters, which mediate the transport of a wide range of solutes across cell membranes.</p>

<p>We express our gratitude to the associate editor, review editor, and reviewers for their favorable evaluation of this manuscript, as well as their constructive comments and encouragement. Their feedback has been integrated to fortify the evidence, refine the data analysis, and elevate the presentation of the results, thereby enhancing the overall quality and clarity of the manuscript.</p>
<p>A brief summary of the modifications in this revision:</p>
<p>(a) We performed four new experiments: 1) intact cell [<sup>3</sup>H]raffinose transport assay; 2) intact cell <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenol detection to demonstrate α-NPG transport; 3) ITC binding assay for the D59C mutant; and 4) molecular dynamics to simulate the water-1 in sugar-binding site and the dynamics of side chains in the Na<sup>+</sup>- and melibiose-binding pockets. All data consistently support the conclusion draw in this article.</p>
<p>(b) We have added a new figure to show the apo state dynamics (the new Fig. 5a,b) and annotated the amino acid residue positions and marked positions in sugar- or Na<sup>+</sup>-binding pockets.</p>
<p>(c) As suggested by reviewer-3, we have moved the individual mapping of ligand effects on HDX data to the main figure, combined with the residual plots, and marked the amino-acid residue positions.</p>
<p>(d) We have added more deuterium uptake plots to cover all residues in the sugar- or Na<sup>+</sup>-binding pockets in the current figure 7 (previously figure 6).</p>
<p>(e) We have added a new figure 8 showing the positions at the well-studied cytoplasmic gating salt-bridge network and other loops likely important for conformational changes, along with a membrane topology marked with the HDX data. We have added a new figure 9 from MD simulations.</p>

<p>We thank you for understanding what we've presented in this manuscript.</p>

<p>(2) The results from the crystallography appear sensible, though the resolution of the data is low, with only the structure with NPG better than 3Å. However, it is a bit difficult to understand what novel information is being brought out here and what is known about the ligands. For instance, are these molecules transported by the protein or do they just bind? They measure the affinity by ITC, but draw very few conclusions about how the affinity correlates with the binding modes. Can the protein transport the trisaccharide raffinose?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The four structures with bound sugars of different sizes were used to identify the binding motif on both the primary substrate (sugar) and the transporter (MelB<sub>St</sub>). Although the resolutions of the structures complexed with melibiose, raffinose, or a-MG are relatively low, the size and shape of the densities at each structure are consistent with the corresponding sugar molecules, which provide valuable data for confirming the pose of the bound sugar proposed previously. In this revision, we further refine the α-NPG-bound structure to 2.60 Å. The identified water-1 in this study further confirms the orientation of C4-OH. Notably, this transporter does not recognize or transport glucosides in which the orientation of the C4-OH at the glucopyranosyl ring is opposite. To verify the water in the sugar-binding site, we initiated a new collaborative study using MD simulations. Results showed that Wat-1 exhibited nearly full occupancy when melibiose was present, regardless of whether Na<sup>+</sup> was bound at the cation-binding site.</p>
<p>As detailed in the Summary, we added two additional sets of transport assays and confirmed that raffinose and α-NPG are transportable substrates of MelB<sub>St</sub>. For α-NPG transport, we measured the end products of the process—enzyme hydrolysis and membrane diffusion of p-nitrophenol released from intracellular α-NPG.</p>
<p>As a bonus, based on the WT-like downhill α-NPG transport activity by the D59C uniporter mutant that failed in active transport against a sugar concentration gradient, we further emphasized that the sugar translocation pathway is isolated from the cation-binding site. The new data strongly support the allosteric effects of cation binding on sugar-binding affinity. Thank you for this helpful suggestion.</p>
<p>A meaningful analysis of ITC data heavily depends on the quality of the data. My laboratory has extensive experience with ITC and has gained rich, insightful mechanistic knowledge of MelB<sub>St</sub>. Because of the low affinity in raffinose and a-MG, unfortunately, no further information can be convincingly obtained. Therefore, we did not dissect the enthalpic and entropic contributions but focused on the Kd value and binding stoichiometry.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The HDX also appears to be well done; however, in the manuscript as written, it is difficult to understand how this relates to the overall mechanism of the protein and the conformational changes that the protein undergoes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are sorry for not presenting our data clearly in the initial submission. In this revised manuscript, we have made numerous improvements, as described in the Summary. These enhancements in the HDX data analysis provided new mechanistic insights into the allosteric effects, leading us to conclude that protein dynamics and conformational transitions are coupled with sugar-binding affinity. Na<sup>+</sup> binding restricts protein conformational flexibility, thereby increasing sugar-binding affinity. The HDX study revealed that the major dynamic region includes a sugar-binding residue, Arg149, which also plays a gating role. Structurally, this dual-function residue undergoes significant displacement during the sugar-affinity-coupled conformational transition, thereby coupling the sugar binding and structural dynamics.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p>
<p>This manuscript from Hariharan, Shi, Viner, and Guan presents x-ray crystallographic structures of membrane protein MelB and HDX-MS analysis of ligand-induced dynamics. This work improves on the resolution of previously published structures, introduces further sugar-bound structures, and utilises HDX to explore in further depth the previously observed positive cooperatively to cotransported cation Na<sup>+</sup>. The work presented here builds on years of previous study and adds substantial new details into how Na<sup>+</sup> binding facilitates melibiose binding and deepens the fundamental understanding of the molecular basis underlying the symport mechanism of cation-coupled transporters. However, the presentation of the data lacks clarity, and in particular, the HDX-MS data interpretation requires further explanation in both methodology and discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this reviewer's time in reading our previous articles related to this manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comments on Crystallography and biochemical work:</p>
<p>(1) It is not clear what Figure 2 is comparing. The text suggests this figure is a comparison of the lower resolution structure to the structure presented in this work; however, the figure legend does not mention which is which, and both images include a modelled water molecule that was not assigned due to poor resolution previously, as stated by the authors, in the previously generated structure. This figure should be more clearly explained.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This figure is a stereo view of a density map created in cross-eye style. In this revision, we changed this figure to Fig. 3 and showed only the density for sugar and water-1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) It is slightly unclear what the ITC measurements add to this current manuscript. The authors comment that raffinose exhibiting poor binding affinity despite having more sugar units is surprising, but it is not surprising to me. No additional interactions can be mapped to these units on their structure, and while it fits into the substrate binding cavity, the extra bulk of additional sugar units is likely to reduce affinity. In fact, from their listed ITC measurements, this appears to be the trend. Additionally, the D59C mutant utilised here in structural determination is deficient in sodium/cation binding. The reported allostery of sodium-sugar binding will likely influence the sugar binding motif as represented by these structures. This is clearly represented by the authors' own ITC work. The ITC included in this work was carried out on the WT protein in the presence of Na<sup>+</sup>. The authors could benefit from clarifying how this work fits with the structural work or carrying out ITC with the D59C mutant, or additionally, in the absence of sodium.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank this reviewer for your helpful suggestions. We have performed the suggested ITC measurements with the D59C mutant. The purpose of the ITC experiments was to demonstrate that MelB<sub>St</sub> can bind raffinose and α-MG to support the crystal structures.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comments on HDX-MS work:</p>
<p>While the use of HDX-MS to deepen the understanding of ligand allostery is an elegant use of the technique, this reviewer advises the authors to refer to the Masson et al. (2019) recommendations for the HDX-MS article (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-019-0459-y">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-019-0459-y</ext-link>) on how to best present this data. For example:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>All authors value this reviewer's comments and suggestions, which have been included in this revision.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) The Methodology includes a lipid removal step. Based on other included methods, I assumed that the HDX-MS was being carried out in detergent-solubilised protein samples. I therefore do not see the need for a lipid removal step that is usually included for bilayer reconstituted samples. I note that this methodology is the same as previously used for MelB. It should be clarified why this step was included, if it was in fact used, aka, further details on the sample preparation should be included.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, a lipid/detergent removal step was included in this study and previous ones, and this information was clearly described in the Methods.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) A summary of HDX conditions and results should be given as recommended, including the mean peptide length and average redundancy per state alongside other included information such as reaction temperature, sequence coverage, etc., as prepared for previous publications from the authors, i.e., Hariharan et al., 2024.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have updated the Table S2 and addressed the reviewer’ request for the details of HDX experiments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Uptake plots per peptide for the HDX-MS data should be included as supporting information outside of the few examples given in Figure 6.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have prepared and presented deuterium uptake time-course plots for any peptides with ΔD &gt; threshold in Fig. S5a-c.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) A reference should be given to the hybrid significance testing method utilised. Additionally, as stated by Hageman and Weis (2019) (doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.9b01325), the use of P &lt; 0.05 greatly increases the likelihood of false positive ΔD identifications. While the authors include multiple levels of significance, what they refer to as high and lower significant results, this reviewer understands that working with dynamic transporters can lead to increased data variation; a statement of why certain statistical criteria were chosen should be included, and possibly accompanied by volcano plots. The legend of Figure 6 should include what P value is meant by * and ** rather than statistically significant and highly statistically significant.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this comment and have cited the suggested article on the hybrid significance method. We fully acknowledge that using a cutoff of P &lt; 0.05 can increase the likelihood of false-positive identifications. By applying multiple levels of statistical testing, we determined that P &lt; 0.05 is an appropriate threshold for this study. The threshold values were presented in the residual plots and explained in the text. For the previous Fig. 6 (renamed Fig. S4b in the current version), we have reported the P value. *, &lt; 0.05; **, &lt; 0.01. (The text for 0.01 was not visible in the previous version. Sorry for the confusion.)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Line 316 states a significant difference in seen in dynamics, how is significance measured here? There is no S.D. given in Table S4. Can the authors further comment on the potential involvement in solvent accessibility and buried helices that might influence the overall dynamics outside of their role in sugar vs sodium binding? An expected low rate of exchange suggests that dynamics are likely influenced by solvent accessibility or peptide hydrophobicity. The increased dynamics at peptides covering the Na binding site on overall more dynamic helices suggests that there is no difference between the dynamics of each site.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The current Table S3 (combined from previous Tables S3 and S4 as suggested) was prepared to provide an overall view of the dynamic regions with SD values provided. For other questions, if we understand correctly, this reviewer asked us to comment on the effects of solvent accessibility or hydrophobic regions on the overall dynamics outside the binding residues of the peptides that cover them. Since HDX rates are influenced by two linked factors: solvent accessibility and hydrogen-bonding interactions that reflect structural dynamics, poor solvent accessibility in buried regions should result in low deuterium uptakes. The peptides in our dataset that include the Na<sup>+</sup>-binding site showed lower HDX, likely due to limited solvent accessibility and lower structural stability. It is unclear what this reviewer meant by &quot;increased dynamics at peptides covering the Na binding site on overall more dynamic helices.&quot; We did not observe increased dynamics in peptides covering the Na<sup>+</sup>-binding site; instead, all Na<sup>+</sup>-binding residues and nearby sugar-binding residues have lower degrees of deuteriation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Previously stated HDX-MS results of MelB (Hariharan et al., 2024) state that the transmembrane helices are less dynamic than polypeptide termini and loops with similar distributions across all transmembrane bundles. The previous data was obtained in the presence of sodium. Does this remove the difference in dynamics in the sugar-binding helices and the cation-binding helices? Including this comparison would support the statement that the sodium-bound MelB is more stable than the Apo state, along with the lack of deprotection observed in the differential analysis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for this suggestion. The previous datasets were collected in the presence of Na<sup>+</sup>. In the current study, we also have two Na<sup>+</sup>-containing datasets. Both showed similar results: the multiple overlapping peptides covering the sugar-binding residues on helices I and V have higher HDX rates than those peptides covering the Na<sup>+</sup>-binding residues, even when Na<sup>+</sup> was present.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Have the authors considered carrying out an HDX-MS comparison between the WT and the D59C mutant? This may provide some further information on the WT structure (particularly a comparison with sugar-bound). This could be tied into a nice discussion of their structural data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this suggestion. Comparing HDX-MS between the WT and the D59C mutant is certainly interesting, especially with the increasing amount of structural, biochemical, and biophysical data now available for this mutant. However, due to limited resources, we might consider it later.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Have the authors considered utilising Li<sup>+</sup> to infer how cation selectivity impacts the allostery? Do they expect similar stabilisation of a higher-affinity sugar binding state with all cations?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have shown that Li<sup>+</sup> also works positively with melibiose. Li<sup>+</sup> binds to MelB<sub>St</sub> with a higher affinity than Na<sup>+</sup> and modifies MelB<sub>St</sub> differently. It is important to study this thoroughly and separately. To answer the second question, H<sup>+</sup> is a weak coupling cation with little effect on melibiose binding. Since its pKa is around 6.5, only a small population of MelB<sub>St</sub> is protonated at pH 7.5. The order of sugar-binding cooperativity is highest with Na<sup>+</sup>, then Li<sup>+</sup>, and finally H<sup>+</sup>.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) MD of MelB suggests all transmembrane helices are reorientated during substrate translocation, yet substrate and cotransporter ligand binding only significantly impacts a small number of helices. Can the authors comment on the ensemble of states expected from each HDX experiment? The data presented here instead shows overall stabilisation of the transporter. This data can be compared to that of HDX on MFS sugar cation symporter XylE, where substrate binding induces a transition to the OF state.

<p>The sugar translocation free-energy landscape simulations showed that both helix bundles move relative to the membrane plane. This analysis aimed to clarify a hypothesis in the field—that the MFS transporter can use an asymmetric mode to perform the conformational transition between inward- and outward-facing states. In the case of MelB<sub>St</sub>, we clearly demonstrated that both domains move and each helix bundle moves as a unit. So only a small number of helices and loops showed labeling changes. Thanks for the suggestion about comparing with XylE. We have included that in the discussion.</p>

<p>(10) Additionally, the recent publication of SMFS data (by the authors: doi:10.1016/j.str.2022.11.011) states the following: &quot;In the presence of either melibiose or a coupling Na<sup>+</sup>-cation, however, MelB increasingly populates the mechanically less stable state which shows a destabilized middle-loop C3.&quot; And &quot;In the presence of both substrate and co-substrate, this mechanically less stable state of MelB is predominant.&quot;.

<p>Thank this reviewer for reading the single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) study on MelB<sub>St</sub>.  The C3 loop mentioned in this SMFS article is partially covered in the dataset Mel or Mel plus Na<sup>+</sup> vs. apo, and there is more coverage in the Na<sup>+</sup> vs. apo dataset. In either condition, no deprotection was detected. The labeling time point might not be long enough to detect it.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The melibiose permease from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (MelB<sub>St</sub>) is a member of the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS). It catalyzes the symport of a galactopyranoside with Na<sup>+</sup>, H<sup>+</sup>, or Li<sup>+</sup>, and serves as a prototype model system for investigating cation-coupled transport mechanisms. In cation-coupled symporters, a coupling cation typically moves down its electrochemical gradient to drive the uphill transport of a primary substrate; however, the precise role and molecular contribution of the cation in substrate binding and translocation remain unclear. In a prior study, the authors showed that the binding affinity for melibiose is increased in the presence of Na<sup>+</sup> by about 8-fold, but the molecular basis for the cooperative mechanism remains unclear. The objective of this study was to better understand the allosteric coupling between the Na<sup>+</sup> and melibiose binding sites. To verify the sugar-recognition specific determinants, the authors solved the outward-facing crystal structures of a uniport mutant D59C with four sugar ligands containing different numbers of monosaccharide units (α-NPG, melibiose, raffinose, or α-MG). The structure with α-NPG bound has improved resolution (2.7 Å) compared to a previously published structure and to those with other sugars. These structures show that the specificity is clearly directed toward the galactosyl moiety. However, the increased affinity for α-NPG involves its hydrophobic phenyl group, positioned at 4 Å-distance from the phenyl group of Tyr26, which forms a strong stacking interaction. Moreover, a water molecule bound to OH-4 in the structure with α-NPG was proposed to contribute to the sugar recognition and appears on the pathway between the two specificity-determining pockets. Next, the authors analyzed by hydrogen-to-deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) the changes in structural dynamics of the transporter induced by melibiose, Na<sup>+</sup>, or both. The data support the conclusion that the binding of the coupling cation at a remote location stabilizes the sugar-binding residues to switch to a higher-affinity state. Therefore, the coupling cation in this symporter was proposed to be an allosteric activator.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript is generally well written.</p>
<p>(2) This study builds on the authors' accumulated knowledge of the melibiose permease and integrates structural and HDX-MS analyses to better understand the communication between the sodium ion and sugar binding sites. A high sequence coverage was obtained for the HDX-MS data (86-87%), which is high for a membrane protein.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank this reviewer for your positive comments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) I am not sure that the resolution of the structure (2.7 Å) is sufficiently high to unambiguously establish the presence of a water molecule bound to OH-4 of the α-NPG sugar. In Figure 2, the density for water 1 is not obvious to me, although it is indeed plausible that water mediates the interaction between OH4/OH6 and the residues Q372 and T373.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A water molecule can be modeled at a resolution ranging from 2.4 to 3.2 Å, and the quality of the model depends on the map quality and water location. In this revision, we refined the resolution to 2.6 Å using the same dataset and also performed all-atom MD simulations. All results support the occupancy of water-1 in the sugar-bound MelB<sub>St</sub>.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Site-directed mutagenesis could help strengthen the conclusions of the authors. Would the mutation(s) of Q372 and/or T373 support the water hypothesis by decreasing the affinity for sugars? Mutations of Thr121, Arg 295, combined with functional and/or HDX-MS analyses, may also help support some of the claims of the authors regarding the allosteric communication between the two substrate-binding sites.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The authors thank this reviewer for the thoughtful suggestions. MelB<sub>St</sub> has been subjected to Cys-scanning mutagenesis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2021.101090">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2021.101090</ext-link>). Placing a Cys residue at Gln372 significantly decreased the transport initial rate, accumulation, and melibiose fermentation, with minimal effect on protein expression, as shown in Figure 2 of this JBC article, which could support its role in the binding pocket. The T373C mutant retained most of the WT's activities. Our previous studies showed that Thr121 is only responsible for Na<sup>+</sup> binding in MelB<sub>St</sub>, and mutations decreased protein stability; now, HDX reveals that this is the rigid position. Additionally, our previous studies indicated that Arg295 is another conformationally important residue. In this version, we have added more HDX analysis to explore the relationship between the two substrate-binding sites with conformational dynamics, especially focusing on the gating salt-bridge network including Arg295, which has provided meaningful new insights.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The main conclusion of the authors is that the binding of the coupling cation stabilizes those dynamic sidechains in the sugar-binding pocket, leading to a high-affinity state. This is visible when comparing panels c and a from Figure S5. However, there is both increased protection (blue, near the sugar) and decreased protection in other areas (red). The latter was less commented, could the increased flexibility in these red regions facilitate the transition between inward- and outward-facing conformations? The HDX changes induced by the different ligands were compared to the apo form (see Figure S5). It might be worth it for data presentation to also analyze the deuterium uptake difference by comparing the conditions sodium ion+melibiose vs melibiose alone. It would make the effect of Na<sup>+</sup> on the structural dynamics of the melibiose-bound transporter more visible. Similarly, the deuterium uptake difference between sodium ion+melibiose vs sodium ion alone could be analyzed too, in order to plot the effect of melibiose on the Na<sup>+</sup>-bound transporter.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for this important question. We have added more discussion of the deprotected data and prepared a new Fig. 8b to highlight the melibiose-binding-induced flexibility in several loops, especially the gating area on both sides of the membrane. We also proposed that these changes might facilitate the formation of the transition-competent state. The overall effects induced by substrate binding are relatively small, and the datasets for apo and Na were collected separately, so comparing melibiose&amp;Na<sup>+</sup> versus Na<sup>+</sup> might not be as precise. In fact, the Na<sup>+</sup> effects on the sugar-binding site can be clearly seen in the deuterium uptake plots shown in Figures 7-8, by comparing the first and last panels.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) For non-specialists, it would be beneficial to better introduce and explain the choice of using D59C for the structural analyses.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Asp59 is the only site that responds to the binding of all coupling cations: Na<sup>+</sup>, Li<sup>+</sup>, or H<sup>+</sup>. Notably, this thermostable mutant D59C selectively abolishes all cation binding and associated cotransport activities, but it maintains intact sugar binding and exhibits conformational transition as the WT, as demonstrated by electroneutral transport reactions including α-NPG transport showed in this articles, and melibiose exchange and fermentation showed previously. Therefore, the structural data derived from this mutant are significant and offer important mechanistic insights into sugar transport, which supports the conclusion that the Na<sup>+</sup> functions as allosteric activator.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) In Figure 5a, deuterium changes are plotted as a function of peptide ID number. It is hardly informative without making it clearer which regions it corresponds to. Only one peptide is indicated (213-226). I would recommend indicating more of them in areas where deuterium changes are substantial.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this comment and have modified the plots by marking the residue position as well as labeled several peptides of significant HDX in the Fig 5b. We also provided a deuteriation map based on peptide coverage (Fig. 5a).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) From prior work of the authors, melibiose binding also substantially increases the affinity of the sodium ion. Can the authors interpret this observation based on the HDX data?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an intriguing mechanistic question. In this HDX study, we found that the cation-binding pocket and nearby sugar-binding residues are conformationally rigid, while some sugar-binding residues farther from the cation-binding pocket are flexible. We concluded that conformational dynamics regulate sugar-binding affinity, but the increase in Na-binding affinity caused by melibiose is not related to protein dynamics. Our previous interpretation based on structural data remains our preferred explanation; therefore, the bound melibiose physically prevents the release of Na<sup>+</sup> or Li<sup>+</sup> from the cation-binding pocket. We also proposed the mechanism of intracellular NA<sup>+</sup> release in the 2024 JBC paper (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2024.107427">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2024.107427</ext-link>); after sugar release, the rotamer change of Asp55 will help NA<sup>+</sup> exit the cation pocket into the empty sugar pocket, and the negative membrane potential inside the cell will further facilitate movement from MelB<sub>St</sub> to the cytosol.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewing Editor Comments:</bold></p>
<p>(1) It would help the reader if the previous work were introduced more clearly, and if the results of the experiments reported in this manuscript were put into the context of the previous work. Lines 283-296 discuss observations that are similar to previous reported structures as well as novel interpretations. It would help the reader to be clearer about what the new observations are.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the important comment. We have revised accordingly by adding related citations and words “as showed previously” when we stated our previous observations.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The affinity by ITC is measured for various ligands, but very few conclusions are drawn about how the affinity correlates with the binding modes. Are the other ligands that are investigated in this study transported by the protein, or do they just bind? Can the protein transport the trisaccharide raffinose? The authors comment that raffinose exhibiting poor binding affinity despite having more sugar units is surprising, but this is not surprising to me. No additional interactions can be mapped to these units on their structure, and while it fits into the substrate binding cavity, the extra bulk of additional sugar units is likely to reduce affinity. In fact, from their listed ITC measurements, this appears to be the trend.</p>
<p>Additionally, the D59C mutant utilized here in structural determination is deficient in sodium/cation binding. The reported allostery of sodium-sugar binding will likely influence the sugar binding motif as represented by these structures. This is clearly represented by the authors' own ITC work. The ITC included in this work was carried out on the WT protein in the presence of Na<sup>+</sup>. The authors could benefit from clarifying how this work fits with the structural work or carrying out ITC with the D59C mutant, or additionally, in the absence of sodium. For non-specialists, please better introduce and explain the choice of using D59C for the structural analyses.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the meaningful comments. We have comprehensively addressed all the concerns and suggestions as listed in the summary of this revision. Notably, the D59C mutant does not catalyze any electrogenic melibiose transport involved in a cation transduction but catalyze downhill transport location of the galactosides, as shown by the downhill α-NPG transport assay in Fig. 1a. The intact downhill transport results from D59C mutant further supports the allosteric coupling between the cation- and sugar-binding sites.</p>
<p>The binding isotherm and poor affinity of the ITC measurements do not support to further analyze the binding mode since none showed sigmoidal curve, so the enthalpy change cannot be accurately determined. But authors thank this comment.</p>

<p>(3) It is not clear what Figure 2 is comparing. The text suggests this figure is a comparison of the lower resolution structure to the structure presented in this work; however, the figure legend does not mention which is which, and both images include a modelled water molecule that was not assigned due to poor resolution previously, as stated by the authors, in the previously generated structure.

<p>(6) Methodology includes a lipid removal step. Based on other included methods, I assumed that the HDX-MS was being carried out in detergent-solubilized protein samples. I therefore do not see the need for a lipid removal step that is usually included for bilayer reconstituted samples. I note that this methodology is the same as previously used for MelB. It should be clarified why this step was included, if it was in fact used, aka, further details on the sample preparation should be included.</p>
<p>(7) A summary of HDX conditions and results should be given as recommended, including the mean peptide length and average redundancy per state alongside other included information such as reaction temperature, sequence coverage, etc., as prepared for previous publications from the authors, i.e., Hariharan et al., 2024.</p>

While the authors include multiple levels of significance, what they refer to as high and lower significant results, and this reviewer understands that working with dynamic transporters can lead to increased data variation, a statement of why certain statistical criteria were chosen should be included, and possibly accompanied by volcano plots.

<p>(12) The presentation of data in S5 could be clarified. Does the number of results given in the brackets indicate overlapping peptides? What are the lengths of each of these peptides? Classical HDX data presentation utilizes blue for protection and red for deprotection. The use of yellow ribbons to show protection in non-sugar binding residues takes some interpretation and could be clarified by also depicting in a different blue. I also don't see the need to include ribbon and cartoon representation when also using colors to depict protection and deprotection. The authors should change or clarify this choice.</p>

<p>We have moved this figure into the current Fig. 6b as suggested by Reviewer-3. To address your questions listed in the figure legend, the number of results shown in brackets indeed indicates overlapping peptides. What are the lengths of each of these peptides? The sequences of each peptide are shown in Figures 7-8 and are also included in Supplemental Figure S5.

<p>(15) Previously stated HDX-MS results of MelB (Hariharan et al., 2024) state that the transmembrane helices are less dynamic than polypeptide termini and loops with similar distributions across all transmembrane bundles.
