<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Protein synthesis during vertebrate embryogenesis is driven by ribosomes of two distinct origins: maternal ribosomes synthesized during oogenesis and stored in the egg, and somatic ribosomes, produced by the developing embryo after zygotic genome activation (ZGA). In zebrafish, these two ribosome types are expressed from different genomic loci and also differ in their ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequence. To characterize this dual ribosome system further, we examined the expression patterns of maternal and somatic rRNAs during embryogenesis and in adult tissues. We found that maternal rRNAs are not only expressed during oogenesis but are continuously produced in the zebrafish germline. Proteomic analyses of maternal and somatic ribosomes unveiled differences in core ribosomal protein composition. Most nucleotide differences between maternal and somatic rRNAs are located in the flexible, structurally not resolved expansion segments. Our in vivo data demonstrated that both maternal and somatic ribosomes can be translationally active in the embryo. Using transgenically tagged maternal or somatic ribosome subunits, we experimentally confirm the presence of hybrid 80S ribosomes composed of 40S and 60S subunits from both origins and demonstrate the preferential in vivo association of maternal ribosomes with germline-specific transcripts. Our study identifies a distinct type of ribosomes in the zebrafish germline and thus presents a foundation for future explorations into possible regulatory mechanisms and functional roles of heterogeneous ribosomes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ribosomes are macromolecular complexes composed of ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and proteins that are responsible for protein synthesis in the cell. Ribosomes of two different origins are present during embryogenesis. Large numbers of maternal ribosomes are synthesized during oogenesis and stored in the egg. Upon fertilization, maternal ribosomes are solely responsible for all translational activity during early embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bazzini et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hensey and Gautier 1997</xref>). Maternal ribosomes are progressively degraded during embryogenesis and replaced by newly synthesized ribosomes (i.e., somatic ribosomes) that are produced after zygotic genome activation (ZGA) in the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Heyn et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Schramm and Bavister 1999</xref>). In addition to their roles in translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bazzini et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cenik et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hensey and Gautier 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Noack Watt et al. 2016</xref>), maternal ribosomes have been proposed to act as a source of pyrimidines required for the synthesis of new ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Liu et al. 2018b</xref>).</p>
<p>In the absence of transcription, the synthesis of new proteins in the early vertebrate embryo needs to be regulated at the post-transcriptional level. Several mechanisms have been described to regulate translation during early embryogenesis, including mRNA localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kloc and Etkin 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lorenzo-Orts et al. 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Maegawa et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Medioni et al. 2012</xref>), binding of proteins or miRNAs to mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Giraldez et al. 2006</xref>), and regulation of polyA tail length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Eichhorn et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lim et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Liu et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Subtelny et al. 2014</xref>). While much effort has been devoted to understanding maternal mRNA regulation in the past, we have recently discovered that maternal ribosomes associate with a specific set of factors that bind to key sites on the ribosome and contribute to its repression and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Leesch and Lorenzo-Orts et al. 2023</xref>). Thus, control of maternal ribosome function also plays an important role in translational regulation during embryogenesis.</p>
<p>Ribosomes have traditionally been considered homogeneous macromolecular complexes with no regulatory role in translation. However, several more recent studies proposed that ribosomes are heterogeneous in their composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ferretti et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Komili et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mageeney and Ware 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">OâLeary et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Shi et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Simsek et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Xue et al. 2015</xref>). Ribosome compositional heterogeneity is thought to be caused by variations in ribosome accessory factors, ribosome proteins, and ribosomal RNA, as well as by modifications of nucleotides and amino acids comprising the ribosome. For instance, distinct rRNAs have been reported in <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> ribosomes isolated from different life cycle stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gunderson et al. 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Waters et al. 1997</xref>), and in ribosomes from <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Peterson et al. 1980</xref>). Moreover, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, ribosomes isolated from the germline and soma showed a different protein composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hopes et al. 2022</xref>). Although heterogeneous ribosomes exist in various developmental and cellular contexts, the functional implications of ribosome heterogeneity remain controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Barna et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Ferretti and Karbstein 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>In zebrafish, maternal and somatic ribosomes differ in their composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Locati et al. 2017a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">2017b</xref>), which allows studying these specific ribosome types in an experimentally well-established vertebrate model organism. Maternal ribosomes differ in all four rRNA sequences (28S, 18S, 5.8S, and 5S) and originate from a different ribosomal DNA (rDNA) locus compared to somatic ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Locati et al. 2017a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">2017b</xref>). Maternal rRNAs are transcribed during oogenesis from a single rDNA cluster located on chromosome 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Locati et al. 2017b</xref>), which is methylated and thus transcriptionally silenced in the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ortega-Recalde et al. 2019</xref>). Maternal rRNAs differ from somatic rRNAs in up to 14% of their sequence. However, the consequences of these differences on ribosome functions are not yet known. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether maternal and somatic ribosomes differ in protein composition and are able to form hybrid subunits, which would suggest functional compatibility among their subunits.</p>
<p>Here we analyze the expression, protein composition, and compatibility of maternal and somatic ribosomal subunits in zebrafish. Our results show that despite the differences in rRNA sequences, maternal and somatic ribosomes are found in polysomes indicating their translational activity and can form hybrid ribosomes containing subunits of both origins. Further, we identify germ cells as a cell type that continues to express maternal-type ribosomes throughout development, suggesting a potential functional importance in germ cell-specific translation.</p>

<title>Expression of rRNA variants across development and cell types in zebrafish</title>
<p>To investigate the expression of maternal and somatic rRNA variants during zebrafish development, we analyzed total RNA during the first five days of embryogenesis. Consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Locati et al. 2017a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">2017b</xref>), we observed that maternal rRNAs originating from the maternal rDNA locus on chromosome 4 (GRCz11; 4: 77,564,140 â 77,555,053) were the sole rRNA variants present in the egg and during early stages of embryogenesis before zygotic genome activation (ZGA). Following ZGA, somatic rRNAs started to be transcribed from the somatic rDNA locus on chromosomeâ 5 (GRCz11; 5: 827,807 â 819,029). The levels of somatic rRNAs increased progressively and reached the same level as maternal rRNAs between 20 to 30 hours post-fertilization (hpf). By 5 days post-fertilization (dpf), more than 98% of the detected rRNAs were of somatic origin, reflecting the transition from maternal to somatic ribosomes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>).</p>

<p>Although most ribosomes are of somatic origin by day 5 of development, maternal rRNA variants may be expressed in specific cell types or tissues beyond oocytes. To investigate this, we employed a PCR-based assay that could discriminate between maternal and somatic rRNA variants based on the amplification of highly variable Expansion Segments (ESs) in 18S and 28S RNAs (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. S1A</xref>). To confirm the applicability of the PCR-based assay, we recapitulated the transition from maternal to somatic 18S rRNA (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. S1B</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1C</xref>). While in most adult tissues a single DNA band corresponding to somatic 18S and 28S rRNAs was detected, testis samples showed evidence for the presence of both somatic and maternal rRNAs (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) experiments using total RNA from testes dissected from five different adult male zebrafish revealed variable levels of maternal and somatic rRNAs, with maternal rRNA variants accounting for 2% to 27% of the total rRNAs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Together, these results suggest that both maternal and somatic ribosomes are present in the male germline.</p>
<p>To gain deeper insights into the expression of maternal rRNAs in the germline, we re-analyzed total RNA sequencing data from whole embryos and larvae, as well as published total RNA sequencing data from FACS-sorted primordial germ cells (PGCs) during larval development up to 10 dpf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Redl et al. 2021</xref>). PGCs, which are the precursors of the adult germline, showed persistently high levels of maternal rRNAs compared to somatic larval tissues throughout 10 dpf (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences are removed from the nascent 47S rRNA and act as a marker for ribosome biogenesis. Consistent with a potential role for maternal ribosomes in the germline, expression analysis of maternal ITS1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), indicated active transcription of maternal rRNAs in PGCs, but not in the soma, starting from 3 dpf (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>); long before the production of early-stage oocytes between 10-25 dpf in juveniles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dranow et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Takahashi 1977</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite our evidence for persistent expression of the rDNA locus on chromosome 4 in the zebrafish germline, for simplicity and consistency with previous publications, we will continue to refer to the rRNAs, the subunits they compose, and the ribosomes generated from this locus as âmaternalâ throughout this manuscript.</p>
<p>Recent interrogation of human cancer biopsies in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Liu et al. 2018a</xref>) has similarly shown differential expression of rRNA variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Rothschild et al. 2023</xref>). To test whether zebrafish maternal-type rRNAs might also be re-expressed in immortalized cells or during tumorigenesis, we analyzed cDNAs from several cultured zebrafish cell lines and excised adult tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Berghmans et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Driever and Rangini 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Heilmann et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Patton et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Paw and Zon 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Perez et al. 2018</xref>). 18S rRNA compositional analysis in the assayed <italic>ex vivo</italic> or neoplastic contexts showed no evidence of reactivated maternal rRNA (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. S4A</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4B</xref>). Similarly testing regenerating fin blastema through 5 days post amputation indicates dedifferentiated cells losing morphology and re-entering the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Pfefferli and JaÅºwiÅska, 2015</xref>) do not express maternal rRNA (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. S4C</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Maternal and somatic ribosomes differ in protein composition</title>
<p>Maternal and somatic ribosomes have so far only been shown to differ in their rRNAs. To investigate potential differences in protein composition, we performed proteomic analyses of ribosomes isolated at different times during embryogenesis and compared the expression of core ribosomal proteins (RPs) (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). We chose time points containing either only maternal ribosomes (egg, 1 hpf, 3 hpf and 6 hpf) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Leesch and Lorenzo-Orts et al., 2023</xref>) or only somatic ribosomes (120 hpf) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). We detected 8 RPs with more than one paralog associated to maternal or somatic ribosomes during embryogenesis, namely Rps8 (eS8), Rps17 (eS17), Rps26 (eS26), Rps27 (eS27), Rplp2 (P2), Rpl5 (uL18), Rpl7 (uL30) and Rpl22 (eL22) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Moreover, alternative isoforms were evident for Rps5 (uS7), Rps18 (uS13), Rps19 (eS19) and Rpl9 (uL6) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p>

<p>To gain further insights into the expression patterns of these alternative RPs, we analyzed previously published RNA-seq datasets covering different stages of oogenesis, embryogenesis, and adult tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cabrera-Quio et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Noda et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Pauli et al. 2014</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>). While only one protein variant was predominantly present (more than 10-fold difference in expression level) for all RPs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), mRNAs encoding for Rps17, Rps27.1/Rps27.2, Rplp2/Rplp2l and Rpl5a/Rpl5b were expressed at more similar levels during development and in adult tissues (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>). In some cases, one RP paralog was associated with purified ribosomes at all stages while the other was ribosome-bound only at specific times. Examples include Rpl5b and Rpl22, which were associated with ribosomes throughout embryogenesis, whereas their paralogs Rpl5a and Rpl22l1, respectively, only showed increased ribosome incorporation at 5 dpf, correlating with the expression of somatic rRNA variants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). This proteomic analysis of maternal and somatic ribosomes during embryogenesis provided evidence for RP composition differences in assembled ribosomes at different times of development, but did not reveal a single RP paralog pair that mirrored the switch between maternal and somatic rRNAs.</p>

<p>As previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Locati et al. 2017a</xref>) the majority of sequence differences between maternal and somatic rRNAs are located in expansion segments (ESs), which are flexible RNA elements on the surface of the ribosome and thus often not resolved by structural methods (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>, Movies 1-3). In fact, only 27% of the nucleotides that differ between maternal and somatic rRNAs were visible in our maternal ribosome structure. In several instances, complementary nucleotide differences were predicted to be present in Watson-Crick base-pairs (e.g. H17, H44, ES27; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), thus likely preserving rRNA interactions and secondary structure (<xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S2</xref>).</p>
<p>Functionally important nucleotides tend to be conserved throughout evolution. We therefore also analyzed whether the differences between maternal and somatic rRNAs corresponded to evolutionarily conserved or more variable nucleotides. We found that nucleotides that differed between zebrafish maternal and somatic rRNAs were depleted from conserved regions (characterized by low Shannon entropies; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Schmitt and Herzel 1997</xref>) and instead enriched in areas with high degrees of variability at the single nucleotide level across evolution (high Shannon entropies) (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. S6B</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6C</xref>). Together, our analyses reveal that the majority of nucleotide differences between maternal and somatic ribosomes are located in evolutionary less conserved regions outside of the structurally well-resolved areas of the ribosome.</p>

<title>Formation of hybrid ribosomes comprising maternal and somatic subunits</title>
<p>To investigate whether maternal and somatic ribosomal subunits may interact and form 80S âhybridâ ribosomes, we focused our structural analyses on rRNA sequence differences and alternative ribosomal proteins in the contact regions between 40S and 60S subunits, termed intersubunit bridges (see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). 40S and 60S subunits interact through 17 bridges (B1a-eB14) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Anger et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ben-Shem et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Melnikov et al. 2012</xref>). Most of these bridges are formed by RNA-RNA or RNA-protein contacts, with the exception of B1b/c, which is formed by the contact of two ribosomal proteins, Rps18 (uS13) and Rpl11 (uL5). Five bridges are specific for eukaryotic ribosomes (eB8, eB11, eB12, eB13, and eB14). On the RNA level, there are sequence differences between maternal and somatic rRNAs in intersubunit bridges B3-B6, eB13, and in expansion segments ES31L, ES41L, and ES6S (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), which form bridges eB8, eB11, eB12 and eB14, respectively (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In addition to rRNA sequence differences, one ribosomal protein, Rps8 (eS8), known to form an intersubunit bridge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Tamm et al. 2019</xref>) has a paralogous RP and both are expressed in early zebrafish embryogenesis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). However, in our data, Rps8a was more abundant at the protein and mRNA level in both maternal and somatic ribosomes, suggesting no difference in RP paralog usage at the intersubunit bridge between maternal and somatic ribosomes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>).</p>

<p>To confirm that PGCs maintain a higher ratio of maternal versus somatic ribosomes at 1 dpf (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), we used RT-qPCR to assess the ratio of maternal and somatic rRNA variants in FACS-isolated eGFP-positive PGCs and non-eGFP expressing somatic cells. As expected, a higher abundance of maternal 18S and 28S rRNA variants were detected in the isolated PGCs compared to somatic cells, confirming the persistence of maternal ribosomes at higher levels in germline cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>).

However, this apparent level of enrichment was similar to the level of maternal ribosomes in isolated PGCs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>), providing no evidence towards selectivity of maternal ribosomes for germ cell-specific transcripts.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Previous studies have revealed that zebrafish ribosomes of maternal and somatic origin are composed of two distinct sets of rRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Locati et al. 2017a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">2017b</xref>). While one set of rRNAs was thought to be exclusively present in maternal ribosomes, our PCR-based and RNA-seq analyses indicate that these rRNAs are not only transcribed during oogenesis, but are also present in PGCs and the male germ line. Translation in PGCs is tightly regulated and differs from that in the soma, as these cells are specified before the onset of zygotic genome activation (ZGA) and contain specific maternal mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dranow et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Johnson et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Yu et al. 2016</xref>). Through at least 10 dpf, both inherited and zygotically generated maternal ribosomes constitute the major ribosome type in PGCs. Therefore, maternal ribosomes may comprise a distinct set of ribosomes that drive translation in the germline - a finding that may have broad implications for understanding germline determination and development in zebrafish.</p>
<p>Heterogeneous rRNA sequences have been described in various organisms, including fungi, invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dimarco et al. 2012</xref>), <italic>Xenopus</italic>, and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Pasolini et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Vierna et al. 2013</xref>). However, whether ribosome heterogeneity translates into specialized ribosomal functions is still a matter of scientific debate. Apart from <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gunderson et al. 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Li et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Waters et al. 1997</xref>) and the 5S rRNA in <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Peterson et al. 1980</xref>), zebrafish embryos are the only known system that contains two distinct ribosomes composed of different sets of rRNAs. Differential expression of rRNA variants between tissues may indicate the ability of rRNA variant ribosomes to have distinct functions. Therefore, zebrafish embryogenesis, especially germline versus soma studies, provides a powerful system to study ribosome-mRNA interactions in the context of the functional consequences of ribosome heterogeneity. However, the cell-to-cell variability in their abundance requires future techniques to address these questions at the single cell level.</p>
<p>Importantly, we observed that at 1 dpf, when maternal and somatic ribosomes are present at similar levels, both types of ribosomes associate with polysomes and are thus likely involved in translation. Consistent with the role of maternal ribosomes in supporting early development, translation by maternally deposited ribosomes is essential and increases during embryogenesis before the onset of ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bazzini et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hensey and Gautier 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Leesch and Lorenzo-Orts et al. 2023</xref>). Notably, in nematode worms lacking zygotic production of ribosomes (Cenik et al., 2016) and in zebrafish mutants with impaired ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bielczyk-MaczyÅska et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Noack Watt et al. 2016</xref>), maternal ribosomes have been shown to be sufficient to sustain embryonic development.</p>
<p>If both maternal and somatic ribosomes are capable of translation, an obvious question is why a dual ribosomal system has evolved in zebrafish. One hypothesis is that maternal ribosomes may favor the translation of certain transcripts. Fully addressing this question would require swapping the maternal and somatic rRNA locus, a challenging experiment in zebrafish. Given that the major sequence differences between maternal and somatic rRNAs are in expansion segments, transcript specificity (if any) may be caused by solvent-exposed surfaces of maternal and somatic ribosomes. Our finding that 80S âhybridâ monosomes composed of 40S and 60S subunits of different origins are readily formed during zebrafish embryogenesis argues against maternal and somatic ribosomes acting as distinct entities.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, though many sequence differences exist between the two, compensatory mutations of Watson-Crick base-pairs may preserve rRNA secondary structure in maternal and somatic ribosomes. For instance, both strands of helix 12 (H12) of the 28S rRNA differ in maternal and somatic ribosomes, with the somatic variant containing a U (U68) and the maternal sequence containing a C (C68). In the opposite strand, the maternal variant encodes a compensatory G73, whereas the somatic variant contains A73, thereby maintaining the Watson-Crick interaction (U-A in the somatic rRNA, C-G in the maternal rRNA). The sarcin-rich domain (SRD, or sarcin-rich loop, SRL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Anger et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Khatter et al. 2015</xref>) is a functionally important site of the ribosome, and contains two nucleotide differences (U<sub>som</sub>3716/C<sub>mat</sub>3864 and A<sub>som</sub>3738/G<sub>mat</sub>3886) located at the helix that forms the base of the SRL stem-loop. It is unclear if this represents a molecular difference among either ribosomesâ capacity to anchor elongation factors during tRNA translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Shi et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Szewczak et al. 1993</xref>). Other functionally important regions like the GTPase association center (GAC), which acts as a binding platform for elongation factors and ribosome rescue factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Uchiumi and Kominami 1994</xref>), were not resolved in our maternal ribosome cryo-EM map in the region containing three nucleotide differences between maternal and somatic 28S RNAs (A<sub>som</sub>1558/C<sub>mat</sub>1573, U<sub>som</sub>1560/C<sub>mat</sub>1575 and U<sub>som</sub>1565/C<sub>mat</sub>1580). Therefore, future studies will be required to directly compare the structures of maternal and somatic ribosomes, though our work already reveals that the vast majority of nucleotide differences is located at the surface on the ribosome and thus unlikely to alter for example ribosomal catalysis.</p>
<p>An alternative and non-exclusive hypothesis is that the maternal rDNA locus may be involved in PGC fate and sex determination in zebrafish. Laboratory strains of zebrafish lack sex chromosomes and, unlike mammals, rely on the transfer of specific maternal factors for germ cell development. Several reports suggest a role for the maternal rDNA locus in sex determination, with specific changes (such as demethylation and amplification on extrachromosomal circles) occurring during oocyte expansion and being associated with feminization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Breit et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dranow et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ortega-Recalde et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Tao et al. 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Another possibility is that the distinct set of rRNAs affects ribosome stability, as it has been suggested that maternal ribosomes are degraded more rapidly than their somatic counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Locati et al. 2017b</xref>). A recent study proposed that ribosome ubiquitination plays a role in targeting and degrading maternal ribosomes during zebrafish embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Ugajin et al., 2023</xref>). Additionally, one of the expansion segments, ES4L, is located on the ribosome surface and is formed by the 3â end of the 5.8S rRNA and the 5â end of the 28S rRNA. This 3â half of the 5.8S rRNA has previously been suggested to play a role in ribosome degradation (Locati et al., 2018), and therefore this region could potentially serve as a target for degradation of maternal ribosomes.</p>
<p>Taken together, our study describes a distinct set of ribosomes present in the zebrafish germline. The presence of two distinct ribosomes during zebrafish embryogenesis provides an experimentally accessible system for future studies of ribosome specialization and defines a potentially novel mechanism of translational regulation in the zebrafish germline.</p>

<p>Zebrafish AB9 fibroblasts, originally derived from an adult caudal fin (ATCC CRL-2298), were cultured on cell culture-treated 10 cm plates (Genesee Scientific, 25-500), collected using trypsin (Gibco, 25200072) and standard cell culture procedures. AB9 cells were grown at 28 Â°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in Dulbeccoâs Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Genesee Scientific, 25â500) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gemini Bio-products) and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (Gibco, 10378â016).</p>
<p>Zebrafish ZMEL melanoma cells, originally derived from Tp53<sup>M214K/M214K</sup> tumors expressing human oncogenic BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> were cultured and collected using the same protocols as AB9 cells. ZMEL cells were a kind gift from the laboratory of Dr. Leonard Zon (Boston Childrenâs Hospital).</p>
<p>Zebrafish ZF4 fibroblasts, originally derived from a 1 dpf embryo (ATCC CRL-2050), were cultured on cell culture-treated 10 cm plates (Genesee Scientific, 25-400), collected using trypsin (Gibco, 25200072) and standard cell culture procedures. ZF4 cells were grown at 28 Â°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbeccoâs Modified Eagle Medium and Hamâs F-12 media (DMEM/F12, Genesee Scientific, 25-503) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gemini Bio-products) and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (Gibco, 10378â016).</p>
<p>For all cell lines, cells from a 50-75% confluent 10 cm plate were collected and either flash frozen or directly lysed in TRIzol.</p>
<p>Zebrafish tumors used in this study were derived from the genotypes Tg(mitfa: GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup>); Tp53<sup>M214K/M214K</sup> (referred to as GNAQ melanoma), Tg(BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>); Tp53<sup>M214K/M214K</sup> (referred to as BRAF melanoma), and Tp53<sup>M214K/M214K</sup> (referred to as MPNST, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor) and excised using standard protocols approved by the Committee on Animal Care at MIT.</p>
<p>Adult zebrafish were monitored and euthanized before tumors (3-4 mm in diameter) were excised with a sterile scalpel and placed into a 35 mm dish. Tumors were incubated with 2 mL of Dissection Media [Dulbeccoâs Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Genesee Scientific, 25â500), 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (Gibco, 10378â016), and 75 Î¼g/mL of Liberase (Roche, 5401020001)], manually disaggregated with a sterile razor blade, and let sit at room temperature until a cellular slurry formed. Tumors were further broken down by trituration with an additional 5 mL of Wash Solution [1x PBS (Genesee Scientific, 25â 508), 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (Gibco, 10378â016), and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gemini Bio-products)]. Cells were passed through a 40 Î¼m strainer (Falcon, 352340), pelleted for 2 min at 500 xg, washed twice with 1x PBS, pelleted, and lysed in TRIzol.</p>

<title>Generation of transgenic fish lines</title>
<p>Plasmid construction was based on the Tol2/Gateway zebrafish kit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kwan et al. 2007</xref>). The p5e-ubi entry clone was a generous gift from the laboratory of Dr. Leonard Zon (Boston Childrenâs Hospital). The p5e-sycp plasmid was cloned by amplifying the sycp promoter from genomic DNA before using Gateway BP Clonase II to insert the gel-selected product into pDONRP4-P1R (#219) using previously described primers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gautier et al. 2013</xref>). The pMe-3xFLAG-eGFP-Rpl10a plasmid was cloned by stitching together PCR products containing 3xFLAG, eGFP, and Rpl10a coding sequence (amplified from 1 dpf cDNA) via Gibson Assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gibson et al. 2009</xref>), then amplified using gateway primers before using Gateway BP Clonase II (ThermoFisher Scientific, 11789020) to clone the insert product. The pMe-3xFLAG-eGFP-Rpl10a-430-3âUTR plasmid was similarly cloned. The p3e-polyA entry clone (#302) and pDestTol2 (#393) were used from the Tol2Kit in conjunction with the above plasmids and LR Clonase II (ThermoFisher Scientific, 11791020) to generate ubi:eGFP-3xFLAG-Rpl10a:polyA and sycp:eGFP-3xFLAG-Rpl10a-430-3âUTR:polyA and are referred to as Tg(Som-RiboFLAG) and Tg(Mat-RiboFLAG) respectively.</p>
<p>To generate mosaic transgenic fish lines, a 1 nL mixture of plasmid DNA (40 ng/Î¼L) and capped-mRNA encoding Tol2 Transposase (20 ng/Î¼L) was loaded into needles pulled from glass capillary tubing (Warner, 64â0766) and injected into one-cell-stage embryos using a pico-liter injector (Warner Instruments, PLI90A). Mosaic founders were crossed with wild-type animals to generate a stable line.</p>
<p>F3 and F4 embryos were used for imaging and experiments. Brightfield images and eGFP images were acquired on a Leica M205 FCA fluorescence stereo microscope. Images were taken with the same settings for all embryos.</p>

<title>FACS isolation of primordial germ cells (PGCs)</title>
<p>One-cell-stage zebrafish embryos were injected with 1-2 nL of capped <italic>eGFP-nanos3âUTR</italic> mRNA using a pico-liter injector (Warner Instruments, PLI90A) and needles pulled from glass capillary tubing (Warner, 64â0766). At 24 hpf, embryos were sorted for eGFP expression, dechorionated using 1 mg/mL pronase (Pronase from <italic>Streptomyces griseus</italic>, Cat# 000000010165921001, Sigma-Aldrich), and washed with 1x PBS (Genesee Scientific, 25â508).</p>
<p>80 eGFP-positive embryos were incubated in a 5 mL solution of TrypLE Express (ThermoFisher Scientific, 12605036) and 0.003% Tricaine (ethyl-3-aminobenzoate-methanesulfonate) for 60 min at 31 Â°C in a Thermomixer (Eppendorf, Thermomixer R) set to 100 rpm, followed by trituration using a glass Pasteur pipette until tissues were digested into single cells. Cells were passed through a 40 Î¼m strainer (Falcon, 352340), pelleted for 5 min at 500 xg at room temperature, and washed with 1x PBS. Cell pellets were resuspended in 1x PBS supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gemini Bio-products). Using a BD FACSAria cell sorter, approximately 1,200 eGFP-expressing cells (primordial germ cells) and 1,200 non-eGFP-expressing cells (somatic cells) were sorted directly into TRIzol.</p>

<title>Additions to polysome gradient protocols</title>
<p>To obtain a better resolution of the low molecular weight fractions, 24 hour post-fertilization embryos were batch deyolked according to the previously published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Link et al. 2006</xref>). While 200 to 250 embryos were used per sample for non-deyolked samples, 500 embryos were used per gradient for deyolked embryos. The deyolking buffer was supplemented with 1x protease inhibitors (EDTA-free, Roche) and 0.1 Î¼g/mL cycloheximide. To avoid DNA contamination in the higher molecular weight factions, obtained larval lysates were treated with 1:125 Turbo DNase (QIAGEN, 79254) according to the manufactures protocol and incubated for 10 min at 28 Â°C.</p>
<p>To isolate RNA after fractionation, 400 Î¼L from each collected fraction were transferred into a Safe-lock Eppendorf tube, 1000 Î¼L TRIzol (ThermoFisher Scientific, 15596-018) reagent were added and samples were vortexed for 10 s immediately.

<title>Western blotting of polysome fractions</title>
<p>400 Î¼L of each fraction was first mixed with 700 Î¼L water to dilute sucrose. Sodium deoxycholate and TCA were added to a final concentration of 0.08% and 20% respectively. Samples were vortexed and incubated overnight at â20 Â°C and centrifuged at 20,000 xg at 4 Â°C for 30 min. Protein pellets were washed twice with 2 volumes of cold (â20 Â°C) 100% acetone, then pelleted again. After acetone was removed, protein pellets were air dried, resuspended in 100 Î¼L Laemmli buffer, sonicated for 5 min (30 s on, 30s off), and boiled for 5 min, before running a portion on a 4-20% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen, XV04205). Transfer to a PVDF membrane previously activated with methanol, was run in cold Tris-glycine transfer buffer (1x Tris-glycine, 20% methanol) at 80 V for 80 min. After transfer, membranes were blocked in 5% milk in PBST (1x PBS with 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h and blotted with primary antibodies (1: 2000 anti-FLAG, Millipore Sigma, F3165, and 1:500 anti-Rpl7, ThermoFisher Scientific, A300-741A) overnight at 4 Â°C. Membranes were washed with PBST and blotted with secondary antibodies (1:10,000 anti-mouse, Invitrogen, 32230, or 1:10,000 anti-rabbit, Invitrogen, 32260) for 1 h at room temperature. All blots were sequentially probed SuperSignal West Femto (ThermoFisher Scientific, 34096) was used to develop the blot and a Bioanalytical Imaging System model c500 (Azure Biosciences) was used for imaging.</p>

For certain PCRs, due to the high G/C content of rRNAs and therefore of the corresponding cDNA, standard PCR conditions were adapted to these more complex templates. RNA and cDNA were isolated as described above. The PCR reaction differed from the manufacturerâs protocol in the addition of 1.3x Q5Â® Hot Start High-Fidelity (from a 2x MasterMix, New England Biolabs M0494) and additionally 1 M betaine (Sigma-Aldrich, B0300).

Three biological replicates, each from independent natural crosses, were measured in triplicate. No reverse-transcriptase samples were included as negative controls. Background amplification was determined using IPs from wild-type (uninjected) lysate. qPCR results with cycle numbers higher than the âbackground controlâ were determined as ânon-specific amplificationâ and thus set to zero. Relative fold differences of specific targets were calculated using the 2ÎCt method.

<p>Shah and colleagues take advantage of the presence of maternal and somatic ribosomes in zebrafish and confirm their differential expression during development. The authors <bold>convincingly</bold> show that ribosomes previously found expressed during oogenesis are also expressed in primordial germ cells and that hybrid maternal and somatic ribosomes are formed during development. The question of ribosome heterogeneity, the expression and function of maternal versus somatically provided ribosomes are of broad interest and this <bold>fundamental</bold> work sets new directions for future functional studies of this interesting phenomenon.</p>

<p>In all animals, the fertilized egg is transcriptionally silent, and thus early embryonic development relies on maternally deposited factors. A key mode of regulation is translational control to produce the proteins needed by the developing embryo. In zebrafish as well as other animals, distinct ribosomes, those coming from the maternal pool (maternal ribosomes produced in the germ line/oocytes), and those produced from new transcription after genome activation (somatic ribosomes). In zebrafish, the maternal pool consists of a &quot;maternal&quot; rRNA produced from rDNA on chromosome 4, that has previously been shown to be amplified or expressed specifically in the germ line and in oocytes. The observed sex-specific expression of m-rDNA has led to models that it is involved in sex differentiation and/or maternal control of early embryonic development, both as mediators of translation and as a source of raw materials needed to produce new ribosomes. The work to date in the field indicates that maternal and somatic ribosomes are distinct in their expression profiles but whether they have unique, or gene-specific activities awaits determining if somatic rDNA can functionally replace m-rDNA.</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors investigated the expression profiles, protein composition, and ability of maternal and somatic ribosome components to interact with one another and their association with polysomes. This study reports sequence differences between maternal and somatic ribosomal components as well as proteomics and structural analysis of ribosome composition in oocytes and early development. This analysis shows that ribosome subunit composition changes over developmental time but did not uncover evidence suggesting maternal or somatic ribosome-specific ribosomal protein paralog use. The key findings of this work are:</p>
<p>
(1) Observation of hybrid ribosomes composed of subunits of maternal and somatic origin in the embryo.</p>
<p>
(2) Detection of both maternal and somatic ribosomes in polysomes, indicating maternal and somatic ribosomes both support translation in the embryos and may not be functionally unique.</p>
<p>
(3) Persistent expression of m-rRNA in germ cells, suggesting m-ribosomes, as the main ribosome type present, are important for translation in germ cells. The question of ribosome heterogeneity and the function of maternal versus somatic rDNA and ribosomes is of great interest to the broader scientific community. Overall, the manuscript is clearly written and the solid data provided support the main ideas and conclusions.</p>
<p>Specific points are detailed below.</p>
<p>(1) In Figure 1D the m-rRNA abundance goes down at 3dpf, then up again while the s-rRNA steadily increases and peaks at 3dpf then drops thereafter. As presented in the graph it is unclear if this up-then-down trend is consistently observed or not. There are bars on the graph for m-rRNA but not for s-rRNA, thus it is unclear how many times this experiment was performed for the s-rRNA or how variable the results were from sample to sample. Beyond this technical point, if the pattern is consistent, this is an interesting observation as it would signal either a shift in rDNA transcription to silence the somatic locus and/or post-transcriptional targeted degradation of the somatic rRNA in germ cells.</p>
<p>(2) Although qualified by the authors to some extent, the conclusion regarding maternal ribosomes and specificity related to the translation of germ line-specific transcripts is potentially confusing or misleading. Since the maternal form appears to be the only or predominant form of ribosomes in the germ cells at this stage, these would be the only ribosomes available for translation in germ cells. So, any RNA being translated in the germ cells, even RNAs that are not specifically expressed in the germline would be &quot;enriched in association with&quot; and translated by the maternal ribosomes in germ cells. Additional supporting evidence would be required to support the conclusion that the maternal ribosomes are specifically dedicated to the translation of germ cell-specific RNAs, like nanos3, rather than just general translation in germ cells. Consistent with a more general role for the maternal ribosomes in translation in germ cells, differential codon use has been previously documented for the RNAs produced in oocytes (aka maternal RNAs) (for example Bazzini et al EMBO 2016; Mishima and Tomari Mol Cell 2016), and tRNA genes were recently reported by Wilson and Postlethwait to reside along with the maternal 5S genes and maternal-specific spliceosome components in the region of chromosome 4 that is differentially activated in oocytes and testis (region 2 coding genes are silenced in the ovary but maternal ribosome-related genes are expressed in the ovary; region 4 contains the maternal 45S gene). Further, some of the authors of this manuscript undergo a shift in tRNA repertoire and a change in iso-decoder expression at the onset of gastrulation (Rappol et al, Nucleic Acids Research 2024). Technical limitations pose challenges to definitively testing the hypothesis, but it would be helpful to place the findings here in the context of the published work.</p>
<p>(3) &quot;An alternate and non-exclusive hypothesis is that the maternal rDNA locus may be involved in PGC fate and sex determination in zebrafish.&quot; It would be helpful to further discuss the published evidence supporting this hypothesis. In accord with a potential role for m-rDNA in ovary differentiation, differential methylation of m-rDNA has been previously reported, with high methylation in testis and low methylation in ovaries. Further, several groups have shown that treating fish with broad inhibitors of methyltransferases causes testis-biased differentiation of the gonad. Finally, Moser et al (Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B 2024) recently published work in which CRISPR-Cas9 was used to target the 45S m-rDNA promoter and interfere with its expression. The mutants with these promoter mutations developed as fertile males, consistent with a role for m-rDNA in ovary differentiation. A recent paper from Moser et. al. (Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B 2024) showing that disrupting the m-rDNA locus leads to male-only development should be discussed. This paper does not exclude the possibility of a maternal role for the ribosomes since only one female was recovered among the 45S-m-rDNA mutants. The expression data in Figure 1D of this manuscript showing that m-rRNA levels go down and then up in PGCs indicates the PGCs are making their own m-rRNA. This observation together with the recovery of fertile males reported in the Moser et al study (Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B 2024) doesn't seem to support a requirement for m-rDNA in PGC fate or germ cell-specific translation, at least in testis, since the mutant males produce sperm and are fertile.</p>
<p>(4) Although the rationale for examining rRNAs in adult tumors, cultured zebrafish cell lines, and during fin regeneration is clear based on the published literature showing elevated embryonic rRNAs, this line of investigation doesn't add much to this study and is a bit of a distraction. That said, the observation that in contrast to published work, neither the maternal (early embryo) nor the specific rRNAs examined are unregulated in these contexts is important and warrants communication with the research community.</p>
<p>(5) The numbers of embryos and stages are not consistently stated in the manuscript. For example, in the &quot;Isolation of zebrafish ribosome.&quot; and &quot;isolation of monosomes&quot; sections of the methods, the stage and number of embryos used for the IPs are not clearly stated in the methods. These important details should be stated throughout the manuscript so that others can perform future studies in a manner that will facilitate comparisons.</p>
<p>(6) The terminology used for the RiboFLAG experiments is potentially confusing or misleading. Specifically, different terms are used to describe the source of the ribosomes (Figure 5, Figure S7, Figure S8 and in the text). For example, &quot;transmission&quot; is used to describe &quot;maternal transmission&quot; for Mat-RiboFLAG, and &quot;paternal transmission&quot; is used for Som-RiboFLAG, and in Figure 5 and Figure S8 &quot;maternally provided&quot; and &quot;paternally provided&quot; are used. However, these terms may be confusing or unintentionally misleading because transmission and provided refer to two different things. In the case of Mat-RiboFLAG, the terms refer to the maternal Rpl10-FLAG ribosomes, which the progeny receive from their mother independent of whether or not they express the transgene. On the other hand, for Som-RiboFLAG, the terms refer to the transgene rather than the Rpl10-FLAG ribosomes that will be produced by the embryo using the transgene they inherited from their father. Consider instead sticking to &quot;maternal&quot; and &quot;somatic&quot;, or alternatively &quot;zygotic expression&quot; and &quot;maternal expression&quot; or &quot;zygotic ribosomes&quot; and &quot;maternal ribosomes&quot;.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study expands previous knowledge on the dual ribosome system in zebrafish by demonstrating the expression of maternal ribosomes in the primordial germ cells as well as the formation of hybrid ribosomes combining subunits of maternal and somatic ribosomes. Although the distinction between the two types is clear at the rRNA level, this is not paralleled at the protein level. An attempt to associate the expression of germ-line-specific transcripts to maternal ribosomes remains inconclusive. Thus, evidence for the functional specialisation of ribosomes in this system is still lacking.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The experiments are well-conducted and the main conclusions are well-supported.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The attempt to take advantage of the system to provide an example of functional ribosome specialisation is justified and the expression of maternal-type ribosomes in the germ line may still be key to understanding the expression of classes of mRNA. However, an alternative possibility related to genome evolution and sex determination is equally relevant.</p>
<p>Assessment following the structure of the manuscript:</p>
<p>Shah et al.: &quot;A dual ribosomal system in zebrafish soma and germline&quot;</p>
<p>The zebrafish dual ribosome system is attractive because it offers a favourable setting to look for ribosome specialization and my impression is that this is exactly what the authors set out to do rather than to try to understand why zebrafish have this unusual setup. If this is correct, the title and the abstract should better reflect the authors' aim and main results. The title suggests to the non-specialist that the dual ribosome system is a novel find which obviously is not the case.</p>
<p>I was a bit confused when reading the introduction. In the first paragraph, it was unclear to me if the degradation of maternal ribosomes is an active process different from normal turnover. I also found the third paragraph slightly out of tune with the discussion section. The dual ribosome setting at the level of ribosomal RNA genes represents an extreme case of sequence heterogeneity and appears to be sporadic in nature in that it only is reported from Plasmodium and zebrafish. The Xenopus example is 5S rRNA (as also mentioned in the discussion section), and the Drosophila example is protein composition, only. If a broader view of ribosome types is intended, there will be more examples, e.g. Trypanosomes that express different stage-dependent ribosomes at the level of rRNA modifications. The occurrence of dual ribosomes in fish should be placed in context with insight from other fish genomes, e.g. Medaka, which has only one type of ribosomes. Also, the duality in zebrafish is not restricted to ribosomes, but also comprises two types of spliceosomes. These observations suggest that the phenomenon should be investigated in the context of genome evolution. This is appropriately brought up in the discussion section, but I believe it would serve the reading of the manuscript if this was made clear from the beginning. With respect to the structural aspects, I am puzzled why one of the few other papers studying this system, Ramachandran et al. RNA 2020 (PMID: 32912962) is not referenced. This paper is focused on ribose methylation of the two types of ribosomal RNA and should be relevant to several aspects of the present study.</p>
<p>The manuscript reports three novel and important findings. First, the maternal-type ribosomes are expressed in PGCs, where they furthermore are shown to translate germ line-specific transcripts, and in the male germ line. Regardless, the authors wisely decide to maintain the classical terminology of maternal and somatic ribosomes. Second, both types of ribosomes are polysome-associated and thus translationally active at 24 hpf when they are found in equal amounts. An elaborate experiment shows that hybrid ribosomes are formed at this stage. Finally, a RIP experiment fails to show selectivity in ribosomal recruitment of a germ line-specific mRNA based on the nanos3 3Â´-UTR. There are several other results, but these are mainly confirmatory or negative, albeit of good quality and important to communicate.</p>
<p>The part of the study that describes differences in protein composition is a bit difficult to follow, partly because of the complexity of the results, and partly because of the disappointment that no parallel changes in proteins to the clear differences in rRNA were observed. Except for the discussion of eS8 in relation to subunit bridging, it is purely descriptive. There is quite a literature on paralog expression (e.g. in yeast and humans) and perhaps it would be possible to relate to the literature in a way that could provide more meaning to the observations. From the M&amp;M section, it appears that the proteomics data were already published in the Leesch and Lorenzo-Orts et al. paper (Nature 2023). They are here found in Table S1 which is presented in a minimal fashion, from which it is time-consuming to extract meaningful information, e.g. on how stringently the ribosomes were prepared.</p>
<p>The hybrid-ribosome observation is convincing, but additional information on the choice of cycloheximide concentration would be helpful to rule out other interpretations.</p>
<p>The experiment on translation of primordial germ cell-specific transcripts by maternal ribosomes is a key experiment. Unfortunately, the experiment failed to show selectivity compared to somatic ribosomes, and in my reading, the promise in the abstract of &quot;preferential association&quot; is not quite justified. More importantly, this experiment is not exhaustive, and a more elaborate discussion on the limitations of the experiment and other approaches would be helpful.</p>
<p>The discussion section is interesting. Importantly, the authors make the non-specialist aware of the peculiarities of laboratory strains of zebrafish with respect to the lack of sex chromosomes and a possible connection between the rDNA locus and sex determination. This information is critical to include in a journal that has a broad readership. I was unable to follow the argument about the 3Â´half of 5.8S &quot;to play a role&quot; in ribosome degradation based on Locati et al., 2018 (which is missing from the reference list) and &quot;serve as a target for degradation of maternal ribosomes&quot;. Kinetic effects on the degradation pattern of rRNA are frequently observed and difficult to interpret.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Ribosomes are generally considered homogeneous complexes with no inherent role in regulating translation. However, recent studies have found heterogeneity in the composition of ribosome accessory factors, proteins, and ribosomal RNA. Moreover, there is evidence that district ribosomal isoforms are produced at different developmental stages in Xenopus, Drosophila, and zebrafish. In Drosophila, germline-derived ribosomes have a different protein composition to those produced by somatic cell types. In zebrafish, germline vs. somatic ribosomes have been shown to incorporate distinct rRNA isoforms. However, the functional significance of ribosome heterogeneity is not known.</p>
<p>The manuscript by Shah et al., uses the power of the zebrafish to test the hypothesis that maternal ribosome isoforms have a distinct function relative to ribosome isoforms produced by somatic cells after the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MTZ). They confirm previous findings that all maternal rRNA are derived from the maternal-specific rRNA locus on Chromosome 4. Additionally, proteomic analysis showed that maternal and somatic ribosomes also differ in protein composition. Using ribosome tagging experiments they showed that maternally derived subunits can form functional heteroduplexes (hybrids) with somatic-derived subunits. Finally, they show that maternal-derived ribosomes continue to be expressed in germ cells where they preferentially associate with the maternally derived and germline localized nanos3 mRNA. This suggests a possible role of maternal ribosomes in germ cell-specific translational regulation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors use the experimental power of zebrafish to test the hypothesis that maternal and somatic-derived ribosomes have distinct functions. They use state-of-the art proteomics, molecular modeling, and transgenesis techniques. For the most part, the data presented is clear and supports their conclusions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Using pulldown experiments they show that maternal ribosomes associate with the PGC-enriched nanos3 RNA, suggesting a role for the maternal isoform in germline-specific translation. However, they acknowledge that the level of enrichment is similar to the level of maternal vs. somatic isoforms that localize to PGCs. The nanos3 mRNA is unique in that it is actively degraded in somatic cells shortly after MTZ so is never present in cells that express the somatic isoforms. Therefore, the association of nanos3 with maternal ribosomes shows that these ribosomes can associate with germline-specific RNAs, but does not provide compelling evidence for a maternal isoform-specific role in translational regulation.</p>
