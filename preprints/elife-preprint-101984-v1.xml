<title>Abstract</title><p>The dysfunction of the cellular endolysosomal pathway, such as in lysosomal storage diseases, can cause severe musculoskeletal disorders. However, how endolysosomal dysfunction causes musculoskeletal abnormalities remains poorly understood, limiting therapeutic options. Here, we report that CHMP5, a member of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-III protein family, is essential to maintain the endolysosomal pathway and regulate bone formation in osteogenic lineage cells. Genetic ablation of <italic>Chmp5</italic> in mouse osteogenic cells increases bone formation in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, <italic>Chmp5</italic> deletion causes endolysosomal dysfunction by decreasing the VPS4A protein, and CHMP5 overexpression is sufficient to increase the VPS4A protein. Subsequently, endolysosomal dysfunction disturbs mitochondrial functions and increases mitochondrial ROS, ultimately resulting in skeletal cell senescence. Senescent skeletal cells cause abnormal bone formation by combining cell-autonomous and paracrine actions. Importantly, elimination of senescent cells using senolytic drugs can alleviate musculoskeletal abnormalities in <italic>Chmp5</italic> conditional knockout mice. Therefore, our results show that cell senescence represents an underpinning mechanism and a therapeutic target for musculoskeletal disorders caused by the aberrant endolysosomal pathway. These results also uncover the function and mechanism of CHMP5 in the regulation of cell senescence by affecting the endolysosomal-mitochondrial pathway.</p>

<body>
<p>The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery is an evolutionarily conserved molecular mechanism essential for diverse cell biological processes. Since it was initially discovered in the early 21st century in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the molecular gear has been extensively dissected in the endocytic pathway, which sorts ubiquitinated membrane proteins and bound cargoes that commit to lysosomal degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. In addition to the endocytic process, ESCRT proteins also play critical roles in other cell activities, such as exocytosis, viral budding, cytokinesis, pruning of neurons, repair of the plasma membrane, and assembly of the nuclear envelope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. In the endocytic pathway, the ESCRT machinery consists of a series of functionally overlapping protein complexes, including ESCRT-0, -I, -II and -III. While the ESCRT-0, -I, and -II complexes are mainly responsible for protein sorting and recruiting ESCRT-III components, the ESCRT-III complex, cooperating with the ATPase VPS4, is the primary executor of membrane severing during the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], which ultimately fuse with the lysosomes for cargo degradation or with the plasma membrane to release cargos into the extracellular space.</p>
<p>Charged multivesicular body protein 5 (CHMP5), the mammalian ortholog of yeast VPS60/MOS10, is a component of the ESCRT-III protein complex and plays an essential role in the late stage of MVB formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. As the yeast <italic>Vps60/Mos10</italic>-null mutation disturbs the endosome-to-vacuole (the lysosome-like structure in yeast) trafficking and affects the sorting of internalized endocytic markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], ablation of <italic>Chmp5</italic> in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) also affects the sorting from late endosomes/MVBs to lysosomes and reduces lysosomal degradation of multiple activated receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Notably, in mouse osteoclasts, CHMP5 suppresses ubiquitylation of the IÎºBÎ± protein and restricts the activity of NFÎºB pathway, without any effect on endolysosomal functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. During Î±Î² T lymphocyte development, CHMP5 promotes thymocyte survival by stabilizing the pro-survival protein of Bcl2 and does not have an influence on the endolysosomal system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. These studies suggest that the regulation of the endolysosomal pathway by CHMP5 depends on the cell and tissue context.</p>
<p>The dysfunction of the endolysosomal pathway can cause severe musculoskeletal disorders. A such example is lysosomal storge diseases, which include more than 50 different subgroups of diseases due to mutations in genes that encode lysosomal hydrolases or genes that are responsible for the transport, maturation, and functions of lysosomal hydrolases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Musculoskeletal pathologies, such as joint stiffness/contracture, bone deformation, muscular atrophy, short stature, and decreased mobility, are among the most common, in some cases the earliest, clinical presentations of lysosomal storage diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. These musculoskeletal lesions are particularly refractory to current treatments for lysosomal storage diseases, including enzyme replacement treatment and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Therefore, studies on the mechanisms of musculoskeletal pathologies due to endolysosomal dysfunction are paramount to design and develop novel treatments for these disorders.</p>
<p>In this study, our results uncover the function and mechanism of CHMP5 in the regulation of cell senescence and bone formation in osteogenic cells. Deletion of <italic>Chmp5</italic> causes endolysosomal dysfunction involving decreased VPS4A protein and subsequently activates cell senescence by increasing intracellular mitochondrial ROS. Senescent cells induce bone formation in both autonomous and paracrine ways. Importantly, senolytic treatment is effective in mitigating musculoskeletal pathologies caused by <italic>Chmp5</italic> deletion.</p>

<title>Ablation of <italic>Chmp5</italic> in mouse osteogenic lineage cells causes aberrant bone formation</title>
<p>In addition to the well-characterized role of the CTSK gene in osteoclasts, this gene has recently been reported to identify periskeletal progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. In particular, the ablation of <italic>Chmp5</italic> in mouse <italic>Ctsk</italic>-expressing cells (hereafter referred to as <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice, homozygous) caused dramatic periskeletal bone overgrowth near the joint compared to <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk/+</sup></italic> (heterozygous) and <italic>Chmp5<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> littermate controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Aberrant periskeletal bone growth in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice became distinct around postnatal day 10 (d10), progressed with age, and involved multiple bones and joints throughout the body, including knee, ankle, and foot joints (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> to <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1A</xref>). With age, these animals developed severe skeletal deformities, progressive joint stiffness, reduced motility, and short stature. Despite bone overgrowth in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> animals, mechanical tests showed that bone stiffness and fracture stress decreased significantly (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), suggesting that bone mechanical properties were impaired in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice.</p>

</fig>
<p>To track CTSK<sup>+</sup> periskeletal progenitors during the bone overgrowth in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice, we crossed <italic>Ctsk-Cre</italic>, <italic>Chmp5<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>, and <italic>Rosa26<sup>mTmG</sup></italic> mice to generate <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk/+</sup>;Rosa26<sup>mTmG/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup>;Rosa26<sup>mTmG/+</sup></italic> reporter animals, in which CTSK<sup>+</sup> periskeletal progenitors and their descendants express membrane-localized green fluorescence protein (GFP). In <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk/+</sup>;Rosa26<sup>mTmG/+</sup></italic> control mice, GFP<sup>+</sup> cells could be detected in the perichondrium, groove of Ranvier, periosteum, ligament, and enthesis in addition to osteoclasts in the bone marrow, but not in growth plate chondrocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). With <italic>Chmp5</italic> deletion, GFP<sup>+</sup> cells consisted of a major part of cells in periskeletal overgrowth in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup>;Rosa26<sup>mTmG/+</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1B</xref>). Tartarate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining did not show TRAP<sup>+</sup> osteoclasts in the periskeletal lesion, while obvious TRAP<sup>+</sup> osteoclasts could be detected in the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1C</xref>). These results indicate that <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient periskeletal progenitors directly contribute to the bone overgrowth in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice.</p>
<p>Next, we sought to confirm the role of CHMP5 in the regulation of bone formation by deleting this gene using another mouse line of osteogenic lineage Cre. We crossed <italic>Chmp5<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice with the line of <italic>Prrx1</italic>-Cre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], <italic>Col2</italic>-Cre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] or <italic>Osx</italic>-Cre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] mice to delete the <italic>Chmp5</italic> gene in <italic>Prrx1</italic>-expressing limb mesenchymal progenitors (<italic>Chmp5<sup>Prrx1</sup></italic> mice), <italic>Col2</italic>-expressing perichondral progenitors (<italic>Chmp5<sup>Col2</sup></italic> mice) or <italic>Osx</italic>-expressing osteoprogenitors (<italic>Chmp5<sup>Osx</sup></italic> mice) and were unable to obtain postnatal homozygous gene knockout mice, probably due to embryonic lethality after ablating C<italic>hmp5</italic> expression in these osteogenic lineages. Subsequently, we used the <italic>Dmp1</italic>-Cre mouse line that could target postnatal endosteal osteoprogenitors, preosteoblasts, mature osteoblasts, and osteocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. <italic>Chmp5<sup>Dmp1</sup></italic> mice were born in normal Mendelian ratios and were viable. Within three weeks of age, the skeletons of <italic>Chmp5<sup>Dmp1</sup></italic> mice began to show a distinct expansion in comparison with <italic>Chmp5<sup>Dmp1/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Chmp5<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> littermate controls, which progressed with age and became much more severe at 1 year of age (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). Bone expansion in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Dmp1</sup></italic> mice that occurred mainly in the endosteum was further shown in detail around the age of 10 weeks by micro-CT and histological analyses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1D, E</xref>).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, since <italic>Dmp1</italic>-expressing lineage cells also generate skeletal muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>], <italic>Chmp5<sup>Dmp1</sup></italic> mice showed a profound decrease in skeletal muscle mass with age (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">H</xref>). Hindlimb abduction, full-limb hanging time, and front-limb pull strength tests showed that muscular functions also decreased profoundly in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Dmp1</sup></italic> compared to <italic>Chmp5<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">J</xref>).</p>

<p>The regulation of osteogenesis by CHMP5 in skeletal progenitors was further determined in the osteogenic cell line MC3T3-E1 after removing <italic>Chmp5</italic> using CRISPR/CAS9 technology (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>).

<title>CHMP5 controls skeletal progenitor cell senescence</title>
<p>To gain more insight into the mechanism of regulation of bone formation by CHMP5, we assumed that depletion of <italic>Chmp5</italic> in osteogenic lineage cells also increases cell proliferation, which contributes to the bone overgrowth in <italic>Chmp5</italic> conditional knockout mice. Unexpectedly, <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> periskeletal progenitors showed a significant decrease in the cell proliferation rate compared to <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk/+</sup></italic> controls (approximately 58% decrease in the cell number on day 6 of P2 culture, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Because CHMP5 has been reported to regulate thymocyte apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], we performed cell apoptosis analyses for <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> and <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk/+</sup></italic> cells. Annexin V staining showed that approximately 4.96 Â± 0.81% of <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> periskeletal progenitors vs. 1.69 Â± 0.68% of <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk/+</sup></italic> control cells were positively stained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3A</xref>). Similarly, the in-situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling assay (TUNEL) demonstrated that around 3.70 Â± 0.72% cells in the periskeletal lesion of <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice were positively labelled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3B</xref>). These results show that cell apoptosis is activated in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> periskeletal progenitors in a rather low ratio.</p>

<p>Notably, the low apoptotic cell ratio (approximately 5%) could not well match the decrease in cell proliferation rate (approximately 58%) in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> periskeletal progenitors. We further analyzed the RNA-seq data of <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> vs. <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk/+</sup></italic> cells to dig out the mechanism of CHMP5 deficiency on the fate of skeletal progenitors. The gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed significant enrichment of genes in multiple molecular pathways associated with cell senescence in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> relative to <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk/+</sup></italic> periskeletal progenitors, including <italic>Hmga1</italic>, <italic>Hmga2</italic>, <italic>Trp53</italic>, <italic>Ets1</italic>, and <italic>Txn1</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). Furthermore, Western blot results showed that both the p16 and p21 proteins, two canonical markers of cellular senescence, were upregulated in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> compared to control cells, with a higher degree of upregulation in the p16 protein (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). C<italic>hmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice were found to show gross accelerated aging-related phenotypes, including hair loss, joint stiffness/contracture, and decreased motility (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>).</p>
<p>To further characterize the effect of CHMP5 on skeletal progenitor cell fate, we deleted <italic>Chmp5</italic> in ATDC5 cells, which were shown to be an appropriate model of periskeletal progenitors in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], using CRISPR/CAS9 technology (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). Similarly, <italic>Chmp5</italic> deletion also significantly suppressed the cell proliferation rate of ATDC5 cells and mildly increased cell apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">D</xref>). However, inhibition of cell apoptosis using the pancaspase inhibitor Q-VD-Oph could not reverse cell number reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3E</xref>), indicating that cell apoptosis was not the main cause of the decrease in the proliferation rate of <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient skeletal progenitors. Instead, cell cycle analysis showed a significant decrease of <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient ATDC5 cells in phase S, and a significant proportion of these cells were arrested in G0/G1 or G2/M phases (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>), which is a typic characteristic of cell cycle arrest in senescent cells. Taken together, these results at molecular, cellular, and gross levels demonstrate that <italic>Chmp5</italic> deficiency induces skeletal progenitor cell senescence.</p>

<title>Secretory phenotype of <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient skeletal progenitors</title>
<p>A remarkable feature of senescent cells is the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which plays a critical role in mediating the pathophysiological processes of cell senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. In particular, periskeletal overgrowths in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic>;<italic>Rosa26<sup>mTmG/+</sup></italic> mice showed evident integration of many cells lacking evidence of Cre-mediated recombination (GFP<sup>-</sup>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deleted periskeletal progenitors might recruit neighboring <italic>wild-type</italic> cells to facilitate the bone overgrowth. Additionally, the GSEA of RNA-seq data showed a significant enrichment of genes associated with the SASP molecular pathway in <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deleted periskeletal progenitors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Meanwhile, confocal fluorescence microscopy captured many extracellular vesicles shed from the plasma membrane of <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> periskeletal progenitors, which were rarely detected around <italic>wild-type</italic> control cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>).

<p>Functionally, conditioned medium collected from <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient skeletal progenitors caused a higher proliferation rate of ATDC5 cells than medium from control cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). Simultaneously, CD45<sup>-</sup>;CD31<sup>-</sup>;GFP<sup>-</sup> skeletal progenitors from periskeletal tissues of <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic>;<italic>Rosa26<sup>mTmG/+</sup></italic> mice showed increased proliferation along with enhanced osteogenic differentiation compared to the corresponding cells from <italic>Ctsk-Cre;Rosa26<sup>mTmG/+</sup></italic> control mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F, G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4B, C</xref>).

<p>Next, we performed a secretome analysis to characterize secretory profiles of <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> vs. <italic>wild-type</italic> periskeletal progenitors.

It should be noted that the early endosomes of EEA1<sup>+</sup> also increased slightly in approximately 10% of <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> periskeletal progenitors, while the recycling endosomes of RAB11<sup>+</sup> and the TGN38<sup>+</sup> trans-Golgi network were relatively normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig. S6E</xref>). These results demonstrate that CHMP5 deficiency in skeletal progenitors causes the accumulation of late endosomes and lysosomes and disrupts the function of the endolysosomal pathway.</p>
<p>To dissect the molecular mechanism of CHMP5 that regulates the endolysosomal pathway, we performed a proteomic analysis in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> and <italic>wild-type</italic> periskeletal progenitors. Bioinformatic analyses of proteomic data showed that VPS4A is one of the most significant decreased proteins in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> compared to <italic>wild-type</italic> periskeletal progenitors (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6I</xref>). The decrease in the VPS4A protein in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> periskeletal progenitors was verified by Western blot analysis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6J</xref>), while the <italic>Vps4a</italic> mRNA did not show a significant change in the RNA-seq analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig. S6F</xref>). On the other hand, when CHMP5 was overexpressed by transfection of a CHMP5 vector into HEK-293T cells, the level of VPS4A protein increased significantly and <italic>VPS4A</italic> mRNA was not significantly affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig. S6G, H</xref>). These results indicate that CHMP5 is essential in maintaining the VPS4A protein. Since VPS4A is a critical ATPase mediating the function of the ESCRT-III protein complex, the reduction of VPS4A protein could be responsible for endolysosomal dysfunction in <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deleted skeletal progenitors.</p>

<title>Mitochondrial dysfunction is responsible for cell senescence in <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deleted skeletal progenitors</title>
<p>A remaining question is how <italic>Chmp5</italic> deficiency and endolysosomal dysfunction cause skeletal cell senescence.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, our results reveal the role and mechanism of CHMP5 in the regulation of cell senescence and bone formation in osteogenic cells. In normal skeletal progenitor cells, CHMP5 is essential in maintaining the VPS4A protein, a critical AAA ATPase for the functions of the ESCRT-III protein complex. The deficiency of CHMP5 decreases the VSP4A protein and causes the accumulation of dysfunctional late endosomes (MVB), lysosomes, and mitochondria, which induce skeletal cell senescence and result in increased bone formation through a combination of cell-autonomous and paracrine mechanisms (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7H</xref>). Strikingly, elimination of senescent cells using senolytic drugs is effective in mitigating abnormal bone formation.</p>
<p>The role of CHMP5 in cell senescence has not been reported. As the mechanisms and functions of cell senescence could be highly heterogeneous depending on inducers, tissue and cell contexts, and other factors such as âtimeâ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>], there is currently no universal molecular marker to define all types of cell senescence. In this study, <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient skeletal progenitors show multiple canonical features of senescent cells, including increased p16 and p21 proteins, cell cycle arrest, elevated secretory phenotype, accumulation and dysfunction of lysosomes and mitochondria. Also, <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> and <italic>Chmp5<sup>Dmp1</sup></italic> mice show dramatic aging-related phenotypes, including hair loss, joint stiffness/contracture, decreased bone strength, or gradual loss of muscle mass and functions. Importantly, senolytic drugs (Q + D) markedly improve musculoskeletal abnormalities and increase animal motility in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> and <italic>Chmp5<sup>Dmp1</sup></italic> mice. These results reveal the role of CHMP5 in controlling the senescence of skeletal cells.</p>
<p>CHMP5 has been reported to regulate VPS4 activity, which catalyzes the disassembly of the ESCRT-III protein complex from late endosomes/MVBs, by binding directly to the VPS4 protein or other protein partners such as LIP5 and Brox [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. However, it remains unknown how CHMP5 regulates VPS4 activity. Our results in this study show that CHMP5 is necessary to maintain the VPS4A protein but does not affect the level of VPS4A mRNA, suggesting that CHMP5 regulates VPS4 activity by maintaining the level of the VPS4A protein. However, the mechanism of CHMP5 in the regulation of the VPS4A protein has not yet been studied. Since CHMP5 can recruit the deubiquitinating enzyme USP15 to stabilize IÎºBÎ± in osteoclasts by suppressing ubiquitination-mediated proteasomal degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], it is also possible that CHMP5 stabilizes the VPS4A protein by recruiting deubiquitinating enzymes and regulating ubiquitination-mediated proteasomal degradation of VPS4A, which needs to be clarified in future studies. Notably, mutations in the <italic>VPS4A</italic> gene in humans can cause multisystemic diseases, including musculoskeletal abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>] (OMIM: 619273), suggesting that normal expression and function of VPS4A are important for musculoskeletal physiology.</p>
<p>The upstream signaling that regulates CHMP5 expression in osteogenic cells is unclear. Previous studies showed that muramyl-dipeptide and lipopolysaccharide upregulate CHMP5 expression in human monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. Whether the mechanism also occurs in osteogenic cells remains to be determined, especially since many molecular and cellular mechanisms are cell lineage/type dependent. In addition, an earlier study showed that <italic>Rank</italic> haploinsufficiency in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice (<italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup>;Rank<sup>+/â</sup></italic>) could greatly reverse skeletal abnormalities in these animals, including periskeletal overgrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Therefore, RANK receptor signaling may function upstream of CHMP5. However, whether RANK is expressed in osteogenic cells needs additional studies to clarify. Otherwise, other epigenetic, transcriptional, translational, or post-translational mechanisms may also play a role in the regulation of CHMP5 expression in osteogenic lineage cells in physiological and pathological contexts.</p>
<p>A previous study using the <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mouse model defined a function of CHMP5 in the regulation of osteoclast differentiation by tuning NF-ÎºB signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. While the evidence on the role of CHMP5 in osteoclastogenesis is robust in that study, our results in the current study provide compelling evidence on the role of CHMP5 in bone formation in osteogenic cells. Additionally, the function of CHMP5 in restricting bone formation was confirmed in the <italic>Chmp5<sup>Dmp1</sup></italic> mouse model and in the MC3T3-E1 cell model (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Therefore, it is probable that both osteoblasts and osteoclasts contribute to bone deformation in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice. However, the previous study by Greenblatt et al. did not find any endolysosomal abnormalities in osteoclasts and in that study cell senescence and mitochondrial functions were not measured. Therefore, our results in this study predominantly reveal a novel function and related mechanism of CHMP5 in the regulation of bone formation in osteogenic cells. Intriguingly, bone overgrowth was confined to the periosteal or endosteal site in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> and <italic>Chmp5<sup>Dmp1</sup></italic> mice, respectively, pointing to a site-specific function of CHMP5 or cell senescence in regulating bone formation.</p>
<p>In addition, there was also a mild increase in apoptotic cells in the population of <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient skeletal progenitors (approximately 5%). Since anti-apoptotic treatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor Q-VD-Oph could not reverse the decrease in cell number in <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient skeletal progenitors, cell apoptosis may not be the main cause of the decrease in cell proliferation rate in these progenitors. It should be noted that although senescent cells are generally resistant to apoptosis, the gradual accumulation of dysfunctional lysosomes and mitochondria in <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient skeletal progenitors could result in overload of toxic macromolecules and metabolites, which could activate the apoptotic pathway to eliminate severely damaged cells. Otherwise, CHMP5 may regulate cell senescence and apoptosis through different mechanisms.</p>
<p>In summary, we have revealed the role of CHMP5 in the regulation of cell senescence and bone formation in osteogenic cells. This study also confirms the essential function of CHMP5 in the endolysosomal pathway that involves the regulation of the VPS4A protein. Additionally, mitochondrial functions are impaired with CHMP5 deletion, which is responsible for cell senescence. Future studies should explore the mechanism of CHMP5 in the regulation of mitochondrial functions. Since <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> and <italic>Chmp5<sup>Dmp1</sup></italic> mice recapitulate many cellular and phenotypic features of musculoskeletal lesions in lysosomal storage disease, these animals could be used as preclinical models to investigate the mechanism and test therapeutic drugs for these intractable disorders.</p>

<p>In this study, two <italic>Chmp5</italic>-flox mouse strains were used, and similar phenotypes were observed. The <italic>Chmp5<sup>tm2.1Gho</sup></italic> strain was previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. The alternative <italic>Chmp5</italic>-flox strain was established by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering. Similarly to the <italic>Chmp5<sup>tm2.1Gho</sup></italic> strain, exons 4 and 5 were selected as the conditional knockout region in the newly created strain and deletion of this region results in frameshift of the <italic>Chmp5</italic> gene. To engineer the target vector, homologous arms, and the conditional knockout region with 5â and 3â loxP sites were generated by PCR using the BAC clone. Cas9, gRNA, and targeting vectors were co-injected into fertilized eggs for gene-edited mouse production and pups were genotyped by PCR followed by sequencing analysis. Mice bearing the targeted allele were backcrossed with C57BL/6J mice up to F8 generation.</p>

<p>Pathway analyses were performed for differentially expressed genes using the Reactome online analysis tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>] and the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (Qiagen). Gene ontology term over-representation analysis was run using PANTHER (version 14.1) with all genes expressed in a tissue or cell type as background and the differentially expressed gene list as input. The P-values of Fisherâs exact tests were corrected by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). Gene set enrichment analyses were performed using GSEA or ConsensusPathDB. For GSEA-based analysis, gene sets of interests were downloaded from the MsigDB, while all built-in gene sets were used for ConsensusPathDB-based analysis.</p>

<title>Nano LC-MS/MS for secretomic and proteomic analyses</title>
<p>Label-free relative protein quantification analyses were performed to identify differentially expressed proteins in the supernatant or cell lysis of <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> versus control periskeletal progenitors (<italic>n</italic> =3 animals per group). For cell supernatants, the same amounts of samples went through 3 kD ultrafiltration tubes and then were processed for reduction and alkylation. Subsequently, the samples were digested in trypsin overnight and the peptides were desalted prior to mass spectrometry analysis. For cell lysis, samples were precipitated using acetone after reduction and alkylation. The samples were then subjected to digestion, desalination, and mass spectrometry analysis.</p>
<p>Quantitative data were collected on an Orbitrap Eclipseâ¢ Tribrid<sup>TM</sup> mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific) coupled to a nanoLC system (EASY-nLCâ¢ 1200, ThermoFisher Scientific). All peptide mixtures were analyzed using the same chromatographic conditions: 5 Î¼l of each sample were fractionated in a 150 Î¼mÃ15 cm in-house made column packed with Acclaim PepMap RPLC C18 (1.9 Î¼m, 100 Ã, Dr. Maisch GmbH, Germany) working at a flow rate of 600 nl/min, using a linear gradient of eluent B (20% 0.1% formic acid in water + 80% acetonitrile) in A (0.1% formic acid in MilliQ water) from 4% to 10% for 5 min, 10% to 22% for 80 min, 22% to 40% for 25 min, 40% to 95% for 5 min, and 95% to 95% for 5 min. MS/MS analyses were performed using Data-Dependent Acquisition (DDA) mode: one MS scan (mass range from 350 to 1500 m/z) was followed by MS/MS scans up to the top 20 most intense peptide ions from the preview scan in the Orbitrap, applying a dynamic exclusion window of 120 seconds.</p>
<p>The raw MS files were analyzed and searched against the Mus_musculus_reviewed protein database using MaxQuant (1.6.2.10). The parameters were set as follows: the protein modifications were carbamidomethylation (C) (fixed), oxidation (M) (variable), acetyl (Protein N-term) (variable); the enzyme specificity was set to trypsin; the maximum missed cleavages were set at 2; the precursor ion mass tolerance was set at 20 ppm; and the MS/MS tolerance was 20 ppm. Only highly confident identified peptides were chosen for downstream protein identification analysis.</p>

After washing in 0.5 M Na cacodylate-HCl buffer (pH 7.0), the cells were post-fixed for 1 hr in 1% osmium tetroxide (w/v) at room temperature. After post-fixation, the culture plate with adherent cells were enblock stained (20 min) with 1% aqueous uranyl-acetate (w/v). Culture plates were washed again in the same buffer and dehydrated through a series of graded ethanol to 100% and transferred through two changes of 50/50 (v/v) SPIpon resin (Structure Probe, Inc.)/100% ethanol and left overnight to infiltrate. The following morning, the cell culture plates were transferred through three changes of fresh SPIpon resin to finish the infiltration and embedding and finally, the plates were filled with freshly prepared SPIpon resin and polymerized for 48 hrs at 70 Â°C.</p>
<p>Once fully polymerized, the plate was cut apart, and each well was plunged into liquid nitrogen to separate the SPIpon epoxy block with the embedded cells from the culture dish. The round epoxy disks with the embedded cells were then examined under an upright light microscope, and areas of cells were cut from the disks and glued onto blank microtome studs and trimmed for ultramicrotomy. Ultrathin sections (70 nm) were cut on a Reichart-Jung ultramicrotome using a diamond knife. The sections were collected and mounted on copper support grids and contrasted with lead citrate and uranyl acetate and examined on a FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit transmission electron microscope at 100 Kv accelerating voltage and images were recorded at various magnifications using a Gatan 2K digital camera system.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript presents a significant and rigorous investigation into the role of CHMP5 in regulating bone formation and cellular senescence. The study provides compelling evidence that CHMP5 is essential for maintaining endolysosomal function and controlling mitochondrial ROS levels, thereby preventing the senescence of skeletal progenitor cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors demonstrate that the deletion of Chmp5 results in endolysosomal dysfunction, elevated mitochondrial ROS, and ultimately enhanced bone formation through both autonomous and paracrine mechanisms. The innovative use of senolytic drugs to ameliorate musculoskeletal abnormalities in Chmp5-deficient mice is a novel and critical finding, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies for musculoskeletal disorders linked to endolysosomal dysfunction.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript requires a deeper discussion or exploration of CHMP5's roles and a more refined analysis of senolytic drug specificity and effects. This would greatly enhance the comprehensiveness and clarity of the manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Zhang et al. reported that CHMP5 restricts bone formation by controlling endolysosome-mitochondrion-mediated cell senescence. The effects of CHMP5 on osteoclastic bone resorption and bone turnover have been reported previously (PMID: 26195726), in which study the aberrant bone phenotype was observed in the CHMP5-ctsk-CKO mouse model, using the same mouse model, Zhang et al., report a novel role of CHMP5 on osteogenesis through affecting cell senescence. Overall, it is an interesting study and provides new insights in the field of cell senescence and bone.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Analyzed the bone phenotype OF CHMP5-periskeletal progenitor-CKO mouse model and found the novel role of senescent cells on osteogenesis and migration.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) There are a lot of papers that have reported that senescence impairs osteogenesis of skeletal stem cells. In this study, the author claimed that Chmp5 deficiency induces skeletal progennitor cell senescence and enhanced osteogenesis. Can the authors explain the controversial results?</p>
<p>(2) Co-culture of Chmp5-KO periskeletal progenitors with WT ones should be conducted to detect the migration and osteogenesis of WT cells in response to Chmp5-KO-induced senescent cells. In addition, the co-culture of WT periskeletal progenitors with senescent cells induced by H2O2, radiation, or from aged mice would provide more information.</p>
<p>(3) Many EVs were secreted from Chmp5-deleted periskeletal progenitors, compared to the rarely detected EVs around WT cells. Since EVs of BMSCs or osteoprogenitors show strong effects of promoting osteogenesis, did the EVs contribute to the enhanced osteogenesis induced by Chmp5-defeciency?</p>
<p>(4) EVs secreted from senescent cells propagate senescence and impair osteogenesis, why do EVs secreted from senescent cells induced by Chmp5-defeciency have opposite effects on osteogenesis?</p>
<p>(5) The Chmp5-ctsk mice show accelerated aging-related phenotypes, such as hair loss and joint stiffness. Did Ctsk also label cells in hair follicles or joint tissue?</p>
<p>(6) Fifteen proteins were found to increase and five proteins to decrease in the cell supernatant of Chmp5Ctsk periskeletal progenitors. How about SASP factors in the secretory profile?</p>
<p>(7) D+Q treatment mitigates musculoskeletal pathologies in Chmp5 conditional knockout mice. In the previously published paper (CHMP5 controls bone turnover rates by dampening NF-ÎºB activity in osteoclasts), inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption rescues the aberrant bone phenotype of the Chmp5 conditional knockout mice. Whether the effects of D+Q on bone overgrowth is because of the inhibition of bone resorption?</p>
<p>(8) The role of VPS4A in cell senescence should be measured to support the conclusion that CHMP5 regulates osteogenesis by affecting cell senescence.</p>
<p>(9) Cell senescence with markers, such as p21 and H2AX, co-stained with GFP should be performed in the mouse models to indicate the effects of Chmp5 on cell senescence in vivo.</p>
<p>(10) ADTC5 cell as osteochondromas cells line, is not a good cell model of periskeletal progenitors. Maybe primary periskeletal progenitor cell is a better choice.</p>

<p>(1) There are a lot of papers that have reported that senescence impairs osteogenesis of skeletal stem cells. In this study, the author claimed that Chmp5 deficiency induces skeletal progennitor cell senescence and enhanced osteogenesis. Can the authors explain the controversial results?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Different skeletal stem cell populations in time and space have been identified and reported. This study shows that <italic>Chmp5</italic> deficiency in periskeletal and endosteal skeletal progenitors causes cell senescence and aberrant bone formation. Although cell senescence during aging can impair osteogenesis of certain skeletal stem cells, which contributes to diseases with low bone mass such as osteoporosis, aging can also increase heterotopic mineralization/calcification in musculoskeletal soft tissues such as ligaments and tendons, which is consistent with our results in this study. These reflect out-of-order musculoskeletal mineralization during aging. We will expand the discussion and clarify the results of CHMP5-regulated cell senescence in osteogenesis in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

</disp-quote>
<p>Increased osteogenesis of WT skeletal progenitors in the periskeletal lesion was shown to be a paracrine mechanism of abnormal bone formation in <italic>Chmp5Ctsk</italic> mice. The coculture experiment will help confirm the effect of <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient skeletal progenitors on the osteogenesis of neighboring WT skeletal progenitors.</p>
<p>Notably, the cause and outcome of cell senescence are highly heterogeneous, and different causes of cell senescence can cause significantly different outcomes. Although the coculture of WT periskeletal progenitors with senescent cells induced by H2O2, radiation, or from aged mice would be very interesting, these are beyond the scope of the current study.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>The WT skeletal progenitor cells from <italic>Chmp5Ctsk</italic> mice have an increased capacity of osteogenesis compared to the corresponding cells from control animals, suggesting that the EVs of the <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deleted periskeletal progenitors could promote osteogenesis of the WT skeletal progenitors, which represents a paracrine mechanism of abnormal bone formation in <italic>Chmp5</italic> deficient animals. We will discuss and clarify these results in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) EVs secreted from senescent cells propagate senescence and impair osteogenesis, why do EVs secreted from senescent cells induced by Chmp5-defeciency have opposite effects on osteogenesis?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The question is similar to comment #1. The functional heterogeneity of cellular senescence will be discussed in further detail and clarified in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The Chmp5-ctsk mice show accelerated aging-related phenotypes, such as hair loss and joint stiffness. Did Ctsk also label cells in hair follicles or joint tissue?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an interesting question. Although we did not check the expression of CHMP5 in hair follicles, which is outside the scope of the present study, the result in Fig. 1E showed the expression of CHMP5 in joint ligaments. Notably, abnormal periskeletal bone formation occurs predominantly at the joint ligament insertion site in <italic>Chmp5Ctsk</italic> mice, which will be elucidated and discussed in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Fifteen proteins were found to increase and five proteins to decrease in the cell supernatant of Chmp5Ctsk periskeletal progenitors. How about SASP factors in the secretory profile?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As mentioned above, the SASP phenotype and related factors of senescent cells could be highly heterogeneous depending on inducers, cell types, and timing of senescence. Most of the proteins we identified in the secretome analysis have previously been reported in the secretory profile of osteoblasts. Although we were also interested in the change of some common SASP factors, such as inflammatory cytokines, the experiment did not detect these factors because of their small molecular weights and the technical limitations of mass spec analysis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) D+Q treatment mitigates musculoskeletal pathologies in Chmp5 conditional knockout mice. In the previously published paper (CHMP5 controls bone turnover rates by dampening NF-ÎºB activity in osteoclasts), inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption rescues the aberrant bone phenotype of the Chmp5 conditional knockout mice. Whether the effects of D+Q on bone overgrowth is because of the inhibition of bone resorption?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Although in <italic>Chmp5Ctsk</italic> mice we cannot exclude the effect of D+Q on osteoclasts, the effect of D+Q on osteoblast lineage cells, which is the focus of the current study, was verified in <italic>Chmp5Dmp1</italic> mice. We will expand the discussion and make these results clearer with the revision.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) The role of VPS4A in cell senescence should be measured to support the conclusion that CHMP5 regulates osteogenesis by affecting cell senescence.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that additional experiments examining the role of VPS4A in cell senescence will provide more mechanistic insights. The focus of the current study is to report that CHMP5 restricts abnormal bone formation by preventing endolysosome-mitochondrion-mediated cell senescence. The roles of VPS4A in cell senescence and skeletal biology will be explored in separate studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) Cell senescence with markers, such as p21 and H2AX, co-stained with GFP should be performed in the mouse models to indicate the effects of Chmp5 on cell senescence in vivo.</p>

<p>We will examine additional markers of cell senescence, as the reviewers suggest, in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(10) ADTC5 cell as osteochondromas cells line, is not a good cell model of periskeletal progenitors. Maybe primary periskeletal progenitor cell is a better choice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We were aware that ATDC5 cells are typically used as a chondrocyte progenitor cell line. However, our previous study showed that ATDC5 cells could also be used as a reasonable cell model for periskeletal progenitors. Furthermore, the corresponding results from primary periskeletal progenitors were shown. We will further clarify this in the revision.</p>
<p>In general, the comments of these reviewers will help clarify our results and further strengthen our conclusion. We will address these comments and questions point to point in more detail in the revised manuscript.</p>
