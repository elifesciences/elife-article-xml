<title>Abstract</title><p>Female sexual receptivity is essential for reproduction of a species. Neuropeptides play the main role in regulating female receptivity. However, whether neuropeptides regulate the establishment of neural circuits for female sexual receptivity is unknown. Here we found the peptide hormone prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), which belongs to the insect PG axis, regulated virgin female receptivity through ecdysone during neural maturation in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. We identified PG neurons expressing PTTH as doublesex-positive neurons, they regulated virgin female receptivity before the metamorphosis during the 3<sup>rd</sup>-instar larval stage. Furthermore, the ecdysone receptor EcR-A in pC1 neurons regulated virgin female receptivity during metamorphosis. The reduced EcR-A in pC1 neurons induced abnormal morphological development of pC1 neurons without changing neural activity. Among all subtypes of pC1 neurons, the function of EcR-A in pC1b neurons was necessary for virgin female copulation rate. These suggested that the changes of synaptic connections between pC1b and other neurons decreased female copulation rate. Moreover, analysis of brain transcriptomes when EcR-A was reduced in pC1 neurons revealed that, additional genes were regulated downstream of EcR-A function in pC1 neurons. The PG axis has similar functional strategy as the HPG axis in mammals to trigger the juvenile–adult transition. Our work suggests a general mechanism underlying which the neurodevelopment during maturation regulates female sexual receptivity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The success of copulation is important for the reproduction of a species. <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> provides a powerful system to investigate the neuronal and molecular mechanism of sexual behaviors. Females decide to mate or not according to their physiological status and the environmental condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dickson, 2008</xref>). Sexually mature adult virgin females validate males after sensing the courtship song and male-specific sex pheromone, receive courtship with pausing and opening the vaginal plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ferveur, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Greenspan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hall, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). If female is not willing to mate, she may kick the legs, flick the wings, or extrude the ovipositor to deter males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Connolly et al., 1973</xref>). Mated females reject males for several days after mating mainly through more ovipositor extrusion and less opening the vaginal plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fuyama et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). These options need the establishment of neural circuits for female sexual receptivity. However, the associated mechanism of neural maturation and the effect of neural maturation on female sexual receptivity is little known.</p>
<p><italic>doublesex</italic> (<italic>dsx</italic>) and <italic>fruitless</italic> (<italic>fru</italic>) are the terminal genes in sex determination regulatory hierarchy. They specify nearly all aspects of somatic sexual differentiation, including the preparation for sexual behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dickson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Manoli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Manoli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mellert et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Pavlou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Siwicki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Yamamoto, 2007</xref>; Yamamoto et al., 2013). In males, male-specific <italic>fru</italic> protein (Fru<sup>M</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Billeter et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Demir et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hall, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Manoli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Stockinger et al., 2005</xref>) and the male-specific <italic>dsx</italic> protein (Dsx<sup>M</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kohatsu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Pan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Pan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Rideout et al., 2010</xref>) are important for the male courtship behaviors. In females, functional Fru protein does not exist, while the neurons in that <italic>fru</italic> P1 promoter or <italic>dsx</italic> is expressed regulate some aspects of the female sexual behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kvitsiani et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Rideout et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>Fru and dsx</italic> are involved in regulating the sexual dimorphism during neurodevelopment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Yamamoto et al., 2013</xref>). For instance, the sexual dimorphism of P1 and mAL neurons which are all associated with male courtship and aggression behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Clowney et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hoopfer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kimura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kohatsu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Pan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Sengupta et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">von Philipsborn et al., 2011</xref>) is the result of regulation by Dsx and/or Fru (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ito et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kimura et al., 2008</xref>). In the cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA) pathway, which induces the courtship inhibiting in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kurtovic et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Wang et al., 2010</xref>), the first-order to the fourth-order components are all fruGAL4-positive neurons and are either male-specific or sexually dimorphic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Ruta et al., 2010</xref>). However, the role of Dsx<sup>F</sup> in neurodevelopment associated with female sexual behaviors is little understood.</p>
<p>During postembryonic development, the PG axis triggers the juvenile–adult transition, similar as the function of hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axis in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Herbison, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Pan et al., 2019</xref>). Hormones of the PG axis act to transform the larval nervous system into an adult version (Truman et al., 2023). Ecdysone belonging to the PG axis is the prime mover of insect molting and metamorphosis and is involved in all phases of neurodevelopment, including neurogenesis, pruning, arbor outgrowth, and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Truman et al., 2023</xref>). The neurons read the ecdysteroid titer through two isoforms of the ecdysone receptor, EcR-A and EcR-B1, according to spatial and temporal conditions in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Riddiford et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Truman et al., 1994</xref>). EcR-A is required in fru P1-expressing neurons for the establishment of male-specific neuronal architecture, and ecdysone receptor deficient males display increased male–male courtship behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dalton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ganter et al., 2007</xref>). However, how ecdysone regulates the neurodevelopment associated with female sexual receptivity, especially the fru<sup>+</sup> and dsx<sup>+</sup> neurons, is unknown.</p>
<p>Much of studies to understand female sexual receptivity has focused on its regulation. How a female respond to males is highly dependent on whether or not she has previously mated. In virgin females, dsx<sup>+</sup> pCd neurons respond to the cVA, while dsx<sup>+</sup> pC1 neurons also respond to male courtship song (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). The receptive females open the vaginal plate (VPO) through activation of the dsx<sup>+</sup> vpoDN neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). After mated, sex peptide in the seminal fluid binds to the fru<sup>+</sup> dsx<sup>+</sup> sex peptide sensory neurons (SPSNs) in the female uterus. Then neuronal activity in the dsx<sup>+</sup> sex peptide abdominal ganglion (SAG) neurons of the ventral nerve cord and in the pC1 neurons is reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Avila et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Feng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Häsemeyer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kubli, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Wang et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Yang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, the sexual receptivity is reduced with less VPO and more ovipositor extrusion (OE) which is controlled by dsx<sup>+</sup> DpN13 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Wang et al., 2020a</xref>). In addition, neuropeptides and monoamines play a critical role in regulation of the female receptivity. The neuropeptides Drosulfakinin, myoinhibitory peptides and SIFamide are involved in female sexual receptivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Terhzaz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). As monoamines, dopamine, serotonin and octopamine are pivotal to female sexual behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ishimoto et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ma et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Neckameyer, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Rezával et al., 2014</xref>). So far, the identified neuropeptides and monoamines modulating female sexual receptivity all function during the adult stage. However, whether neuropeptides or monoamines regulate the establishment of neural circuits for female sexual receptivity is unknown.</p>
<p>To explore the factors that regulate <italic>Drosophila</italic> virgin female receptivity especially during neurodevelopment, we did a knock-out screen including most of CCT members. We discovered a requirement for the prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) during postembryonic development for virgin female receptivity. We also found that PG neurons expressing PTTH are dsx<sup>+</sup> neurons. PTTH, a brain derived neuropeptide hormone, is the primary promoter of the synthesis of steroid hormone 20- hydroxyecdysone (20E) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">McBrayer et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Rewitz et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, the enhanced virgin female receptivity due to the loss of PTTH could be rescued through feeding 20E to the 3<sup>rd</sup>-instar larvae. Due to that 20E functions through its receptor EcR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Riddiford et al., 2000</xref>), we then tested the function of EcR in pC1 neurons which encode the mating status of females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). The reduced EcR-A expression in pC1 neurons resulted in the unnormal anatomical pattern of pC1 neurons and the reduced female copulation rate. Furthermore, the decreased female copulation rate was due to the reduced EcR-A in pC1b neurons. To detect the molecular mechanism for the regulation of pC1 neurons in virgin female receptivity, we tested the RNAseq when EcR- A was reduced in pC1 neurons. We found some regulated genes, which provide clues for our future research in the molecular mechanism by which pC1 neurons regulate virgin female receptivity. Thus, in addition to demonstrating the function of PTTH in virgin female receptivity during neural maturation, our study identified the necessary role of the normal pC1b neural morphology in virgin female receptivity.</p>

<title>PTTH modulates virgin female receptivity</title>
<p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, neuropeptides and monoamines, belonging to the chemoconnectome (CCT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Deng et al., 2019</xref>), play a critical role in regulation of the female receptivity. To explore the factors that regulate virgin female receptivity especially during neurodevelopment, we screened 108 chemoconnectome (CCT) knock-out lines generated by the CRISPR-Cas9 system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Deng et al., 2019</xref>) (unpublished data). The result showed that prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) might regulate virgin female receptivity. The deletion mutant <italic>ΔPtth</italic> removed part of the 5’ UTR and almost all coding sequence and is a protein null (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>). We confirmed the PTTH knock-out flies by using PCR analysis at the PTTH locus in genomic DNA samples (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>), by using RT-PCR to identify the loss of PTTH transcripts in cDNA samples (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>) and by detecting the immunoreactivity of PTTH in the central brain (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref></bold>). Primers used are listed in <bold>Supplementary File 1</bold>. PTTH immunoreactivity was found in the brain of wild-type and heterozygous flies (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> H1 and H3</bold>), but was absent in homozygous <italic>ΔPtth</italic> flies (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H2</xref></bold>). As the previous study, the <italic>ΔPtth</italic> larvae lacking PTTH undergo metamorphosis with about 1 day delay compared with the wild type control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Shimell et al., 2018</xref>) (data not shown). Besides, the <italic>ΔPtth</italic> adult male and female flies had the significant increased weight than wild type flies (<bold><xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref></bold>). This is also consistent with that PTTH regulates developmental timing and body size in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Mcbrayer et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Shimell et al., 2018</xref>).</p>

<p>To confirm the function of PTTH, we tested virgin female receptivity of <italic>ΔPtth</italic> female flies. We found that the virgin female losing PTTH had significantly higher copulation rate and shorter latency to copulation than wild type flies (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 D-G</xref></bold>). In addition, the <italic>ΔPtth</italic> flies had higher copulation rate and lower latency to copulation compared to heterozygous null mutant females within 2 days (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 D-E</xref></bold>) and within 3 days, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 D-F</xref></bold>). The enhanced virgin female receptivity had no relationship either with the attractivity or with the locomotion activity of virgin females (<bold><xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1— figure supplement 1B</xref>-D</bold>). These results suggested that PTTH participates in virgin female receptivity in a dose-dependent manner.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we carried out genetic rescue experiments to further confirm the function of PTTH in modulating virgin female receptivity. We used the pan-neuronal driver elavGAL4 to drive UAS-PTTH expression in PTTH mutant background. We detected the PTTH signals using PTTH antibody in the rescued female brains (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H4</xref></bold>). We found that neuron-specific expression of PTTH could restore the enhanced copulation rate and shorter latency to copulation in <italic>ΔPtth</italic> virgin females (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref></bold>). These results confirmed that PTTH modulates virgin female receptivity.</p>

<p>Most identified neurons associated with female sexual behaviors express <italic>doublesex</italic> gene. We asked whether PG neurons are a part of the doublesex circuitry or not. Double labeling of dsxLexA and PtthGAL4 neurons (LexAop-tomato,UAS- stingerGFP/PtthLexA;dsxGAL4/+) revealed that PG neurons are all doublesex-positive (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>). We then used an intersectional strategy to visualize overlapped expression between dsxLexA and PtthGAL4 (UAS &gt; stop &gt; myrGFP/+;LexAop2-FlpL,dsxLexA/PtthGAL4). We observed all PG neurons with GFP signals (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></bold>). These results suggested that PG neurons are dsx<sup>+</sup> neurons.</p>
<p>We then analyzed whether PG neurons are involved in the modulation of virgin female receptivity. First, we activated PG neurons transiently in adult virgin females by driving the temperature-sensitive activator dTrpA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hamada et al., 2008</xref>) using PtthGAL4. PG neurons were activated at 29°C compared with the control treatment at 23°C. No significantly different copulation rate or latency to copulation was detected (<bold><xref rid="fig2s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2— figure supplement 3A-C</xref></bold>). This suggested that PG neurons do not regulate virgin female receptivity during the adult stage.</p>
<p>To identify the detail time for the function of PG neurons in virgin female receptivity, we inactivated PG neurons through kir2.1 under the control of the temporal and regional gene expression targeting system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">McGuire et al., 2004</xref>). The inactivation of PG neurons during larval stage enhanced virgin female copulation rate significantly (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref></bold>). However, when PG neurons were inactivated during pupal or adult stages, virgin female copulation rate did not change significantly (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 F-G</xref></bold>). Furthermore, we activated PG neurons at different stages overlapping the postembryonic larval developmental time using dTrpA1 (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). Stage 1 was from the 1<sup>st</sup>-instar larvae to six hours before the 3<sup>rd</sup>-instar larvae. Stage 2 was from six hours before the 3<sup>rd</sup>-instar larvae to the end of the wandering larvae. Stage 3 was from the end of wandering larvae to the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup> day of the pupal stage. Stage 4 was from the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup> day of the pupal stage to the eclosion of adults. The copulation rate did not change significantly when activating PG neurons during the stage 1, stage 3 or stage 4 (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref></bold>). However, we found the significant lower copulation rate and the longer latency to copulation only when PG neurons were activated during the stage 2 (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref></bold>). The defected copulation was not due to a lower locomotion activity of virgin females (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref></bold>). Taken together, our findings indicated that the activity of dsx<sup>+</sup> PG neurons negatively regulate virgin female receptivity during the stage from the start of the 3<sup>rd</sup>-instar to the end of wandering stage.</p>

<title>Ecdysone receptor EcR-A in pC1 neurons regulates virgin female copulation rate</title>
<p>Given that PTTH regulates virgin female receptivity through ecdysone which acts on its receptor EcR, we then asked that whether ecdysone regulates the function of neurons associated with virgin female receptivity through EcR. pC1 and vpoDN neurons are two main dsx<sup>+</sup> neurons involved in virgin female receptivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). pC1 neurons encode the mating status of female flies, vpoDN neurons regulate the opening of vaginal plate when females attend to accept males. EcR-A and EcR-B1 are the two prominently expressed ecdysone receptors in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Riddiford et al., 2000</xref>). First, we tested the expression of EcR-A and EcR-B1 in these two neurons on the 2<sup>nd</sup> day of the pupal stage when ecdysone functions as the main mover in the metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dalton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Truman et al., 1994</xref>). The GFP signals labeled by pC1-ss2-GAL4 and vpoDN-ss1-GAL4 were merged well with the signals of both EcR-A and EcR-B1 antibodies respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 —figure supplement 1</xref></bold>). This revealed that EcR-A and EcR-B1 express in both pC1 and vpoDN neurons. We then tested the function of EcR in pC1 and vpoDN neurons through reducing the expression of EcR-A and EcR-B1 respectively. We used the split GAL4 for pC1 and vpoDN neurons to drive the UAS-EcR-RNAi. First, we reduced the expression of all EcR isoforms in pC1 neurons, this decreased the copulation rate and prolonged the latency to copulation significantly (<bold><xref rid="fig5s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 —figure supplement 2A</xref></bold>). Furthermore, we reduced the expression of EcR-A in pC1 neurons. The virgin female had the significant lower copulation rate and longer latency to copulation (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold>). The reduced copulation rate had no relationship with the attractivity (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref></bold>) and the locomotion activity of virgin females (<bold><xref rid="fig5s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 —figure supplement 2B</xref></bold>). When reducing the expression of EcR-B1 in pC1 neurons, virgin females had the significant longer latency to copulation but the comparable copulation rate to controls (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref></bold>). However, reducing the expression of EcR-A (<bold><xref rid="fig5s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 —figure supplement 3</xref> A-C</bold>) and EcR-B1 (<bold><xref rid="fig5s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 5— figure supplement 3 D-F</xref></bold>) using three split vpoDNGAL4s in vpoDN neurons all did not affect virgin female receptivity. This suggested that the expression of EcR-A in pC1 neurons regulates virgin female copulation rate, but EcR isoforms in vpoDN neurons do not modulate virgin female receptivity.</p>

<p>Two split-GAL4 drivers for pC1 neurons had been obtained previously. pC1-ss1-GAL4 labels pC1-a, c and -e neurons, and pC1-ss2-GAL4 labels all pC1-a, -b, -c, -d and -e neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Wang et al., 2020b</xref>). We also tested virgin female receptivity when EcR-A or EcR-B1 were reduced in pC1-a, -c and -e neurons simultaneously using pC1-ss1-GAL4 respectively. While the copulation rate or the latency to copulation did not change significantly (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 C-D</xref></bold>). This suggested that, pC1b and/or pC1d neurons are necessary for the functions of EcR-A and EcR-B1 in pC1 neurons on virgin female receptivity. Whether pC1d is involved in the regulation of female receptivity is uncertain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Deutsch et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Schretter et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Taisz et al., 2023</xref>). However, when reducing EcR-A in pC1d neurons alone using the specific split GAL4 SS56987 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Schretter et al., 2020</xref>), virgin female receptivity including copulation rate and latency to copulation did not change significantly compared with controls (<bold><xref rid="fig5s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 —figure supplement 4</xref></bold>). These results suggested that the function of EcR-A in pC1b neurons is necessary for virgin female copulation rate.</p>
<p>As recently mated females may reduce sexual receptivity and increase egg laying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Avila et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kubli, 2003</xref>). we asked whether the decreased copulation rate induced by EcR-A could be a post-mating response and correlate with elevated egg laying. To address this, we examined the number of eggs laid by virgin females when EcR-A was reduced in pC1 neurons. We found that manipulation of EcR-A did not enhance egg laying significantly in virgin females (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref></bold>). Meanwhile, we further analyzed whether reduction of EcR-A in pC1 neurons regulates the opening of vaginal plate (VPO) or the ovipositor extrusion (OE). We found that reducing the EcR-A expression in pC1 neurons lead to the significantly less VPO and more OE (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 G-H</xref></bold>). These results suggested that reduced EcR-A expression in pC1 neurons results in the similar phenotype to that of mated females.</p>

<title>EcR-A participates in the morphological development of pC1 neurons</title>
<p>EcR isoforms have distinct temporal and spatial expression patterns in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Riddiford et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Truman et al., 1994</xref>). It is unknown when EcR-A functions in pC1 neurons for virgin female receptivity. Thus, we examined virgin female receptivity when EcR-A expression was conditionally reduced through RNAi via the pC1-ss2-GAL4 under the control of the temporal and regional gene expression targeting system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">McGuire et al., 2004</xref>). EcR-A was reduced during the larval, pupal and adult stage respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 I-K</xref></bold>). Only during the pupal stage, reducing EcR-A made the significant lower copulation rate and longer latency to copulation (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref></bold>). The result suggested that EcR-A in pC1 neurons plays a role in virgin female receptivity during metamorphosis. This is consistent with that PTTH regulates virgin female receptivity before the start of metamorphosis which is around the puparium formation.</p>
<p>We then tested how EcR-A functions in pC1 neurons to modulate virgin female receptivity. First, we tested the morphology of pC1 neurons when reducing the expression of EcR-A in pC1 neurons. We found that the morphology of pC1 neurons appeared after the formation of the white pupa (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>1</bold>). The reduced EcR-A expression induced the more elaborated morphologies of the pC1-d/e cells, especially the extra vertical projection (EVP) near the midline of brains (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 B-D</xref></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Deutsch et al., 2020</xref>). These changes exhibited from the second day of the pupal stage (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 B1-B2</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6E</xref></bold>) and maintained at the adult stage (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 D1-D2</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref></bold>). Meanwhile, the number of pC1 cell bodies in adult flies when EcR-A was reduced were the same as that of wild type flies (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref></bold>). Previous studies suggested that pC1d cells serve as a hub within the central brain for dsx<sup>+</sup> and fru<sup>+</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Deutsch et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, the unnormal development of pC1d neurons may induce the changes between pC1d neurons and other dsx<sup>+</sup> and fru<sup>+</sup> neurons to affect associated behaviors.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we asked whether reduced female copulation rate was due to that EcR-A expression affected the activity of pC1 neurons. Because all pC1 cells characterized so far project to the lateral junction of the lateral protocerebral complex (LPC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kimura et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Rezával et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Wang et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Wu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>), we expressed GCamp6s in all pC1 neurons and tested the calcium signals in the lateral junction of LPC when EcR-A was knocked down (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D1-D2</xref></bold>). Reduced EcR-A did not induce significantly different calcium responses in the LPC (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref></bold>). Thus, our results suggested that the decreased female copulation rate induced by reduced EcR-A in pC1 neurons was mainly due to the morphological changes of pC1b neurons, which then modulate the connections of pC1b neurons with other neurons.</p>

<p>The gene encoding dopamine beta-monooxygenase (DBM) was the top most down-regulated gene (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7 A-B</xref></bold>). The mammal homolog of DBM is monooxygenase DBH-like 1 (Moxd1). Moxd1 has the similar structure as the mammal dopamine β- hydroxylase (DBH) which is the enzyme for transition from dopamine to norepinephrine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Park et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Prigge et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Vendelboe et al., 2016</xref>). This implied that DBM is probably related to the dopamine metabolism. It will be interesting to study the function of DBM in virgin female receptivity. Besides, CG30428 protein was also down-regulated (<bold>Supplementary File 2)</bold>. It is predicted to be active in nucleus, suggesting its role in gene expression and cellular metabolism. This is consistent with that reduction of EcR- A in pC1 neurons induced the unnormal anatomical morphology of pC1 neurons, which may due to the unnormal cell death and cellular differentiation during development.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we found that peptide hormone PTTH modulates virgin female receptivity through ecdysone during neural maturation. PG neurons expressing PTTH are doublesex-positive and regulate virgin female receptivity during the 3<sup>rd</sup>-instar larval stage. Furthermore, ecdysone receptor EcR-A functions in pC1 neurons to regulate virgin female copulation rate during the metamorphosis mainly through modulating the anatomical morphology of pC1b neurons. Taken together, our results identified the function of PTTH-ecdysone and their downstream pathway, EcR-A in pC1 neurons, on regulating virgin female copulation rate during neural maturation mainly through modulating the morphology of pC1b neurons.</p>
<p>Our results suggested a regulatory role of PTTH in virgin female receptivity. Even though insects and mammals represent highly diverged classes, insects have evolved a similar strategy for triggering the juvenile–adult transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Herbison, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Pan et al., 2019</xref>). The juvenile–adult transition involves the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axis in mammals and the PG axis in insects. Among the neurons belonging to the axis, PG neurons and GnRH neurons have the similar function to stimulate the PG gland and pituitary gland to release hormones which trigger maturation, respectively. It will be interesting to study the function of GnRH neurons in the mammal sexual behaviors. Most of neurons regulating sexual behaviors in female flies are dsx<sup>+</sup> neurons. Our results showed that PG neurons are also dsx<sup>+</sup> neurons. This suggested that PG neurons have relationships with other dsx<sup>+</sup> neurons and the juvenile–adult transition is regulated by <italic>doublesex</italic> gene.</p>
<p>In our study, PTTH regulates virgin female receptivity in an ecdysone-dependent manner before the peak of ecdysone for the metamorphosis. Ecdysone functions through its receptor EcR which is involved in all phases of the nervous system development. Previous studies have demonstrated that the fru<sup>+</sup> neuron development need EcR-A in male <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Furthermore, reduced EcR-A in fru<sup>+</sup> neurons induced the male-male courtship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dalton et al., 2009</xref>). In females, we detected the expression of EcR-A and EcR-B1 in both dsx<sup>+</sup> pC1 and dsx<sup>+</sup> vpoDN neurons. However, EcR regulates virgin female receptivity in pC1 neurons but not in vpoDN neurons. This may due to that EcR does not regulate the morphology of vpoDN neurons and thus the synaptic connections with other neurons. Alternatively, EcR regulates the morphology of vpoDN neurons without changing functional connectivity or gene expressions within associated neurons. It is worth noting that the losing of PTTH resulted in the enhanced virgin female receptivity, which is contrary to the reduced receptivity when knocking down EcR-A in pC1 neurons. This may due to that 20E and EcR regulates multiple neurodevelopment associated with virgin female receptivity when PTTH is knocked out, but not only functions in pC1 neurons. This may also due to that PTTH mutant results in increased EcR expression in pC1 neurons.</p>
<p>Reduced EcR-A expression in all pC1 neurons lead to the decreased copulation rate, while reduced EcR-A in pC1-a, c and e simultaneously did not reduce the copulation rate significantly. This suggested that EcR-A plays the critical role in pC1-b or/and -d neurons for regulating virgin female receptivity. Our results revealed that reduced EcR- A induced the more elaborated morphologies of pC1d neurons. Previous studies detected the synaptic connections between the axons of pC1d and the dendrites of DNp13 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Deutsch et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Mezzera et al., 2020</xref>). DNp13 neurons are command neurons for ovipositor extrusion. When females extruded, the ovipositor physically impedes copulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Mezzera et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Wang et al., 2020a</xref>). However, reduced EcR-A expression in pC1d neurons did not affect virgin female receptivity (<bold><xref rid="fig5s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 —figure supplement 4</xref></bold>). This might be due to three possibilities. First, the more elaborated morphologies of pC1d neurons did not affect synaptic connections between pC1d and DNp13 neurons. Second, the unchanged pC1 neural activity could not affect the neural activity of DNp13 neurons. Third, the morphological change of pC1d neurons is not sufficient for the decreased copulation rate. To sum, these suggest that the morphological change of pC1b neurons is necessary for the decreased copulation rate. However, due to the lack of pC1b drivers, we could not rule out morphological changes in pC1b neurons when EcR-A was reduced.</p>
<p>We identified DBM as the mostly down-regulated gene when EcR-A was reduced in pC1 neurons. DBM is the insect homolog of MOXd1 in mammals. However, the function of MOXd1 has not been identified but is predicted to hydroxylate a hydrophobic substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Xin et al., 2004</xref>). The similar structure between MOXd1 and dopamine beta-monooxygenase in mammals suggests the possible role of DBM in dopamine metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cubells et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kim et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Timmers et al., 2004</xref>). Besides, previous study identified the Moxd1 as a useful marker for the sexually dimorphic nuclei and may be involved in the regulation of sex-biased physiology and behaviors in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Tsuneoka et al., 2017</xref>). These make it interesting to further study on the molecular mechanism by which DBM and Moxd1 regulate sexual behaviors in flies and mammals respectively.</p>
<p>Taken together, this study demonstrates that the peptide hormone PTTH, expresses in dsx<sup>+</sup> PG neurons, regulates virgin female receptivity during neural maturation. It also revealed that the morphological development of pC1b neurons regulated by EcR-A is necessary for virgin female copulation rate. This work extends the understanding of how neurodevelopmental processes regulate adult sexual behavior.</p>

<title>Behavioral assays</title>
<p>Flies were reared at 25°C and 60% humidity under a 12 hr light:12 hr dark cycle. Virgin females and wild-type males were collected upon eclosion, placed in groups of 12 flies each and aged 4–6 days (except for the assays for PTTH mutant on different days after eclosion, and the molecular rescue assay for the 24h-old females) before carrying out behavioral assay except for the transient thermogenetic experiments. Female receptivity assays were conducted as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Wang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). A virgin female of defined genotype and a wild type male were gently cold anesthetized and respectively introduced into two layers of the courtship chambers separated by a removable transparent film. The flies were allowed to recover for at least 45 min before the film was removed to allow the pair of flies to contact. The mating behavior was recorded using a camera (Canon VIXIA HF R500) for 30 min at 17 fps for further analysis.</p>
<p>For transient activation experiment by dTrpA1 in adult stage, flies were reared at 23°C. Flies were loaded into courtship chamber and recovered for at least 30 min at 23°C, then were placed at 23°C (control group) or 29°C (experimental group) for 30 min prior to removing the film and videotaping. For activation experiment by dTrpA1 during development, flies were reared at 29°C during the specific stages compared with the controls who were reared at 23°C all the time. Flies were loaded into courtship chamber and recovered for at least 45 min at 23°C prior to removing the film and videotaping.</p>

<title>Quantification and statistical analysis of female receptivity behavior</title>
<p>Two parameters including copulation rate and latency to copulation were used to characterize receptivity and we got the data sets of two parameters from the same flies. The time from removing the film to successful copulation was measured for each female. The number of females that had engaged in copulation by the end of each 1 min interval within 30 min were summed and plotted as a percentage of successful copulation. The latency to copulation was the time from removing the film to successful copulation. All the time points that female successfully copulated were manually analyzed and the data of unhealthy flies were discarded.</p>

<title>Temporally restricted RNAi</title>
<p>tub-GAL80<sup>ts</sup> crosses were reared at either 18°C for control groups or 30°C for experimental groups. Virgin females were collected at eclosion and were placed in groups of 12 flies each and aged 4–6 days before carrying out behavior assay. Assays were tested at 23°C.</p>

<title>Vaginal plate opening and ovipositor extrusion</title>
<p>A virgin female of defined genotype and a wild type male were aspirated into the courtship chambers and respectively introduced into two layers of the courtship chambers separated by a removable transparent film. The flies were allowed to recover for 30 min before the film was removed. To allow visualization of vaginal plate opening, we recorded uncompressed image sequences at 896 x 896 pixels and 50 frames per second using a Photron Mini AX camera (Photron) with an AF-S VR Micro-Nikkor 105mm lens (Nikon). Instances of vaginal plate opening and ovipositor extrusion were scored blind to genotype from frame by-frame playback during the first 5 min of courtship or until copulation if it occurred within 5 min. Courtship initiation was defined as the male orienting toward and beginning to follow the female. Rare trials with fewer than 30 s of total courtship were discarded.</p>

<title>Locomotion assays</title>
<p>The rearing and experimental conditions in locomotion assays were the same as that in the corresponding female receptivity assays, excepting that individual females were loaded in the chambers without males. Spontaneous movements of the flies were recorded with a camera (Canon VIXIA HF R500) for 30 min at 30 fps for further analysis. The activity of flies during the middle 10 min was analyzed to calculate the average walking speed using Ctrax software.</p>

<p>Summary: This article explores the role of Ecdysone in regulating female sexual receptivity in Drosophila. The researchers found that PTTH, throughout its role as a positive regulator of ecdysone production, negatively affects the receptivity of adult virgin females. Indeed, loss of larval PTTH before metamorphosis significantly increases female receptivity right after adult eclosion and also later. However, during metamorphic neurodevelopment, Ecdysone, primarily through its receptor EcR-A, is required to properly develop the P1 neurons since its silencing led to morphological changes associated with a reduction in adult female receptivity. Nonetheless, the result shown in this manuscript sheds light on how Ecdysone plays a dual role in female adult receptivity, inhibiting it during larval development and enhancing it during metamorphic development. Unfortunately, this dual and opposite effect in two temporally different developmental stages has not been highlighted or explained.</p>
<p>Strengths: This paper exhibits multiple strengths in its approach, employing a well-structured experimental methodology that combines genetic manipulations, behavioral assays, and molecular analysis to explore the impact of Ecdysone on regulating virgin female receptivity in Drosophila. The study provides clear and substantial findings, highlighting that removing PTTH, a positive Ecdysone regulator, increases virgin female receptivity. Additionally, the research expands into the temporal necessity of PTTH and Ecdysone function during development.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
There are two important caveats with the data that are reflecting a weakness:</p>
<p>1-Contradictory Effects of Ecdysone and PTTH: One notable weakness in the data is the contrasting effects observed between Ecdysone and its positive regulator PTTH. PTTH loss of function increases female receptivity, while ecdysone loss of function reduces it. Given that PTTH positively regulates Ecdysone, one would expect that the loss of function of both would result in a similar phenotype or at least a consistent directional change.</p>
<p>2- Discordant Temporal Requirements for Ecdysone and PTTH: Another weakness lies in the different temporal requirements for Ecdysone and PTTH. The data from the manuscript suggest that PTTH is necessary during the larval stage, as shown in Figure 2 E-G, while Ecdysone is required during the pupal stage, as indicated in Figure 5 I-K. Ecdysone is a crucial developmental hormone with precisely regulated expression throughout development, exhibiting several peaks during both larval and pupal stages. PTTH is known to regulate Ecdysone during the larval stage, specifically by stimulating the kinetics of Ecdysone peaking at the wandering stage. However, it remains unclear whether pupal PTTH, expressed at higher levels during metamorphosis, can stimulate Ecdysone production during the pupal stage. Additionally, given the transient nature of the Ecdysone peak produced at wandering time, which disappears shortly before the end of the prepupal stage, it is challenging to infer that larval PTTH will regulate Ecdysone production during the pupal stage based on the current state of knowledge in the neuroendocrine field.</p>
<p>Considering these two caveats, the results suggest that the authors are witnessing distinct temporal and directional effects of Ecdysone on virgin female receptivity.</p>

<p>Summary: The authors tried to identify novel adult functions of the classical Drosophila juvenile-adult transition axis (i.e. ptth-ecdysone). Surprisingly, larval ptth-expressing neurons expressed the sex-specific doublesex gene, thus belonging to the sexual dimorphic circuit. Lack of ptth during late larval development caused enhanced female sexual receptivity, an effect rescued by supplying ecdysone in the food. Among many other cellular players, pC1 neurons control receptivity by encoding the mating status of females. Interestingly, during metamorphosis, a subtype of pC1 neurons required Ecdysone Receptor A in order to regulate such female receptivity. A transcriptomic analysis using pC1-specific Ecdyone signaling down-regulation gives some hints of possible downstream mechanisms.</p>
<p>Strengths: the manuscript showed solid genetic evidence that lack of ptth during development caused enhanced copulation rate in female flies, which includes ptth mutant rescue experiments by over-expressing ptth as well as by adding ecdysone-supplemented food. They also present elegant data dissecting the temporal requirements of ptth-expressing neurons by shifting animals from non-permissive to permissive temperatures, in order to inactivate neuronal function (although not exclusively ptth function). By combining different drivers together with a EcR-A RNAi line authors also identified the Ecdysone receptor requirements of a particular subtype of pC1 neurons during metamorphosis. Convincing live calcium imaging showed no apparent effect of EcR-A in neural activity, although some effect on morphology is uncovered. Finally, bulk RNAseq shows differential gene expression after EcR-A down-regulation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: the paper has three main weaknesses. The first one refers to temporal requirements of ptth and ecdysone signaling. Whereas ptth is necessary during larval development, the ecdysone effect appears during pupal development. ptth induces ecdysone synthesis during larval development but there is no published evidence about a similar role for ptth during pupal stages. Furthermore, larval and pupal ecdysone functions are different (triggering metamorphosis vs tissue remodeling). The second caveat is the fact that ptth and ecdysone loss-of-function experiments render opposite effects (enhancing and decreasing copulation rates, respectively). The most plausible explanation is that both functions are independent of each other, also suggested by differential temporal requirements. Finally, in order to identify the effect in the transcriptional response of down-regulating EcR-A in a very small population of neurons, a scRNAseq study should have been performed instead of bulk RNAseq.</p>
<p>In summary, despite the authors providing convincing evidence that ptth and ecdysone signaling pathways are involved in female receptivity, the main claim that ptth regulates this process through ecdysone is not supported by results. More likely, they'd rather be independent processes.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This manuscript shows that mutations that disable the gene encoding the PTTH gene cause an increase in female receptivity (they mate more quickly), a phenotype that can be reversed by feeding these mutants the molting hormone, 20-hydoxyecdysone (20E). The use of an inducible system reveals that inhibition or activation of PTTH neurons during the larval stages increases and decreases female receptivity, respectively, suggesting that PTTH is required during the larval stages to affect the receptivity of the (adult) female fly. Showing that these neurons express the sex-determining gene dsx leads the authors to show that interfering with 20E actions in pC1 neurons, which are dsx-positive neurons known to regulate female receptivity, reduces female receptivity and increases the arborization pattern of pC1 neurons. The work concludes by showing that targeted knockdown of EcRA in pC1 neurons causes 527 genes to be differentially expressed in the brains of female flies, of which 123 passed a false discovery rate cutoff of 0.01; interestingly, the gene showing the greatest down-regulation was the gene encoding dopamine beta-monooxygenase.</p>
<p>Stengths</p>
<p>
This is an interesting piece of work, which may shed light on the basis for the observation noted previously that flies lacking PTTH neurons show reproductive defects (&quot;... females show reduced fecundity&quot;; McBrayer, 2007; DOI 10.1016/j.devcel.2007.11.003).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
There are some results whose interpretation seem ambiguous and findings whose causal relationship is implied but not demonstrated.</p>
<p>
1- At some level, the findings reported here are not at all surprising. Since 20E regulates the profound changes that occur in the central nervous system (CNS) during metamorphosis, it is not surprising that PTTH would play a role in this process. Although animals lacking PTTH (rather paradoxically) live to adulthood, they do show greatly extended larval instars and a corresponding great delay in the 20E rise that signals the start of metamorphosis. For this reason, concluding that PTTH plays a SPECIFIC role in regulating female receptivity seems a little misleading, since the metamorphic remodeling of the entire CNS is likely altered in PTTH mutants. Since these mutants produce overall normal (albeit larger--due to their prolonged larval stages) adults, these alterations are likely to be subtle. Courtship has been reported as one defect expressed by animals lacking PTTH neurons, but this behavior may stand out because reduced fertility and increased male-male courtship (McBrayer, 2007) would be noticeable defects to researchers handling these flies. By contrast, detecting defects in other behaviors (e.g., optomotor responses, learning and memory, sleep, etc) would require closer examination. For this reason, I would ask the authors to temper their statement that PTTH is SPECIFICALLY involved in regulating female receptivity.</p>
<p>
2- The link between PTTH and the role of pC1 neurons in regulating female receptivity is not clear. Again, since 20E controls the metamorphic changes that occur in the CNS, it is not surprising that 20E would regulate the arborization of pC1 neurons. And since these neurons have been implicated in female receptivity, it would therefore be expected that altering 20E signaling in pC1 neurons would affect this phenotype. However, this does not mean that the defects in female receptivity expressed by PTTH mutants are due to defects in pC1 arborization. For this, the authors would at least have to show that PTTH mutants show the changes in pC1 arborization shown in Fig. 6. And even then the most that could be said is that the changes observed in these neurons &quot;may contribute&quot; to the observed behavioral changes. Indeed, the changes observed in female receptivity may be caused by PTTH/20E actions on different neurons.</p>

3- Some of the results need commenting on, or refining, or revising:</p>
<p>
a- For some assays PTTH behaves sometimes like a recessive gene and at other times like a semi-dominant, and yet at others like a dominant gene. For instance, in Fig. 1D-G, PTTH[-]/+ flies behave like wildtype (D), express an intermediate phenotype (E-F), or behave like the mutant (G). This may all be correct but merits some comment.</p>
<p>
b- Some of the conclusions are overstated. i) Although Fig. 2E-G does show that silencing the PTTH neurons during the larval stages affects copulation rate (E) the strength of the conclusion is tempered by the behavior of one of the controls (tub-GAL80[ts]/+, UAS-Kir2.1/+) in panels F and G, where it behaves essentially the same as the experimental group (and quite differently from the PTTH-GAL4/+ control; blue line).(Incidentally, the corresponding copulation latency should also be shown for these data.). ii) For Fig. 5I-K, the conclusion stated is that &quot;Knock-down of EcR-A during pupal stage significantly decreased the copulation rate.&quot; Although strictly correct, the problem is that panel J is the only one for which the behavior of the control lacking the RNAi is not the same as that of the experimental group. Thus, it could just be that when the experiment was done at the pupal stage is the only situation when the controls were both different from the experimental. Again, the results shown in J are strictly speaking correct but the statement is too definitive given the behavior of one of the controls in panels I and K. Note also that panel F shows that the UAS-RNAi control causes a massive decrease in female fertility, yet no mention is made of this fact.</p>
