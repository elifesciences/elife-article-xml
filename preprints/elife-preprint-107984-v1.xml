<abstract><p>The stromal compartment of many solid tumors plays a critical role in shaping an immunosuppressive microenvironment that limits the effectiveness of immune-based therapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Among stromal constituents, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have emerged as key regulators of antitumor immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Here, we identify a distinct subset of CAFs in both murine and human stroma-rich cancers that secrete osteoprotegerin (OPG)— a soluble decoy receptor that neutralizes receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), both of which are involved in T cell function. In vitro, OPG directly impairs CD8⁺ T cell-mediated killing of target cells. In murine models of pancreatic and breast cancer, antibody-mediated blockade of OPG promotes robust immune infiltration into the tumor microenvironment, leading to significant tumor regression. Stromal profiling revealed that OPG blockade induces a shift in CAF cells—reducing immunosuppressive OPG⁺ fibroblasts while expanding interferon-responsive fibroblasts, thus recalibrating the tumor stroma toward a pro-immunogenic landscape. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized mechanism of stromal immune suppression and highlight OPG as a stromal immune checkpoint controlling CD8⁺ T cell infiltration. Targeting OPG may offer a novel therapeutic strategy to convert immunologically “cold” tumors into T cell-infiltrated, tumor microenvironment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cancer cells induce alterations in the tissue microenvironment in which they grow, and the relationship between cancer and its microenvironment evolves throughout the life history of a tumor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. There has been considerable interest in understanding the relationship between the stroma and tumor-infiltrating immune cells, and emerging evidence suggests that the stromal compartment creates an immunosuppressive microenvironment that can also affect responsiveness to immunotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. More recently, one cell type in the tumor microenvironment (TME), cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF), have been prominently investigated <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. CAFs are not only a direct source of growth factors, but they can also release these factors via proteolysis of the extracellular matrix remodeling (ECM) by secreting the necessary proteases supporting primary tumor growth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. The landscape of CAFs has been extensively profiled using a variety of techniques, such as single-cell RNA-seq and flow cytometry, across several mouse tumor models and human malignancies to uncover functionally distinct populations of CAFs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. This has led to the increased recognition that CAFs are heterogeneous cell populations within the TME, and distinct subtypes play divergent roles, from supporting tumor growth to tumor-restraining functions – highlighting the limitations of designing nonspecific therapies broadly targeting all CAFs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in solid tumors are functionally heterogeneous and can be broadly classified into two major subtypes: inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs) and myofibroblastic CAFs (myCAFs). iCAFs are characterized by secretion of inflammatory cytokines and growth factors and are driven primarily by NF-κB signaling; they often reside distally from tumor cells and are thought to promote immunosuppression via recruitment of myeloid cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. In contrast, myCAFs exhibit high expression of α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) and ECM components, are induced by TGF-β signaling, and are typically located adjacent to tumor nests, where they contribute to tissue stiffness and immune exclusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. However, it remains unclear whether CAFs interact directly with immune cells to directly modulate adaptive immune-suppressive responses, and how we can harness the molecular mechanisms mediating this process to treat cold tumors.</p>
<p>Here, we identify a subset of inflammatory cancer-associated fibroblasts (iCAFs) characterized by the expression and secretion of osteoprotegerin (OPG; Tnfrsf11b), a soluble decoy receptor for TRAIL and RANKL. We show that iCAF-derived OPG directly impairs CD8⁺ T cell cytotoxic function via interference with TRAIL signaling. Using both genetic and antibody-mediated approaches to block OPG in murine models of pancreatic and breast cancer, we demonstrate that inhibition of this stromal-derived immune suppressive factor markedly enhances T cell infiltration and promotes tumor regression. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism of fibroblast-mediated immune evasion and highlight OPG as a stromal immune checkpoint that may be therapeutically targeted to overcome immune exclusion in stroma-rich, treatment-resistant cancers.</p>

<title>Identification of osteoprotegerin (OPG)-secreting iCAFs</title>
<p>To probe stromal-immune interactions we first investigated an orthotopic breast cancer model using the GFP-labelled tumor cell line EO771 in C57BL/6J mice, as this immunocompetent neoplastic model is well established for interrogating the role of stromal-immune interactions during tumor growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. To characterize the stromal microenvironment, tumors isolated on day 24 after implantation were subjected to flow cytometry sorting (GFP<sup>-</sup>CD45<sup>-</sup>), and scRNA-seq of the sorted stromal cells was performed using the Chromium (10X genomics) platform (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). We excluded any remnant immune, endothelial and tumor cells, while using <italic>Pdgfr</italic> expression to selectively identify mesenchymal derived stromal cells. These stromal cells were clustered based on their individual transcriptomes and visualized by UMAP projection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). Using known gene markers, two distinct clusters that shared characteristics of CAF markers for fibroblasts, collagen deposition, and ECM were identified (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B, C</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1A, B</xref>). One of these clusters showed high expression of myofibroblast protein α-smooth muscle actin (gene <italic>Acta2</italic>) and <italic>Pdgfrβ,</italic> suggesting a myofibroblastic origin and were assigned as myCAFs based on widely used nomenclature (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C, D</xref>). The other CAF cluster was marked by high expression of <italic>Periostin</italic> (<italic>Postn</italic>) and the absence of <italic>Acta2</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. We also observed that a large fraction of the cells within this cluster displayed expression of cytokines such as IL33, chemokines such as Cxcl5, Cxcl12 and extracellular remodeling factors such as Mmp2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B, C, D</xref>). This combination of gene expression was reminiscent of a signature associated with activated fibroblasts or senescent cells, and based on previous nomenclature referred this Postn<sup>+</sup> <italic>Acta2</italic><sup>-</sup> cluster as iCAFs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Of note, the Postn<sup>+</sup> cluster is not homogenous, and only subset of cells within this cluster are post-mitotic (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1C, D</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. One key cytokine highly and uniquely expressed in this iCAF population is <italic>Tnfrsf11b</italic>, a member of the Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). <italic>Tnfrsf11b encodes for a</italic> secreted protein osteoprotegerin (OPG) that binds to and inhibits both receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in cytotoxic T cells, to inhibit TRAIL-induced apoptosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. To establish whether OPG protein is directly secreted from CAFs, we next sorted CAFs from EO771 tumors using the scheme depicted (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>) and cultured them to collect conditioned media (CM). We detected high levels of OPG protein in CM from CAFs but failed to detect OPG from CM of epithelial and endothelial cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>). We also detected high levels of OPG from CM in sorted CAFs from human tumor samples, suggesting that both mouse and human tumors contain populations of iCAFs that secrete OPG (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G</xref>).</p>

<p>To determine whether iCAFs in human stromagenic cancers also expressed TNFRSF11B, we analyzed stromal cells from human esophageal carcinoma using single-cell transcriptome sequencing from tumor samples and matched adjacent nonmalignant tissues from 12 patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Multiple samples from each patient represented a path of progression from squamous epithelium through metaplasia, dysplasia to adenocarcinoma; to characterize the fibroblast cell diversity within samples, we performed integrated analysis restricted on this compartment across nonmalignant and tumor samples and identified five subclusters of fibroblasts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2A-C</xref>). Similar to the murine tumor model, in human esophageal carcinoma we identified cells with high expression of TNFRSF11B within the POSTN-expressing CAF cluster that also displayed expression of iCAF-characteristic transcripts, such as cytokines and chemokines (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). We also analyzed stromal cell populations from a publicly available single-cell RNA-seq dataset of 26 treatment-naïve breast tumors (ER+, HER2+, and TNBC) from Wu et al.

<title>OPG inhibits cytotoxic T-cell effector function</title>
<p>As OPG acts as a decoy protein that binds TRAIL and RANKL and inhibits its interaction with their corresponding receptors DR5 and RANK, we next explored whether OPG would directly interfere with immune mediated cytotoxic activity. Previous studies pointed to upregulation of TRAIL on the surface of T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. We first assessed whether CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells expressed TRAIL on the surface upon stimulation. Stimulation of effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, with CD3/CD28 antibodies led to a massive increase in cell-surface TRAIL expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2 E</xref>); and the activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was confirmed by increased IFN-γ secretion and proliferation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2 F, G</xref>). These results confirmed that TRAIL protein was upregulated on the cell surface of Teff cells upon activation. Similarly, stimulation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with CD3/CD28 antibodies led to an increase in cell-surface RANKL expression in a subset of cells that were activated as measured by CD69 upregulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2 H-J</xref>).</p>
<p>To directly gain insight into whether OPG can block TRAIL-mediated cytotoxic activity of T cells we employed an effector-target co-culture assay using a TRAIL-sensitive fibroblast like cell line, L929 as the target cells, and sorted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells as effector cells from the mouse spleen. The cytotoxicity mediated by the Teff cells was measured by ATP levels as a proxy for target cell death. Co-culture of unstimulated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with target cells did not result in cell death, however, when CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were stimulated with CD3/CD28 antibodies before co-culture, massive cytotoxicity activity was observed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2J</xref>). This cytotoxicity was dampened by the addition of recombinant OPG in a dose-dependent fashion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2J</xref>). To interrogate whether this same pathway operated in human cells we next assayed the ability of recombinant OPG protein to dampen the cytotoxic activity of human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs)-derived CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and found a similar dose-dependent effect (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2D-F</xref>).</p>

GFP labelled-EO771 cells injected into the mammary gland of female C57BL/6J mice were treated with either αOPG or isotype control IgG (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). Caliper measurements of the tumor size beginning two weeks after tumor injection showed that αOPG-treated mice displayed smaller tumors, and on average showed a 50% decrease in tumor size at the end of the four-week period (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). The tumors dissected from αOPG-treated mice showed a 40% reduction in tumor volume on average compared to the IgG-treated mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). To rule out off-target effects of αOPG and evaluate tumor growth kinetics and immune phenotype in the absence of OPG in the host, we next injected EO771 cells into female OPG-deficient and age-matched WT mice. Tumors in OPG-deficient (OPG KO) mice also grew more slowly and were reduced in volume compared to WT mice, recapitulating the phenotype seen in αOPG-treated mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). To address whether the OPG secreting cells were derived from locally by tumor cells or derived from bone marrow, we carried our bone marrow chimera experiments in which bone marrow from OPG KO or WT age- and sex-matched littermates were transplanted into irradiated C57BL6-CD45.1(CD45.1) mice. Six weeks after radiation, half million of EO771 cells were injected into the 4th mammary fat of CD45.1 recipient mice and tumor growth were measured. No difference in the tumor size was observed in between recipient mice that received transplanted cells were from OPG KO or WT mice. This experiment indicated that OPG secreting stromal cells were derived from derived from local tissue resident stromal cells and not from bone marrow.</p>

<p>Tumors from IgG- and αOPG-treated mice were dissociated and sorted into stromal (GFP<sup>-</sup> CD45<sup>-</sup>) and immune (GFP<sup>-</sup> CD45<sup>+</sup>) fractions and processed for scRNA-seq using the 10X platform (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F</xref>).

Instead, pathway enrichment analysis pointed to the upregulation of IFN-responsive genes for MHC proteins and MHC-related molecules, suggesting that pathways regulated by IFN, such as antigen processing and presentation, were potentiated in the tumor fibroblasts that originated from αOPG-treated mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3G</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3B</xref>).

<title>Blocking OPG enhances tumor infiltration and T cell effector function</title>
<p>The remodeling of the CAF landscape after αOPG-treatment, and in particular the appearance of a CAF subset with potential T-cell modulatory activity, prompted us to investigate the effect of αOPG-treatment on tumor T-cell infiltration (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4 A</xref>). Spectral flow cytometry demonstrated the paucity of immune infiltration observed in isotype-treated tumors, in contrast to an extensive immune infiltration seen in tumors after αOPG treatment that included over a four-fold increase in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). The significant increase in immune infiltration in tumors after αOPG treatment was not a result of changes in tumor size (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4SA</xref>), as these data were normalized to cell counts. We next examined the transcriptional changes in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) after αOPG treatment. UMAP density projection illustrated that CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> TILs that originate from control IgG treatment mice and αOPG-treated mice appeared to occupy distinct spaces representing distinct gene-expression programs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4B</xref>). Genes that control proximal signaling events downstream of the TCR, proliferation and T cell activation were upregulated in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> TILs that originate from αOPG-treated mice when compared to isotype control-treated mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4C</xref>).

<p>However, extensive evidence has shown that transcriptional characteristics do not always directly translate into functional capacities; to test TIL effector functionality more directly, we next assessed the ability of TILs to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines and release lytic granules (degranulation). We exposed single-cell suspensions of tumors from αOPG or isotype control mice to a cell-activation cocktail supplemented with Brefeldin A for four hours. Cells were subsequently stained for pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as perforin and granzymes indicative of cytotoxic function. Spectral flow analysis (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig S4D</xref>) showed that stimulation resulted in dramatic increases in the staining of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) in CD4<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>-</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from αOPG-treated mice compared to isotype controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D, E</xref>). In addition to these pro-inflammatory cytokines, we also observed an increase in release of lytic granules containing perforin A and granzyme B from αOPG-treated samples, indicating enhanced CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell effector function that could account for the tumor regression observed after treatment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4 D, E</xref>). Spectral flow analysis of the tumors from <italic>OPG-</italic>deficient and WT mice also showed increased infiltration of TILs and was consistent with that from αOPG-treated mice compared to isotype controls (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig S4E, F</xref>).</p>
<p>As OPG also plays important roles in bone remodeling, we additionally carried out trabecular bone analysis by microcomputed tomography (microCT) to evaluate bone loss over the course of αOPG and control IgG treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. After three weeks of treatment, no change was observed in trabecular bone volume/total bone volume (BV/TV) in αOPG treated mice compared to IgG-treated controls; we also measured bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP), a serum biomarker for bone remodeling; no difference in BALP in the serum of αOPG and IgG treated mice was observed (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig S4G, H</xref>). These data suggest that the three-week treatment of αOPG did not affect bone resorption or bone formation at detectable levels.</p>
<p>As CAFs that secrete OPG are present in several human stromagenic cancers, we next tested αOPG treatment in a pancreatic cancer model. FC1199 cells were implanted heterotopically into the flank of C57BL/6J mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>) and notably, the weights of tumors dissected from αOPG-treated mice showed a 30% reduction in tumor volume compared to IgG-treated controls (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). F1199 tumor cells were dissociated, and immune infiltration and effector function of TILs analyzed by spectral flow cytometry. A significant increase in immune infiltration was observed in tumors after αOPG treatment in contrast to isotype-treated tumors, and moreover, TILs from αOPG-treated mice demonstrated an increase in release of lytic granules containing perforin A and granzyme B, indicating enhanced CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell effector function similar to the results seen in the EO771 breast cancer model (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>).</p>

<p>To determine whether OPG secreted specifically from iCAFs was the main source of immune evasion, adipose-derived stromal cells isolated from either WT or OPG KO mice combined with FC1199 were implanted heterotopically into the flank of C57BL/6J mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>). In these tumors, the microenvironment would predominantly contain CAFs derived from the co-implanted adipose-derived stromal cells. Analysis of these tumors revealed that those containing OPG-deficient stromal cells exhibited approximately a 35% reduction in weight compared to tumors containing wild-type (WT) stromal cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>). Consistent with the tumor reduction, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells displayed a significant increase in cytokines and lytic granules in the tumor with OPG deficient stroma in comparison to tumor that contained WT-derived stromal cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F</xref>). These results are consistent with the notion that blocking OPG secretion from CAFs primarily contributes to TIL activation and infiltration and also consistent with the bone marrow chimera experiments (3E).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>It is increasingly recognized that immunosuppressive barriers within the tumor microenvironment are a major obstacle for checkpoint inhibitor and adoptive T-cell therapy in patients with solid tumors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. This work identifies a cancer-associated fibroblast subtype in the tumor microenvironment that secrete an immunoregulatory protein, OPG, that acts as a critical negative regulator of T-cell tumor infiltration and effector function. Antibody mediated blockade of OPG or its genetic deletion in host animals induces massive infiltration of T cells that were capable of augmented cytokine secretion and effector function. These broad changes in the immune landscape are likely due to the alterations in the tumor microenvironment and the appearance of IFN-licensed CAFs, which play key roles in modulating immune infiltration to the tumor microenvironment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Moreover, immune infiltration and cytokine secretion can also lead to further activation of interferon-stimulated genes, creating a positive feedback loop that further enhances immune responses against the tumor. As immune infiltration of tumors in stromagenic cancers is closely related to clinical outcomes, a potential αOPG therapy that converts “cold” into “hot” tumors could improve treatment and survival, particularly when used in combination with other therapies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>While the evidence for a role of the CD8<sup>+</sup> TILs in tumor control is compelling, our results indicate that CD4<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>-</sup>TILs also displayed the ability to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines and release lytic granules in mice treated with αOPG. These results indicate that CD4<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>-</sup>TILs can exert cytotoxic functions and/or inhibit tumor growth through secretion of IFNγ and TNFa, consistent with previous work showing that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells play a substantial role in tumor control in both preclinical models and in patient case studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. While we have emphasized T cell infiltration into the tumor microenvironment, it is clear that infiltration of other immune cells such as myeloid cells are also observed in αOPG treated tumors.</p>
<p>Although interference with TRAIL/DR5 signaling plays a key role in restoring effector function in iNKT and T cells, many of the immunologic effects of αOPG are likely mediated by its modulation of the RANK/RANKL pathway. RANK/RANKL signaling appears to be involved in the emergence of IFN-licensed CAFs, and blockade of TRAIL alone has not replicated the robust immune activation observed with αOPG. In bone metabolism, OPG blockade enhances RANKL signaling and promotes osteoclastogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Given that RANKL signaling and T cells are known to influence cancer metastasis to bone, the mechanisms described here may have relevance to both primary and metastatic settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Interestingly, OPG blockade also leads to increased IFN-γ secretion by T effector cells, which may act in a negative feedback loop to regulate bone homeostasis—suggesting potential convergence between cancer immunology and bone biology, particularly in stromagenic cancers where bone loss is a common sequela.</p>
<p>It remains unclear whether the IFN-stimulated CAF subset that emerges after αOPG treatment arises through reprogramming of existing iCAFs, or from alternative lineage trajectories involving multipotent stromal progenitors. Our in vitro data indicate that TRAIL signaling can induce apoptosis of iCAFs, which would support a model in which IFN-licensed CAFs arise de novo from progenitor populations. This would further suggest that the primary targets of infiltrating T cells are iCAFs, rather than tumor cells. However, in vivo lineage tracing is needed to definitively resolve the origin and fate of these CAF populations.</p>
<p>Regardless of their ontogeny, our findings support a model in which OPG-directed therapies reshape the stromal-immune landscape of the TME, with broad implications for the treatment of otherwise refractory stromagenic malignancies.</p>

Digestion was neutralized with 20 mL complete culture media (DMEM/F12+ 10% FBS + 1% Pen/Strep). The sample was strained once through a 100 µm cell strainer and centrifuged at 500g for 10 min at RT. The supernatant containing adipocytes and triglycerides was discarded from the top. Red blood cells were lysed by resuspending the pellet in 3 mL ACK lysis buffer and incubating the sample for 3 min at RT. Lysis was attenuated by diluting the sample with 20 mL complete culture media and centrifuged at 500g for 10 min at RT to obtain the eWAT stromal pellet. The supernatant was discarded, and the eWAT stromal cell pellet was resuspended in 1 mL complete culture media. Total live eWAT stromal cells were counted using the Vi-CELL XR Cell Viability Analyzer (Beckman Coulter).</p>

<title>Co-injection of stromal cells and tumor cells</title>
<p>To investigate the significance of stromal-derived OPG in tumorigenesis, eWAT stromal cells were isolated from either age-matched OPGKO mice or WT mice, as mentioned earlier. The isolated eWAT stromal cells were washed with PBS and resuspended to a concentration of 4 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml. Simultaneously, the tumor cell line FC1199 cells were trypsinized and resuspended to a concentration of 4 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml. eWAT stromal cells and FC1199 cells were then combined at a 1:1 ratio immediately before injection. Subsequently, 10-week-old C57BL6 male mice were subcutaneously inoculated in the right flank with a 100 µL cell mixture, equivalent to 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> eWAT stromal cells and FC1199 cells for each mouse.</p>

<p>The eWAT stromal cells was purified by CD45-depletion using mouse MojoSort mouse CD45 nanobeads. Senescence of eWAT stromal cells cells was induced by treatment with 20 μM etoposide for 24h. Proliferating eWAT stromal cells cells without etoposide treatment were used as the proliferative control (Pro). Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) were isolated from male C57BL6/J mice and cultivated. BMDCs were pulsed with 10 or 100 ng/L α-GalCer or vehicle overnight and then washed with PBS before co-cultivating with iNKT hybridoma cells at a 4:1 ratio. To test whether OPG impacts the cytotoxicity of T effector cells against target cells, eWAT stromal cells cells and L929 cells were pretreated with rOPG/αOPG and cultivated with iNKT hybridoma and CD8 T cells respectively for 8 hours. The viability of eWAT stromal cells cells or L929 cells was measured using ATPlite Luminescence Assay.</p>

<p>This study presents an <bold>important</bold> finding by identifying OPG as a novel stromal checkpoint influencing T-cell anti-tumor responses, thereby shedding new light on the complex interplay between the tumor microenvironment and immune regulation. The data are robust and the experimental approaches are sound, providing <bold>solid</bold> support for the study's conclusions; however, there are a number of additional questions raised by the data. Of particular note are the questions raised on the mechanistic effects of TRAIL versus RANKL. In addition, it would broaden the interest in this study to include more translational human data to complement the work presented.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Wang et al. present a compelling study investigating a novel immunosuppressive mechanism within the tumor microenvironment (TME) mediated by a subset of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)-specifically, inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs) that secrete osteoprotegerin (OPG). Utilizing both genetic and antibody-mediated OPG inhibition in murine breast and pancreatic cancer models, the authors demonstrate that blocking OPG enhances infiltration and effector function of cytotoxic T cells, which leads to significant tumor regression. Their data further show that OPG blockade induces a population of IFN-licensed CAFs characterized by increased expression of antigen presentation genes and immunomodulatory properties that favour T cell infiltration. The manuscript proposes that OPG functions as a &quot;stromal immune checkpoint&quot; and could represent a promising therapeutic target to convert &quot;cold&quot; tumors into &quot;hot,&quot; immunotherapy-responsive tumours.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Novel role for OPG+ CAF as T-cell immune suppressors:</p>
<p>
This study introduces a novel role for OPG+ iCAFs as active suppressors of T cell function and highlights stromal OPG as a critical negative regulator of antitumor immunity.</p>
<p>(2) Methodological Rigor:</p>
<p>
The manuscript is underpinned by a thorough and systematic experimental design, combining genetic mouse models, antibody interventions, in vitro functional assays, single-cell RNA-seq, and human RAN-seq datasets analyses.</p>
<p>(3) Translational Relevance:</p>
<p>
By identifying OPG as a stromal immune checkpoint, the study opens exciting opportunities for developing new immunotherapeutic strategies in stromatogenic tumors.</p>
<p>(4) Clear and Comprehensive Data Presentation:</p>
<p>
The use of high-dimensional single-cell technologies and logical, detailed data presentation supports the study's reproducibility and transparency.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript lacks definitive data identifying the cellular origin of OPG, particularly establishing iCAFs as the exclusive functional source.</p>
<p>(2) There is a paucity of translational evidence directly correlating OPG+ iCAFs with T cell exclusion in human tumors.</p>
<p>(3) The scope is limited by the reliance on two murine models, including a subcutaneous pancreatic cancer model, which may not fully recapitulate native tumor microenvironments.</p>
<p>(4) Long-term outcomes and durability of response following OPG blockade, including possible effects on bone homeostasis, are not addressed.</p>
<p>(5) Mechanistic experiments related to the blockade of TRAIL and RANKL remain incomplete, and alternative pathways are not thoroughly explored.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The work identified a protein called OPD secreted by a particular subtype of cancer-associated fibroblasts and found that it regulated T cell function in the tumor microenvironment. They showed that an antibody that targeted this protein could induce infiltration of immune cells into the tumour and could convert a cold tumor lacking tumour infiltration to a hot tumour with an immune-rich tumour microenvironment. They have supported the conclusion with the data in animal work as well as human tissue data. The authors also stated that it remains unclear whether the IFN-stimulated CAF subset after antibody treatment of OPG is due to reprogramming of existing iCAFs or arises de novo from progenitor populations. Despite their preclinical data suggesting the latter, they rightly suggested that in vivo lineage tracing is needed to further prove the origin and fate of these CAF populations. Overall, this is a well-designed and important study that would benefit from further mechanistic clarification and minor revision.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strength of their data is that they utilized an immunocompetent orthotopic breast cancer model using the GFP-labelled tumor cell line EO771 in C57BL/6J mice, a well-established model for interrogating the role of stromal-immune interactions in carcinogenesis and tumor growth. They also performed scRNA-seq of the sorted stromal cells of the implanted EO771 cells as well as stromal cells from human esophageal carcinoma using tumor samples and matched adjacent non-malignant tissues from patients.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The key mechanistic aspects remain unclear, in particular the relative contributions of the TRAIL versus RANKL pathways to immunosuppression. The dual inhibition of TRAIL and RANKL by OPG is proposed, but the contribution of each axis to immune suppression was not clearly dissected. It would strengthen the paper to evaluate the effects of TRAIL versus RANKL signalling (e.g., with selective ligands or antagonists), which warrants deeper mechanistic exploration. Moreover, while CD4⁺ T cell cytotoxicity was observed, its functional role was underexplored.</p>
