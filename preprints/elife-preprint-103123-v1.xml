<title>Abstract</title>
<p>In order to understand how prefrontal cortex provides the benefits of working memory (WM) for visual processing we examined the influence of WM on the representation of visual signals in V4 neurons in two macaque monkeys. We found that WM induces strong β oscillations in V4 and that the timing of action potentials relative to this oscillation reflects sensory information-i.e., a phase coding of visual information. Pharmacologically inactivating the Frontal Eye Field part of prefrontal cortex, we confirmed the necessity of prefrontal signals for the WM-driven boost in phase coding of visual information. Indeed, changes in the average firing rate of V4 neurons could be accounted for by WM-induced oscillatory changes. We present a network model to describe how WM signals can recruit sensory areas primarily by inducing oscillations within these areas and discuss the implications of these findings for a sensory recruitment theory of WM through coherence.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Our capacity to dynamically interact with the world around us based on our own needs, priorities and goals is an example of our cognitive flexibility. The goals and plans preserved by working memory (WM) are capable of altering our perceptions of and actions toward the world around us. Thus, understanding how our plans alter the representation of sensory information can reveal the neural basis of cognitive flexibility. Prefrontal cortex (PFC) is believed to be one of the sources controlling sensory signals according to goals and plans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. In this study, we are specifically examining how WM information sent from PFC can influence the representation of sensory information in visual areas in macaque monkeys. We have already shown that the Frontal Eye Field (FEF) part of PFC sends a direct WM signal to extrastriate area V4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, and visual areas manifest the WM content in their oscillatory behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Within the FEF, WM alters the efficacy of V4 inputs as well, and these inputs mostly target neurons believed to be involved in the transformation of visual information into motor action<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. The finding that extrastriate visual areas receive the content of WM, and that information sent from these areas to prefrontal cortex is undergoing a visuomotor transformation, provide a clear picture of the sequence of events giving rise to the benefits of WM. However, exactly how this top-down WM signal enhances the representation in visual areas is not known, considering that neurons in extrastriate visual areas show little or no change in their firing rate in response to WM content<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Thus, how WM impacts visual representations is crucial for understanding the neural code, since the behavioral consequences of WM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> suggest that the representation altered by WM content is likely to be the representation that our behavior relies on.</p>
<p>Knowing that the FEF sends a spatially-specific signal to V4 carrying the content of WM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, we studied the responses of V4 neurons while top-down WM is directed to their receptive field (RF) or elsewhere, under the conditions in which FEF activity is intact or disrupted using pharmacological manipulation. V4 neurons were provided with a bottom-up visual input with the goal of understanding how a top-down WM signal can alter the representation of bottom-up information. This arrangement revealed that WM primarily enhances the phase coding of visual information in V4. Pharmacological inactivation demonstrated that FEF activity is necessary for this phase-dependent representational enhancement in V4. We also show that average firing rate modulations within visual areas can be accounted for by WM-induced oscillations within these areas, supporting the primacy of WM-dependent oscillations in generating the signatures of WM within sensory areas. These results corroborate a WM model in which sensory areas can be recruited by higher areas without needing to change the average firing rate of sensory neurons.</p>

<title>WM modulates oscillatory power and spike timing in V4, but not average firing rates</title>
<p>In order to assess the impact of WM on the visual representation, we recorded local field potentials (LFPs) and neuronal activity in extrastriate area V4 during a spatial WM task with visual signals presented to neurons independent of the WM demand (see Methods; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The animal had to remember a visual cue presented either inside the V4 RF or in the opposite hemifield (memory IN and OUT conditions, respectively), and following a delay period, made a saccade to the remembered location to receive a reward. The background stimulus could have one of four orientations and three levels of contrasts (or no contrast, the classic memory-guided saccade (MGS) task), allowing us to examine the interaction between bottom-up sensory information and top-down WM signals. We recorded 145 V4 neurons across 88 recording sessions; most of our analysis focuses on their responses during the last 700ms of the delay period of the WM task.</p>

<p>A) Memory-guided saccade with background (MGS-background) task. The monkey fixated and a peripheral visual cue appeared (Cue). The monkey maintained fixation while remembering the cue location (∼1s; Delay), and after the fixation point disappeared, executed a saccadic eye movement to the remembered location (Response) to receive a reward. Throughout the task, there was a task-irrelevant, full-field oriented bar background; the background contrast ranged from 0-64%, in one of 4 orientations. The memory location was either inside the extrastriate RF (IN condition, shown) or 180 degrees away (OUT condition). Neurophysiological recordings of spiking and LFP activity were made from extrastriate visual area V4, with linear array or single electrodes.</p>

<p>As expected, V4 neurons were capable of signaling the properties of the background stimulus present in their RF. The left panel in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1B</xref> shows the response of a sample V4 neuron during the IN condition. During the fixation period and the cue period, the neuron exhibited sensitivity to different contrast levels of the background stimulus projected to its RF (main effect of contrast: F<sub>Fixation</sub>=41.744, p&lt;10<sup>−16</sup>; F<sub>Cue</sub>=14.541, p&lt;10<sup>−6</sup>; one-way ANOVAs). The neuron’s contrast sensitivity was still manifested in its firing rate during the delay period (F<sub>IN</sub>=19.950, p&lt;10<sup>−8</sup>; One-way). As shown on the right side of <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1B</xref>, this neuron also showed contrast sensitivity during the delay period of the OUT condition (F<sub>OUT</sub>= 17.851, p&lt;10<sup>−7</sup>; One-way ANOVA). Importantly, the contrast sensitivity during the delay period was not significantly different between the IN vs. OUT conditions (F<sub>condition</sub>= 5×10<sup>−4</sup>, p=0.981; F<sub>contrast</sub>=37.540, p&lt;10<sup>−16</sup>; F<sub>interaction</sub>=0.301, p=0.742; Two-way ANOVA). Similarly, the neuron was selective for the orientation of the background stimulus. The neuron exhibited orientation sensitivity during the fixation period as well as the delay period in both IN and OUT conditions (main effect of orientation: F<sub>Fixation</sub>=16.401, p&lt;10<sup>−8</sup>; F<sub>IN</sub>=10.410, p&lt;10<sup>−5</sup>; F<sub>OUT</sub>=19.014, p&lt;10<sup>−10</sup>; One-way ANOVAs; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). As with contrast, the content of WM (IN vs. OUT condition) did not significantly change the neuron’s orientation sensitivity during the delay period (F<sub>Condition</sub>= 5×10<sup>−4</sup>, p=0.982; F<sub>Orientation</sub>=28.082, p&lt;10<sup>−16</sup>; F<sub>Interaction</sub>=0.810, p=0.492; Two-way ANOVA). Thus, this sample neuron exhibited contrast and orientation sensitivity for the background stimulus; however, WM did not alter the stimulus information reflected in the neuron’s firing rate.</p>
<p>The same pattern was observed in the population of 145 V4 neurons: neurons’ firing rates reflected the properties of the background stimulus, but this capacity was not affected by WM. The response to different background stimuli was similar between the fixation period, delay IN, and delay OUT conditions, both for contrast (F<sub>Contrast</sub>=16.923, p&lt;10<sup>−7</sup>; F<sub>Condition</sub>=0.311, p=0.733; F<sub>Interaction</sub>=0.400, p=0.811; Two-way ANOVA) and orientation (F<sub>Orientation</sub>=23.294, p&lt;10<sup>−14</sup>; F<sub>Condition</sub>=0.770, p=0.465; F<sub>Interaction</sub>=0.202, p=0.976; Two-way ANOVA) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D, 1E</xref>; see also Fig. S1A-B). <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref> shows the ability of V4 neurons to discriminate between all 12 stimuli of various contrasts and orientations across time. Overall, the ability of V4 neurons to discriminate between various background stimuli was not altered during the delay period of the IN vs. OUT conditions (discriminability<sub>IN</sub>=1.514±0.783, discriminability<sub>OUT</sub>=1.482±0.680, p=0.462; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>; see also Fig. S1C-D). Therefore, whereas sensory information is reflected in the firing rate of V4 neurons, the impact of spatial WM on the sensory representation is not traceable by this neural signature.</p>
<p>In contrast to the lack of WM-driven change in firing rates, we found that V4 LFP oscillations strongly reflect the content of WM. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref> shows the LFP power spectrum during the delay period for the same channel of recording as of the example neuron shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-C</xref>. The β (14-22 Hz; see Methods) band power was 0.019±0.013 dB/Hz during the IN condition, which is 18.9% greater than the 0.016±0.012 dB/Hz during the OUT condition (Wilcoxon ranksum, p=0.002). Therefore, although neurons’ firing rates do not change due to WM, the power of the LFP oscillation in the β range reflects the impact of WM in the same recording channel. This phenomenon was observed across the 88 LFP recordings (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>): β LFP power during the delay was greater for the IN condition compared to the OUT condition (Power<sub>IN</sub>=2.001±0.336, Power<sub>OUT</sub>=1.842±0.333, p&lt;10<sup>−3</sup>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref>). Importantly, this WM-dependent enhancement of β power was observed independent of the background stimuli (Fig. S2). In summary, a visual area known to receive the spatial WM signal exhibits the signature of this top-down signal in its subthreshold LFP activity, but not in neurons’ firing rates.</p>
<p>The LFP reflects a combination of nearby currents, including synaptic inputs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, and is not directly transmitted along axons to other brain areas in the manner that spikes are. Therefore, we sought to identify whether these WM-dependent oscillatory changes impact any other aspects of spiking activity within V4. Although at the coarse scale of average firing rate there was no change due to WM, at a higher temporal resolution it became evident that the timing of V4 action potentials depended on the phase of WM-induced β oscillations. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> shows the distribution of spikes generated by a sample V4 neuron across various phases of the β oscillation during the delay period, for memory IN and OUT conditions. The average delay period FR was not different between the two memory conditions (F<sub>Condition</sub>= 2.050, p=0.153; F<sub>Contrast</sub>=11.511, p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>; F<sub>Interaction</sub>=1.314, p=0.271; Two-way ANOVA), but the phase distribution of spikes during the delay period of the IN condition was more concentrated (centered around 160-degree phase) compared to the OUT condition. To quantify the phenomenon, we used the spike-phase locking (SPL) as a measure of how consistently spikes of a neuron are generated at a certain phase. The SPL index varies between 0 (spikes homogenously distributed across phases) to 1 (all spikes occurring at a certain phase). For the sample neuron shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, SPL changed from 0.063 for the OUT to 0.163 for the IN condition. Across the population of 145 V4 neurons, we found a consistent impact of WM on SPL: SPL relative to the β oscillation was significantly greater during the IN condition compared to the OUT condition (n=145 neurons; SPL<sub>IN</sub>=0.164±0.014, SPL<sub>OUT</sub>=0.155±0.005, p&lt;10<sup>−3</sup>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). These results indicate that although WM does not change the average firing rate, it influences V4 spike timing to be more closely aligned with WM-dependent oscillations. Conversely, evaluating the consistency of the LFP at the time of V4 spikes, the spike triggered average (STA) LFP also shows this strong coupling of spikes to LFP phase in the β range (Fig. S3).</p>

<title>Spatial WM specifically enhances phase coding of visual information</title>
<p>To understand how WM-induced oscillations benefit the sensory representation within V4, we examined whether V4 neurons’ sensitivity was reflected in the timing of their spikes relative to these WM-induced oscillations. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2C</xref>, analyzing the average normalized LFP at the time of spiking (the STA) for an example neuron, we observed that in the presence of the high contrast stimulus in the background during the memory IN condition, V4 spikes were associated with a steeper LFP change compared to when a low contrast stimulus was in the background (Slope<sub>High</sub>=0.052, Slope<sub>Low</sub>=0.029). For this neuron, this difference was less prominent during the OUT condition (Slope<sub>High</sub>=0.042, Slope<sub>Low</sub>=0.035). We observed a similar phenomenon across the population. The LFP slope around the time of a spike was significantly sharper when the preferred (high contrast) stimulus was presented in the background, compared to the nonpreferred (low contrast) stimulus, during the IN condition (Slope<sub>High</sub>=0.046±0.003, Slope<sub>Low</sub>=0.021±0.002, p&lt;10<sup>−8</sup>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref> left). This difference was not observed during the OUT condition (Slope<sub>High</sub>=0.030±0.002, Slope<sub>Low</sub>=0.039±0.004, p=0.110, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref> right). This indicates that WM-induced oscillations can facilitate the spiking activity in visual areas, consistent with what other groups have shown regarding the role of oscillations as a boost for passing the spiking threshold <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Similar results were observed for preferred versus nonpreferred orientations (Fig. S4).</p>
<p>The idea that a WM-induced oscillation can change the timing of spikes also suggests the possibility that the timing of spikes relative to that oscillation could convey information, referred to as a neural phase code. We used the mutual information (MI) to quantify visual information conveyed by either the phase or rate of spikes to have a side-by-side comparison of a neural phase vs. rate code (see Methods). <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref> left shows the average population MI measured based on phase coding across time for both the IN and OUT conditions. The presence of the WM cue reduced both phase and rate coding of background information during the visual period (Phase MI<sub>IN</sub>=0.007±0.001 bits, Phase MI<sub>OUT</sub>=0.014±0.002 bits; p=0.012; Rate MI<sub>IN</sub>=0.019±0.002 bits, Rate MI<sub>OUT</sub>=0.031±0.003 bits; p=0.012). However, maintenance of WM information during the delay period increased the phase coding capacity of the V4 neurons to represent information about the stimulus in their RF, but did not alter their rate coding. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref> shows the capacity of V4 neurons to encode the background stimulus during the IN vs. OUT conditions under phase (left) and rate (right) coding schemes. Phase MI during the delay period of the IN condition was 0.019±0.002 bits, significantly greater than the 0.012±0.002 bits during the OUT condition (p&lt;10<sup>−3</sup>). However, delay period rate MI was not significantly different between the IN and OUT conditions (MI<sub>IN</sub>=0.024±0.003 bits; MI<sub>OUT</sub>=0.022±0.003 bits, p=0.261). We also found that the WM-dependent enhancement of phase-dependent visual representation was limited to the β range oscillations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>) It is imperative to note that despite the seemingly small values of MI (e.g., 0.019 bits), an increase of 54% in phase MI between the IN and OUT conditions means a huge boost in coding capacity due to WM. The MI value can be interpreted as a measure of the rate of statistical learning from incoming data through which sensory decisions can be made. For example, with 0.012 bits per 100 ms phase MI available in the OUT condition, for a population of 100 neurons firing independently it would take 294 ms to fully differentiate 12 stimuli. WM-induced enhancement of phase MI means that the same discriminatory capacity can be achieved within 190 ms with the same number of neurons, or within the same amount of time but with only 65 neurons. Altogether, consistent with the finding that WM mainly modulated oscillations within the β range (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I, J</xref>), we found that WM mostly improves the phase coding in V4 within the same β range. Thus, WM specifically enhanced β range phase coding in V4, without altering rate coding.</p>

<p>We recorded from 66 V4 neurons before and after FEF inactivation. Both the V4 LFP power spectrum and SPL showed a reduction in the β range following FEF inactivation (Fig. S5). In these 66 neurons, prior to inactivation, the impact of WM on phase coding was evident: during the delay period there was significantly stronger phase coding of information in the β range for the memory IN condition (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E-G</xref>; Phase MI<sub>IN</sub>=0.023±0.004 bits, Phase MI<sub>OUT</sub>=0.018±0.003 bits, p=0.039).

<title>Primacy of a phase code</title>
<p>The finding that WM mainly modulates phase coded information within extrastriate areas fundamentally shifts our understanding of how the top-down influence of prefrontal cortex shapes the neural representation, suggesting that inducing oscillations is the main way WM recruits sensory areas. However, while this side-by-side comparison of rate and phase coding shows the strength of the latter, several studies have reported an impact of WM on the firing rate of visual neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. One can argue that a slight increase in firing rate at each stage of visual processing can gradually accumulate to eventually emerge in the form of a robust firing rate change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, and that this will be sufficient to support WM. In order to determine the primary means by which WM alters neural representations, we constructed a neural field network model of visual areas during WM. In order to examine the impact of WM on oscillatory and firing rate changes in visual areas, we designed the model to consist of interconnected excitatory and inhibitory units (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, e-cells and i-cells) capable of generating oscillatory activity. To modulate this oscillatory activity, these neural field units received bottom-up and top-down type input. The units were tuned to different stimulus ‘features’ of the bottom-up input (analogous to orientation tuning of V4 neurons in the experimental data, with input strength analogous to contrast). The top-down input was not feature selective, providing a uniform input across the network, with stronger connections to e-cells than i-cells, consistent with what is known about the FEF-V4 circuitry and anatomy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. A higher strength of WM signal in the model corresponds to the memory IN condition, in comparison to the absence of WM input in the memory OUT equivalent. The model replicates several key features of the experimental data: units reflect sensory information in their phase and rate, WM-enhanced β power, and locking of units’ activity to this oscillation under the influence of WM (Fig. S6). The model’s phase coding of visual stimuli is evident in the relative timing of responses of differently tuned e-cells to an input stimulus (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Using this model, we can directly compare the magnitude of information encoded by the phase and rate of model units, quantified via information gain (see Methods). We found that not only was information encoded by phase much greater than that encoded by rate, but also that phase and rate information were oppositely affected by changes in WM strength: phase information increased and rate information decreased as the WM signal increased (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). We also found this same divergent pattern between phase and rate codes when measuring coding performance using mutual information (see Fig. S7). Therefore, the quantification of information within a tangible network model revealed that in an oscillating network, a top-down induced oscillation can be detrimental to the rate-dependent representation of information.</p>

<p>The model revealed that stronger WM input increased both oscillation strength and peak frequency (Fig. S6), and we hypothesized that this change in frequency could explain changes in firing rate. We tested this idea both in the model and in the experimental data. In the model, we varied the strength of the WM signal across 4 levels of stimulus input strength (resembling various levels of stimulus contrast). We then divided oscillatory cycles occurring in the respective stimulus input levels into deciles based on their oscillation frequency, and measured information encoded by phase and rate as a function of oscillation frequency (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Phase information increased with increasing oscillation frequency while rate information decreased at higher oscillation frequencies, for all non-zero contrast levels (Model utility t-test for contrasts 0-3 respectively; phase code: p&gt;0.05, &gt;0.05, &lt;0.01,0.001; and rate code: p&gt;0.05, &lt;0.05,0.01,0.0001). Importantly, we found that the network replicating the oscillatory and representational characteristics of V4 during WM shows an increased firing rate as oscillation frequency increases. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref> shows how small variations in the strength of the WM signal resulted in correlated changes in oscillation frequency and firing rate (r = 0.901; linear model utility t-test significant: p&lt;0.0001). Thus, firing rate is positively correlated with oscillation frequency, but information encoded by that rate is negatively correlated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref> vs. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4E</xref>). To confirm that such a relationship exists in the experimental data, for each neuron we measured the peak LFP frequency and average firing rate across subsamples of trials, allowing us to test the relationship between peak β frequency and evoked firing rate within a single condition. As shown for two sample V4 neurons, such a relationship between peak frequency and average firing rate existed between the IN and OUT conditions (for a single background stimulus; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F &amp; G</xref>). For the first sample neuron, in which the peak frequency changed from 18.81 to 15.84 Hz between the IN and OUT conditions, the firing rate changed from 1.084 to 0.869, and peak frequency and firing rate were correlated across subsamples of trials (Pearson correlation, r=0.716, p&lt;10<sup>−32</sup>; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). Results from the second sample neuron show that this relationship remains the same even in cases where WM reduces the peak frequency (peak-frequency<sub>IN</sub> = 15.041 Hz, peak-frequency<sub>OUT</sub> = 16.827 Hz, FR<sub>IN</sub>=0.630, FR<sub>OUT</sub>=0.816): the correlation between firing rate and peak frequency remains positive (Pearson correlation, r=0.671, p&lt;10<sup>−26</sup>; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). At the population level, we looked at firing rate during the delay period across subsamples of trials for all 145 V4 neurons, sorted according to their peak frequency (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref> left, this relationship between peak frequency and firing rate was present across both IN and OUT conditions; more importantly, this relationship remained the same between the two memory conditions (F<sub>Condition</sub>=9.649, p=0.003; F<sub>Frequency</sub>=399.566, p&lt;10<sup>−31</sup>; F<sub>Interaction</sub>=2.935, p=0.091, ANCOVA), suggesting that the frequency of WM-induced oscillations can account for firing rate changes. Critically, a similar analysis for the visual period of the task revealed that the presence or absence of a visual stimulus (IN vs. OUT condition) creates a much larger change in firing rate, which cannot be accounted for by changes in β frequency (F<sub>Condition</sub>=5.113×10<sup>3</sup>, p&lt;10<sup>−72</sup>; F<sub>Frequency</sub>=103.220, p&lt;10<sup>−15</sup>; F<sub>Interaction</sub>=71.427, p&lt;10<sup>−11</sup>, ANCOVA) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref> right). In other words, changes in rate during the delay period may be a consequence of changes in phase locking frequency. We also examined the relationship between peak frequency and firing rate as a function of stimulus efficacy. Both firing rate and peak frequency vary with stimulus efficacy (Fig. S8A; two sample neurons), but there was no difference for this relationship between the IN and OUT condition (Fig. S8B). Figure S9 shows that this relationship between firing rate and peak frequency is specific to the β frequency range. While there was no overall change in average firing rate due to WM across the V4 population (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, Fig. S1, and related statistics), this analysis further suggests that any WM-related changes in the firing rates of individual V4 neurons could be primarily driven by changes in oscillatory frequency.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Prefrontal cortex modulates sensory and motor signals in order to guide our actions based on goals and priorities maintained in WM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Within prefrontal areas, FEF sends direct projections to extrastriate visual areas carrying the content of WM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. We designed a paradigm in which neurons in extrastriate area V4 are provided with bottom-up input while the top-down signal carrying WM content can be directed to the part of space represented by these neurons or elsewhere. This allowed us to examine which aspect of the sensory representation within V4 is influenced by a top-down WM signal, and to causally test the role of FEF activity in this WM-driven modulation. We found that a neural phase code representation of sensory stimuli was strongly modulated by top-down WM signals coming from the FEF, while firing rates were relatively unaffected, leading us to conclude that representations based on the average firing rate of neurons are not the primary way that top-down signals enhance sensory processing. Using a combination of computational modelling and experimental data analysis, we provided evidence that any changes in the average firing rate of individual neurons might be a byproduct of small changes in the frequency of the WM-induced oscillation.</p>
<p>The long<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> and growing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> list of neural signatures of attention begs a unifying theory describing the exact mechanisms involved in generating this plethora of neural signatures. Many of these signatures are seen in both attention and WM, including enhanced visual responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, changes in inter-neuronal correlations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, decreased variability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, and shifts in RFs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. In light of the present findings, we suggest that by inducing an oscillation, top-down signals allow expression of sensory representations in the form of a neural phase code: neurons emit action potentials in response to this induced oscillation with a relative timing that reflects their sensitivity. Slight changes in the frequency of the oscillation might then account for changes in the average firing rate of neurons in sensory areas, and one can imagine coherent oscillations altering the dependent and independent variability of the neurons as well. Understanding whether the β oscillations observed in our study function in the same way as the mostly gamma oscillations reported in attention studies will require a more complete understanding of the characteristics of oscillators operating in the presence and absence of visual information (see also <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>).</p>
<p>A framework in which top-down signals primarily alter the phase of the spikes faces an important challenge: in communication between brain areas, LFP oscillations are not carried along with spikes down axonal projections. A phase code without its oscillatory reference frame is likely unreadable. However, studies in our lab and others have provided growing evidence that there are coherent oscillations between brain areas during WM, which could provide the shared oscillatory frame of reference required to transfer phase-coded information. For example, oscillatory coherence between FEF and inferotemporal cortex exists and predicts performance on an object WM task<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>; similarly, synchrony between PFC and V4 is also correlated with WM performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Oscillatory coherence between prefrontal and parietal areas also reflects the content of WM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. For a more complete review of findings of inter-areal coherence during WM and their relationship to performance, see <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. The significance of enhancing the efficacy of signals by generating a coherent signal <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> has previously been presented in the context of communication through coherence (CTC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>, as has the idea that phase in the receiving area can influence sensitivity to incoming signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. In addition to gating of efficacy by phase of the receiving area (as in CTC, where this gating can make a downstream area more sensitive to input from one source than another<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>), the precise timing of spikes relative to oscillations even within a coherently oscillating site (i.e. phase coding) could also be crucial when this timing is going to be gated back into signal strength using a coherent oscillation in the receiving area.</p>
<p>We found that WM signals allow expression of visual representations in the form of a neural phase code, indicating that prefrontal cortex can recruit sensory areas using a WM-induced oscillation. This new finding, along with the abundant evidence of coherent oscillations across brain areas during WM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, lead to a working hypothesis about how WM can recruit sensory areas. Consistent with sensory recruitment theories of WM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>, these results suggest that sensory and memory signals can be preserved in sensory areas without being expressed in their average firing rate. This latent information is expressed in the form of a phase code in response to a WM-induced oscillation, and is potentially readable by other areas that have oscillations coherent with the oscillatory frame of reference induced by WM. This proposed recruitment through coherence framework of working memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup> offers an explanation for how WM can recruit highly feature-sensitive sensory areas in the absence of robust firing rate changes within them.</p>

<p>We recorded the activity of 145 V4 neurons across 88 recording sessions (55 sessions Monkey E, 33 sessions Monkey O), including 66 V4 neurons during 33 FEF inactivation sessions (29 sessions Monkey E, 4 sessions Monkey O). We recorded neurophysiological activity using Neuralynx and Blackrock data acquisition systems. We digitized spike waveforms at 32 KHz, and performed offline spike sorting manually. We used single tungsten microelectrodes of 200μm diameter, with epoxylite insulation (FHC, Bowdoin, ME), and linear 16-channel arrays (Plexon, Dallas, TX). Electrodes were inserted using a hydraulic microdrive (Narishige, Japan).</p>
<p><italic>V4 recordings:</italic> We simultaneously recorded from FEF (single electrode) and V4 (single or linear array electrodes). In this paper we only present the data from the V4 recordings.</p>
<p><italic>FEF inactivation with V4 recording:</italic> FEF was pharmacologically inactivated through infusion of 0.5-1μL of the GABA-a agonist muscimol, using a custom microinjectrode system (described in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>). Muscimol concentration was 5mg/ml (pH 6.5 to 7). V4 activity was recorded from a site with RFs overlapping the estimated FEF RF, before and after FEF inactivation. Performance on the memory guided saccade task was used to verify FEF inactivation.</p>

<p>For all analyses of V4 responses (main <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>,<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>,<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), we pooled V4 data from simultaneous FEF-V4 recording sessions with data from FEF inactivation sessions (using the V4 data prior to FEF inactivation). For the results of <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, we assess the role of FEF on V4 coding using inactivation data in which we recorded from V4 before and after FEF inactivation. Evaluations of neural responses to background stimuli of varying contrast or orientation include the three non-zero contrast values. Wherever a statistical test is not specified it is Wilcoxon sign rank. P values are reported up to three decimal digits, and p values less than 0.001 are reported as p&lt;10<sup>−x</sup>.

<title>LFP power spectrum, spike-phase locking, and STA</title>
<p>The power spectral density of the local field potentials (LFPs) was calculated using the multitaper method, employing three tapers (discrete prolate spheroidal (DPSS)-Slepian sequences) for each trial and channel. For population LFP power statistics, LFP power spectrums were normalized, [(X-min)/(max-min)]. In sessions with array recordings (51/88 sessions) power calculations were performed for each channel and then averaged across all channels in that session before calculating population statistics. To quantify the reliability of spike timing relative to the LFP of the same channel, we employed the Spike-phase locking (SPL) method <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>, which measures the consistency or locking strength of spike phases to the LFPs. This is achieved by calculating the angular summation between phases of LFPs and spike times. The amplitude of the SPL indicates the strength of spike locking to LFP phase, while the angle reflects the phases of LFPs when spikes occurred. For the spike-triggered average (STA) of the LFP, we first normalized the LFP by taking the z-score of the LFP across timepoints within 100ms of a spike for each trial, then averaged those values across trials.</p>

<title>Rate and phase coding capacity</title>
<p>Our primary means of measuring coding capacity was the method developed by Panzeri and colleagues, which allowed us to quantify and compare information contained in rate and phase codes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. This calculation of coding capacity was done in four steps. 1) First, using the FIR filter, LFPs were filtered into ten different frequency bands (1-4; 4-8; 8-12; 12-17; 17-22; 22-27; 27-35; 35-55; 65-90; 90-120). 2) Next, based on Hilbert transform, the phase of filtered LFPs were extracted. 3) Subsequently, the average of phases at the time of spike occurrence were estimated for a window of 100ms duration with 100ms shift. 4) Finally, mutual information (MI) was calculated between these average phases (phase code) or average spike rate (rate code) and different stimuli. The MI was calculated across all stimulus contrasts and orientations. For full mathematical details see <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. The configuration we used was: direct method, biased naive estimates and 20 bootstraps <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Neural field model</title>
<p>Our neural field model is defined by be a periodic orientation tuning domain parameter <italic>θ</italic> ∈ [0, <italic>π</italic>). This neural field model is intended to represent a hypercolumn-like population with a subset of cells within the neural field preferentially responsive to a <italic>θ</italic>-oriented stimulus. This model has been studied in detail in a previous article by our group <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. The neural field model is described by <italic>u</italic>(<italic>θ, t</italic>), <italic>v</italic>(<italic>θ, t</italic>), the e- and i-activity for every <italic>θ</italic>-location on the ring, that solves the integro-differential equation:
<disp-formula id="ueqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="610140v1_ueqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
The integral convolution “*” in the above, is over the <italic>θ</italic>-domain, with <italic>W</italic>(<italic>θ</italic>) being the von-Mises periodic weight kernel
<disp-formula id="ueqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="610140v1_ueqn2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
A mass-model at <italic>θ</italic> and <italic>θ</italic>′ will be connected with weight <italic>W</italic>(<italic>θ − θ</italic>′)<italic>dθ</italic>′. The parameter <italic>k</italic> is the inverse-variance-like scale parameter that shapes the broadness/tightness of the distribution, and <italic>I_</italic>0(<italic>k</italic>) is the order-zero modified Bessel function of the first kind, which serves as the normalization constant. Note that the half-circle orientation tuning domain <italic>θ</italic> ∈ [0, <italic>π</italic>) necessitates a “2” factor in the weight function to be <italic>π</italic>-periodic. The same spatial scale <italic>k</italic> is used for both e- and i-cell populations.</p>
<p>The <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>σ</italic></sub>(<italic>I</italic>) function defines the output firing rate of each population as a function of its input <italic>I</italic>---an F-I curve. We have used a sigmoidal-shaped F-I curve defined as the inverse mean first passage time, plus a 5ms refractory period, of a leaky integrate an fire LIF model neuron driven by uncorrelated Gaussian white noise <italic>σξ</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) with standard deviation <italic>σ</italic> (see for example <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>:

</disp-formula>
with capacitance <italic>C</italic> = 1 micro-Farads, spike threshold voltage <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> = <italic>−</italic>50mV, and reset and leak voltages <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> = <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>l</italic></sub> = <italic>−</italic>65mV (all parameters are listed in Table S1). With these parameters, <italic>I</italic> = 1nA of current induces the membrane voltage to approach spike threshold in the absence of noise. Increasing noise parameter <italic>σ</italic> has the effect of reducing the overall gain of the F-I curve (see <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>, for more details on this model).</p>
<p>Three types of external inputs were given to the neural field: working memory inputs, stimulus inputs, and random inputs. WM inputs are uniform current inputs, added to <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub> and <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, over the entire neural field (equal for all <italic>θ</italic>-values). These uniform inputs raised very slightly the mean firing rate and oscillation frequency and represent an WM-like or attentional-like enhancement of hypercolumn activity. Stimulus inputs are orientation-tuned given by Von Mises-like distribution functions
<disp-formula id="ueqn4">
<graphic xlink:href="610140v1_ueqn4.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
in which the peak strength (set to unity) of the stimulus located at orientation <italic>θ</italic><sub>0</sub>. We fix <italic>θ</italic><sub>0</sub> = <italic>π</italic>/2--a 90-degree (vertical) orientated stimulus, without loss of generality. Finally, to capture the temporal variations in network oscillations observed in real cortical tissues, on simulations in which we assessed sensory coding (see below), we included slow-timescale Ornstein-Ulenbeck noise <italic>y</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) to both e- and i-cell input currents <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub> and <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> globally to the entire network (uniformly across all <italic>θ</italic>-values). The dynamics of <italic>y</italic> are given by the stochastic differential equation
<disp-formula id="ueqn5">
<graphic xlink:href="610140v1_ueqn5.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>ξ</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) is uncorrelated zero-mean unit-variance gaussian white noise. This equation results in a normal stationary distribution of <italic>y</italic>-values, with zero-mean, and standard deviation <italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>z</italic></sub>, and a temporal autocorrelation decay timescale <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>z</italic></sub> = 50ms, so that the network oscillations, which were typically in the 20 Hz range (50 ms oscillation cycles), showed robust cycle to cycle variability but little long-timescale multi-cycle correlation.</p>
<p>In the absence of any external input, we set neural field model to be very near the a supercritical Hopf instability (see <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>) in which additional current above a current threshold <italic>I</italic><sup><italic>*</italic></sup>, elicited oscillations with amplitude emerging continuously from zero, and oscillation frequency in the <italic>β</italic>-band around 18-20 Hz. From this <italic>I</italic><sup><italic>*</italic></sup> parameter starting point we ran simulations from over four levels of WM input (uniform current) and four levels of orientation-selective stimulus input (contrast levels), starting from zero. We call these WM 0,1,2,3 levels, and contrast levels 0,1,2,3. Altogether, the input to cells can be represented by

where <italic>Δ</italic><sub><italic>stim</italic></sub> and <italic>Δ</italic><sub><italic>WM</italic></sub> are the current increments for the respective input levels of stimulus <italic>a</italic> = 0,1,2,3 and WM <italic>b</italic> = 0,1,2,3. In addition to the input current changes that occur for our model, it is common to accept that increased stimulus input comes with increased input current fluctuations. We modeled this by adjusting the <italic>σ</italic> -parameter the F-I curve as a function of contrast input:

<title>Coding performance</title>
<p>The phase- and rate-based responses of the neural field model can be used to discriminate the input stimuli. We have chosen to discriminate the neural field model responses at the neural field locations <italic>θ</italic> = <italic>π</italic>/2 and <italic>π</italic>/4. We computed the coding performance for two competing codes: a rate code (i.e., a spike count code) and a phase code. To define the phase variable in the phase code, we examined the proxy LFP signal formed by averaging e-cell rate responses over the entire field domain. We derived a phase angle <italic>φ</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) ∈ [<italic>−π, π</italic>] of oscillation via the Hilbert transform of this LFP signal. After segmenting the simulation run time into oscillation cycles <italic>φ</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) ∈ [<italic>−π, π</italic>], for <italic>t</italic> ∈ [0, <italic>T</italic>], where <italic>T</italic> = 1/<italic>f</italic> is oscillation period. The mean rate response is simply <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="610140v1_inline1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, from which we assume Poisson-distributed <italic>n</italic> number of spikes are emitted:
<disp-formula id="ueqn9">
<graphic xlink:href="610140v1_ueqn9.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
which constituted the rate code distribution.</p>
<p>The phase code distribution is obtained from the rate response <italic>u</italic>(<italic>θ, t</italic>), by using a change-of-variables between time and phase <italic>t</italic> = <italic>g</italic>(<italic>φ</italic>), where <italic>g</italic>(<italic>φ</italic>) is the inverse of the Hilbert phase angle:
<disp-formula id="ueqn10">
<graphic xlink:href="610140v1_ueqn10.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
Using the spike count and phase distributions as the basis of the rate and phase codes, respectively, we computed two different measures of coding performance. First, to measure the amount of information gained from the code at <italic>θ</italic> = <italic>π</italic>/2, given one assumes the data are distributed according to <italic>θ</italic> = <italic>π</italic>/4, we computed the information gain rate (IG)--the Kullback Libler divergence (in natural units of information, nats):
<disp-formula id="ueqn11">
<graphic xlink:href="610140v1_ueqn11.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
Where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="610140v1_inline2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. Second, we computed the mutual information (MI) between stimulus feature <italic>θ</italic> = <italic>π</italic>/2 or <italic>π</italic>/4, and the phase data <italic>φ</italic>. We assumed the two stimuli were equally likely on a given ‘’trial” in which case the probability of each stimulus was 1/2. The phase mutual information <italic>MI</italic><sub><italic>φ</italic></sub> is then defined as the Kullback Libler divergence <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>KL</italic></sub> (using log-base-two, in this case) between the pooled distributions <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="610140v1_inline3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> to the product distribution <italic>q</italic><sub><italic>π</italic>/2</sub><italic>q</italic><sub><italic>π</italic>/4</sub>; and similarly, for the rate codes:

<p>This study uses electrophysiological recordings, causal manipulations of activity, and modeling to investigate how the maintenance of a spatial location in working memory affects the representation of visual information in area V4 of monkeys. The work is <bold>important</bold> not just for understanding how visual information is encoded, but also for determining precisely how prefrontal inputs to the sensory cortex sculpt the corresponding visual responses during working memory. The data provide <bold>solid</bold> evidence of direct communication between prefrontal circuits that store spatial information and V4, which, under the current experimental conditions, manifests mainly as changes in temporal activity patterns (beta oscillations and phase coding).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study investigates what happens to the stimulus-driven responses of V4 neurons when an item is held in working memory. Monkeys are trained to perform memory-guided saccades: they must remember the location of a visual cue and then, after a delay, make an eye movement to the remembered location. In addition, a background stimulus (a grating) is presented that varies in contrast and orientation across trials. This stimulus serves to probe the V4 responses, is present throughout the trial, and is task-irrelevant. Using this design, the authors report memory-driven changes in the LFP power spectrum, changes in synchronization between the V4 spikes and the ongoing LFP, and no significant changes in firing rate.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The logic of the experiment is nicely laid out.</p>
<p>(2) The presentation is clear and concise.</p>
<p>(3) The analyses are thorough, careful, and yield unambiguous results.</p>
<p>(4) Together, the recording and inactivation data demonstrate quite convincingly that the signal stored in FEF is communicated to V4 and that, under the current experimental conditions, the impact from FEF manifests as variations in the timing of the stimulus-evoked V4 spikes and not in the intensity of the evoked activity (i.e., firing rate).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I think there are two limitations of the study that are important for evaluating the potential functional implications of the data. If these were acknowledged and discussed, it would be easier to situate these results in the broader context of the topic, and their importance would be conveyed more fairly and transparently.</p>
<p>(1) While it may be true that no firing rate modulations were observed in this case, this may have been because the probe stimuli in the task were behaviorally irrelevant; if anything, they might have served as distracters to the monkey's actual task (the MGS). From this perspective, the lack of rate modulation could simply mean that the monkeys were successful in attending the relevant cue and shielding their performance from the potentially distracting effect of the background gratings.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>It is generally believed that higher-order areas in the prefrontal cortex guide selection during working memory and attention through signals that selectively recruit neuronal populations in sensory areas that encode the relevant feature. In this work, Parto-Dezfouli and colleagues tested how these prefrontal signals influence activity in visual area V4 using a spatial working memory task. They recorded neuronal activity from visual area V4 and found that information about visual features at the behaviorally relevant part of space during the memory period is carried in a spatially selective manner in the timing of spikes relative to a beta oscillation (phase coding) rather than in the average firing rate (rate code). The authors further tested whether there is a causal link between prefrontal input and the phase encoding of visual information during the memory period. They found that indeed inactivation of the frontal eye fields, a prefrontal area known to send spatial signals to V4, decreased beta oscillatory activity in V4 and information about the visual features. The authors went one step further to develop a neural model that replicated the experimental findings and suggested that changes in the average firing rate of individual neurons might be a result of small changes in the exact beta oscillation frequency within V4. These data provide important new insights into the possible mechanisms through which top-down signals can influence activity in hierarchically lower sensory areas and can therefore have a significant impact on the Systems, Cognitive, and Computational Neuroscience fields.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a well-written paper with a well-thought-out experimental design. The authors used a smart variation of the memory-guided saccade task to assess how information about the visual features of stimuli is encoded during the memory period. By using a grating of various contrasts and orientations as the background the authors ensured that bottom-up visual input would drive responses in visual area V4 in the delay period, something that is not commonly done in experimental settings in the same task. Moreover, one of the major strengths of the study is the use of different approaches including analysis of electrophysiological data using advanced computational methods of analysis, manipulation of activity through inactivation of the prefrontal cortex to establish causality of top-down signals on local activity signatures (beta oscillations, spike locking and information carried) as well as computational neuronal modeling. This has helped extend an observation into a possible mechanism well supported by the results.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although the authors provide support for their conclusions from different approaches, I found that the selection of some of the analyses and statistical assessments made it harder for the reader to follow the comparison between a rate code and a phase code. Specifically, the authors wish to assess whether stimulus information is carried selectively for the relevant position through a firing rate or a phase code. Results for the rate code are shown in Figures 1B-G and for the phase code are shown in Figure 2. Whereas an F-statistic is shown over time in Figure 1F (and Figure S1) no such analysis is shown for LFP power. Similarly, following FEF inactivation there is no data on how that influences V4 firing rates and information carried by firing rates in the two conditions (for positions inside and outside the V4 RF). In the same vein, no data are shown on how the inactivation affects beta phase coding in the OUT condition.</p>
<p>Moreover, some of the statistical assessments could be carried out differently including all conditions to provide more insight into mechanisms. For example, a two-way ANOVA followed by post hoc tests could be employed to include comparisons across both spatial (IN, OUT) and visual feature conditions (see results in Figures 2D, S4, etc.). Figure 2D suggests that the absence of selectivity in the OUT condition (no significant difference between high and low contrast stimuli) is mainly due to an increase in slope in the OUT condition for the low contrast stimulus compared to that for the same stimulus in the IN condition. If this turns out to be true it would provide important information that the authors should address.</p>
<p>There are also a few conceptual gaps that leave the reader wondering whether the results and conclusion are general enough. Specifically,</p>
<p>(1) the authors used microstimulation in the FEF to determine RFs. It is thus possible that the FEF sites that were inactivated were largely more motor-related. Given that beta oscillations and motor preparatory activity have been found to be correlated and motor sites show increased beta oscillatory activity in the delay period, it is possible that the effect of FEF inactivation on V4 beta oscillations is due to inactivation of the main source of beta activity. Had the authors inactivated sites with a preponderance of visual neurons in the FEF would the results be different?</p>
<p>(2) Somewhat related to this point and given the prominence of low-frequency activity in deeper layers of the visual cortex according to some previous studies, it is not clear where the authors' V4 recordings were located. The authors report that they do have data from linear arrays, so it should be possible to address this.</p>
<p>(3) The authors suggest that a change in the exact frequency of oscillation underlies the increase in firing rate for different stimulus features. However, the shift in frequency is prominent for contrast but not for orientation, something that raises questions about the general applicability of this observation for different visual features.</p>
<p>(4) One of the major points of the study is the primacy of the phase code over the rate code during the delay period. Specifically, here it is shown that information about the visual features of a stimulus carried by the rate code is similar for relevant and irrelevant locations during the delay period. This contrasts with what several studies have shown for attention in which case information carried in firing rates about stimuli in the attended location is enhanced relative to that for stimuli in the unattended location. If we are to understand how top-down signals work in cognitive functions it is inevitable to compare working memory with attention. The possible source of this difference is not clear and is not discussed. The reader is left wondering whether perhaps a different measure or analysis (e.g. a percent explained variance analysis) might reveal differences during the delay period for different visual features across the two spatial conditions.</p>
<p>The use of the memory-guided saccade task has certain disadvantages in the context of this study. Although delay activity is interpreted as memory activity by the authors, it is in principle possible that it reflects preparation for the upcoming saccade, spatial attention (particularly since there is a stimulus in the RF), etc. This could potentially change the conclusion and perspective.</p>
<p>For the position outside the V4 RF, there is a decrease in both beta oscillations and the clustering of spikes at a specific phase. It is therefore possible that the decrease in information about the stimuli features is a byproduct of the decrease in beta power and phase locking. Decreased oscillatory activity and phase locking can result in less reliable estimates of phase, which could decrease the mutual information estimates.</p>
<p>The authors propose that coherent oscillations could be the mechanism through which the prefrontal cortex influences beta activity in V4. I assume they mean coherent oscillations between the prefrontal cortex and V4. Given that they do have simultaneous recordings from the two areas they could test this hypothesis on their own data, however, they do not provide any results on that.</p>
<p>The authors make a strong point about the relevance of changes in the oscillation frequency and how this may result in an increase in firing rate although it could also be the reverse - an increase in firing rate leading to an increase in the frequency peak. It is not clear at all how these changes in frequency could come about. A more nuanced discussion based on both experimental and modeling data is necessary to appreciate the source and role (if any) of this observation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this report, the authors test the necessity of prefrontal cortex (specifically, FEF) activity in driving changes in oscillatory power, spike rate, and spike timing of extrastriate visual cortex neurons during a visual-spatial working memory (WM) task. The authors recorded LFP and spikes in V4 while macaques remembered a single spatial location over a delay period during which task-irrelevant background gratings were displayed on the screen with varying orientation and contrast. V4 oscillations (in the beta range) scaled with WM maintenance, and the information encoded by spike timing relative to beta band LFP about the task-irrelevant background orientation depended on remembered location. They also compared recorded signals in V4 with and without muscimol inactivation of FEF, demonstrating the importance of FEF input for WM-induced changes in oscillatory amplitude, phase coding, and information encoded about background orientations. Finally, they built a network model that can account for some of these results. Together, these results show that FEF provides meaningful input to the visual cortex that is used to alter neural activity and that these signals can impact information coding of task-irrelevant information during a WM delay.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Elegant and robust experiment that allows for clear tests for the necessity of FEF activity in WM-induced changes in V4 activity.</p>
<p>(2) Comprehensive and broad analyses of interactions between LFP and spike timing provide compelling evidence for FEF-modulated phase coding of task-irrelevant stimuli at remembered location.</p>
<p>(3) Convincing modeling efforts.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) 0% contrast background data (standard memory-guided saccade task) are not reported in the manuscript. While these data cannot be used to consider information content of spike rate/time about task-irrelevant background stimuli, this condition is still informative as a 'baseline' (and a more typical example of a WM task).</p>
<p>(2) Throughout the manuscript, the primary measurements of neural coding pertain to task-irrelevant stimuli (the orientation/contrast of the background, which is unrelated to the animal's task to remember a spatial location). The remembered location impacts the coding of these stimulus variables, but it's unclear how this relates to WM representations themselves.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study investigates what happens to the stimulus-driven responses of V4 neurons when an item is held in working memory. Monkeys are trained to perform memory-guided saccades: they must remember the location of a visual cue and then, after a delay, make an eye movement to the remembered location. In addition, a background stimulus (a grating) is presented that varies in contrast and orientation across trials. This stimulus serves to probe the V4 responses, is present throughout the trial, and is task-irrelevant. Using this design, the authors report memory-driven changes in the LFP power spectrum, changes in synchronization between the V4 spikes and the ongoing LFP, and no significant changes in firing rate.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The logic of the experiment is nicely laid out.</p>
<p>(2) The presentation is clear and concise.</p>
<p>(3) The analyses are thorough, careful, and yield unambiguous results.</p>
<p>(4) Together, the recording and inactivation data demonstrate quite convincingly that the signal stored in FEF is communicated to V4 and that, under the current experimental conditions, the impact from FEF manifests as variations in the timing of the stimulus-evoked V4 spikes and not in the intensity of the evoked activity (i.e., firing rate).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I think there are two limitations of the study that are important for evaluating the potential functional implications of the data. If these were acknowledged and discussed, it would be easier to situate these results in the broader context of the topic, and their importance would be conveyed more fairly and transparently.</p>
<p>(1) While it may be true that no firing rate modulations were observed in this case, this may have been because the probe stimuli in the task were behaviorally irrelevant; if anything, they might have served as distracters to the monkey's actual task (the MGS). From this perspective, the lack of rate modulation could simply mean that the monkeys were successful in attending the relevant cue and shielding their performance from the potentially distracting effect of the background gratings. Had the visual probes been in some way behaviorally relevant and/or spatially localized (instead of full field), the data might have looked very different.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Any task design involves tradeoffs; if the visual stimulus was behaviorally relevant, then any observed neurophysiological changes would be more confounded by possible attentional effects. We cannot exclude the possibility that a different task or different stimuli would produce different results; we ourselves have reported firing rate enhancements for other types of visual probes during an MGS task (Merrikhi et al. 2017). We have added an acknowledgement of these limitations in the discussion section (lines 311-319). At minimum, our results show a dissociation between the top-down modulation of phase coding, which is enhanced during WM even for these task-irrelevant stimuli, and rate coding. Establishing whether and how this phase coding is related to perception and behavior will be an important direction for future work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>With this in mind, it would be prudent to dial down the tone of the conclusions, which stretch well beyond the current experimental conditions (see recommendations).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have edited the title (removing the word ‘primarily’) and key sentences throughout to tone down the conclusions, generally to state that the importance of a phase code in WM modulations is *possible* given the observed results, rather than certain (see abstract line 27, introduction lines 58-60, results line 215, conclusion lines 294-295).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Another point worth discussing is that although the FEF delay-period activity corresponds to a remembered location, it can also be interpreted as an attended location, or as a motor plan for the upcoming eye movement. These are overlapping constructs that are difficult to disentangle, but it would be important to mention them given prior studies of attentional or saccade-related modulation in V4. The firing rate modulations reported in some of those cases provide a stark contrast with the findings here, and I again suspect that the differences may be due at least in part to the differing experimental conditions, rather than a drastically different encoding mode or functional linkage between FEF and V4.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added a paragraph to the discussion section addressing links to attention and motor planning (lines 301-322), and specifically acknowledging the inherent difficulties of fully dissociating these effects when interpreting our results (lines 311-319).</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We do not believe this to be likely based on what is known anatomically and functionally about this circuitry. Anatomically, the projections from FEF to V4 arise primarily from the supragranular layers, not layers which contain the highest proportion of motor activity (Barone et al. 2000, Pouget et al. 2009, Markov et al. 2013). Functionally, based on electrical identification of V4-projecting FEF neurons, we know that FEF to V4 projections are predominantly characterized by delay rather than motor activity (Merrikhi et al. 2017). We have now tried to emphasize these points when we introduce the inactivation experiments (lines 180-182).</p>
<p>Experimentally, the spread of the pharmacological effect with our infusion system is quite large relative to any clustering of visual vs. motor neurons within the FEF, with behavioral consequences of inactivation spreading to cover a substantial portion of the visual hemifield (e.g., Noudoost et al. 2014, Clark et al. 2014), and so our manipulation lacks the spatial resolution to selectively target motor vs. other FEF neurons.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Unfortunately our chamber placement for V4 has produced linear array penetration angles which do not reliably allow identification of cortical layers. We are aware of previous results showing layer-specific effects of attention in V4 (e.g., Pettine et al. 2019, Buffalo et al. 2011), and it would indeed be interesting to determine whether our observed WM-driven changes follow similar patterns. We may be able to analyze a subset of the data with current source density analysis to look for layer-specific effects in the future, but are not able to provide any information at this time.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this report, the authors test the necessity of prefrontal cortex (specifically, FEF) activity in driving changes in oscillatory power, spike rate, and spike timing of extrastriate visual cortex neurons during a visual-spatial working memory (WM) task.

They also compared recorded signals in V4 with and without muscimol inactivation of FEF, demonstrating the importance of FEF input for WM-induced changes in oscillatory amplitude, phase coding, and information encoded about background orientations. Finally, they built a network model that can account for some of these results.

<p>Indeed, here we have focused on how maintaining spatial WM impacts visual processing of incoming sensory information, rather than on how the spatial WM signal itself is represented and maintained. Behaviorally, this impact on visual signals could be related to the effects of the content of WM on perception and reaction times (e.g., Soto et al. 2008, Awh et al. 1998, Teng et al. 2019), but no such link to behavior is shown in our data.</p>
