<title>Abstract</title><p>Identification of unique essential bacterial genes is important for not only the understanding of their cell biology but also the development of new antimicrobials. Here we report a previously unrecognized core component of the <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> divisome. Our results reveal that the protein, termed Aeg1 interacts with multiple cell division proteins, including FtsN, which is required for components of the divisome to localize to the midcell. We demonstrate that the FtsA<sub>E202K</sub> and FtsB<sub>E65A</sub> mutants effectively bypassed the need of Aeg1 by <italic>A</italic>. <italic>baumannii</italic>, as did the activation variants FtsW<sub>M254I</sub> and FtsW<sub>S274G</sub>. Our results suggest that Aeg1 is a cell division protein that arrives at the division site to initiate cell division by recruiting FtsN, which activates FtsQLB and FtsA to induce the septal peptidoglycan synthase FtsWI. The discovery of the new essential cell division protein has provided a new target for the development of antibacterial agents.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> is a Gram-negative bacterial pathogen that causes a wide variety of nosocomial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>), including urinary tract infections, gastrointestinal and skin/wound infections and secondary meningitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). The challenge posed by this pathogen is compounded by the emergence of isolates that are resistant to almost all of the available antibiotics, including some of the last resort for treatment of infections caused by bacterial pathogens, including colistin, tigecycline, and carbapenems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). As a result, the World Health Organization (WHO) has classified <italic>A. baumannii</italic> as a pathogen for which new antibiotics are urgently needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Meeting this challenge requires the discovery of antimicrobials of new mechanisms with action or other mitigation strategies that enable reduction of disease burden caused by this pathogen.</p>
<p>Historically, the discovery of antibiotics was largely based on the search for secondary metabolites produced by soil-dwelling microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). The majority of clinically used antibiotic classes originate from soil bacteria, including lactams, aminoglycosides, polymyxins, and glycopeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Unfortunately, natural products discovery is now plagued by problems of so-called ‘dereplication problem’, wherein rediscovery of molecules or their close relatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). As a result, there has not been a novel antibiotic discovered in over 30 years using traditional methods of screening environmental samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). The overuse of these merely variants of existing compounds has further accelerated the problem associated with antibiotic resistance. Thus, identification of novel therapeutic targets in the pathogen may serve as an effective alternative to the problem.</p>
<p>A better understanding of gene function associated with <italic>A. baumannii</italic> pathogenesis and biology will provide us strategies to develop antibiotics with potentially novel mechanisms of action. One extensively explored avenue in this regard is the identification of previously unrecognized essential genes by methods enabled by new DNA sequencing technologies, including insertion sequencing (INSeq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>), transposon sequencing (Tn-seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), transposon-directed insertion site sequencing (TraDIS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), and high-throughput insertion tracking sequencing (HITS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Application of these methods has identified genes believed to be required for bacterial viability under various conditions in such important pathogens as <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>) and <italic>A. baumannii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>).</p>
<p>Similar to candidate genes identified by other methods, putative essential genes obtained by In-seq were deduced from sequencing results of surviving mutants, some of which can be false positives or negatives due to unsaturated mutant libraries or polar effects on downstream genes of the insertion sites. Using In-seq Wang et al identified 453 candidate essential genes for the growth of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> strain ATCC 17978 on rich medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Among these, genes annotated as hypotheticals with orthologs in other taxonomically distant microorganisms are of particular interest because their potential role in cellular processes that can be explored as targets for the development of novel antimicrobials. We thus set out to test a subgroup of the predicted essential genes by a conditional gene deletion strategy based on the arabinose inducible promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). From ten genes examined, three were found to be essential for <italic>A. baumannii</italic> viability on rich medium. Further study revealed that one of these genes codes for a novel bacterial cell division protein.</p>

<title>Identification of genes required for <italic>A. baumannii</italic> viability</title>
<p>Analysis of strains of <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, including the model strain 17978 by In-seq technologies have led to the identification of at least 453 genes potentially required for bacterial growth on rich medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Whereas many of these genes are involved in known cellular processes fundamental for cell viability such as DNA replication, transcription and translation, some code for proteins of unknown activity, are thus of great interest as potentially new antimicrobial targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). To determine the function of the candidate essential genes annotated as hypotheticals, we first confirmed their essentiality by a conditional gene deletion method. To this end, we employed a set of plasmids that allow inducible gene expression in <italic>A. baumannii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Each gene of interest was expressed from the arabinose-inducible promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>), and the corresponding gene was deleted from the chromosome by the standard allele exchange method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Chromosomal deletion mutants harboring the arabinose-inducible gene were tested for essentiality by spotting serially diluted cells onto solid medium with or without arabinose (ara) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). If the gene of interest is essential, the bacterium should fail to grow on plates without ara.</p>

<p>Our initial analysis of 10 genes (<bold>Supplementary Files 1</bold>) identified <italic>A1S_0137</italic>, <italic>A1S_2249</italic>, and <italic>A1S_3387</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>) that met the criteria of being required for growth on LB agar (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Importantly, gene <italic>A1S_3387</italic> is also essential for <italic>A. baumannii</italic> growth in the Vogel-Bonner minimal medium with succinate (VBS) as the sole carbon source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1-figure supplement 1</xref>). These genes were thus designated as <italic><underline>A</underline>. baumannii</italic> <underline>e</underline>ssential <underline>g</underline>enes (Aeg) and Aeg1 (<italic>A1S_3387</italic>) was chosen for detailed study.</p>
<p>Sequence analysis revealed that Aeg1 has orthologs in a number of Gram-negative bacteria, including <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> members of the <italic>Moraxellaceae</italic> family and some strains of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, with sequence similarity ranging from 80% to identical (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1-figure supplement 2</xref>). Aeg1 is predicted to harbor a single transmembrane domain, however, the precise location of this transmembrane segment has been predicted differently across various analyses. SMART Web site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>) predicted the transmembrane region to be located at the N-terminus of Aeg1 (7-29 aa). In contrast, Phobius, based on HMM suggested the transmembrane segment is situated more centrally within the Aeg1 protein (134-151 aa), and further proposed that the N-terminus may correspond to a signal peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Regardless of the specific transmembrane topology prediction, the N-terminal region of Aeg1 appears to be a critical domain. Therefore, to further elucidate the structural and functional importance of the Aeg1 close to its N-terminus end, we employed a dual inducible system with two compatible plasmids that use promoters that respond to ara and isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), respectively. Strain Δ<italic>aeg1</italic>(P<sub>BAD</sub>::Aeg1, P<sub>TAC</sub>::Aeg1) was able to grow on medium containing 1% ara or 0.5 mM IPTG (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>) indicating that the chromosomal deletion can be complemented by either of the constructs when expression of Aeg1 was induced. Importantly, expression of the Aeg1 mutant lacking N-terminal region was unable to restore the growth of the strain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>), suggesting that N-terminal domain of Aeg1 is essential for its activity.</p>

<title>Depletion of Aeg1 caused cell filamentation in <italic>A. baumannii</italic></title>
<p>We next examined the morphology of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> lacking Aeg1 by optical and scanning electron microscopy. Cultures of strain Δ<italic>aeg1</italic>(P<sub>BAD</sub>::Aeg1) were induced by ara for 14 h, cells diluted into fresh LB with or without ara were allowed to grow for 18 h. We found that cells of cultures grown in medium containing 1% ara exhibited a short rod cell shape similar to that of the wild-type strain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). In medium without ara most cells of strain Δ<italic>aeg1</italic>(P<sub>BAD</sub>::Aeg1) displayed an elongated morphology which is in sharp contrast to those of wild-type cells grew under identical conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Quantitative analysis indicated that in medium supplemented with ara, more than 95% of the cells of strain Δ<italic>aeg1</italic>(P<sub>BAD</sub>::Aeg1) were shorter than 5 μm. Incubation in medium without ara for 18 h caused more than 96% of the cells to become elongated with cell lengths ranging from 5 μm to over 10 μm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). The phenotype can be partially reversed after growing the elongated cells in medium containing 1% ara for 4 h (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). These results indicate that depletion of Aeg1 causes cell elongation, a phenotype that had been observed in recent studies using transposon insertion sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>).</p>

<title>Mutations in the cell division gene <italic>ftsA</italic> bypasses the requirement of Aeg1</title>
<p>To explore the cellular process participated by Aeg1, we sought to isolate suppressor mutants that can survive in standard medium under conditions the gene is not expressed. To this end, cells of strain Δ<italic>aeg1</italic>(P<sub>BAD</sub>::Aeg1) grown in medium supplemented with ara were exposed to the mutagen ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), and the treated cells were plated on LB agar without ara. A few colonies were obtained from approximately 6×10<sup>8</sup> cells and two independent mutants M1 and M2 were chosen for further analysis. In spotting assays using diluted cells, each of these two mutants derived from strain Δ<italic>aeg1</italic>(P<sub>BAD</sub>::Aeg1) was able to grow on medium without ara at rates comparable to those of wild-type bacteria (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). We then performed whole genome sequencing analysis of these two mutants, which revealed that M1 and M2 had 320 and 328 substitution mutations, respectively. In addition, 659 insertion-deletion (InDel) mutations were found in M1 and 665 such mutations were associated with M2 <bold>(Supplementary Files 2)</bold>.</p>

<p>Because depletion of Aeg1 caused cell elongation, we first examined mutated genes whose functions are known to be involved in cell division. An E202K mutation caused by a G to A substitution in the first position of the codon was found in the cell division protein FtsA in both M1 and M2 (<bold>Supplementary Files 2</bold>). We thus verified the suppression phenotype by introducing a plasmid expressing FtsA or FtsA<sub>E202K</sub> into strain Δ<italic>aeg1</italic>(P<sub>BAD</sub>::Aeg1) and examined the growth of the resulting bacterial strains under different induction conditions. Expression of FtsA<sub>E202K</sub> allowed strain Δ<italic>aeg1</italic>(P<sub>BAD</sub>::Aeg1) to gain the ability to grow in the absence of ara. In contrast, although the protein was expressed at a comparable level, FtsA cannot suppress the growth defect caused by Aeg1 depletion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Consistent with the growth phenotypes, expression of FtsA<sub>E202K</sub> in strain Δ<italic>aeg1</italic>(P<sub>BAD</sub>::Aeg1) under conditions in which the complementation gene was not expressed displayed a morphology similar to that of wild-type bacteria (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies have found that several mutations in FtsA bypassed the requirement of a number of essential cell division proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic>, including ZipA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>), FtsK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>), and FtsN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Among these, FtsA<sub>R286W</sub> (FtsA*) was the first gain-of-function mutation found in <italic>E. coli</italic>, which allowed the survival of mutants lacking ZipA (Δ<italic>zipA</italic>) or FtsK (Δ<italic>ftsK</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Additionally, FtsA<sub>I143L</sub>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>) and FtsA<sub>E124A</sub>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>) weakly bypassed the requirement of FtsN. These mutations also rescued the FtsL<sub>L86F/E87K</sub> mutant when overexpressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). We thus examined whether similar mutations in FtsA of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> can bypass the need of Aeg1 by constructing substitution FtsA mutants D124A, V144L and Q285W, which correspond to E124A, I143L, and R286W in its <italic>E. coli</italic> counterpart, respectively (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3-figure supplement 1</xref>) and tested them in strain Δ<italic>aeg1</italic>(P<sub>BAD</sub>::Aeg1). Whereas FtsA<sub>Q285W</sub> cannot detectably suppress Aeg1 depletion, expression of FtsA<sub>D124A</sub> or FtsA<sub>V144L</sub> partially resecured the growth of strain Δ<italic>aeg1</italic>(P<sub>BAD</sub>::Aeg1) in medium without ara (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Despite multiple attempts, we were unable to detect the expression of these FtsA mutants by immunoblotting using antibody specific to the Flag epitope fused to these alleles (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref><bold>, lower panels</bold>), suggesting that the low activity exhibited by these mutants may result from low protein levels.</p>
<p>The observation that mutations in genes involved in cell division bypass the need of Aeg1 suggests that this protein participate in the same cellular process. We thus analyzed the cellular localization of Aeg1 in <italic>A. baumannii</italic> by introducing a plasmid that expresses Aeg1-mCherry from the P<sub>BAD</sub> promoter. Fluorescence microscopy analysis revealed that Aeg1 localized at the septum of dividing cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>), which validated the genetic evidence for its role in cell division.</p>

<title>Aeg1 interacts with multiple core components of the <italic>A. baumannii</italic> divisome</title>
<p>To further explore the possibility that Aeg1 is a component of the <italic>A. baumannii</italic> divisome, we determined its interactions with known cell division proteins using the Cya-based bacterial two-hybrid method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). Effective complementation between the fused T25 and T18 domains requires their localization to the cytoplasmic compartment. Because the predicted transmembrane topology of Aeg1 is not unequivocal, with one model suggesting an N-terminal transmembrane segment and another proposing a more centrally located membrane-spanning domain. To circumvent potential artifacts arising from the ambiguous topological models of Aeg1, we generated two distinct fusion constructs, tethering the T25 domain to either the N-terminus or C-terminus of the Aeg1 protein. We then assessed the complementation between these Aeg1-T25 fusions and the potential binding partners fused to the T18 domain to evaluate the interaction between Aeg1 and other Fts proteins. Among the tested proteins FtsZ, FtsA, ZipA, FtsK, FtsQ, FtsL, FtsB, FtsW, FtsI, and FtsN, Aeg1 detectably interacts with ZipA, FtsK, FtsL, FtsB, and FtsN. Intriguingly, ZipA and FtsN appearing to have higher binding affinity with Aeg1 whether the T25 reporter domain was fused to the N-terminus or C-terminus of the Aeg1 construct (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-D</xref>), as indicated by the hydrolysis of X-gal by derivatives of the <italic>E. coli</italic> reporter strain BTH101 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>) harboring appropriate protein fusions. When the interactions were quantitatively determined by measuring galactosidase activity, the binding of FtsN or ZipA to Aeg1 appeared the strongest among all examined protein pairs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-D</xref>). This observation suggests that the precise topology of Aeg1 does not significantly impact its ability to engage these binding partners.</p>

<p>We next analyzed the localization of putative Aeg1-interacting proteins identified in our bacterial two-hybrid experiments. To this end, we coexpressed the mCherry-Aeg1 fusion with GFP fusion of ZipA, FtsL, FtsB, or FtsN in the WT strain from the ara- and IPTG-inducible promoter, respectively. Prior to localization studies, we first sought to examine the functionality of the GFP fusions by individually deleting the chromosomal gene of <italic>zipA, ftsB</italic>, <italic>ftsL,</italic> and <italic>ftsN</italic> in <italic>A. baumannii</italic> strains expressing the fusion proteins from a plasmid. Our results indicate that each GFP fusion was capable of complementing the growth defects caused by deleting the corresponding gene (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4-figure supplement 1A</xref>). Similarly, we found that expression of the mCherry-Aeg1 fusion allowed the deletion of the <italic>aeg1</italic> gene (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4-figure supplement 1B</xref>). In each case, the growth of the strain expressing the fusion protein complementing the chromosomal deletion was comparable to that of the wild-type strain (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4-figure supplement 1A</xref>). These strains were then used in experiments aiming at investigating the localization of the relevant proteins. Saturated cultures of strains derived from WT(P<sub>BAD</sub>::mCherry-Aeg1) (grown for 16 h) that harbored the GFP fusions were diluted into fresh LB broth. When the cell density of the subcultures reached OD<sub>600</sub>=0.6, IPTG (0.25 mM) or ara (0.25%) were added to induce the expression of fusion proteins for 4 h and samples were processed for microscopic analysis. Consistent with results from the protein interaction experiments using the bacterial two-hybrid assay, we found that Aeg1 colocalized with ZipA, FtsL, FtsB, and FtsN <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref><bold>, red arrows)</bold>, but occasional non-co-localization was also observed <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref><bold>, white arrows)</bold>.

<title>Aeg1 is an essential core cell division protein in <italic>A. baumannii</italic></title>
<p>The interaction map between Aeg1 and core divisome proteins prompted us to postulate that the absence of Aeg1 prevented these proteins from localizing to the midcell. To test this hypothesis, we introduced plasmids that direct the expression of GFP fusion of each of the divisome proteins into strain Δ<italic>aeg1</italic>(P<sub>BAD</sub>::mCherry-Aeg1). We evaluated the protein of Aeg1-mCherry at 2, 4, and 6 h after withdrawing arabinose and found that at the 2 h and 4 h time points mCherry-Aeg1 was still readily detectable (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5-figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, we found that removal of arabinose for 6 h rendered Aeg1-mCherry undetectable in approximately 90% of the cells. We thus used the 6 h inducer withdraw to examine the effects of Aeg1 depletion. In cells depleted of Aeg1, all of the examined core division proteins displayed midcell mistargeting, including ZipA, FtsB, FtsL, and FtsN (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). These results suggest that Aeg1 is a new member of cell division protein, which plays a role in positioning several other core proteins at the septum of <italic>A. baumannii</italic>.</p>

</fig>
<p>During the formation of the divisome, FtsN was believed to be the last protein being recruited to the septum where it converts FtsQLB and FtsA into their active forms, which subsequently activate the septal peptidoglycan synthase FtsWI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). If the interaction between Aeg1 and FtsN is critical for the ability of the latter to switch on FtsQLB and FtsA, constitutively active mutants of FtsQLB or FtsA should suppress the need of Aeg1 for cell viability. To test this hypothesis, we expressed HA-FtsB<sub>E65A</sub> and HA-FtsL<sub>Q70K</sub> of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> (equivalent to mutants of their <italic>E. coli</italic> counterparts that allow the bypass of the requirement of FtsN) (<xref rid="fig5s2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5-figure supplement 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>) in strain Δ<italic>aeg1</italic>(P<sub>BAD</sub>::Aeg1) on medium without ara. Although the expression of HA-FtsB<sub>E65A</sub> was not detectable with the HA-specific antibody, induction of this mutant completely restored the growth of the Δ<italic>aeg1</italic> mutant in the absence of Aeg1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). In contrast, a similarly constructed plasmid that directs the expression of HA-FtsB<sub>D68H</sub> cannot bypass the requirement of Aeg1 under the same conditions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Similarly expressed HA-FtsL<sub>Q70K</sub> detectably rescued bacterial growth without Aeg1 at a level considerably lower than that of FtsB<sub>E65A</sub> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). The low or undetectable activity exhibited by FtsL<sub>Q70K</sub> and FtsB<sub>D68H</sub> may result from the low protein levels in strain Δ<italic>aeg1</italic>(P<sub>BAD</sub>::Aeg1). Nevertheless, these results support our hypothesis that Aeg1 functions upstream of FtsN, probably by functioning as its activator or recruiting factor. It is known that expression of mutants FtsI<sub>K211I</sub>, FtsW<sub>M269I</sub>, and FtsW<sub>E289G</sub> driven by a strong promoter can bypass the need of FtsN in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). The ability of FtsB<sub>E65A</sub> and FtsA<sub>E202K</sub> to suppress the growth defect of the Δ<italic>aeg1</italic> mutant prompted us to examine whether constitutively active alleles of FtsW or FtsI have the same effects. Overexpression of FtsW<sub>M254I</sub> and FtsW<sub>S274G</sub> of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> detectably rescued the growth of the strain in which Aeg1 had been depleted (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). FtsI from <italic>A. baumannii</italic> does not have a residue corresponding to K211 of its <italic>E. coli</italic> counterpart (<xref rid="fig5s2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5-figure supplement 2</xref>), we thus did not test the effect of this mutation. Therefore, our results demonstrate that Aeg1 may collaborate with FtsN to activate at least a part of FtsQLB and FtsA for subsequently activation of FtsWI during cell division. Together with results that the variant FtsA<sub>E202K</sub> suppressed the growth defect caused by <italic>aeg1</italic> depletion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), these observations support a model in which the Aeg1-FtsN complex is involved in the activation of FtsQLB and FtsA.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Powerful In-seq DNA sequencing technologies based on saturated transposon insertion libraries have allowed the identification of genes essential for bacterial viability under specific conditions, including commonly used rich media such as LB broth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Using a conditional gene deletion method, we have revealed that from 10 putative essential genes identified by this method, three previously annotated as hypotheticals are essential for <italic>A. baumannii</italic> viability, suggesting that assignment of essentiality to genes identified by methods of this kind needs to be individually verified.</p>
<p>Our assignment of <italic>aeg1</italic> as an essential gene is consistent with a recent study which revealed its essentiality (termed <italic>advA</italic>) by transposon insertion sequencing, which also observed cell elongation upon the depletion of this gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Our results provided at least two additional lines of evidence to support the notion that Aeg1 is a core cell division protein in <italic>A. baumannii</italic>. First, random suppression mutations that bypassed the requirement of Aeg1 mapped to a classic cell division gene and mutations in some cell division genes known to circumvent the need of specific cell division proteins rescued the growth defect caused by Aeg1 depletion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Second, Aeg1 interacts with at least a subset of proteins involved in cell division (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-D</xref>).</p>
<p>In the process of bacterial cell division, over 30 distinct proteins are assembled into a complex typically referred to as “divisome” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). Ten of these are normally essential for both cell division and survival, and they are now mainly suggested to be the core of the divisome in various bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). These essential division proteins are mostly named Fts (filamentation temperature sensitive), which stems from the fact that inactivating one of these <italic>fts</italic> genes causes cells to become filamentous, which eventually failed to survive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Among these, the FtsQLB complex not only serves as a scaffold for recruitment of subsequent divisome proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>), but also plays an important role in regulating the activity of the divisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). The constriction control domain (CCD) of FtsL was previously defined as a critical component for switching the conformation of FtsLB from an off to an on state in order to activate FtsWI by enabling the interaction between FtsI<sup>peri</sup> and the AWI (activation of FtsWI) region of FtsL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). Division obstruction caused by Aeg1 depletion can be effectively circumvented by suppression mutations (FtsB<sub>E65A</sub>) in its CCD domain and by activation mutations (M254I and S274G) of FtsW (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>), suggesting that Aeg1 functions upstream of these proteins.</p>
<p>In addition to FtsQLB-mediated activation of FtsI in the periplasm, the constitutively active form of FtsA (FtsA*) acting on FtsW in the cytoplasm, these two events functions synergistically to activate FtsWI for sPG synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). FtsA is a member of the actin family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>), which interacts with FtsN via a unique IC domain positioned between the IA and IIA domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). Little is known about the function of the IA and IIA domains of FtsA. That the E202K mutation in the IIA domain bypasses the requirement of Aeg1 by <italic>A. baumannii</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>) suggests that Aeg1 and FtsA work together to activate FtsW.</p>
<p>The maturation of the core divisome is facilitated by the recruitment in a nearly sequential order of the late-division proteins FtsK, FtsQ, FtsL/FtsB, FtsW, FtsI, and FtsN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). Once the latest division protein, FtsN, is recruited, division-specific peptidoglycan synthesis conferred by the FtsWI complex is activated to build the septum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). More recent studies suggest that by binding to FtsA, a small amount of FtsN is recruited to the division site earlier than previously thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>) where it induces a conformational switch in both FtsA and the FtsQLB subcomplex on both sides of the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Furthermore, binding between FtsA and FtsN is regulated by ZipA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). Our observation of strong binding of Aeg1 to ZipA and FtsN (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-D</xref>) prompted us to propose a model in which Aeg1 participates in cell division by anchoring to the division site together with ZipA where it recruits FtsN, which in turn signals to both the cytoplasmic or periplasmic branches of peptidoglycan synthesis involving FtsA and the FtsQLB complex, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). The placement of Aeg1 as one of the early arrivals in the hierarchical sequential assembly of the divisome is consistent with the fact that the requirement of Aeg1 can be bypassed by constitutively active mutants of FtsA<sub>E202K</sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), FtsB (FtsB<sub>E65A</sub>), FtsL (FtsL<sub>Q70K</sub>) and of FtsW (FtsW<sub>M254I</sub> and FtsW<sub>S274G</sub>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>

<p>In the early stages of Z-ring assembly, anchor proteins FtsA and ZipA tether FtsZ to the inner face of the plasma membrane. In the initial phase of cell division, a small amount of FtsN is recruited to the divisome in a FtsA-dependent manner <bold>(left, recruitment phase)</bold> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>). The Aeg1-ZipA-FtsN complex acts as a dynamic scaffold for recruiting downstream of Fts proteins. Once more FtsN is recruited to the divisome, it will activate both FtsA and the FtsQLB complex, which in turn activates FtsI in the periplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Note that constitutively active form of FtsA (FtsA*) acts on FtsW in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>) so did the hyperactive mutants FtsA<sub>E202K</sub>.

This manipulation replaced the Flag tag on pJL02 with an HA tag. pJL03 is a pVRL1-based plasmid harboring P<sub>BAD,</sub> which allows expressing Flag-tagged proteins in <italic>A. baumannii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>).</p>
<p>The DNA fragment were amplified from genomic DNA of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> strain and digested with appropriate restriction enzyme <bold>(Supplementary Files 3)</bold>, following insert into similarly digested plasmids. The experimental procedure entails fusion of the GFP gene with the target gene, followed by ligation of the resulting construct into the pJL05 vector for subsequent expression.</p>

<title>Introduction of plasmids into <italic>A. baumannii</italic></title>
<p>Plasmids were introduced into <italic>A. baumannii</italic> by electroporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>) or by triparental mating. Electrocompetent cells were prepared using a previously described protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>) with minor modifications. Briefly, saturated cultures of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> were diluted 1:100 into 50 mL LB medium to grow for 18 h at 37°C and cells were harvested by centrifugation (4000<italic>g</italic>) at room temperature (RT) for 5 min. Cells were washed twice with 10 mL of 10% glycerol, resuspended in 1 mL of 10% glycerol, cells aliquoted in 50 μL. were stored at -80°C. For transformation, 1 μg of plasmid DNA was mixed with 50 μL competent cells and electroporation was performed in 0.2-cm cuvettes on a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser system (2.5 kV/cm, 25 μF, 200 Ω).</p>
<p>The <italic>E. coli</italic> MT607 harboring pRK600 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>) was used for triparental mating. Briefly, 100 μL of overnight cultures of the donor, recipient, and the helper strain were mixed and cells were harvest by centrifugation (4000<italic>g</italic>) for 5 min. Mixed cells washed twice with 1 mL of sterile water were spotted onto LB agar and the mating was allowed to proceeded for 4-6 h at 37°C before plating onto selective medium.</p>

<title>Construction of in-frame deletion mutants of <italic>A. baumannii</italic></title>
<p>To delete the putative essential genes, we first introduced a plasmid expressing the gene of interest into <italic>A. baumannii</italic> and the resulting strains were used to construct chromosomal deletion mutants using a method based on the suicide plasmid pSR47s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Briefly, the coding region of the gene was inserted into pJL03, which allows expression of Flag-tagged protein from the P<sub>BAD</sub> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) and the resulting plasmid was introduced into <italic>A. baumannii</italic> by electroporation. Strains in which the chromosomal deletion is complemented by GFP or mCherry fusions of the relevant Fts proteins were similarly constructed.</p>
<p>To construct the plasmid used for in-frame deletion of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> genes, 1.0 kilobase DNA fragment was amplified from the upstream and downstream of the gene to delete, respectively, digested with appropriate restriction enzymes and inserted into similarly digested pSR47s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). The primers were designed so that in each case the gene to be deleted was replaced with an open reading frame consisting of the first and last 15 residues linked by two amino acids encoded by the sequence of the restriction enzyme used to fuse the two DNA fragments (<bold>Supplementary Files 3</bold>). The plasmid was then introduced into the <italic>A. baumannii</italic> strain harboring the pJL03 derivative expressing the gene to be deleted from the P<sub>BAD</sub> promoter by triparental mating. Transconjugants obtained on LB agar containing 1% ara were grown in LB broth containing 5% sucrose for 18 h prior to being streaked onto LB agar supplemented with 5% sucrose. Deletion mutants were identified by colony PCR with primers corresponding to the 5’ end of the upstream fragment and the 3’ of the downstream fragments.</p>

<title>Ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis</title>
<p>The <italic>A. baumannii</italic> strain Δ<italic>aeg1</italic>(P<sub>BAD</sub>::Aeg1) was grown in LB broth containing 1% ara to saturation, cells from 2-mL culture collected by centrifugation were washed twice with cold buffer A [60 mM K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 33 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 7.6 mM (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 1.7 mM sodium citrate, PH=7]. Cells resuspended in 2x buffer A supplemented with 1.4% EMS were incubated in a shaker (220 rpm) at 37°C for 15 min for 30 min, 45 min and 60 min, respectively. Treated cells harvested by centrifugation were washed twice with buffer A prior to being plated onto LB agar supplemented with 5% glucose. Colonies appeared were purified and tested by spotting diluted cells onto LB agar with or without ara, respectively to confirm the ability to grown in the absence Aeg1. To eliminate the possibility that the ara-independent growth phenotype was due to mutations in the P<sub>BAD</sub> promoter, the plasmid from each mutant candidate was rescued and the promoter region was sequenced. Only mutants harboring an intact P<sub>BAD</sub> promoter were retained for further study.</p>
<p>Genome sequencing was performed by Suzhou Golden Wisdom Biological Technology Co., Ltd, and mutations were identified using the genome of the parent strain ATCC 17978 as reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>).</p>

<title>Bacterial Two-Hybrid assays</title>
<p>To assess interactions between Aeg1 and <italic>A. baumannii</italic> Fts proteins, we employed the <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic> adenylate cyclase (Cya)-based bacterial two-hybrid system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). The coding region of Aeg1 was fused to the T25 fragment of Cya and testing Fts proteins were individually fused to the T18 fragment on pUT18C-Flag, which allows the detection of the fusion protein with the Flag-specific antibody (<bold>Supplementary Files 3</bold>). Interaction was evaluated in the cya<sup>-</sup> <italic>E. coli</italic> strain BTH101 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>) by the ability of the testing strains to hydrolyze X-Gal. Quantitative measurement of β-galactosidase activity with performed with ortho-nitrophenyl-β-galactoside (ONPG) using an established protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>). Testing bacterial strains were cultured in 2 mL LB broth containing 0.5 mM IPTG for 18 h, and 0.2 mL cells were harvest and resuspended in 1 mL Z-buffer (60 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 40 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>·H<sub>2</sub>O, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 10 mM KCl, and 7 mL of 2-mercaptoethanol per liter). After adding 50 µL 1% (m/v) SDS and 100 μL of chloroform, cells were lysed by 30 s vortex and 50 μL of ONPG (40 mg/mL) was added. The reaction was terminated with 500 µL of 1 M Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> after ONPG hydrolysis had occurred as determined the presence of the yellow color product. β-galactosidase activity is defined as in Miller units using the following equation: (OD<sub>420</sub>×1000)/ [(time of incubation in min)x(volume of cell suspension in mL)x(cell density of the culture in OD<sub>600</sub>)]. All assays were done in triplicate.</p>

<title>Antibodies and immunoblotting</title>
<p>HA-specific antibody (1:1000) was purchased from Santa Cruz (Cat #sc-7392), and rabbit anti-ICDH (1:2000) was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). To prepare protein samples, we diluted (1:100) saturated bacterial cultures into fresh LB broth. When OD<sub>600</sub> of the cultures reached 0.6, IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. Approximately 1×10<sup>9</sup> cells were collected, resuspended in 100 μL SDS sample buffer and were boiled for 5 min. Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, which were first blocked with 5% nonfat milk for 1 h followed by incubation with appropriate primary antibodies for 14 h. Washed membranes were incubated with the appropriate IRDye-labeled secondary antibodies and signals were detected using an Odyssey CLx system (LI-COR).</p>

<title>Fluorescence imaging</title>
<p>To determine the cellular localization of Aeg1 and its colocalization with members of the divisome, we constructed pJL03::Aeg1-mCherry, which expressed the fusion from the P<sub>BAD</sub> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). GFP chimera of Fts proteins were expressed from pJL05 driven by the P<sub>TAC</sub> promoter inducible by IPTG. Each of the GFP-Fts fusion was introduced into strain WT(P<sub>BAD</sub>::mCherry-Aeg1).</p>
<p>To visualize the localization of the fusions, bacterial strains were grown to saturation in LB broth containing ara and the cells washed twice with PBS were diluted to a density of approximately 5×10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL. The cultures were split into two 2-mL subcultures, the one used to determine how the absence of Aeg1 impacted the cellular localization of Fts proteins received only IPTG but not ara. Cultures were incubated in a shaker for an additional 6 h, and 100 μL cells were withdrawn and fixed by incubation in glutaraldehyde for 20 min at RT. After washing twice with PBS, samples were stained with Hoechst 33342 (1:5000) (Invitrogen, cat#H3570) and mounted on slides for observation with an Olympus IX-83 fluorescence microscope.</p>

<p>This <bold>useful</bold> study shows that the essential Acinetobacter baumannii gene Aeg1 likely plays an key role in cell division. The strength of the work is the discovery that the depletion of Aeg1 leads to cell filamentation and that gain-of-function mutations in cell division genes FtsB and FtsL rescue the lethality of Aeg1 depletion. However, Aeg1's localization pattern and its requirement for other division proteins' localizations require further characterization of the functionality of fluorescent fusion proteins, fluorescence images of higher quality, and improvements in statistic qualifications, leaving the study' evidence for Aeg1's exact role in cell division <bold>incomplete</bold> at this time. In conclusion, the critical role of Aeg1 in the assembly of the A. baumannii divisome has yet to be established unambiguously.</p>

<p>In this study, the authors confirm that one of the genes classified as essential in a Tn-mutagenesis study in A. baumannii, Aeg1, is, in fact, an essential gene. The strength of the work is that it discovered that the depletion of Aeg1 leads to cell filamentation and that activation mutations in various cell division genes can suppress the requirement for Aeg1. These results suggest that Aeg1 plays an important role in cell division. The work's weakness is that it lacks convincing evidence to define Aeg1's place or role in the divisome assembly pathway. It is unclear whether proteins are at the division site under the wildtype condition and when Aeg1 is depleted, and whether Aeg1 is indeed required for a set of division proteins to the division site.</p>
<p>Reviewer comments:</p>
<p>The revised manuscript partially addressed two of the three major concerns from the previous assessment: (1) the functionality test of fluorescent fusion proteins using a spotting assay, and (2) membrane protein topology in the bacterial two-hybrid assays by constructing a C-terminal T25 fusion.</p>
<p>(1) In the spotting assay, all fluorescent fusion proteins rescued the growth of the corresponding deletion strain, which suggests these fusion proteins are functional. However, fluorescent images of these fusion proteins were diffusive, and only a few cells showed the expected midcell/membrane localization pattern for cell division proteins. This observation raised the concern that these fusion proteins may be cleaved in the middle, leading to the separation of the untagged fusion partner and diffusive fluorescent protein in the cytoplasm, which would explain the positive spotting rescue results. This phenomenon is commonly observed in other bacterial species. A western blot using an antibody targeting either the fluorescent protein or the fusion partner is widely used to examine whether the fusion protein is expressed at its full length.</p>
<p>(2) The authors constructed a C-terminal fusion of Aeg1 and showed that it still interacted with ZipA and FtsN. This result supports the authors' suggestion that the N-terminus of Aeg1 may not be the predicated membrane-targeting domain. Along the same line, the membrane topology of ZipA should also be considered. ZipA's N terminus is in the membrane facing the periplasm, and its C terminal domain is in the cytoplasm. Therefore, the PUT18C fusion will place the T18 domain of ZipA in the periplasm. All other division proteins' N termini are in the cytoplasm.</p>
<p>(3) Colocalization images did not show significant midcell localizations for each fluorescent protein; most cells showed diffusive cytoplasmic fluorescence. In all other species, midcell localization of cell division proteins is prominent in dividing cells, especially for early division proteins such as ZipA (at least 40-50% of cells show midcell bands). In A. baumannii, divisome localization timing may differ from other species, but this possibility needs to be established before the colocalization pattern is examined. Compounding this issue is that in Aeg1 depletion strains, some cells expressing ZipA, FtsB, FtsL, and FtsN fusions showed roughly regularly spaced puncta in long filamentous cells. It is hard to explain why this was observed if, under the WT condition, these fusions do not localize to the midcell. These results again raised concerns that these fusion proteins may not be functional and the observations are protein aggregates.</p>
<p>Besides these major issues, experimental observations did not support some claims in the main text. For example: (1) In the two-hybrid assay, only ZipA and FtsN showed significant interactions with Aeg1, as judged by the darkness of the blue spots. FtsL and FtsB showed pale spots. The quantified values accompanying this figure did not appear to agree with the image. (2) The spotting rescue assay showed that only FtsB-E56A and FtsA-E202K was able to bypass Aeg1 depletion (full dilution set comparable to that of Aeg1 complementation), but the main text claimed that FtsA-D124A and V144L, and FtsW-M254I and S274G also rescued the growth. These claims could be misleading.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) The reviewers asked to clarify the BTH assay: The fused T25 and T18 domains must be in the cytoplasmic to complement successfully. The authors stated that the N terminus of Aeg1 transverses the membrane once, which means that the T25-Aeg1 will have T25 in the periplasm. However, T18C vector fusion with other division proteins will have T18C of ZipA in the periplasm (ZipA's N terminus is on the periplasmic side of the inner membrane) while that of FtsN in the cytoplasm (FtsN's N terminus is in the cytoplasm). As such, it isn't easy to understand why T25-Aeg1 showed positive results for both ZipA and FtsN. Note that FtsL, FtsB, and FtsI all have the same topology as FtsN but showed negative results. It is possible that these fusion proteins do not fold correctly, and hence, the results cannot be interpreted directly. The authors did not address this concern but only cited that BTH is a commonly used assay for protein-protein interactions.</p>

<p>In response to the editor's comments and the concerns raised by the reviewer, we have performed two sets of Aeg1-T25 fusion experiments to determine whether the Aeg1 topology impacts protein interactions measured by bacterial two-hybrid (BTH) assays. In the first set of experiments, we fused the T25 domain to the N-terminus of Aeg1 and still observed strong binding of Aeg1 to ZipA and FtsN, respectively. Similar results were obtained from the second set of experiments in which the T25 domain was fused to the C-terminus of Aeg1.</p>
<p>These results indicate that the precise topology of Aeg1 does not significantly impact its ability to engage these binding partners. Aeg1 is predicted to harbor a single transmembrane domain, however, the precise location of this transmembrane segment differs in predictions made by different algorithms. The SMART Web site (1) predicted the transmembrane region to be located at the N-terminus of Aeg1 (7-29 aa). In contrast, Phobius, based on HMM （2， 3）suggested the transmembrane segment is situated more centrally within the Aeg1 protein (134-151 aa), and further proposed that the N-terminus may function as a signal peptide. This latter prediction also provides a potential explanation for the larger-than-expected molecular weight of the Aeg1 truncation mutant observed in the Western blot shown in Fig 1C. The removal of the putative signal peptide may have altered the protein structure, affecting its electrophoretic mobility. As a result, we are more inclined to favor the topology model for Aeg1 predicted by Phobius.</p>

<p>(2) It is still difficult to identify the midcell localization patterns of Aeg1 and other division proteins from microscopy images (Fig. 4C and Fig. 5A). In Fig 4C, only ZipA and Aeg1 formed clear, regular band-like colocalization patterns. Others formed irregular co-localized puncta along the cell length, different from the expected midcell localization patterns. Cells also appeared to be much longer than WT cells, suggesting cell division defects. The most likely reason for these aberrant localization patterns and filamentous cells is that GFP/mCherry-fusions of these division proteins are not functional and become dominant negative, interfering with proper cell division. The authors need to test the functionality of these fusion proteins before they can be used for imaging. (The authors also mislabeled Hoechst and the division protein GFP panels labels in this figure.)</p>

<p>Thank you for raising this important point. To examine the functionality of the fluorescence protein fusion constructs, we have painstakingly performed conditional knockout of the genes of interest (<italic>zipA</italic>, <italic>ftsB</italic>, <italic>ftsL</italic>, and <italic>ftsN</italic>) in <italic>A. baumannii</italic> strains inducibly expressing the corresponding fusion protein. We found that these fluorescence protein fusions were able to fully rescue the growth of the mutant lacking the corresponding <italic>fts</italic> gene (Figure 4-figure supplement 1). Concurrently, we have also successfully knocked out the <italic>aeg1</italic> gene under conditions <italic>in trans</italic> expression of an mCherry-Aeg1 fusion protein, which was able to effectively rescue the growth defects of the Δa_eg1_ mutant (Figure 4-figure supplement 1). We then introduced the functional fluorescence protein fusions into wild-type cells and observed the co-localization of Aeg1 with the relevant Fts proteins. The results showed that Aeg1 indeed co-localized with ZipA, FtsB, FtsL, and FtsN (Fig.4E, red arrows), but occasional non-co-localization was also observed (Fig.4E, white arrows).</p>
<p>We have utilized the functional fluorescence protein fusion constructs to analyze the localization of relevant Aeg1-interacting proteins in the Δ<italic>aeg1</italic> strain upon Aeg1 depletion. Our results showed that the depletion of Aeg1 indeed impacted the midcell localization of the several Aeg1-interacting Fts proteins.</p>
