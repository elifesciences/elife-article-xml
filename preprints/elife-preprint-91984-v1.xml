<title>Abstract</title><p>Autophagy is a conserved process of cellular self-digestion that promotes survival during nutrient stress. In yeast, methionine starvation is sufficient to induce autophagy. One pathway of autophagy induction is governed by the SEACIT complex, which regulates TORC1 activity in response to amino acids through the Rag GTPases Gtr1 and Gtr2. However, the precise mechanism by which SEACIT senses amino acids and regulates TORC1 signaling remains incompletely understood. Here, we identify the conserved 5’-3’ RNA exonuclease Xrn1 as a surprising and novel regulator of TORC1 activity in response to methionine starvation. This role of Xrn1 is dependent on its catalytic activity, but not on degradation of any specific class of mRNAs. Instead, Xrn1 modulates the nucleotide-binding state of the Gtr1/2 complex, which is critical for its interaction with and activation of TORC1. This work identifies a critical role for Xrn1 in nutrient sensing and growth control that extends beyond its canonical housekeeping function in RNA degradation and indicates an avenue for RNA metabolism to function in amino acid signaling into TORC1.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Autophagy is a conserved process that degrades cytoplasmic components and organelles under nutrient stress to maintain cell viability. The TORC1 kinase complex is a master regulator of autophagy (and many other cellular processes) in response to nutrient cues such as the availability of amino acids. The activation of TORC1 promotes cell growth and proliferation, while inhibition of TORC1 blocks cell growth and induces autophagy. Precisely how cells sense a variety of nutrient cues and their metabolic state to regulate TORC1 activity and autophagy has yet to be fully elucidated.</p>
<p>When budding yeast cells (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>) are switched from a nutrient-rich, lactate-based media (YPL) to a synthetic, minimal, lactate media (SL), they induce autophagy despite abundant nitrogen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. This autophagy-inducing regime, which forces yeast cells to utilize mitochondrial respiration, has allowed for the discovery of additional regulators of autophagy such as the SEACIT complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, called GATOR1 in mammalian cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, which senses amino acid availability. As autophagy under these conditions is potently suppressed by the sole addition of methionine, SEACIT can be seen as a regulator of autophagy triggered by an insufficiency of methionine and its downstream metabolite S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>SEACIT has been found to sense cellular state and inhibit TORC1 through mechanisms at the post-translational level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. However, several recent studies suggest autophagy can also be regulated at the post-transcriptional level. The RNA exonuclease Xrn1 and decapping enzyme Dcp2 have been implicated in the regulation of autophagy under nitrogen starvation through a mechanism involving RNA decay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Xrn1 is an evolutionarily conserved cytoplasmic 5’-3’ exonuclease responsible for the degradation and processing of wide variety of RNAs, including mRNAs, tRNAs, rRNAs, and lncRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. RNA decay occurs simultaneously at both the 5’ and 3’ ends. mRNAs are first trimmed and/or deadenylated at the 3’ end by the Pan2-Pan3 and CCR4-NOT complexes, and then undergo decapping, removal of the 5’ 7-methylguanosine cap by Dcp2, before being degraded by Xrn1.</p>
<p>The reported mechanisms of post-transcriptional autophagy regulation involve the sequestration and degradation of autophagy (<italic>ATG</italic>) mRNA transcripts under nutrient-replete conditions, thus suppressing autophagy. Nitrogen starvation reduces levels of Xrn1 protein, resulting in accumulation of <italic>ATG</italic> gene transcripts, promoting autophagy induction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. RCK family RNA helicases Dhh1, Vad1, and DDX6 and 3’ RNA decay complex Pat1-Lsm have also been implicated in regulation of autophagy under nitrogen starvation through similar mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. However, how these RNA helicases and decay enzymes achieve specificity for <italic>ATG</italic> gene transcripts over other mRNAs is unclear.</p>
<p>We sought to further understand the role of Xrn1 in the regulation of autophagy. We find that Xrn1 has a prominent role in the regulation of autophagy induced by methionine starvation. In particular, cells lacking Xrn1 exhibit increased inhibition of TORC1 and enhanced autophagy. Unexpectedly, we found that Xrn1 regulates autophagy in a manner that is independent of <italic>ATG</italic> mRNA accumulation. Instead, Xrn1 exhibits biochemical and genetic interactions with the SEACIT complex and regulates TORC1 activity through toggling the nucleotide binding-state of the small Rag GTPase proteins Gtr1 and Gtr2. These findings reveal a fundamental role for this RNA exonuclease in the direct regulation of TORC1 signaling in response to amino acids and suggest a mechanism for signaling between RNA decay and cell growth control in response to nutritional stress.</p>

<title>Cells lacking Xrn1 exhibit enhanced autophagy and are unresponsive to methionine in respiratory conditions</title>
<p>Xrn1 has been implicated in the regulation of autophagy during nitrogen starvation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, but a role for this exonuclease in regulating autophagy in response to methionine deprivation has not been determined. To assess the role of Xrn1 under such conditions, we grew wild type (WT) and Xrn1 null yeast strains (<italic>xrn1Δ</italic>) in a rich, lactate-based media (YPL), then switched cells to a synthetic, minimal, lactate media (SL) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). This media switch robustly induces autophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. We observed that <italic>xrn1Δ</italic> cells induced autophagy more readily than WT, even in YPL media when autophagy is normally repressed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B-C</xref>).</p>

<p>The switch from YPL media to SL media induces autophagy specifically in response to insufficiency of methionine. If cells are switched to SL and supplemented with methionine, autophagy is repressed, while the addition of all other non-sulfur amino acids has minimal effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. We found that <italic>xrn1Δ</italic> cells are unable to repress autophagy despite methionine supplementation, thus revealing a previously unknown role for Xrn1 in methionine sensing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C,D</xref>). Importantly, the amount of Xrn1 protein did not change in response to nutrient availability (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figures S1A,B</xref>). Moreover, the addition of methionine to SL media restored growth of WT but not <italic>xrn1Δ</italic> cells, consistent with the inability of methionine to inhibit autophagy in this mutant (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1C</xref>). These results indicate that Xrn1 is a negative regulator of autophagy induced in response to methionine deprivation.</p>
<p>Switch from YPL to SL results in a significant decrease in intracellular levels of methionine and SAM, consistent with autophagy induction due to methionine insufficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Methionine levels were comparable between <italic>xrn1Δ</italic> and WT cells following switch to SL media, though many other sulfur-containing metabolites, including SAM, were unexpectedly elevated in <italic>xrn1Δ</italic> cells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figures S1D,E</xref>, <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>). As such, the amplified induction of autophagy exhibited by <italic>xrn1Δ</italic> cells cannot be explained by insufficient methionine or other sulfur-containing metabolites. Instead, they exhibit hallmarks of enhanced but dysregulated sulfur metabolism.</p>
<p>As previously reported, we also observed enhanced autophagy induction in <italic>xrn1Δ</italic> cells following nitrogen starvation in high glucose conditions (YPDèSD-N)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figures S2A, B</xref>). However, since the difference in autophagy between <italic>xrn1Δ</italic> and WT cells was more significant under methionine deprivation, and methionine did not inhibit autophagy in <italic>xrn1Δ</italic> mutant cells, we focused on investigating the role of Xrn1 in the regulation of autophagy in response to methionine starvation (YPLèSL).</p>

<title>Cells lacking Xrn1 accumulate transcripts of core autophagy genes</title>
<p>A major function of Xrn1 in cells is to degrade mRNA from the 5’ end following the removal of the 5’ cap. To determine if its exonuclease activity is required for its regulation of autophagy, we generated cells expressing a catalytically dead mutant of Xrn1 (D208A)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. The autophagy phenotype of these cells matched that of <italic>xrn1Δ</italic> cells, (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), demonstrating that Xrn1 exonuclease activity is required for normal autophagy regulation.

<p>Xrn1 plays a general role in regulating gene expression through RNA decay. It has been reported that Xrn1 regulates the levels of core autophagy (<italic>ATG</italic>) gene mRNAs in response to nitrogen availability, allowing for accumulation of these genes under starvation to induce autophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. We examined whether the loss of Xrn1 affected levels of <italic>ATG</italic> mRNAs under methionine deprivation by RNA-seq. WT cells induce sulfur metabolism (e.g., <italic>MET</italic>) genes and repress growth-promoting genes (e.g., ribosomal subunits) following the switch to SL, consistent with methionine starvation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. In contrast, <italic>xrn1Δ</italic> cells displayed fewer overall changes in transcript abundance following the switch from YPL to SL (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, Table S2). The abundance of <italic>ATG</italic> mRNAs was increased in cells lacking Xrn1 in YPL media, but was decreased in SL media (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2D</xref>, S3B). As autophagy is upregulated in <italic>xrn1Δ</italic> cells compared to WT cells in this condition, these transcriptomic analyses reveal a disconnect between the abundance of <italic>ATG</italic> mRNA transcripts and the induction of autophagy. Collectively, these results suggest that alteration of specific <italic>ATG</italic> transcripts is not the primary mechanism by which Xrn1 regulates autophagy induced by methionine starvation.</p>

<title>Cells lacking Xrn1 exhibit diminished TORC1 signaling</title>
<p>TORC1 is a master regulator of autophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. To assess whether Xrn1 might regulate autophagy through TORC1, we assayed TORC1 signaling by examining the phosphorylation of one of its downstream substrates, ribosomal protein S6 (Rps6). Switch to minimal media (SL) results in reduced S6 phosphorylation (S235/236), consistent with TORC1 inhibition and induction of autophagy, which can be restored by addition of methionine to minimal media (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Strikingly<italic>, xrn1</italic>Δ cells have reduced p-S6, even in YPL rich media. In SL media, p-S6 is further diminished, and addition of methionine to the media has no effect on p-S6 levels in cells lacking Xrn1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Xrn1 is therefore required for the ability of TORC1 to properly sense methionine availability. Furthermore, the amounts of p-S6 observed in <italic>xrn1Δ</italic> cells are inversely correlated with the level of autophagy, consistent with a potential role of Xrn1 in regulating autophagy through TORC1.</p>

<title>Xrn1 interacts with the SEACIT complex, a negative regulator of TORC1</title>
<p>We next sought to understand the mechanism by which Xrn1 might regulate TORC1. The SEACIT complex (comprised of Npr2, Npr3, Iml1) is a key regulator of TORC1 activity through the Rag GTPase heterodimer Gtr1 and Gtr2 in response to amino acid levels. The role of Gtr1/2 in regulating TORC1 is dependent on their nucleotide-binding state. When amino acids are sufficient, Gtr1 is loaded with GTP, while Gtr2 is bound to GDP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. In this state, the Gtr1/2 complex activates TORC1 and promotes cell growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. The SEACIT complex is a dedicated GTPase activating protein (GAP) for Gtr1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. When amino acids are insufficient, SEACIT triggers the hydrolysis of the GTP bound by Gtr1, and the exchange of GDP for GTP on Gtr2, thereby inactivating the Gtr1/2 complex, which in turn leads to TORC1 inhibition and autophagy induction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Deletion of any component of SEACIT renders TORC1 constitutively active and inhibits autophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The SEACIT component Npr2 has been found to be selectively required for autophagy induction under respiratory conditions, but not nitrogen starvation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. We examined the regulation of autophagy in cells lacking both Xrn1 and Npr2. Unexpectedly, the loss of both proteins restored normal, methionine-responsive regulation of autophagy (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). This result suggests that Xrn1 may function in this pathway to control TORC1 activity, and that these two proteins may have opposing roles in TORC1 regulation.</p>
<p>To further understand the role of Xrn1 in relation to the SEACIT complex, we examined the growth of cells lacking Xrn1, Npr2, or both. Loss of Npr2 results in increased growth under respiratory conditions, consistent with the role of Npr2 in TORC1 inhibition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Cells lacking Xrn1 have a severe growth defect, and the further loss of Npr2 has no effect on growth, indicating that Xrn1 may function downstream of Npr2, but upstream of TORC1.</p>
<p>We next tested whether Xrn1 might associate with Npr2 or other components of the SEACIT complex. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) analysis revealed that Xrn1 interacts with Npr2 in YPL media, and that interaction is decreased following switch to SL media (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), suggesting their interaction is dependent on methionine availability.</p>

<title>Xrn1 regulates Gtr1/2 nucleotide-binding state</title>
<p>Our results indicate that Xrn1 regulates autophagy by controlling TORC1 activity downstream of Npr2 and the SEACIT complex. Since SEACIT is a GAP for Gtr1, we next assayed the methionine sensitivity of cells lacking Gtr1 alone or in combination with Xrn1. The loss of Gtr1 alone did not result in changes in autophagy. However, in combination with the loss of Xrn1, these cells became entirely insensitive to methionine availability, inducing autophagy in all media conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Furthermore, we observed that Xrn1 interacts with Gtr1 independent of methionine starvation (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A</xref>).</p>

<p>Specific mutations in Gtr1 confer dominant regulation of TORC1 activity and autophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Cells expressing GTP-locked Gtr1 (Q65L) are unable to induce autophagy following switch to SL media and exhibit enhanced growth (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4B,C</xref>). Conversely, cells expressing GDP-locked Gtr1 (S20L) induce autophagy regardless of methionine availability and have a slow-growth phenotype (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4B,C</xref>). Strikingly, when these mutations were introduced in the <italic>xrn1Δ</italic> background, their phenotypes became dominant to <italic>xrn1Δ</italic>: cells with GTP-locked Gtr1 cannot induce autophagy and have enhanced growth, while cells with GDP-locked Gtr1 constitutively induce autophagy and have a severe growth defect (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, D). The GTP-locked mutation of Gtr1 is also sufficient to restore TORC1 kinase activity in cells lacking Xrn1 (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4B</xref>). Moreover, Xrn1 preferentially interacted with the GDP-locked form of Gtr1, indicating that Xrn1 may have a specific role in TORC1 regulation through Gtr1 (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4C</xref>).</p>
<p>Notably, although loss of Xrn1 can cause accumulation of <italic>ATG</italic> mRNA transcripts, we find that the mutation of Gtr1 to its GTP-locked state does not restore WT levels of these transcripts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). This result indicates that, although this mutant is dominant in its suppression of autophagy through constitutive activation of TORC1, cells with this mutation still erroneously accumulate mRNAs of key autophagy genes. Collectively, these results decouple the abundance of autophagy mRNAs from the induction of autophagy, and supports a model in which Xrn1 regulates autophagy through modulation of TORC1 signaling directly, rather than through degradation of key mRNAs.</p>
<p>Consistent with previous reports, mutations in Gtr2 have a milder effect on autophagy regulation, yet these mutations, as well as loss of Gtr2, exhibit synergistic effects in combination with the loss of Xrn1 (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figures S5A,B,C</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Thus, mutations that alter the nucleotide-binding state of Gtr1 are epistatic to <italic>xrn1Δ</italic>, while mutations that alter the nucleotide-binding state of Gtr2 synergize with <italic>xrn1Δ</italic> in terms of autophagy phenotypes. These data are consistent with a model in which Xrn1 converts Gtr1/2 from a TORC1-inhibitory state to a TORC1-activating state.</p>
<p>Gtr1 has one annotated guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), Vam6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Gtr2 has two GAPs, Lst4 and Lst7, which act in a complex (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5D</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. We tested autophagy induction in response to methionine starvation of strains lacking these proteins alone or in combination with <italic>xrn1Δ.</italic> Like <italic>xrn1Δ</italic> mutants, cells lacking Lst4 or Lst7 lost the ability to sense methionine and induced autophagy regardless of its availability (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figures S5E,F</xref>). Moreover, the loss of Xrn1 in addition to either Lst4 or Lst7 severely exacerbated the methionine-insensitive autophagy and growth defect phenotypes of these strains (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figures S5E,G</xref>). These genetic epistasis experiments strongly suggest that Xrn1 functions by toggling Gtr1/2 nucleotide binding states in a manner conducive for TORC1 activation, but might not act through Lst4 and Lst7. Unexpectedly, cells lacking Vam6 were unable to induce autophagy following methionine deprivation, suggesting that the role of this protein in respiratory conditions is not fully understood (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5H</xref>). Ivy1 and Ait1 have been described as regulators of TORC1 signaling through Gtr1 and Gtr2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>.

<p>Finally, we investigated whether the presence of RNA might influence interactions between Xrn1 and either Npr2 or Gtr1.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this work, we have identified a role for an RNA exonuclease, Xrn1, in TORC1 signaling through regulation of Gtr1/2 nucleotide-binding states. Loss of Xrn1 results in reduced interaction between Gtr1 and TORC1, which inhibits the complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Curiously, cells lacking Xrn1 also exhibit a severe growth defect, consistent with previous observations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. We have shown here that this defect can be largely rescued by a single mutation of Gtr1 locking it in its GTP-bound conformation. Thus, the severe growth defect of <italic>xrn1Δ</italic> cells cannot be solely attributed to a defect in RNA decay, but is instead due to TORC1 inhibition.</p>
<p>Prior studies have linked RNA decay enzymes to the regulation of autophagy through the expression of key autophagy-driving mRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. In response to methionine starvation, we observed minimal changes in mRNA levels of the majority of <italic>ATG</italic> genes in the absence of Xrn1. Instead, our findings suggest a direct role for an RNA decay enzyme (i.e., Xrn1) in the regulation of autophagy through TORC1 under conditions of nutritional stress.</p>
<p>How might Xrn1 sense methionine availability to regulate TORC1 activity? Methionine starvation triggers significant changes in the transcriptome (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Transcripts coding for proteins involved in growth and ribosome biogenesis are rapidly degraded, while genes for sulfur metabolism must be transcribed to promote methionine and SAM biosynthesis for survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Moreover, methionine starvation leads to an insufficiency of SAM, which could result in compromised ability to methylate particular RNAs, including tRNAs and rRNAs. Xrn1 has been shown to have not only a general role in buffering cellular RNA levels that cannot be managed by other RNA decay enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, but also a specific role in degrading particular RNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. We report here that Xrn1 is capable of interactions with Npr2, which can be influenced by the presence of RNA. The accumulation of RNAs that need to be degraded in response to an insufficiency of SAM may titrate Xrn1 away from SEACIT, thereby liberating SEACIT to act on Gtr1, converting it to its GDP-bound state and inhibiting TORC1. In cells lacking Xrn1, the SEACIT complex is free to act on Gtr1, shifting the equilibrium towards the inactive state of this complex and promoting autophagy (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>).</p>
<p>As for how precisely Xrn1 regulates Gtr1/2, our cumulative findings suggest that Xrn1 likely acts by regulating the nucleotide binding states of the Gtr1/2 heterodimer. Notably, GTP-locked Gtr1 mutants bypass <italic>xrn1Δ</italic> phenotypes, while in stark contrast GTP-locked Gtr2 mutants exacerbate them. As such, we hypothesize that Xrn1 likely acts as either a GEF for Gtr1 or a GAP for Gtr2, such that the loss of Xrn1 keeps the heterodimer in its inactive state, thereby inhibiting TORC1. Alternatively, Xrn1 could act through the other GAPs and GEFs that modulate Gtr1/2.</p>
<p>In the absence of Xrn1, our metabolite profiling experiments reveal elevated levels of many sulfur-containing metabolites, including SAM, cystathionine, and glutathione, despite reduced TORC1 signaling and enhanced autophagy. As <italic>MET</italic> gene transcripts were not elevated in <italic>xrn1Δ</italic> mutant cells, how Xrn1 contributes to sulfur metabolic processes is unclear, but is nonetheless consistent with a key role for this enzyme in the cellular response to methionine availability. Moreover, it has not escaped our attention that bulk intracellular levels of GTP and GDP were also modestly decreased in <italic>xrn1Δ</italic> cells (Figure S6F), suggesting that Xrn1 may also play a role in recycling of guanosine nucleotides from RNA that may be supplied for Gtr1/2 function. However, our attempts to rescue the phenotypes of <italic>xrn1Δ</italic> with guanosine supplementation have not been successful thus far. Nonetheless, it remains possible that Xrn1 could also help locally recycle GDP or GTP pools for GEF-mediated exchange of their bound nucleotides.</p>
<p>The majority of previous studies on TORC1 signaling have focused on how various amino acids, nutrients, or growth factors directly signal into TORC1 through a variety of protein complexes. In this study, we now show how RNA can also act as a signal to modulate TORC1 signaling through the exonuclease Xrn1. In this manner, the accumulation of particular RNAs, perhaps in response to reduced methylation potential, could act as a surrogate of the metabolic state and indicator of cellular stress, which can then be integrated into the regulation of cellular metabolic activities through TORC1. As the SEACIT complex and Xrn1 are conserved in mammalian cells, this mechanism of RNA signaling into TORC1 is likely to be conserved as well.</p>

<p>Summary: The paper by McGinnis et al. uses a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to understand how the conserved 5'-3' RNA exonuclease Xrn1 affects autophagy in response to methionine starvation in S. cerevisiae. The authors present evidence Xrn1 affects autophagy primarily via its effect on regulating TORC1 signaling. They present some evidence that Xrn1's effect on TORC1 singnaling is via its physical interaction with the SEACIT complex.</p>
<p>Strengths: The experiments in general for this paper are clear and have proper controls.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The authors seem to try and fit the data to a simplistic model rather than embrace the complexity of the data. I will give some examples below.</p>
<p>1. Figure 1 clearly shows that xrn1d results in loss of tight repression of autophagy. Specifically, the 0 timepoint has increased autophagy in both the idh-GFP and ALP assays. However, it is incorrect to say that it is related in any way to methionine deprivation. The same basic pattern of regulation occurs in WT and xrn1d strains. The only difference is the &quot;leakiness&quot; of repression at t=0.</p>
<p>2. Figure 2 shows that catalytically inactive Xrn1 has the same autophagy phenotype as a deletion, indicating that Xrn1 enzymatic activity is important for function. However, it is also clear that xrn1-deletion cells expressing wt Xm1-flag do not repress autophagy as well as XRN+ cells, even though the amount of expressed protein seems similar. Does this imply the flag-tag may be a less active version of the protein? This should be discussed.</p>
<p>3. Figure 3 shows Xrn1-loss effects TORC signaling and that npr2-deletion inhibits autophagy. The surprising result is that a xrn1d/npr2d behaves like WT with regards to autophagy. This needs to be discussed. To me, this seems to strongly suggest that methionine repression of autophagy is occurring downstream of both xrn1 and npr2. Measuring p-S6 in the double mutant may be informative.</p>
<p>4. Figure 4 appears to show that even in the absence of GTR1, autophagy is repressed in rich media, active in YPL-SL, but still responds to methionine repression. This does not seem consistent with the model presented in Figure 5. Shouldn't loss of GTR1 result in repressed Torc1? The GTP and GDP-lock mutants are either all on, or all off. Why is deletion different? This needs to be explained and discussed. Also, the Figure legend does not match figures (problem after Fig4b).</p>
<p>5. Figure 5B shows GTR1 IP with Xrn1-FLAG. However, there are no negative controls in this experiment, so the result could be background. RNAaseA and RNA addition experiments are convincing.</p>
<p>6. Line 254-255. The lead sentence is simply not supported by the data. There is no evidence that Xrn1 actually affects the regulation of Gtr1/2 binding states.</p>
<p>7. Line 259-260. This is again overstated. Just because a mutant can be rescued by Gtr1-GTP-locked, does not say anything about RNA decay. In fact, the double mutant has extra high levels of some ATG RNA's, so I have no idea how the Gtr1 rescues.</p>
<p>8. Line 268-281. Your model here ignores the fact that methionine regulation takes place in the absence of both xrn1 and npr2. Therefore the model, as proposed, can't be correct.</p>
<p>9. Line 290-300. The slow growth rate of Xrn1 mutants may be affecting the metabolite levels. I felt that this entire paragraph was overly speculative.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
McGinnis and colleagues conducted a study to elucidate the precise mechanism through which SEACIT detects amino acids and regulates TORC1 signaling in yeast. In their research, the authors made a noteworthy discovery by identifying the conserved 5'-3' RNA exonuclease Xrn1 as a novel regulator of TORC1 activity, particularly in response to stress-induced autophagy. The study revealed that the impact of Xrn1 on TORC1 is contingent on its catalytic activity rather than the degradation of any specific category of mRNAs. Instead, Xrn1 plays a pivotal role in modulating the nucleotide-binding state of the Gtr1/2 complex. This modulation is crucial for the complex's interaction with and subsequent activation of TORC1.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This study holds considerable potential as it illuminates an intriguing function of Xrn1 in nutrient sensing and growth control, expanding beyond its conventional role in RNA degradation. Furthermore, the research suggests a novel pathway through which RNA metabolism can influence methionine signaling to activate TORC1.</p>
<p>Weaknesses/General comments:</p>
<p>1. Previous work has shown that SAMTOR, upstream of mTORC1 in mammalian cells, senses methionine abundance through SAM levels (PMID: 29123071). However, this study suggests that Xrn1 senses and signals methionine to regulate mTORC1 signaling independently of SAM abundance. This finding appears to contradict the mentioned previous work. The authors should address this discrepancy. Moreover, the title of this manuscript does not seem to fit with actual findings. In the title, the authors mention that Xrn1 regulates TORC1 in response to SAM availability, but SAM levels do not seem to matter for Xrn1-dependent regulation of autophagy and TORC1.</p>
<p>2. This group has previously shown that the addition of methionine stimulates the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which inhibits autophagy and promotes growth through the action of the methyltransferase Ppm1p, which modifies the catalytic subunit of PP2A in tune with SAM levels (PMID: 23870128). Since Xrn1 controls autophagy in a methionine-dependent manner, the authors should assess the effects of Xrn1 on SAM-dependent methylation of PP2A?</p>
<p>3. The authors should measure the effects of Xrn1 and TORC1 regulation on the methionine-SAM cycle activity through an isotope tracing approach, possibly by using U-13C-methionine.</p>
<p>4. The authors use mainly the GFP cleavage assay from Idh1-GFP to assess mitochondria degradation (or mitophagy) and generalize that autophagy is induced. Other assays should be employed more notably to assess globally non-mitochondrial specific degradation. For example, the authors could employ the Pho8∆60 assay.</p>
<p>5. In several blots (Panel 3D, 4D, 4B, 4F), the authors assess autophagy through GFP cleavage from Idh1-GFP but do not assess TORC1 activity in the same conditions. Showing autophagy induction and TORC1 activity on the same panels would be preferable.</p>
<p>Specific comments:</p>
<p>1. Panel 5E: As a control, the authors should use DNA instead of NMPs.</p>
<p>2. Panel S3B: Contrary to what is indicated in the text, this panel does not display ATG mRNA levels.</p>
<p>3. Panel S5K is not cited in the text. The rationale behind measuring the steady-state levels of GTP and GDP is not explained.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>
This study investigated the role of the exonuclease Xrn1 in regulating autophagy in response to methionine deprivation in the budding yeast (S. cerevisiae). As a model system, wild-type and xrn1-deletion cells are switched from a nutrient-rich, lactate-based media (YPL) to a synthetic, minimal, lactate media with or without re-addition of methionine. Autophagy is measured by a previously reported Idh-GFP cleavage assay, and in some cases by quantification of alkaline phosphatase activity. The authors conclude that Xrn1 suppresses autophagy in response to methionine depletion based on the results of the Idh-GFP assay. However, the alkaline phosphatase assay could potentially suggest the opposite conclusion, with xnr1 deletion blocking the induction of autophagy relative to baseline in those cells, an interpretation which is complicated by higher basal autophagy induction upon xnr1 deletion. To address the mechanism of Xrn1 regulation of autophagy, a model is presented in which Xrn1 activates Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (TORC1), which suppresses autophagy. This regulation is proposed to occur through physical association of Xrn1 with known upstream regulators of TORC1 activity, the SEACIT/GATOR1 and Gtr/Rag complexes. However, TORC1 activity is not measured under many key experimental conditions, making it difficult to determine the accuracy of this model. If the model ultimately proves correct, this would be an important finding that establishes a new player in the critical TORC1 pathway that controls cell growth and metabolism in response to changes in nutrient availability.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>
Clear and highly reproducible results using the Idh-GFP cleavage assay to measure apoptosis.</p>
<p>Detailed characterization of the metabolic and transcriptomic effects of Xrn1 deletion through metabolomics and RNA-seq.</p>
<p>Use of a catalytically inactive Xrn1 mutant to demonstrate that its effects on autophagy require its catalytic activity.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>
Predominant use of a single autophagy assay (Idh-GFP cleavage), with potentially conflicting results in another assay (alkaline phosphatase activity).</p>
<p>TORC1 activity is not measured under many key experimental conditions.</p>
<p>Protein-protein interactions are studied by overexpression of tagged proteins. While this may be essential for detection, the level of overexpression relative to endogenous protein is unclear, as well as whether this recapitulates the endogenous interactions and regulation.</p>
<p>Results from some experiments have several possible interpretations.</p>
