<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an inherited neuromuscular disorder stemming from deletions or mutations in the Survival Motor Neuron 1 (<italic>SMN1</italic>) gene, leading to decreased levels of SMN protein, and subsequent motor neuron death and muscle atrophy. While traditionally viewed as a disorder predominantly affecting motor neurons, recent research suggests the involvement of various peripheral organs in SMA pathology. Notably, the liver has emerged as a significant focus due to the observed fatty liver phenotype and dysfunction in both SMA mouse models and SMA patients. Despite these findings, it remains unclear whether intrinsic depletion of SMN protein in the liver contributes to pathology in the peripheral or central nervous systems. To address this knowledge gap, we developed a mouse model with a liver-specific depletion of SMN by utilizing an <italic>Alb-Cre</italic> transgene together with one <italic>Smn<sup>2B</sup></italic> allele and one <italic>Smn</italic> exon 7 allele flanked by loxP sites. We evaluated phenotypic changes in these mice at postnatal day 19 (P19), a time when the severe model of SMA, the <italic>Smn<sup>2B/-</sup></italic> mice, typically exhibit many symptoms of the disease. Our findings indicate that liver-specific SMN depletion does not induce motor neuron death, neuromuscular pathology or muscle atrophy, characteristics typically observed in the <italic>Smn</italic><sup>2B/-</sup> mouse at P19. However, mild liver steatosis was observed at this time point, although no changes in liver function were detected. Notably, pancreatic alterations resembled that of <italic>Smn<sup>2B/-</sup></italic>mice, with a decrease in insulin producing alpha-cells and an increase in glucagon producing beta-cells, accompanied with a reduction in blood glucose levels. While the mosaic pattern of the Cre-mediated excision precludes definitive conclusions regarding the contribution of liver-specific SMN depletion to overall tissue pathology, our findings highlight an intricate connection between liver function and pancreatic abnormalities in SMA, adding a nuanced layer to our understanding of the disease’s complexities.</p>

<label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Insufficient levels of Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) protein, primarily arising from mutations or deletions in the <italic>SMN1</italic> gene, are the root cause of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a hereditary neuromuscular disorder widely acknowledged as one of the leading genetic causes of infant mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Characterized by the loss of motor neurons, SMA presents as a progressive weakening of muscle strength, primarily impacting proximal muscles. If left untreated, this deterioration culminates in respiratory failure and premature mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The diverse phenotypes observed in SMA patients can be attributed to the genetic variations within the <italic>SMN</italic> gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Humans harbor two copies of the <italic>SMN</italic> gene, <italic>SMN1</italic> and <italic>SMN2</italic>, which share a nearly identical sequence except for a critical C to T substitution at position 6 of exon 7 in <italic>SMN2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. This single nucleotide change disrupts splicing of the gene, resulting in the predominant production of an unstable protein lacking exon 7, known as <italic>SMNΔ7</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Despite this, approximately 10% of functional full-length (FL) SMN protein is still produced by the <italic>SMN2</italic> gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Consequently, the <italic>SMN2</italic> gene serves as a modifier of disease phenotype, with a higher copy number correlating with milder disease severity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. In contrast, mice possess a single copy of the <italic>Smn</italic> gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Notably, while homozygous deletion of both <italic>SMN</italic> genes has not been observed in humans, the homozygous deletion of the <italic>Smn</italic> gene in mice induces morphological alterations and degenerative changes in embryos post-morula stage, ultimately resulting in death at preimplantation stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. This underscores the pivotal role of the <italic>SMN</italic> gene in early embryonic development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Recent research has unveiled the extensive impact of SMN depletion beyond motor neurons, implicating additional tissues such as the liver and pancreas in both SMA patients and mouse models of SMA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Despite major therapeutic advancements focusing on restoring SMN levels, which have notably enhanced both lifespan and quality of life in SMA patients, complete phenotypic rescue remains elusive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Additionally, existing therapies primarily target postnatal treatment, potentially overlooking crucial developmental changes stemming from SMN depletion. This underscores the likelihood of a broader role for the <italic>SMN</italic> gene in multiple non-neuronal cell types, necessitating further exploration.</p>
<p>Attention has been increasingly drawn to the liver as a critical area of investigation in SMA research. Both clinical studies and preclinical mouse models have unveiled disruptions in fatty acid metabolism, leading to an increased susceptibility among SMA patients to dyslipidemia and liver steatosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Given its multifaceted role in regulating numerous biological functions, including the storage and regulation of lipids, carbohydrates, amino acids, and iron, as well as the synthesis of essential growth factors and the clearance of toxic metabolites, any disruptions in liver function may have deleterious effects on other tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To explore the role of SMN in the liver, prior studies have utilized a transgenic mouse model featuring the Cre recombinase transgene driven by the α-fetoprotein promoter (<italic>Alfp-Cre</italic>). This approach led to near-total depletion of SMN protein specifically in the liver, resulting in severe impairment of liver development and late embryonic lethality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. In our study, to better represent the level of SMN depletion in the liver observed in SMA and elucidate the intricate interplay between SMN deficiency in the liver and its systemic impact in SMA-like pathology, we utilized a mouse model employing <italic>Alb-Cre</italic>, where the albumin promoter drives expression of Cre recombinase in a liver-specific manner. This model also harbors one <italic>Smn<sup>2B</sup></italic> allele and one <italic>Smn</italic> exon 7 allele flanked by loxP sites. The <italic>Smn<sup>2B</sup></italic> allele contains a 3-base pair substitution in the mouse <italic>Smn</italic> gene, resulting in aberrant splicing of exon 7<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Consequently, this genetic approach results in the production of approximately 30% full-length functional SMN protein production in the liver.</p>
<p>Our findings reveal that our novel liver specific SMN depleted (herein referred to as <italic>Alb<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic>) mouse model induces mild liver steatosis and disrupts pancreatic function, characterized by decreased insulin-positive and increased glucagon-positive cells, alongside reduced blood glucose levels. Remarkably, this mouse model does not exhibit an overt SMA phenotype, demonstrating normal lifespan and motor function. Nevertheless, our data suggests an intricate relationship between hepatic function and pancreatic abnormalities in SMA, thereby enhancing our comprehension of the disease’s pathophysiology.</p>

<label>2.1</label><title>Generation of liver-specific SMN-depleted mice</title>
<p>To elucidate the impact of liver specific SMN depletion on both CNS and peripheral tissue pathology, we utilized mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the mouse albumin promoter, referred to as <italic>Alb<sup>Cre</sup></italic>. This strain is commonly employed for liver-specific gene knockout using the Cre/loxP system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. We generated the <italic>Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic> genotype by crossing <italic>Smn<sup>F7/F7</sup></italic> with <italic>Smn<sup>2B/2B</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The <italic>Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic> genotype carries one allele harboring a three nucleotide switch in the exon splicing enhancer within exon 7 of the mouse <italic>Smn</italic> gene (known as <italic>Smn<sup>2B</sup></italic> allele), mimicking the <italic>SMN2</italic> gene in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, while the other allele features exon 7 flanked by l<italic>oxP</italic> sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Additionally, crosses between <italic>Alb<sup>Cre</sup></italic> and <italic>Smn<sup>F7/F7</sup></italic>yielded <italic>Alb<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic>;<italic>Smn<sup>F7/+</sup></italic> offspring.</p>

Upon crossing <italic>Alb<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Smn<sup>F7/+</sup></italic>with <italic>Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic> animals, Cre recombination will induce specific excision of exon 7 in the liver, leading to reduced SMN protein production only in the liver.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>The liver-specific mouse line was subsequentially established through further genetic crosses between <italic>Alb<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic>;<italic>Smn<sup>F7/+</sup></italic>and <italic>Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic>, resulting in various genotypes, including <italic>+/+</italic>;<italic>Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), and <italic>Alb<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). As <italic>+/</italic>+;<italic>Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic> mice lack Cre recombinase, they were used as heterozygous controls. In contrast, recombination occurs in <italic>Alb<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic>animals resulting in the specific deletion of one allele of exon 7 in the liver, while the <italic>Smn</italic>2B allele remains unaffected.</p>
<p><italic>Smn<sup>2B/-</sup></italic> mice express approximately 15% residual full-length SMN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> (FLSMN) compared to <italic>Smn<sup>2B/+</sup></italic>heterozygous mice. Therefore, both genotypes were included in this study as additional controls. Tissues were collected at postnatal day 19 (P19), corresponding to the symptomatic phase of the <italic>Smn</italic><sup>2B/-</sup> mouse model. At this stage, <italic>Smn<sup>2B/-</sup></italic> mice show increased liver steatosis and metabolic defects, ultimately culminating in multiple system defects and mortality, typically occurring around P25<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We first assessed SMN protein levels in the liver and across CNS and peripheral tissues. Our findings confirmed a reduction in SMN protein levels across various tissues in <italic>Smn<sup>2B/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-E</xref>). However, in <italic>Alb<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic>, there was a ∼70% decrease in FLSMN protein expression in the liver (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, A’) compared to littermate control counterparts (<italic>+/+;Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic>). Conversely, SMN protein levels in the brain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, B’), muscle (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, C’), SC (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>, D’) and pancreas (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, E’) remained unaltered, indicating that deletion of <italic>Smn</italic> exon 7 was restricted to the liver in <italic>Alb<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Smn</italic><sup>2<italic>B/F7</italic></sup>mice.</p>

<label>2.2</label><title>Alb<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup> mice show mild yet important liver steatosis</title>
<p>We previously showed that <italic>Smn<sup>2B/-</sup></italic> mice exhibit defects in fatty acid metabolism and lipid accumulation in the liver<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Additionally, SMA patients face an elevated risk of dyslipidemia and steatosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Hence, we explored whether the intrinsic decrease in SMN levels restricted to the liver would lead to increased lipid accumulation. Histology from <italic>Alb<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>) qualitatively indicates some level of hepatic microvesicular steatosis and lipid accumulation. However, there was a noticeable variation in cell morphology and Oil Red-O retention among hepatocytes, suggesting incomplete recombination.</p>

<p>Consistent with the histological findings, <italic>Alb<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic>mice showed variable triglycerides levels (n1=45.95, n2=10.10; n3=75.72; n4=21.91 μg/mg, mean±SEM 38.44±14.48) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), and yet higher than those observed in +/+;<italic>Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic> controls (n1=2.60, n2=0.15; n3=0.66; n4=1.44 μg/mg, mean±SEM 1.213±0.5332), although this difference did not reach statistical significance (p=0.0824). As expected, <italic>Smn</italic><sup>2B/-</sup> controls exhibited increased lipid accumulation and triglyceride levels.

<p>We next sought to identify whether <italic>Alb<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic>mice display disturbed liver homeostatic function. Specifically, we evaluated parameters associated with iron metabolism (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A,B</xref>), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>), and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>) levels, all of which have previously been identified as altered in <italic>Smn<sup>2B/-</sup></italic> mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> and were further confirmed in our study.

<label>2.4</label><title>Liver-specific SMN depleted mice display pancreatic defects</title>
<p>We have demonstrated pancreatic and glucose abnormalities in the <italic>Smn<sup>2B/-</sup></italic> mouse model of SMA and type I SMA patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Therefore, we conducted immunohistochemistry to investigate the cellular profile of the pancreas, aiming to ascertain whether the targeted depletion of SMN in the liver contributes to pancreatic dysfunction.

<label>3.</label><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The liver is pivotal in regulating numerous biological functions in the body. These encompass, among others, the storage and balance of lipids, carbohydrates, and iron, as well as the synthesis of vital growth factors and the clearance of non-essential or harmful metabolites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Given its multifaceted role, any alterations in liver function can potentially have cascading effects on other organs within the body. Hence, aside from elucidating the impact of liver specific SMN depletion on hepatic function, it is imperative to explore its effects on other tissues, as alterations in these tissues have been documented in various mouse models of SMA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Previous work on conditional knockout of <italic>Smn</italic> in the livers of mice resulted in severe impairment of liver development characterized by iron overload and subsequent liver atrophy, ultimately leading to late embryonic lethality<sup>8</sup>. In our study, we generated a novel mouse model where instead of a complete knockout of <italic>Smn</italic> in the liver, we created a scenario where SMN protein was depleted to 30% of full-length SMN production specifically within the liver, while SMN protein levels in other tissues remain comparable to those of heterozygous controls. Notably, this mouse line did not exhibit any signs of developmental delays, liver atrophy, or reduced lifespan. Nonetheless, within 19 days after birth, <italic>Alb<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic> mice showed a mild yet rapid onset of fatty liver disease and trends towards an increase in lipid levels when maintained on a normal chow diet, underscoring the importance of SMN in lipid metabolism.</p>
<p>Mild liver steatosis may be accompanied by disruptions in crucial liver function markers, notably those implicated in iron metabolism, autophagy, and growth factor regulation, such as IGF-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Accordingly, we initially investigated the expression of HO-1, an enzyme responsible for heme degradation into iron, carbon monoxide, and biliverdin; and transferrin, a liver-synthesized glycoprotein involved in iron transport across tissues (reviewed in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>). Prior studies have documented alterations in these proteins in <italic>Smn<sup>2B/-</sup></italic> mouse livers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. While our current analysis did not reveal significant differences in <italic>Alb<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic>mice, the observed upward trend in transferrin and HO levels suggests ongoing changes in iron metabolism, which may not be fully manifested at P19. In addition, incomplete Cre-mediated excision of <italic>Smn<sup>F7</sup></italic> allele may be hindering a comprehensive understanding of SMN’s role in liver function.</p>
<p>Furthermore, no alterations were observed for P62 levels, a multifunctional scaffold protein implicated in autophagy, formation of hepatic inclusion bodies, and hepatocyte cell death (reviewed in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>) despite its increased presence in mouse models of SMA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Similarly, there were no changes detected in IGF-1 protein levels, whose deficiency has been linked to liver pathology and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, and its decrease is evident in <italic>Smn<sup>2B/-</sup></italic> mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Altogether, our findings underscore the necessity of conducting further investigations at later time points to unveil potential modifications in other pathways and their repercussions on liver physiology. Additionally, the variability in the data may be due to differences in Cre recombination efficiency from mouse to mouse due to inconsistent Cre recombination among littermates, or the absence of Cre expression in certain cells leading to recombination failure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Previously, our research unveiled metabolic abnormalities in SMA-like mice, including glucose intolerance, insulin hypersensitivity, and hyperglucagonemia, accompanied by changes in pancreatic islet composition characterized by an increase in glucagon-producing α-cells at the expense of insulin-producing β-cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Histopathological examination of pancreatic tissue from infants and children with SMA type I corroborated these findings, revealing a predominant presence of glucagon-producing α-cells within pancreatic islets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Furthermore, one-year-old <italic>Smn<sup>+/-</sup></italic>mice producing approximately 50% of SMN protein, when exposed to a high-fat diet, exhibited dysregulation in the proportion of glucagon-producing α-cells within pancreatic islets and heightened hepatic insulin and glucagon sensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Our study uncovers a novel intrinsic role of liver-specific SMN in pancreatic function, distinct from IGF-1 signaling, pancreatic SMN levels (which remained stable), or canonical SMA pathology.</p>
<p>In addition, while the hallmark pathological features of SMA include motor neuron loss, NMJ pathology, muscle atrophy, and consequent motor function alterations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, these were not evident in the <italic>Alb<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic> mouse model at P19. However, given that glucose metabolism defects are observed in various neurodegenerative and neuromuscular disorders, subsequent time points are crucial to discern whether additional alterations arise as the mice age. Although hepatic and pancreatic abnormalities likely occur independently of disease onset, given that SMN depletion in motor neurons and muscle alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> is sufficient to induce a SMA-like phenotype, the potential influence of these anomalies on SMA progression warrants careful consideration.</p>
<p>Overall, our findings suggest that alterations in SMN production solely within the liver may suffice to induce pathological hepatic and pancreatic function, shedding light on a novel role of SMN in liver physiology.</p>

<p>Liver tissues from P19 mice were promptly dissected and flash frozen. Subsequently, triglyceride analysis was conducted at the Vanderbilt Mouse Metabolic Phenotyping Center, employing established protocols previously utilized by our team<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>.</p>

<label>4.9</label><title>Motor function, weight, and survival assessments</title>
<p>Motor function, weight, and survival were assessed according to established protocols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Spinal reflexes were evaluated using the righting reflex test, while motor balance and coordination were evaluated with the pen test. Additionally, muscle strength was measured using the inverted mesh grip test (see <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref>). The righting reflex test was conducted from P7 to P13, the inverted mesh grip test from P13 to P25, and the pen test from P19 to P25. Assessments were performed every two days. A maximum duration of 30 sec for the pen test and 60 sec for the inverted mesh grip represented the established threshold. Three consecutive measurements were obtained, and their average was recorded for subsequent analysis. Weight was measured every two days starting at day 7 until day 30, and then weekly until day 60. Animal welfare was monitored throughout the 60-day period during weight measurements.</p>

<label>4.10</label><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Survival data were visualized using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and intergroup differences were evaluated using the Mantel-Cox test. Brown-Forsythe and Welch ANOVA were employed to compare three or more sets of unpaired measurements, given the mosaic-like outcome observed in the <italic>Alb<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic> model, where assumptions of equal variances were not tenable. Two-way ANOVA, followed by Šídák’s method for multiple comparisons, was utilized to assess the influence of two factors on a response. Statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism V.10.2.1 (GraphPad Prism Software, San Diego, CA), with significance set at P &lt; 0.05. Data were presented as mean ± standard error of the mean. Sample sizes (n) are provided in figure legends, indicating the number of biological replicates analyzed, with each data point corresponding to an individual mouse from at least two different litters. Detailed statistical information is outlined in the respective figure legends, where statistical significance is indicated by *, p &lt; 0.05; **, p &lt; 0.01; ***, p &lt; 0.001.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript presents a comprehensive exploration of the role of liver-specific Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) depletion in peripheral and central nervous system tissue pathology through a well-constructed mouse model. This study is pioneering in its approach, focusing on the broader physiological implications of SMN, which has traditionally been associated predominantly with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Novelty and Relevance: The study addresses a significant gap in understanding the role of liver-specific SMN depletion in the context of SMA. This is a novel approach that adds valuable insights into the multi-organ impact of SMN deficiency.</p>
<p>(2) Comprehensive Methodology: The use of a well-characterized mouse model with liver-specific SMN depletion is a strength. The study employs a robust set of techniques, including genetic engineering, histological analysis, and various biochemical assays.</p>
<p>(3) Detailed Analysis: The manuscript provides a thorough analysis of liver pathology and its potential systemic effects, particularly on the pancreas and glucose metabolism.</p>
<p>(4) Clear Presentation: The manuscript is well written. The results are presented clearly with well-designed figures and detailed legends.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Limited Time Points: The study primarily focuses on a single time point (P19). This limits the understanding of the temporal progression of liver and pancreatic pathology in the context of SMN depletion. Longitudinal studies would provide a better understanding of disease progression.</p>
<p>(2) Incomplete Recombination: The mosaic pattern of Cre-mediated excision leads to variability in SMN depletion, which complicates the interpretation of some results. Ensuring more consistent recombination across samples would strengthen the conclusions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Marylin Alves de Almeida et al. developed a novel mouse cross via conditionally depleting functional SMN protein in the liver (AlbCre/+;Smn2B/F7). This mouse model retains a proportion of SMN in the liver, which better recapitulates SMN deficiency observed in SMA patients and allows further investigation into liver-specific SMN deficiency and its systemic impact. They show that AlbCre/+;Smn2B/F7 mice do not develop an apparent SMA phenotype as mice did not develop motor neuron death, neuromuscular pathology or muscle atrophy, which is observed in the Smn2B/- controls. Nonetheless, at P19, these mice develop mild liver steatosis, and interestingly, this conditional depletion of SMN in the liver impacts cells in the pancreas.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The current model has clearly delineated the apparent metabolic perturbations which involve a significantly increased lipid accumulation in the liver and pancreatic cell defects in AlbCre/+;Smn2B/F7 mice at P19. Standard methods like H&amp;E and Oil Red-O staining show that in AlbCre/+;Smn2B/F7 mice, their livers closely mimic the livers of Smn2B/- mice, which have the full body knockout of SMN protein. Unlike previous work, this liver-specific conditional depletion of SMN is superior in that it is not lethal to the mouse, which allows an opportunity to investigate the long-term effects of liver-specific SMN on the pathology of SMA.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: Given that SMA often involves fatty liver, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, using the current mouse model, the authors could have explored the long-term effects of liver-specific depletion of SMN on metabolic phenotypes beyond P19, as well as systemic effects like glucose homeostasis. Given that the authors also report pancreatic cell defects, the long-term effect on insulin secretion and resistance could be further explored. The mechanistic link between a liver-specific SMN depletion and apparent pancreatic cell defects is also unclear.</p>
<p>Discussion:</p>
<p>This current work explores a novel mouse cross in order to specifically deplete liver SMN using an Albumin-Cre driver line. This provides insight into the contribution of liver-specific SMN protein to the pathology of SMA, which is relevant for understanding metabolic perturbations in SMA patients. Nonetheless, given that SMA in patients involve a systemic deletion or mutation of the SMN gene, the authors could emphasize the utility of this liver-specific mouse model, as opposed to using in vitro models, which have been recently reported (Leow et al, 2024, JCI). Authors should also discuss why a mild metabolic phenotype is observed in this current mouse model, as opposed to other SMA mouse models described in literature.</p>

<p>We will address all the textual suggestions, including rectifying any typos and incorporating the most recent literature.</p>
<p>We will conduct longitudinal studies to determine whether the phenotype worsens or improves over time in liver-specific SMN-depleted mice. In this regard, we will present data from P60 animals, such as histological analyses for the characterization of the liver and pancreas.</p>
