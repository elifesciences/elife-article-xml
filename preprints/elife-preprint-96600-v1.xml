<title>Abstract</title><p>Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), known as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, is characterized by persistent hyperglycemia caused by damage to the pancreatic β cells and an absolute insulin deficiency, which will affect multiple organs and has a poor prognosis. Oxidative stress and apoptosis play a major role in the progression of T1DM. Eugenol (EUG) is a natural compound with anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-apoptosis activities. However, the potential effects of EUG on T1DM had not been investigated. In this study, we established the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced T1DM mouse model <italic>in vivo</italic> and STZ-induced pancreatic β cell MIN6 cell model <italic>in vitro</italic> to explore the protective effects of EUG on T1DM, and tried to illuminate the potential mechanism. Our results showed that EUG intervention could activate the expression of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (NRF2), increase the expressions of downstream proteins NQO-1 and HO-1 regulated by NRF2, alleviate pancreatic β cell damage in T1DM, elevate insulin secretion, and reduce the expression levels of apoptosis and oxidative stress related markers. Furthermore, these effects of EUG could be significantly reversed by ML385, an inhibitor of NRF2. The present study suggested that EUG exerted protective effects on pancreatic β cells in T1DM by mitigating apoptosis and oxidative stress through activating the NRF2 signaling pathway. Consequently, EUG holds great promise as a potential therapeutic candidate for T1DM.</p>

<label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a chronic and progressive autoimmune disease characterized by severe destruction of pancreatic β cells, resulting in absolute insulin insufficiency and subsequent hyperglycemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. The symptoms of this disease are polydipsia, polyphagia, polyuria, wasting, etc., which can develop into ketoacidosis and even lead to death without any treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Additionally, chronic hyperglycemia can cause various complications including diabetic nephropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>] and diabetic cardiomyopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>], imposing huge social and economic burdens. The global incidence of T1DM is rapidly increasing. According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), it is estimated that 537 million adults (20-79 years) worldwide were affected by diabetes in 2021, while more than 1.2 million children and adolescents (0-19 years) had T1DM. It is predicted that the number of individuals with diabetes will reach approximately 783 million worldwide by 2045, with developing countries experiencing the largest increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Currently, insulin intervention is the most effective way to treat T1DM, but there are still challenges on excessive fluctuations in blood glucose levels before and after meals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>] and life expectancy is shorter. Furthermore, in comparison to the general population, the quality of life is considerably compromised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Therefore, it is crucial to explore more effective treatment strategies for T1DM patients.</p>
<p>Oxidative stress is a concept that has attracted much attention in recent years, which refers to the imbalance between the production of oxygen free radicals within cells and the attenuation of anti-oxidant reactions, and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Hyperglycemia in diabetic patients can lead to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and expression of oxidative stress-related markers <italic>in vivo</italic>, while decreasing expression of anti-oxidant markers and disrupting internal homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Normally, cells possess effective anti-oxidant protection mechanisms to maintain cell homeostasis, particularly through nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2), which serves as an efficient regulator of cellular anti-oxidant defense by modulating the expression of genes encoding anti-oxidant proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. NRF2 can bind to Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) in the cytoplasm under normal physiological conditions, and then undergo degradation via ubiquitination. When cells are exposed to oxidative stress, NRF2 dissociates from KEAP1, avoids ubiquitination, and is transferred from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, where it subsequently enhances expression of target proteins such as NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO-1) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) by binding to the anti-oxidant response element (ARE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, ROS can induce DNA damage, and alter the expression of proteins involved in cell regulation inhibition or activation, impairment of mitochondrial function, ultimately leading to apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Recent findings indicated that systemic activation of NRF2 signaling delays the onset of T1DM in spontaneous non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Therefore, targeting NRF2 may hold promise for T1DM prevention and treatment.</p>
<p>Eugenol (EUG), a phenolic aromatic compound, is obtained mainly from clove oil. It has various biological activities such as anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and anti-bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Previous study has demonstrated that EUG could reduce oxidative stress through activating the KEA1-NRF2 signaling pathway to alleviate colitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. Additionally, EUG has been found to attenuate transmissible gastroenteritis virus-induced apoptosis through the ROS-NRF2-ARE signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>].</p>
<p>So far, there has been no report to determine whether EUG has a protective effect on damaged pancreatic β cells in T1DM. Our study aims to investigate the protective effect of EUG on pancreatic β cell damage in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced T1DM mouse model and STZ-induced MIN6 cell model, and try to elucidate the underlying mechanism. The findings may provide a novel therapeutic candidate drug for T1DM.</p>

<label>2.1</label><title>Eugenol (EUG) can relieve the symptoms associate with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and reduce the blood glucose level in T1DM mice</title>
<p>The experimental design timeline for <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments was illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>. To evaluate the effects of EUG on T1DM mice, the fasting body weight (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), the fasting blood glucose (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), water intake in 24 h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), food intake in 24 h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>), and area of urine-soaked pads in T1DM mice (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplement Figure 1A</xref>) were recorded. The results showed that EUG effectively ameliorated the multiple symptoms associated with T1DM, including polydipsia, hyperphagia, polyuria, and weight loss, while 20 mg/kg EUG exhibited the most improvement. At the termination of the experiment, the mice in each group showed very different growth states (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplement Figure 1B</xref>). The results showed that the mice in T1DM group were significantly smaller than mice in Control group, and EUG treatment could improve this phenomenon. Given that T1DM can elevate the levels of urinary glucose and urine ketone, we conducted biochemical analysis for urine glucose (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplement Figure 1C</xref>) and urine ketone in each group of mice. The results (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1G</xref>) showed that EUG administration exhibited a mitigating effect on the increase of urinary glucose and urine ketone caused by T1DM.</p>

<p>It is widely known that both oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and insulin tolerance tests (ITT) can be used to detect T1DM and predict prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. In this study, mice in each group were performed OGTT at week 1 (before T1DM induction), week 3 (one week after T1DM induction), week 5 (three weeks after T1DM induction), and week 10 (at the end of the experiment). The results demonstrated that EUG treatment could effectively decrease blood glucose levels and improve islet function in T1DM mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1I</xref>). In addition, these findings were further demonstrated by the results of ITT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>). Diabetes is a chronic progressive disease, and long-term elevated blood glucose can have harmful effects on vital organs such as the heart, kidneys, and liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Therefore, PAS staining was performed on the kidneys (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplement Figure 1D</xref>). The results showed that T1DM indeed induced glycogen accumulation within the glomerulus, and EUG intervention showed a significant reduction in such glycogen accumulation, thereby enhancing the prognosis of T1DM. In brief, EUG could relieve the symptoms and reduce the blood glucose level in T1DM mice.</p>

<label>2.2</label><title>EUG can improve the damage degree of islets in T1DM mice</title>
<p>Insulin is produced by the β cells of pancreatic islets. Western blot (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) and RT-qPCR were employed to assess insulin expression levels in each group. The quantitative results of both western blot (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) and RT-qPCR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>) showed that there was a decrease in insulin expression in T1DM mice, while EUG intervention effectively increased insulin expression levels. In addition, the serum insulin levels of mice in each group were measured by ELISA at different time points. The results showed that serum insulin levels were significantly reduced after T1DM modeling, and subsequently recovered by EUG intervention as well as 20 mg/kg EUG exhibited the most improvement effect (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). The hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining was performed to observe the structural integrity of the islets in each group of mice. The results showed that, in comparison to the Control group, the islet structure of T1DM mice exhibited severe damage with indistinct boundaries and evident vacuolization in the islet cells. EUG intervention could improve the damage degree of islets (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Furthermore, insulin immunohistochemical staining was performed to further assess insulin expression in each group of mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). The quantitative result showed that EUG treatment significantly enhanced insulin expression in T1DM mice, and 20 mg/kg EUG displayed the most remarkable improvement (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). These findings suggested that EUG intervention could effectively ameliorate islet damage in T1DM mice.</p>

<label>2.3</label><title>EUG can reduce the apoptosis of pancreatic β cells in T1DM mice</title>
<p>DNA is essential for cell survival, and γH2AX serves as a reliable marker for DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Western blot was performed to assess the expression of γH2AX in each group of mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The results showed that the pancreatic β cells of T1DM mice had severe DNA damages, and EUG intervention could reduce the number of DNA damages (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). γH2AX immunohistochemical staining was also performed to assess γH2AX expression in each group of mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). The quantitative results were consistent with those of western blot. It is well known that DNA damage in cells is closely associated with apoptosis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). To investigate the potential anti-apoptotic effects of EUG on mouse pancreatic β cells, western blot was conducted to evaluate the expression levels of BCL2, BAX, and Cleaved Caspase-3 in pancreatic β cells of mice in each group (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). The results showed that there was a significant increase in the number of apoptotic pancreatic β cells in T1DM mice compared to Control group, and EUG intervention effectively inhibited the apoptosis of pancreatic β cells in T1DM mice as well as 20 mg/kg EUG had the most obvious effects (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Furthermore, the expression levels of <italic>Bcl2</italic> and <italic>Bax</italic> genes in pancreatic β cells of mice in each group were detected by RT-qPCR, and the results were consistent with those of western blot (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Finally, TUNEL staining was further performed to evaluate the apoptosis of pancreatic β cells in each group of mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). The quantitative results showed an increased number of apoptotic pancreatic β cells in T1DM mice, which could be mitigated by EUG intervention (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). These findings suggested that EUG exhibited a potential to attenuate pancreatic β cell apoptosis in T1DM mice.</p>

<label>2.4</label><title>EUG protects pancreatic β cells in T1DM mice by activating the NRF2 signaling pathway</title>
<p>Oxidative stress is a well-known pathogenic mechanism in T1DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. In addition, EUG has been reported to have powerful anti-oxidant properties and can effectively activate nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Western blot was used to detect the expression levels of total NRF2 protein (T-NRF2) and nuclear NRF2 protein (N-NRF2) in each group of mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). The findings showed that compared to Control group, the T1DM group exhibited an up-regulation in NRF2 expression, and EUG intervention could effectively activate NRF2, exerting anti-oxidative effects (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). The results of RT-qPCR were consistent with those of western blot (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Furthermore, western blot was conducted to evaluate the expression of key proteins involved in the NRF2 signal pathway in each group of mice such as Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1(NQO-1) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). The results showed that under the intervention of EUG, the protein expression levels of HO-1 and NQO-1 were increased, but the expression of KEAP1 was decreased due to the activation of NRF2 signaling pathway (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). The result of <italic>Ho-1</italic> gene expression was consistent with those of the above protein expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). Finally, biochemical assays were performed to detect the serum oxidative stress-related markers scuh as MDA, SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px in each group of mice. The oxidative stress related index (MDA) in the T1DM group was increased, and the expression of anti-oxidant stress related indexes (SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px) were significantly increased in EUG intervention group (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). These data suggested that EUG could alleviate oxidative stress-induced pancreatic β cell damage in TIDM mice through activating NRF2 signaling pathway.</p>

<label>2.5</label><title>EUG can alleviate the impairment of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced MIN6 cells</title>
<p>To further explore the potential effects of EUG on T1DM, we established STZ-induced MIN6 cell model <italic>in vitro</italic>. The cytotoxicity of STZ on MIN6 cells was evaluated by CCK-8 assay. The results showed that the viability of MIN6 cells decreased in a dose-dependent manner after 24 h treatment with different concentrations of STZ (0-8 mM), and the optimal concentration for STZ treatment was 1 mM (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplement Figure 2A</xref>). In addition, the cytotoxicity of EUG on MIN6 cells was also evaluated using CCK-8 assay. The results showed that EUG concentration in the range of 0-600 μM had no significant effect on cell viability (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplement Figure 2B</xref>). Before 1 mM STZ treatment, MIN6 cells were treated with different concentrations of EUG (0-400 μM) for 2 h. The result showed that the viability of MIN6 cells was improved by EUG pre-treatment and reached the optimum after 50 μM EUG treatment (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplement Figure 2C</xref>). Optical microscopy observation showed that compared to Control group, the number of cells in STZ group was significantly reduced and cell morphology was worse. EUG treatment could alleviate the above phenomena, while the intervention of NRF2 inhibitor ML385 (10 μM) could aggravate the cell damage (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplement Figure 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>Since pancreatic β cell damage can affect insulin secretion, we evaluated insulin protein and gene expression levels in different groups. Western blot (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>) and RT-qPCR were used to evaluate the expression levels of insulin protein and gene in each group. The results (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>) showed that insulin levels in the STZ-induced group were significantly lower than those in the Control group. However, after EUG treatment, STZ-induced insulin levels in MIN6 cells were significantly elevated, which could be reversed by the NRF2 inhibitor ML385 intervention. Furthermore, the cell culture supernatant of each group was collected for detecting insulin levels using ELISA, and the results were consistent with the above (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). These findings suggested that EUG has the potential to enhance the insulin secretion of STZ-induced MIN6 cells.</p>

<label>2.6</label><title>EUG reduces STZ-induced MIN6 cell damage through activating the NRF2 signaling pathway</title>
<p>In order to further explore the potential mechanism of EUG on T1DM, ML385, the typical NRF2 antagonist, was used to assess the expression of NRF2 pathway related proteins by western blot (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7A</xref>). The quantitative results showed that the protein levels of T-NRF2 and N-NRF2 in STZ-induced MIN6 cells were higher than those in the Control group, and EUG treatment markedly increased the expressions of T-NRF2 and N-NRF2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). Furthermore, EUG treatment also elevated HO-1 and NQO-1 protein levels but reduced KEAP1 level (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). However, ML385 could effectively reverse the effects of EUG on STZ-induced MIN6 cells. The quantitative results showed that the ratio of T-NRF2/β-Actin and N-NRF2/Lamin B decreased significantly after ML385 treatment, but EUG intervention could alleviate the decrease in NRF2 expression caused by ML385. Moreover, RT-qPCR (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7C</xref>) and immunofluorescence staining (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7D</xref>) were performed to assess the expressions of HO-1 and NRF2 in MIN6 cells with different treatments, and the trends of results were consistent with those of western blot (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7E</xref>). To further demonstrate that EUG can alleviate the STZ-induced MIN6 cells <italic>in vitro</italic> by activating the NRF2 signaling pathway, we used NRF2 inhibitor ML385 to detect oxidative stress in different groups. MitoSOX staining (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>) showed that EUG significantly reduced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in STZ-induced MIN6 cells, whereas ML385 could significantly weaken EUG effect (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>). These data suggested that EUG may ameliorate the damage of MIN6 cells caused by oxidative stress through activating NRF2 signaling pathway.</p>

<p>To further demonstrate that EUG can alleviate STZ-induced MIN6 cell damage <italic>in vitro</italic> by activating the NRF2 signaling pathway, we used NRF2 inhibitor ML385 to evaluate the apoptosis of MIN6 cells with different treatments. Western blot result of γH2AX (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>) showed that STZ treatment increased the amount of DNA damage in MIN6 cells, while EUG intervention effectively reduced the amount of DNA damage in MIN6 cells, but ML385 intervention could reversed this phenomenon.

<label>3.</label><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) involves the destruction of pancreatic β cells, resulting in an absolute deficiency of insulin, and T1DM is more common among adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Although subcutaneous insulin injection is the standard clinical treatment for T1DM, it does not improve life quality of patients. Therefore, it is urgent to explore more effective treatments for T1DM. A large number of studies have demonstrated that oxidative stress and apoptosis play crucial roles in causing islet damage in T1DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. In this study, we aimed to investigate the protective effects of eugenol (EUG) on islet damage <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> T1DM models, and tried to illuminate the underlying mechanism.</p>
<p>EUG is a phenolic compound found in many aromatic plants, and possesses a range of pharmacological properties such as anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-bacteria, and so on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. EUG can reduce blood glucose levels, alleviate insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>], inhibit the activity of key diabetes-related enzymes in diabetic rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], and inhibit the production of advanced glycosylation end products associated with diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. Therefore, it is speculated that EUG may have a protective effect on diabetes. So far, there has been no studies confirming whether EUG has a protective effect on T1DM. In this study, we will try to explore the protective effects of EUG on streptozotocin (STZ)-induced <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> T1DM models. Our <italic>in vivo</italic> results showed that EUG administration could effectively ameliorate the T1DM symptoms such as polydipsia, polyphagia, polyuria, and weight loss, and also alleviate ketonuria and glycosuria of T1DM mice. In addition, due to EUG intervention, the islet damage of T1DM mice was mitigated, and the insulin secretion was enhanced as well as hyperglycemia symptom was also effectively alleviated. As a chronic disease, diabetes can affect multiple organs such as the kidney, liver, and heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. In this study, PAS staining showed that EUG intervention could significantly reduce glomerular glycogen accumulation and improved the prognosis in T1DM mice. Our <italic>In vitro</italic> data showed that EUG treatment could ameliorate STZ-induced functional impairment of MIN6 cells and increase insulin secretion levels, while reducing apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Therefore, it can be speculated that EUG has the potential to treat T1DM.</p>
<p>The individuals suffering from diabetes exhibit chronic hyperglycemia, leading to the ROS generation that can cause cell damage through various mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. Mitochondria serve as the main source of ROS, and when mitochondrial dysfunction, there is an augmented ROS production in the mitochondrial respiratory chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. The mitochondrial respiratory chain complex enzymes are impaired under persistent hyperglycemia, leading to the development of secondary complications in diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. Therefore, oxidative stress is widely recognized as a major factor in the pathogenesis of diabetes. Our study showed that MDA level was elevated in T1DM mice. This biomarker is associated with oxidative stress that represents the end product of lipid peroxidation caused by free radicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. Additionally, anti-oxidant enzymes SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px can induce catabolism of superoxide and peroxides to protect the body from oxidative stress damage. In our study, there was a reduction in the levels of SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px in T1DM group <italic>in vivo</italic>, while EUG intervention could inhibit MDA level and promote productions of SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px in T1DM mice. These anti-oxidant enzymes subsequently inhibited oxidative stress response in T1DM mice by limiting free radical reaction. Mitochondria play a key role in the regulation of oxidative stress. MitoSOX fluorescence staining <italic>in vitro</italic> results showed that there was a significant increase in mitochondrial ROS in STZ-induced MIN6 cells, which could be reversed by EUG intervention. Furthermore, both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> findings revealed that EUG could enhance the relevant indicator expressions of NRF2 signaling pathway, which is associated with anti-oxidant stress response. To further verify the relationship between EUG and the NRF2 signaling pathway, the NRF2 specific inhibitor ML385 was used <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. Notably, ML385 could significantly abolish the effects of EUG. Therefore, we speculated that the activation of NRF2 signaling pathway might serve as a protective mechanism of EUG against STZ-induced T1DM.</p>
<p>NRF2 is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in cellular response to oxidative stress by inducing the expression of various anti-oxidants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>], and its activity is regulated by the endogenous inhibitor KEAP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. NRF2 and KEAP1 constitute a conserved intracellular defense mechanism against oxidative stress. Normally, KEAP1-CUL3-E3 ubiquitin ligase can target the N-terminal Neh2 domain of NRF2, and then facilitates NRF2 ubiquitination, thereby maintaining low level of NRF2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. In response to oxidative stress, specific cysteine residues in KEAP1 are modified to induce conformational changes in KEAP1-CUL3-E3 ubiquitin ligase, disrupting NRF2 ubiquitination and facilitating its translocation into the nucleus for heterodimerization with small MAF protein (sMAF). This complex then binds to anti-oxidant response elements (ARE) located in the promoter region of various cytoprotective genes to promote their transcription and induce the expression of a series of cell protective genes, such as NQO1, HO-1, SOD, CAT, GSH-Px, exerting an anti-oxidative stress role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. Previous study had demonstrated that EUG could attenuate transmissible gastroenteritis virus-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis through the ROS-NRF2-ARE signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. In this study, both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> data showed that EUG activated NRF2, enhanced its nuclear translocation, and induced the expression of cytoprotective proteins NQO-1 and HO-1. Furthermore, <italic>in vivo</italic> study showed that NRF2 regulated the levels of anti-oxidant enzymes such as SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px to inhibit free radical reactions to exert a protective effect on T1DM mice. Our <italic>in vivo</italic> results suggested that EUG has the potential to alleviate pancreatic β cell damage through activating the NRF2 pathway, thereby enhancing insulin secretion and improving the prognosis of T1DM. Meanwhile, ML385 intervention effectively counteracted the anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic effects of EUG, leading to reduced NRF2 nuclear translocation and down-regulation of anti-oxidant oxidases. Therefore, we speculated that EUG might alleviate pancreatic β cell damage through activating the NRF2 signaling pathway.</p>
<p>Mitochondria are the main sites for cellular ROS production, and intracellular ROS can serve as signaling molecules to regulate physiological functions of the body. ROS accumulation caused by hyperglycemia can lead to decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and increased membrane permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. The apoptotic factor cytochrome C (Cyct) is released into the cytoplasm to activate the Caspase cascade (e.g. Caspase9 and Caspase3 are activated successively), resulting in chromosome aggregation and DNA fragmentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. The protein Caspase-3, which is essential for cellular function, plays a pivotal role in the intricate process of programmed cell death known as apoptosis. The BCL-2 family proteins, including anti-apoptotic proteins such as BCL-2, BCL-xl, and pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAX and BAD, can regulate this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. The dysregulation of the BCL2/BAX, characterized by aberrant expression of anti-apoptotic or pro-apoptotic genes, can initiate apoptosis and ultimately lead to organ damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. The development of T1DM is caused by autoimmune destruction of islet β cells, and islet activation stimulates antigen-presenting cells to trigger the activation of CD4<sup>+</sup> helper T cells and subsequent the release of chemokines/cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. These cytokines then activate CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T cells, leading to the destruction of β cells. The apoptotic pathways of T1DM include exogenous (receptor mediated) and endogenous (mitochondria driven) mechanisms. Exogenous pathway encompasses CD4<sup>+</sup>-CD8<sup>+</sup> interacting Fas pathway, while endogenous pathway involves a delicate balance between anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma (BCL-2) and BCL-xL proteins with pro-apoptotic Bax, Bad, Bid, and Bik proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. Therefore, targeted intervention of apoptosis can effectively improve the prognosis of T1DM. EUG has been reported to alleviate precancerous breast lesions by inhibiting apoptosis through the HER2/PI3K-AKT pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. In this study, our <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> results showed that EUG treatment significantly down-regulated the expression of BAX and Cleaved Caspase-3 but up-regulated the level of BCL2 in the T1DM mice, and reduced the number of TUNEL positive cells, exerting a protective effect on islet β cells in T1DM mice. Cell survival relies on DNA integrity, as any damage to DNA can trigger cell apoptosis or necrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. In this study, our data demonstrated that the expression of the DNA damage biomarker γH2AX was elevated in T1DM group <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, but EUG intervention could reversed this trend. NRF2 can be involved in apoptosis regulation, and NRF2-deficient cells have increased spontaneous apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> results showed that the NRF2 specific inhibitor ML385 could decrease the anti-apoptosis effect of EUG on STZ-induced MIN6 cells. Therefore, we speculated that EUG could suppress apoptosis through activating the NRF2 signaling pathway.</p>
<p>In this study, <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> results suggested that EUG may play a protective role in pancreatic β cell damages of T1DM by alleviating oxidative stress and apoptosis via activating the NRF2 signaling pathway. However, there are certain limitations to our study. Firstly, ML385 was just used to assess the protective effect of EUG <italic>in vitro</italic> but not <italic>in vivo</italic>, and the inhibitory effect on NRF2 <italic>in vivo</italic> needs to be further investigated. Secondly, it is imperative to analyze the dynamics of NRF2 decay to determine whether EUG affects the stability of NRF2 protein and to further understand its mechanism of action. Lastly, although MIN6 cells are widely used in diabetes <italic>in vitro</italic> research, the primary islet cells would be optimal for T1DM study <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our studies demonstrated that EUG treatment could relieve the symptoms associate with T1DM and improve the damage of islets in T1DM mice. Moreover, EUG could suppress the impairment of STZ-induced MIN6 cell <italic>in vitro</italic>. EUG exhibits significant inhibitory effects on the oxidative stress and apoptosis in T1DM group <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> through activating the NRF2 mediated oxidative stress pathway. These findings suggested that EUG holds potential as a therapeutic option for patients with TIDM.</p>

<label>4.2</label><title>Animal experiment</title>
<p>After one week of adaptive feeding, type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) mouse model was established by streptozotocin (STZ; Sigma-Aldrich, CA, USA)-induced C57BL/6 mice. In brief, after 5 h fasting each morning in each group of mice, STZ was dissolved in a 0.1 M sodium citrate buffer (Solarbio, China, Beijing), and then intraperitoneally injected into mice at a dose of 50 mg/kg for 5 consecutive days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. Due to the instability and photosensitivity of STZ solution, it was prepared under dark condition and used immediately. To prevent death from transient hypoglycemia, the mice were given the 10% glucose solution instead of water during T1DM modeling. Fasting blood glucose levels were measured three days after modeling, and mice with fasting glucose levels more than 250 mg/dL were included in the study.</p>
<p>Regarding eugenol (EUG; purity &gt; 98%, MedChemExpress, NJ, USA) dosage setting, previous studies have demonstrated that oral administration of EUG (20mg/kg/day) is effective in improving hyperglycemic symptoms in mice for 15 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]. Additionally, studies have shown that oral administration of EUG (5, 10 mg/kg/day) can cure visceral leishmaniasis in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]. Based on these reports, the T1DM mice in our study were divided into five groups, such as Control (n = 30), T1DM (n = 30), T1DM + EUG (5 mg/kg/day) (n = 30), T1DM + EUG (10 mg/kg/day) (n = 30), and T1DM + EUG (20 mg/kg/day) (n = 30). Each group received daily intragastric administration for 8 weeks, and Control group received an equal volume of normal saline. Fasting blood glucose levels and fasting weight were measured and recorded weekly. Finally, serum samples were collected through orbital blood collection technique, and pancreatic tissue were isolated for subsequent experiments.</p>

<label>4.3</label><title>Fasting blood glucose, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and insulin tolerance test (ITT)</title>
<p>The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT) are widely regarded as the criterion for diagnosing diabetes, and are crucial methods for assessing pancreatic islet function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. After fasting for 14 h, the fasting blood glucose levels in each group mice were measured, and tail vein blood samples were collected and analyzed using a glucometer. OGTT was conducted in each group mice by intragastric administering 20% glucose solution after fasting for 14 h, and blood glucose levels were measured at 0 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, and 120 min after the first gavage administration. ITT was performed in each group mice by administering intraperitoneal injection of 0.75 U insulin/kg after fasting for 4 h and prepare 20% glucose solution to be administered in case a mouse became hypoglycemic. The blood glucose levels were measured at 0 min, 15 min, 30 min, 45 min, 60 min, and 90 min after the first intraperitoneal injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>].</p>

<label>4.4</label><title>Food, water, urine volume, and urine glucose measurements</title>
<p>The changes in food and water intake for each group were recorded throughout the experiment by controlling the daily initial food intake (100g) and water quantity (250mL). The urine volume of each cage was measured by recording the area of the bedding material saturated with urine. The urine of mice in each group was collected to detect the urine glucose levels according to the Urine glucose Assay Kit (Jiancheng, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China).</p>

<label>4.5</label><title>Islet isolation</title>
<p>The method described by Xu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>] was used to isolate islets. Firstly, the common bile duct was ligated, and collagenase V solution (0.8 mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich, CA, USA) was retrograde injected through the common bile duct until the pancreas was filled and foliated. The pancreas was then digested in the same concentration of 5 mL collagenase V solution at 37℃ for 15 min until most of the pancreatic tissues were digested into chylous and silt. To stop digestion, 10 mL of 4℃ Hank’s solution was added and then centrifuged after slight shaking, and stop immediately when the centrifugation speed reached 2000 rpm. The supernatant was discarded and the sediment was washed twice with Hanks balanced salt solution. Islet tissues were placed in 5 mL of 4℃ Ficoll density gradient medium (1.119). After mixing, a sequence of slow drips consisting of 2 mL 4℃ Ficoll density gradient medium (1.077) and 2 mL Hank’s solution were added into the tube before centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min. The sediment was washed again with Hank’s solution, and then was picked under a dissecting microscope (Leica, Germany). The isolated islets were promptly utilized for subsequent experimental procedures.</p>

<p>The mouse pancreatic β cell line MIN6 was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA), and was cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Gibco, United States) containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S; Gibco, CA, USA), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, CA, USA), and 1% MEM NON-ESSENTIAL AMINO ACIDS SOLUTION (100×; NEAA, Gibco, USA) at a 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. The cells were passaged every three days.</p>
<p>The <italic>in vitro</italic> cell model of T1DM was induced by STZ. MIN6 cells were treated with different concentrations of STZ (0.5 mM, 1 mM, 2 mM, 4 mM, and 8 mM) for 24 h to explore the optimal working concentration. Subsequently, STZ-induced MIN6 cells were treated with EUG at different concentrations (50 μM, 100 μM, 200 μM, 400 μM, and 600 μM) for 2 h to explore the optimal working concentration. Based on the optimal working concentrations of STZ and EUG, we set different groups such as Control, STZ, STZ + EUG, STZ + ML385 (10 μM, MedChemExpress, NJ, USA), STZ + ML385 + EUG. EUG or ML385 was pre-treated 2 h before the STZ stimulation, ML385 and EUG mixture in the same time.

<p>The total proteins from mouse islets or MIN6 cells were obtained using RIPA lysis buffer (Solarbio, Beijing, China) supplemented with a phosphatase inhibitor (Solarbio, Beijing, China) and a serine protease inhibitor (Solarbio, Beijing, China). Nuclear protein extraction kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) was used to extract nuclear proteins according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Protein concentration was determined using BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China). The 7.5%, or 12.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide (SDS-PAGE) gels were employed to separate 20∼80 µg proteins, which were subsequently transferred onto the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). These membranes were then blocked with 8% skim milk (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) at RT for 3 h. After washing with tris-buffered saline containing Tween-20 (TBST), these membranes were incubated overnight at 4℃ with primary antibodies listed in Supplementary Table 1. Then, these membranes were incubated with goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG HRP secondary antibodies (Affinity, Melbourne, Australia) diluted at a ratio of 1:5000 at RT for 3 h. Finally, the protein bands were detected using ECL chromogenic kit (EpiZyme, Shanghai, China), and visualized by ChemiDic<sup>TM</sup> XRS imaging system (Bio-Rad, CA USA).

<p>Summary</p>
<p>Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) progression is accelerated by oxidative stress and apoptosis. Eugenol (EUG) is a natural compound previously documented as anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and anti-apoptotic. In this manuscript by Jiang et al., the authors study the effects of EUG on T1DM in MIN6 insulinoma cells and a mouse model of chemically induced T1DM. The authors show that EUG increases nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) levels. This results in a reduction of pancreatic beta-cell damage, apoptosis, oxidative stress markers, and a recovery of insulin secretion. The authors highlight these effects as indicative of the therapeutic potential of EUG in managing T1DM.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>Relevant, timely, and addresses an interesting question in the field. The authors consistently observe enhanced beta cell functionality following EUG treatment, which makes the compound a promising candidate for T1DM therapy.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>The in vivo experiments have too few biological replicates. With an n=3 (as all figure legends indicate) in complex mouse studies such as these, drawing robust conclusions becomes challenging. It is important to reproduce these results in a larger cohort, to validate the conclusions of the authors. Another big concern is the lack of quantifications and statistical analysis throughout the manuscript. Although the authors claim statistical significance in various experiments, the limited information provided makes it difficult to verify. The authors use vague and minimal descriptions of their experiments, which further reduces the reader's comprehension and the reproducibility of the experiments. Finally, the use of Min6 cells as a model for pancreatic beta cells is a strong limitation of this study. Future studies should seek to reproduce these findings in a more translational model and use more relevant in vitro cell systems (eg. Islets).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors consider the effects of eugenol (EUG), a plant-produced substance known to reduce oxidative stress in various cellular contexts via Nrf2, in alleviating the effects of streptozotocin (STZ), a known rodent beta cell toxin. They claim that EUG treatment would be useful for T1D therapy.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The experiments shown are sufficiently clear and rather convincing in documenting that eugenol can revert the effects of streptozotocin on animal physiology as well as beta cell oxidative stress and cell death via activation of Nrf2.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>In my view, there are major concerns with the basic premises of the manuscript.</p>
<p>(1) While oxidative stress may be implicated in T1D they are neither the primary nor the main reason for autoimmune beta cell destruction. In T1DM, ER stress rather than oxidative stress is the main intracellular mediator of cell death. Thus, the abstract statement that 'oxidative stress plays a major role in T1D' is an exaggeration.</p>
<p>(2) Streptozotocin induces beta cell death through mechanisms that only partially overlap with autoimmune beta cell destruction. The main players ie beta cell / immune system crosstalk and T-cell mediated cell death are not present in the STZ model.</p>
<p>In short, because the interplay between the immune system and beta cell-intrinsic factors that trigger and accelerate the disease is completely missing, STZ treatment cannot be used as a T1DM model when beta cell demise mechanisms are concerned. The statement that STZ-treated mice are, in this context, a T1DM model, is misleading.</p>
<p>There are inconsistencies in the manuscript. Mechanistically, the manuscript remains at a rather superficial level demonstrating that the eugenol effects are mediated by Nrf2 upregulation and a downregulation of its partner inhibitor protein Keap1. How is eugenol penetrating the cell, is there a receptor that could be potentially targeted? Are there intermediary proteins that convey the effect to the Nrf2/Keap1 complex or is eugenol directly disrupting their interaction? What are direct downstream Nrf2 effectors? Besides, streptozotocin is also a powerful DNA alkylating agent. Are these effects mitigated by EUG?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study by Jiang et al. aims to establish the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) mouse model in vivo and the STZ-induced pancreatic β cell MIN6 cell model in vitro to explore the protective effects of Eugenol (EUG) on T1DM. The authors tried to elucidate the potential mechanism by which EUG inhibits the NRF2-mediated anti-oxidative stress pathway. Overall, this study is well executed with solid data, offering an intriguing report from animal studies for a potential new treatment strategy for T1DM.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The in vivo efficacy study is comprehensive and solid. Given that STZ-induced T1DM is a devastating and harsh model, the in vivo efficacy of this compound is really impressive.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The Mechanism is linked with the anti-oxidant property of the compound, which is common for many natural compounds, such as flavonoids and polyphenol. However, rarely, this kind of compound has been successfully developed into therapeutics in clinical usage. Indeed, if that is the case, Vitamin C or Vitamin E could be used here as the positive control.</p>
