<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Bactofilins are a widespread family of cytoskeletal proteins with important roles in bacterial morpho-genesis, chromosome organization and motility. They polymerize in a nucleotide-independent manner, forming non-polar filaments that are typically associated with the cytoplasmic membrane. Membrane binding was suggested to be mediated by a short N-terminal peptide, but the underlying mechanism and the conservation of this interaction determinant among bacteria remain unclear. Here, we use the bacto-filin homolog BacA of the stalked bacterium <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> as a model to analyze the membrane-binding behavior of bactofilins. Based on site-directed mutagenesis of the N-terminal region, we identify the full membrane-targeting sequence of BacA (MFSKQAKS) and pinpoint amino acid residues that are critical for its function <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Molecular dynamics simulations then provide detailed insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the membrane affinity of this peptide. Collectively, these analyses reveal a delicate interplay between the water exclusion of hydrophobic N-terminal residues, the arrangement of the peptide within the membrane and the electrostatic attraction between positively charged groups in the peptide and negative charges in the phospholipid molecules. A comprehensive bio-informatic analysis shows that the composition and properties of the membrane-targeting sequence of BacA are conserved in numerous bactofilin homologs from diverse bacterial phyla. Importantly, our findings reveal cooperative effects between the membrane-binding and polymerization activities of BacA. Moreover, they demonstrate that both of these activities critically contribute to the recruitment of the BacA client protein PbpC, a membrane-bound cell wall synthase that uses a conserved peptide in its N-terminal cytoplasmic tail to interact with BacA assemblies. Finally, we show that PbpC can functionally replace the endogenous membrane-targeting sequence of BacA when provided at elevated levels <italic>in trans</italic>, indicating that client proteins can make a significant contribution to the membrane association of bacto-filin polymers. Together, these results unravel the mechanistic underpinnings of membrane binding by bactofilin homologs, thereby illuminating a previously obscure but important aspect in the biology of this cytoskeletal protein family.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cytoskeletal proteins mediate a variety of fundamental cellular processes in bacteria, including cell growth, cell division and DNA segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cabeen and Jacobs-Wagner, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Wagstaff and Löwe, 2018</xref>). Many important components of the bacterial cytoskeleton have eukaryotic homologs. The conserved cell division protein FtsZ, for instance, is a member of the tubulin superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Löwe and Amos, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Mukherjee et al., 1993</xref>), forming dynamic polymers at the cell division site that control the assembly and function of the cell division apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">McQuillen and Xiao, 2020</xref>). By contrast, the morphogenetic protein MreB, which governs cell growth and morphology in most rod-shaped bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Jones et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">van den Ent et al., 2001</xref>), is homologous to actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Rohs and Bernhardt, 2021</xref>). Some bacteria also possess intermediate-filament-like proteins, such as the coiled-coil-rich protein crescentin, which promotes cell curvature in the crescent-shaped alphaproteobacterium <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ausmees et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Liu et al., 2024</xref>). Apart from these universally conserved cytoskeletal protein families, bacterial cells can contain various polymer-forming proteins that are typically absent from eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Wagstaff and Löwe, 2018</xref>). A pro-minent member of this group of proteins is bactofilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kühn et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Bactofilin homologs are widespread among bacteria and involved in diverse cellular functions. In many species, they have important roles in cell shape determination, including the establishment or adjustment of cell curvature in <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Sycuro et al., 2010</xref>), <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Frirdich et al., 2023</xref>), <italic>Leptospira biplexa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Jackson et al., 2018</xref>) and <italic>Rhodospirillum rubrum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Pöhl et al., 2024</xref>), the modulation of cell size in <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brockett et al., 2021</xref>), the formation of buds in <italic>Hyphomonas neptunium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Pöhl et al., 2024</xref>), the stabilization of rod shape in <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Koch et al., 2011</xref>) and <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hay et al., 1999</xref>) and the synthesis of stalk-like cellular extensions in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kühn et al., 2010</xref>), <italic>Asticcacaulis biprosthecum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Caccamo et al., 2020</xref>) and <italic>Rhodomicrobium vannielii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Richter et al., 2023</xref>). Other functions include DNA organization in <italic>M. xanthus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anand et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lin et al., 2017</xref>) as well as cell motility in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">El Andari et al., 2015</xref>). Bactofilins are relatively small proteins charac-terized by a central Bactofilin A/B domain (InterPro ID: IPR007607) that is typically flanked by unstructured terminal regions of varying lengths. The central domain is ∼110 amino acids long and folds into a compact right-handed β-helix with a triangular geometry, measuring roughly 3 nm along its longitudinal axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kassem et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Shi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Vasa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Zuckerman et al., 2015</xref>). This basic unit polymerizes into extended non-polar filaments through alternating head-to-head and tail-to-tail interactions between individual subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Deng et al., 2019</xref>). The resulting protofilaments can further assemble into higher-order structures such as bundles, lattices and 2D crystalline sheets <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Holtrup et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kühn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Pöhl et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Sichel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Vasa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Zuckerman et al., 2015</xref>) and, potentially, also <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kühn et al., 2010</xref>). Previous studies have indicated that bactofilins are typically associated with the cytoplasmic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Deng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hay et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Koch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kühn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lee et al., 2023</xref>). However, only a small subset of them, including certain gammaproteobacterial representatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hay et al., 1999</xref>), contain predicted transmembrane helices, suggesting that canonical bactofilins use an unconventional membrane-targeting mechanism that may have specifically evolved in this cyto-skeletal protein family. Consistent with this notion, the membrane-binding activity of bactofilin homologs from <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Deng et al., 2019</xref>) and <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lee et al., 2023</xref>) has recently been shown to depend on a short peptide in the N-terminal unstructured region of the proteins. However, the conservation of this peptide, the precise mechanism underlying its affinity for the lipid bilayer, and the interplay between membrane attachment and bactofilin polymerization still remain to be investigated.</p>
<p>In this study, we comprehensively analyze the membrane-binding behavior of bactofilins, using BacA from <italic>C. crescentus</italic> as a model protein. Previous work has shown that BacA forms membrane-associated poly-meric sheets at the old pole of the <italic>C. crescentus</italic> cell, which recruit the cell wall synthase PbpC to stimulate stalk formation at this subcellular location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Billini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hughes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kühn et al., 2010</xref>). By systematically exchanging residues in the N-terminal region of BacA, we identify a short N-terminal pep-tide (MFSKQAKS) that acts as the membrane-targeting sequence (MTS) of BacA and pinpoint residues critical for its membrane-binding activity <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. We then clarify the molecular mechanism underlying the membrane affinity of this sequence using molecular dynamics simulations. A compre-hensive bioinformatic analysis suggests that the mode of action identified for the MTS of BacA may be broadly conserved among bactofilins from various different phyla. Importantly, our findings indicate that membrane association and polymerization are cooperative processes that are both required for robust BacA assembly, with polymerization in turn promoting the interaction of BacA with its client protein PbpC, and vice versa. Together, these findings reveal the mechanistic basis of membrane binding by bactofilin homologs and highlight the implications of this process for bactofilin function, thereby shedding light on a thus-far poorly understood aspect in the biology of this widespread cytoskeletal protein.</p>

<title>The membrane-binding activity of BacA depends on an N-terminal amphipathic peptide</title>
<p>Previous work has proposed a small N-terminal peptide as the membrane-targeting sequence (MTS) of canonical bactofilin homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Deng et al., 2019</xref>). In the case of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> BacA, the suggested region comprises the sequence MFSKQAKS at the N-terminal end of the protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). To verify the importance of this peptide for BacA function, we compared the localization pattern of wild-type BacA with that of a mutant derivative lacking the predicted membrane-targeting sequence (MTS). For this purpose, the two proteins were fused to the monomeric yellow fluorescent protein mVenus and produced in a strain carrying an in-frame deletion in the endogenous <italic>bacA</italic> and <italic>bacB</italic> genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). As expected, the wild-type protein was fully functional and formed distinct fluorescent foci at the stalked pole of the cells, which have been previously shown to reflect the formation of small patches of membrane-associated BacA polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kühn et al., 2010</xref>). The mutant protein (Δ2-8), by contrast, was evenly distributed in the cytoplasm, supporting the idea that the N-terminal region of BacA is involved in membrane binding. The diffuse local-ization also suggests a defect in polymerization, which however may be a secondary effect resulting from the loss of membrane association, since previous work has shown that the unstructured terminal regions are not essential for bactofilin assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Sichel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Vasa et al., 2015</xref>). In line with this finding, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis confirmed that the Δ2-8 variant formed polymers similar to those of wild-type BacA when overproduced in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, although not essential, membrane binding may facilitate BacA polymerization at native expression levels by promoting its enrichment at the membrane surface and thereby stimulating inter-subunit interactions. To further evaluate the role of polymerization in BacA localization, we generated a mutant variant of BacA impaired in self-assembly by replacing a conserved phenylalanine residue in the C-terminal polymerization interface of its Bactofilin A/B domain (F130 in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> BacA) with a charged arginine residue. Consistent with previous work in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Deng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jacq et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Zuckerman et al., 2015</xref>), TEM analysis (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>) and size-exclusion chromatography studies (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref>) verified that the mutant protein (F130R) failed to form polymeric structures <italic>in vitro</italic>. Importantly, the corresponding mVenus fusion protein no longer formed membrane-associated polar foci but was dispersed within the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting that polymerization and membrane binding could stimulate each other.</p>

<p>Apart from transmembrane segments, proteins commonly employ amphiphilic helices to associate with the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane, as exemplified by the bacterial actin homologs FtsA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Pichoff and Lutkenhaus, 2005</xref>) and MreB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Salje et al., 2011</xref>). As a first step to clarify the mechanism underlying the membrane-binding activity of the MTS, we therefore determined whether it was able to adopt an amphiphilic helical structure. However, neither machine-learning-based pattern recognition, as employed by AmphipaSeeK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Sapay et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), nor helical wheel analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) provided any support for this possibility, suggesting a different mode of action.</p>
<p>To obtain more insight into the function of the MTS, we systematically exchanged single or multiple amino acid residues in the N-terminal eight amino acids of BacA-mVenus (<xref rid="fig1s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1–figure supplement 3</xref>) and analyzed the localization patterns of the mutant proteins. Among the single exchanges, substitution of the hydrophobic phenylalanine residue at position 2 (F2Y and F2E) led to a disperse or, occasionally, patchy distribution of the fusion protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Other single substitutions, by contrast, had relatively mild effects, including the formation of multiple and/or mispositioned bactofilin complexes (<xref rid="fig1s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 1–figure supplement 4</xref>). Notably, however, a double exchange replacing the two positively charged lysine residues in the MTS with polar serine residues (K4S-K7S) strongly increased the fraction of delocalized protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), although distinct fluorescent foci or patches were still detectable, suggesting residual membrane-binding activity. An even stronger effect, as reflected by a complete dispersion of the fluorescence signal, was observed when negatively charged glutamate residues were introduced at these positions (K4E-K7E). Collectively, these results point to a central role of F2 and K4/K7 in the association of BacA with the cytoplasmic membrane.</p>
<p>To further characterize the mutant BacA-mVenus variants, we analyzed their mobility within the cell using single-particle tracking (Figure 2–video 1 and <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>). As expected, given its ability to interact with the membrane and polymerize, the wild-type protein exhibited a very low diffusional mobility. Mutant variants that were partially delocalized (F2Y and K4S-K7S) were significantly more mobile, and variants with a largely diffuse localization (Δ2-8, F2E, K4E-K7E and F2E-K4E-K7E) displayed the highest diffusion rates, approaching the mobility of free mVenus (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <bold>Supplementary file 1</bold>). These results support the notion that the MTS is required for the formation of stable membrane-associated BacA assemblies.</p>

</fig>
<p>As a direct means to analyze the membrane-binding activity of the fusion proteins, we next performed cell fractionation studies. To this end, cells producing different BacA-mVenus variants were lysed and membranes were separated from soluble components by ultracentrifugation. Western blot analysis revealed that a large part of the wild-type protein was detected in the membrane fraction, whereas the variant lacking the MTS (Δ2-8) was completely soluble (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). A severe reduction in membrane-binding activity was also observed for all fusion proteins lacking residues F2 and K4/K7 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), confirming the importance of these residues in the function of the MTS.</p>
<p>After having identified a role of the MTS in the association of BacA with membranes <italic>in vivo</italic>, we aimed to verify the membrane-targeting activity of this peptide in a defined system <italic>in vitro</italic>. For this purpose, we purified wild-type BacA and various mutant derivatives, using a cleavable N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-SUMO affinity tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Marblestone et al., 2006</xref>), which allowed us to obtain proteins without any non-native extensions that could potentially interfere with the analysis. This approach also made it possible to obtain two additional BacA variants, one lacking the N-terminal methionine of BacA (ΔM) and another one lacking the N-terminal methionine and containing a glutamate instead of the phenylalanine normally located at the second position of the MTS (xE). We then incubated the different proteins with small unilamellar vesicles (liposomes) made of phosphatidylglycerol, which has been identified as the most abundant membrane lipid in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> under standard growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Contreras et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Stankeviciute et al., 2019</xref>). Subsequently, the liposomes were collected by ultracentrifugation and analyzed for the amount of bound protein (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Consistent with the <italic>in vivo</italic> data, a large proportion (∼80%) of the wild-type protein was associated with the liposome pellet, whereas only a small fraction sedimented in control reactions lacking liposomes, likely reflecting large, poorly soluble polymer bundles. Variants lacking the entire MTS (Δ2-8) or carrying the F2E or K4E/K7E exchanges, by contrast, showed severe defects in membrane binding, with sedimentation efficiencies similar to those obtained in the liposome-free control reactions. Residual binding was still observed for the F2Y and K4S/K7S variants, consistent with the milder defects observed for these proteins in the localization and single-particle tracking studies (compare <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). Notably, while the behavior of the xE variant closely resembled that of the F2E variant, the absence of residue M1 (ΔM) alone only partially abolished the membrane association of BacA, indicating that the N-terminal methionine plays an important but not decisive role in the function of the MTS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Together, these findings verify the existence of an N-terminal MTS in BacA. Moreover, they identify the hydrophobic residues M1 and F2 and the two positively charged lysine residues K4 and K7 as key determinants of its membrane-binding affinity.</p>

<title>BacA polymerization and membrane binding are mutually stimulating processes</title>
<p>Our results showed that the disruption of the polymerization interface (F130R) resulted in a diffuse, cyto-plasmic localization of BacA, suggesting that polymerization might be a prerequisite for efficient membrane binding (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). To investigate this possibility, we clarified the membrane-binding activity of the polymerization-deficient F130R variant of BacA-mVenus. Cell fractionation experiments showed that the fusion protein was barely detectable in the membrane fraction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). In line with this finding, only marginal membrane-binding activity was observed for the untagged BacA-F130 variant in liposome-binding assays (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). These results suggest that the MTS has a relatively low affinity for the membrane, so that a stable interaction can only be achieved by cooperative binding of multiple MTS-containing N-terminal tails, arrayed on the surface of bactofilin polymers. Further support for this idea came from domain swapping experiments that showed that the MTS of BacA was able to mediate stable membrane attachment when fused to a derivative of the polymer-forming protein crescentin from <italic>C. crescentus</italic> lacking its native membrane-targeting sequence (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Interestingly, the diffuse localization and high diffusional mobility of BacA variants containing a defective MTS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>) indicate that there may also be a converse stimulatory effect of membrane binding on BacA polymerization. To further assess this possibility, we analyzed whether an MTS-defective BacA variant could regain the ability to form membrane-associated polymeric complexes if equipped with a heterologous membrane-targeting sequence. To this end, two copies of the N-terminal amphiphilic helix of <italic>E. coli</italic> MreB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Salje et al., 2011</xref>) were fused to a BacA-mVenus variant lacking the native MTS-containing peptide (Δ2-8). Microscopic analysis revealed that the fusion protein condensed into distinct foci at the old pole or the cell center (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), reminiscent of the aberrant localization patterns observed for mutant proteins with exchanges in the MTS that did not completely abolish membrane binding (compare <xref rid="fig1s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 1–figure supplement 4</xref>). The restoration of fluorescent foci was accompanied by a strong decrease in diffusional mobility, as determined by single-molecule tracking (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). In addition, cell fractiona-tion experiments showed that the fusion protein was highly enriched in the membrane pellet (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Importantly, when its polymerization interface was disrupted by introduction of the F130R exchange, focus formation was abolished, membrane binding was strongly reduced, and the diffusional mobility of the fusion protein increased to a value similar to that of an F130R variant containing the native MTS of BacA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C-E</xref>). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the polymerization and membranebinding activities of BacA strongly stimulate each other.</p>

<title>Molecular dynamics simulations identify M1, K4 and K7 as key residues of the BacA MTS</title>
<p>To investigate the molecular underpinnings of the interaction between the MTS of BacA and the membrane, we turned to all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. For this purpose, peptides comprising the ten N-terminal bactofilin residues were simulated in the presence of a multi-component lipid bilayer that was composed of approximately 50% monoglucosyldiglyceride (GLY), 33% phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and 16% diacylglycerol (DAG) lipids (see <bold>Supplementary file 2</bold> for details), approximating the native com-position of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> cell membranes under standard growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chow and Schmidt, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Contreras et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Stankeviciute et al., 2019</xref>). In addition to the wild-type peptide MFSKQAKSNN, our analysis also included the mutant F2Y and K4S-K7S variants (each in a separate simulation).</p>
<p>The starting structures of the peptides were modeled in an extended conformation without any secondary structure. At the beginning, a single peptide (wild-type, F2Y or K4S-K7S) was placed in the aqueous phase at a distance of approximately 3 nm from the lipid headgroups. During the 500-ns simulations, all three peptides rapidly bound to the membrane and established multiple contacts with the lipids at the mem-brane/water interface (illustrated for the wild-type MTS in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). In doing so, the peptides did not adopt any persistent secondary structures but remained disordered, with a preference for somewhat extended conformations (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B,C</xref> and <bold>Supplementary file 3</bold>). Notably, in control simulations in which the peptides were initially modeled as α-helices, the peptides unfolded rapidly, either in the aqueous phase or after binding to the membrane/water interface, eventually yielding the same results (within the statistical uncertainties) as the simulations starting from an extended conformation.</p>

</fig>
<p>Excluding the initial phase of the simulations in which the peptides were not yet bound to the membrane, we then determined the density profiles of the three different peptides along the membrane normal (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>). The results show that the N-terminal residues 1 and 2 insert deeply into the lipid bilayer, assuming positions below the phosphate headgroup region, while the positions of the remaining residues (3 to 10) are gradually shifted towards the aqueous phase. The peptides thus bind to the membrane in a tilted orientation, with their N-terminal region protruding more deeply into the hydrophobic parts of the lipid headgroup region (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Interestingly, in case of the F2Y variant, the presence of tyrosine at position 2 pulls residue M1 and Y2 further towards the head-group/water interface (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5–figure supplement 1B</xref>). This result can be explained by the preferential hydration of tyrosine compared to phenylalanine, as is also reflected in the difference of the solvation free energies (ΔG<sub>solv</sub>) of the corresponding side-chain analogs <italic>p</italic>-cresol (-25.6 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>) and toluene (-3.2 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Wolfenden et al., 1981</xref>).</p>
<p>To characterize the interactions between the peptides and the membrane in more detail, the contacts between the individual peptide residues and the different lipid species in the bilayers were counted. The results confirm the above finding that residues 1 and 2 show the strongest association with lipids and that lipid interactions gradually decrease for residues further down the peptide chain (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Notably, among these interactions, contacts with anionic PG lipids dominate, even though the percentage of PG lipids (33%) in the simulated bilayer is smaller than that of GLY lipids (50%) (see above and <bold>Supplementary file 2</bold>), which can largely be attributed to the lysine residues at positions 4 and 7. In line with this result, the K4S-K7S variant shows a strong reduction in the number of PG contacts at these positions, which is partially compensated by a higher prevalence of GLY contacts, particularly for residues 1 to 5 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). The F2Y variant, by contrast, did not show a marked decrease in the number of total lipid contacts for position 2, with fewer PG contacts (of residues 1 and 2) again compensated by more GLY lipid contacts (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Taken together, the lipid contact analysis shows that the N-terminal residues M1 and F2 establish the closest contacts with the lipid bilayer, and that the lysine residues K4 and K7 strongly interact with PG lipids.</p>

</fig>
<p>The contact analysis described above only provides insight into the spatial proximity of the peptides and the lipids. To additionally determine the strength of the interactions, we analyzed the MD simulations in terms of the interaction energies between the different peptide residues and the lipid molecules (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). For both the wild-type peptide and its F2Y variant, the strongest (most favorable) peptide-lipid interaction energy is seen for residues 1, 4 and 7, which can be attributed to strong electrostatic attraction between the PG lipids and the charged NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> group at the N-terminus (residue M1) as well as the side chains of residues K4 and K7, respectively. Notably, out of all residues, M1 interacts most strongly with the membrane. Nevertheless, its removal (ΔM) had only a moderate effect on the membrane-binding activity of BacA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), corroborating the notion that the largest part of the interaction energy is provided by the N-terminal NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> group of M1 rather than its hydrophobic side chain. However, taken together, the two lysines K4 and K7 make an even larger contribution to the interaction, consistent with the significant reduction in membrane association observed for the K4S-K7S variants of BacA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C</xref><bold>, 2C and 3</bold>). It is interesting to note that in terms of the interaction energy, residue F2 does not seem to play a prominent role in the peptide-membrane association (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>), although the F2Y exchange strongly reduces the membrane-binding affinity of BacA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C</xref><bold>, 2C and 3</bold>). The deleterious effect of this exchange may be explained by the preferential hydration of tyrosine compared to phenylalanine, which is not reflected in the peptide-membrane interaction energy but in the difference in hydration freeenergy (see above). Furthermore, residues M1 and Y2 in the F2Y peptide are located in closer proximity to the aqueous phase (see <xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5–figure supplement 1B</xref>), which leads to a substantial decrease in the favorable interaction energy of the N-terminal NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>-group with PG lipids that is only incompletely compensated by slightly more favorable interactions with GLY lipids (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Together, these results provide a rational basis for the experimental finding that the F2Y and K4S-K7S variants of BacA have a considerably lower membrane-binding affinity than the wild-type protein.</p>

<title>The N-terminal membrane-targeting sequence is conserved among bactofilin homologs</title>
<p>The results of the MD simulations confirmed that the short peptide (MFSKQAKS) at the N-terminus of BacA acts as an MTS. To assess whether this mode of interaction was more widespread among bactofilins, we set up a bioinformatic pipeline to analyze the conservation of the N-terminal region of bactofilin homologs from a broad range of bacterial lineages (<xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7–figure supplement 1</xref>). To this end, all proteins containing an annotated bactofilin domain were retrieved from the UniProt database (UniProt Consortium, 2023). After the exclusion of entries from non-bacterial origin, we eliminated all bactofilin homologs containing predicted N-terminal transmembrane helices as a membrane anchor. These proteins were relatively rare (∼3.2%) but widely distributed across the bacterial phylogeny, with the majority found in the gammaproteobacteria (<xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7–figure supplement 1</xref>). To avoid biases arising from the over-representation of certain bacterial species in UniProt, we next grouped highly similar (&gt;90% identity) bactofilin sequences, which typically represent orthologs from different sequenced strains, and only kept one sequence per group. For each of the remaining proteins, we then determined the N-terminal region preceding the bactofilin domain. Based on the length of the MTS identified for BacA, we eliminated proteins whose predicted N-terminal tails were shorter than eight amino acids, potentially due to misannotation of the translational start sites. The remaining proteins (14337 sequences) were then used to search for conserved N-terminal amino acid motifs.</p>
<p>A global analysis of the entire protein set yielded a conserved motif with the consensus sequence MFSKKKK, which resembled the MTS identified for <italic>C. crescentus</italic> BacA and contained both the two hydrophobic N-terminal residues that insert into the core of the lipid bilayer as well as the two lysin residues that make electrostatic interactions with the headgroups of PG lipids (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). This result suggests that the presence of an N-terminal MTS is a common feature of bacterial bactofilin homologs. However, this global approach might obscure lineage-specific adaptations of the MTS to evolutionary differences in membrane lipid composition. To address this issue, we conducted an additional analysis in which we sorted the proteins according to their phylogenetic origin before performing a motif search. In doing so, we focused on the phyla Pseudomonadota, Bacteroidota, Bacillota, Spirochaetota and Thermodesulfobacteriota, which contribute the majority of the bactofilin homologs in the UniProt database. This refined analysis confirmed the presence of conserved N-terminal motifs in each of the five phyla, although there is variability in the consensus sequences of these motifs both within and between phyla (<xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7–figure supplement 1</xref>). A comparison of the most prevalent motifs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>) revealed that bactofilin homologs from Pseudomonadota and Bacillota share highly similar N-terminal sequences, which largely correspond to the global motif described above. A similar N-terminal motif is also found in most bactofilin homologs from Bacteroidota, although these proteins often display a negatively rather than a positively charged residue at position 4. The most prevalent motif identified in Spirochaetota and Thermodesulfobacteriota, by contrast, is fundamentally different from the global consensus motif and may thus have a function unrelated to membrane binding (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). However, there is also a subset of sequences from these phyla that do share MTS-like sequences (<xref rid="fig7s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 7–figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that the ability of bactofilins to interact with membranes is still widespread in these phyla. Together, these results strongly suggest that the majority of bactofilin homologs known to date feature an N-terminal MTS whose composition and mode of action are similar to that of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> BacA.</p>

<title>BacA polymerization promotes client-protein binding</title>
<p>The only client protein of BacA reported to date is the cell wall synthase PbpC, a bitopic membrane protein related to <italic>E. coli</italic> PBP1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Yakhnina et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Strobel et al., 2014</xref>). Previous work has shown that its N-terminal cytoplasmic tail was sufficient for its bactofilin-dependent recruitment to the stalked cell pole of <italic>C. crescentus</italic>, suggesting that this region of the protein contains all critical interaction determinants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hughes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kühn et al., 2010</xref>). However, its precise mode of interaction with the polar bactofilin cluster and the role of this interaction in bactofilin assembly has remained unclear.</p>
<p>To clarify which of the two bactofilin paralogs of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> interacts with PbpC to mediate its polar localization, we analyzed the subcellular distribution of an mVenus-tagged PbpC variant in different bacto-filin mutants. The fusion protein retained its wild-type localization pattern in the Δ<italic>bacB</italic> background but failed to condense into polar foci in Δ<italic>bacA</italic> cells, identifying BacA as its main interactor (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref> and <xref rid="fig8s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 8–figure supplement 1A</xref>). Next, we aimed to pinpoint the regions in the cytoplasmic tail of PbpC that mediate its recruitment to BacA. For this purpose, we retrieved the amino acid sequences of PbpC homologs and aligned their predicted cytoplasmic tails (<xref rid="fig8s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 8–figure supplement 2</xref>). This analysis identified four distinct segments, including (i) a highly conserved peptide at the N-terminal end of PbpC (region C1), (ii) a proline-rich medial region, (iii) a second highly conserved peptide (Region C2) and (iv) a region rich in positively charged amino acids immediately adjacent to the transmembrane helix. To assess the importance of these segments, we generated mVenus-PbpC derivatives whose cytoplasmic tail either lacked region C1 (Δ2-13) or only comprised region C1, with the remaining parts being replaced by an unstructured region taken from the periplasmic protein DipM of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Izquierdo-Martinez et al., 2023</xref>) (<xref rid="fig8s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 8–figure supplement 3</xref>). Microscopic analysis showed that the removal of region C1 resulted in the loss of polar localization, whereas the chimeric variant showed the same localization pattern as the wild-type fusion protein (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). Similar results were obtained for cells that were cultivated under phosphate-limiting condition to stimulate stalk growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Schmidt, 1968</xref>). Interestingly, the delocalization of mVenus-PbpC upon deletion of region C1 did not reduce its ability to promote stalk elongation (<xref rid="fig8s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 8–figure supplement 4</xref>). Region C1 thus appears to be necessary and sufficient for the recruitment of PbpC to the cell pole-associated BacA assembly, but dispensable for its role in stalk biogenesis.</p>

<p>To verify the ability of region C1 to directly associate with BacA, we generated a synthetic peptide comprising the N-terminal 13 residues of PbpC and analyzed its interaction with purified BacA polymers using biolayer interferometry. When biosensors carrying the immobilized peptide were titrated with increasing concentrations of BacA, we observed specific binding with an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>) of 4.9 µM (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref> and <xref rid="fig8s5" ref-type="fig">Figure 8–figure supplement 5</xref>). A similar assay with the polymerization-deficient F130R variant, by contrast, only yielded residual binding with very fast dissociation rates (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>). These results confirm the direct interaction of BacA with region C1 of PbpC. Moreover, they indicate that BacA polymerization is a prerequisite for efficient and stable PbpC binding, likely because the high local accumulation of BacA within polymers leads to an increase in the avidity for its interaction partner.</p>
<p>Having identified a direct association of BacA with the N-terminal peptide of PbpC, we set out to map the PbpC-binding site of BacA using hydrogen-deuterium-exchange (HDX) mass spectrometry, a method that allows the detection of local shifts in the accessibility of backbone amide hydrogens induced by conformational changes and/or ligand binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Konermann et al., 2011</xref>). When analyzed alone, the HDX profile of BacA showed very fast HDX in the N-and C-terminal regions flanking the bactofilin domain, which indicates a high degree of disorder and thus corroborates the predicted domain structure of BacA (<xref rid="fig8s6" ref-type="fig">Figure 8–figure supplement 6</xref>). Upon incubation with the PbpC peptide, several peptides in the C-terminal half of the central bactofilin domain exhibited a small, yet significant decrease in the HDX rate (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>), with the most prominent changes observed in a region close to the C-terminal polymerization interface (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>). Although additional studies are required to precisely define the interface, this finding suggest that inter-subunit interactions in the bactofilin polymer could potentially induce slight conformational changes in BacA that promote PbpC binding.</p>
<p>To clarify whether the interaction with PbpC contributes to BacA assembly, we compared the localization patterns of BacA-Venus in wild-type and Δ<italic>pbpC</italic> cells. The behavior of the fusion protein was unchanged in the mutant background, suggesting that PbpC does not have a major role in BacA polymerization or membrane binding (<xref rid="fig8s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 8–figure supplement 1B</xref>). Nevertheless, it was conceivable that PbpC binding could contribute, at least to some extent, to the association of BacA polymers with the cytoplasmic mem-brane, thereby complementing the activity of the MTS. To test this hypothesis, we set out to investigate the effect of PbpC on the assembly of an MTS-free BacA-mVenus variant (Δ2-8). Our initial studies showed that the mutant protein had a diffuse localization when analyzed in cells producing PbpC at native levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). However, it was possible that, in this setting, the affinity between the two proteins or the number of PbpC molecules available for the interaction are not be high enough to compensate for the loss of the endogenous membrane-targeting sequence. We therefore performed localization studies in cells that overproduced a C-terminally truncated variant of PbpC in which the periplasmic region was replaced by the fluorescent protein mCherry (PbpC<sub>1-132</sub>-mCherry) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kühn et al., 2010</xref>), thereby accumulateing elevated levels of the PbpC membrane anchor. Control experiments showed that the truncated protein colocalized with wild-type BacA-mVenus and stabilized the polar bactofilin cluster under conditions of BacA-mVenus overproduction (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref> and <xref rid="fig9s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 9–figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, the increased availability of the PbpC membrane anchor also fully restored polar localization for the MTS-free fusion protein (Δ2-8), whereas it could not reverse the localization defect of the polymerization-deficient F130R variant (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). These results support the notion that membrane binding and polymerization are co-operative processes that are both required for efficient bactofilin assembly. Moreover, they suggest that membrane-bound client proteins can contribute to the recruitment of bactofilins to the cytoplasmic membrane, although the importance of this effect may vary between systems.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Bactofilins are widespread among bacteria and mediate the spatial organization of diverse cellular processes. Although the polymers they form are typically associated with the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane, the vast majority of bactofilin homologs lack transmembrane helices, suggesting the existence of an alternative membrane-targeting mechanism. Consistent with this notion, the membrane-binding activity of the bactofilin <italic>Th</italic>Bac from <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> has recently been localized to the unstructured N-terminal tail of the protein, and a sequence alignment based on several well-characterized bactofilin hom-ologs suggested the existence of a conserved N-terminal motif in this protein region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Deng et al., 2019</xref>). Our work considerably extends these initial findings by determining the precise composition of the N-terminal MTS, unraveling its mode of action and clarifying its conservation among bacteria. Moreover, we reveal a mutual dependence of membrane-binding and bactofilin polymerization and provide first insights into mode of interaction between the bactofilin scaffold and membrane-associated client proteins.</p>
<p>Mutational analysis of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> BacA identified residues F2 and K4/K7 as key components of the BacA MTS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). This finding is explained by the results of our MD analysis, which show that the insertion of F2 into the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>) is critical to ensure the proper positioning of the MTS in the membrane, thereby promoting electrostatic interactions of the N-terminal NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> group with the negatively charged lipid headgroups of phosphatidylglycerol. The positively charged ε-amino groups of K4 and K7, by contrast, directly interact with these lipid headgroups, making the largest contribution to the overall interaction energy (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Notably, the N-terminal methionine residue of proteins is usually removed after translation when followed by an amino acid with a short side chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hirel et al., 1989</xref>). In the case of BacA, however, the bulky phenylalanine residue at position 2 presumably inhibits this process, so that residue M1 may be a genuine, conserved part of the MTS. Although M1 interacts most extensively with the lipid bilayer (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>), its absence has only a moderate effect on the mem-brane-binding activity of BacA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). This observation supports the idea that most of its interaction energy is contributed by the N-terminal NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> group, whereas the insertion of the M1 side chain into the hydrophobic core of the membrane only serves to tune the positioning of the N-terminus at the lipid-water interface. Consistent with the results of the MD simulations, the loss of either F2 or K4/K7 drastically impairs the membrane-binding activity of BacA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Moreover, it prevents the assembly of BacA into distinct higher-order complexes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting a link between BacA mem-brane association and polymerization. Indeed, a soluble BacA variant lacking the native MTS (Δ2-8) regains the ability to form polymeric complexes when fused to a heterologous MTS from <italic>E. coli</italic> MreB (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), indicating that membrane binding is a prerequisite for efficient BacA polymerization. Conversely, poly-merization appears to promote membrane binding, because the disruption of the BacA polymerization interface (F130R) strongly increases the fraction of soluble protein (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Comparable results were obtained when a suitable membrane anchor was provided <italic>in trans</italic> (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). Together, these findings point to a cooperative binding mechanism, whereby (i) membrane association leads to an increase in the local concentration of BacA that facilitates its self-assembly into polymers, and (ii) polymerization closely juxtaposes multiple MTS-containing N-terminal tails, thereby increasing the avidity of BacA for the mem-brane and shifting the equilibrium to the membrane-bound state. This process may be particularly relevant at the low bactofilin levels (∼200 BacA molecules per cell) found in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kühn et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, substitutions in the MTS that did not completely abolish BacA assembly often led to the formation of multiple and/or mislocalized complexes (<xref rid="fig1s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 1–figure supplement 4</xref>). The mechanism determining the polar localization of BacA is still unclear. However, it is conceivable that bactofilin polymers are intrinsically curved and thus preferentially associate with membrane regions of positive or negative Gaussian curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kühn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Pöhl et al., 2024</xref>). Alternatively, the MTS may preferentially bind certain lipid species that are enriched in the polar regions of the cell, with its modification leading to a change in the lipid specificity that interferes with this recruitment pathway. Exchanges at less critical positions of the MTS may affect these recruitment mechanisms by reducing the membrane-binding affinity and thus, indirectly, also the dimensions of BacA polymers or by altering their lipid specificity.</p>
<p>To assess the conservation of mode of membrane association established for BacA, we conducted a comprehensive comparison of the N-terminal regions of all bactofilin homologs known to date. This analysis revealed that amino acid sequences similar to the MTS of BacA are highly prevalent in a large number of bactofilins from the phyla Pseudomonadota, Bacteroidota and Bacillota, strongly suggesting that MTS-mediated membrane binding is a common theme among this group of proteins (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Notably, how-ever, most prevalent N-terminal motifs identified for the bactofilin homologs of Spirochaetota and Thermodesulfobacteriota are fundamentally different from those of the other phyla investigated (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> and <xref rid="fig7s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 7–figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that they exhibit in a different mode of membrane binding or interact with factors other than the cytoplasmic membrane.</p>
<p>Notably, a small subset of bacterial bactofilin homologs contain an N-terminal transmembrane domain, which mediates their stable insertion into the cytoplasmic membrane. While found in a diversity of bacterial phyla, these proteins are particularly abundant in the Pseudomonadota, especially in their gamma-proteobacterial and alphaproteobacterial lineages (<xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7–figure supplement 1</xref>). One of them, the bactofilin CcmA of <italic>P. mirabilis</italic>, has been previously investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hay et al., 1999</xref>). It was shown to undergo proteolytic processing and exist in two forms, a full-length form that is an integral membrane protein and a shorter form that lacks the N-terminal transmembrane segments. Intriguingly, the shorter form has an N-terminal sequence (MFSRKTE) that corresponds to the predicted consensus sequence of the MTS in Pseudomonadota and, indeed, behaves like a typical peripheral membrane protein. The specific functional properties conferred by these two distinct modes of membrane association are still unclear. However, it is tempting to speculate that the assembly of MTS-containing bactofilins may be dynamically regulated by cell cycle-dependent changes in membrane curvature or composition, whereas homologs with transmembrane domains may form more static polymeric assemblies. Consistent with this idea, <italic>C. crescentus</italic> BacA only assembles at the old cell pole once its cell envelope bulges outward to initiate stalk formation, thereby establishing a region of positive Gaussian curvature, although its cytoplasmic levels remain constant throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kühn et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, the BacA homolog of the stalked budding bacterium <italic>H. neptunium</italic> consistently assembles in regions of positive Gaussian curvature, first localizing to the stalked pole and then, once the terminal segment of the stalk starts to expand into a bud, to the bud neck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Pöhl et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>Instead of using an MTS or a transmembrane domain, some bactofilins may also interact with the membrane indirectly by binding to other membrane-associated proteins, as recently suggested for the bactofilin homolog CcmA from <italic>H. pylori</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Sichel et al., 2022</xref>). Our results suggest that the interaction with PbpC contributes, at least to some extent, to the membrane association of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> BacA. We did not observe any obvious localization defects in a Δ<italic>pbpC</italic> mutant (<xref rid="fig8s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 8–figure supplement 1A</xref>), indicating that PbpC binding is not critical for its proper assembly and positioning at native accumulation levels. However, when produced in excess, the PbpC membrane anchor was able to fully compensate for the absence of the N-terminal MTS, providing sufficient links with the cytoplasmic membrane to enable the assembly of polar BacA clusters. Thus, client protein binding is an important factor to consider when analyzing the assembly and localization dynamics of bactofilins <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>The determinants mediating the interaction of membrane-associated bactofilin scaffolds with their client proteins are still poorly understood. For <italic>M. xanthus</italic> BacP, the binding site for its soluble interactor PadC was shown to be located in the exceptionally long unstructured C-terminal tail, which contains a conserved KKKVVVKK motif potentially involved in the interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anand et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lin et al., 2017</xref>). However, most bactofilin homologs have much shorter C-terminal tails, which are typically poorly conserved in sequence and, at least in certain cases, dispensable for function <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Sichel et al., 2022</xref>), suggesting a direct interaction of client proteins with the bactofilin core domain. Our results indeed suggest that the cytoplasmic tail of PbpC associates with the C-terminal region of the bactofilin domain, close to the polymerization interface. Importantly, BacA assembly appears to be critical for efficient PbpC binding <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>), suggesting that inter-subunit contacts could potentially change the conformation of BacA such as to increase its affinity for its client protein. In addition, polymers may have a higher avidity for PbpC than BacA monomers. Polymerization thus acts as a trigger for both membrane association and the recruitment of client proteins, ensuring the tight regulation of bactofilin function.</p>
<p>Collectively, our findings provide important new insights into the function of bactofilins and the nucleotide-independent dynamics of their assembly. It will be interesting to analyze how cell cycle-or stress-induced changes in membrane composition affect the membrane-binding and polymerization behavior of MTS-containing bactofilin homologs. Moreover, it will be informative to shed light on the mode of mem-brane binding for bactofilins with conserved N-terminal sequences that are clearly distinct from the global consensus motif.</p>

All coverslips were cleaned before use by sonication in 2% (v/v) Hellmanex II solution (Hellma, Germany) for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by rinsing in distilled water and a second round of soni-cation in double-distilled water. Images were taken at 20-ms intervals by slimfield microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Plank et al., 2009</xref>), using an Olympus IX-71 microscope equipped with a UAPON 100x/ NA 1.49 TIRF objective, a back-illuminated electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) iXon Ultra camera (Andor Solis, USA) in stream acquisition mode, and a LuxX 457-100 (457 nm, 100 mW) light-emitting diode laser (Omicron-Laserage Laserprodukte GmbH, Germany) as an excitation light source. The laser beam was focused onto the back focal plane and operated during image acquisition with up to 2 mW (60 W cm<sup>-2</sup> at the image plane). Andor Solis 4.21 software was used for camera control and stream acquisition. Each single-particle tracking analysis was preceded by the acquisition of a phase contrast image. Subsequently, ∼500 frames were acquired to bleach most fluorescent proteins in the cell and thus reach the single-mole-cule level. Subsequently, remaining and newly synthesized molecules were tracked over ∼2,500 frames. Prior to analysis, the frames recorded before reaching the single-molecule level were removed from the streams using photobleaching curves as a reference, and the proper pixel size (100 nm) and time incre-ment were adjusted in the imaging metadata using Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Subsequently, cell meshes were determined using Oufti (Paintdakhi et al., 2016) and single particles were tracked with u-track 2.2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jaqaman et al., 2008</xref>).

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study advances our understanding of how bactofilin cytoskeletal proteins associate with cell membranes by identifying and characterizing a conserved membrane-targeting sequence. The evidence is <bold>solid</bold>, with a well-integrated combination of mutagenesis, biophysical analysis, molecular simulations, and bioinformatics supporting the mechanistic model. The work will be of particular interest to microbiologists and structural biologists studying bacterial cytoskeletons and membrane-protein interactions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors of this study investigated the membrane-binding properties of bactofilin A from Caulobacter crescentus, a classic model organism for bacterial cell biology. BacA was the progenitor of a family of cytoskeletal proteins that have been identified as ubiquitous structural components in bacteria, performing a range of cell biological functions. Association with the cell membrane is a frequent property of the bactofilins studied and is thought to be important for functionality. However, almost all bactofilins lack a transmembrane domain. While membrane association has been attributed to the unstructured N-terminus, experimental evidence had yet to be provided. As a result, the mode of membrane association and the underlying molecular mechanics remained elusive.</p>
<p>Liu at al. analyze the membrane binding properties of BacA in detail and scrutinize molecular interactions using in-vivo, in-vitro and in-silico techniques. They show that few N-terminal amino acids are important for membrane association or proper localization and suggest that membrane association promotes polymerization. Bioinformatic analyses revealed conserved lineage-specific N-terminal motifs indicating a conserved role in protein localization. Using HDX analysis they also identify a potential interaction site with PbpC, a morphogenic cell wall synthase implicated in Caulobacter stalk synthesis. Complementary, they pinpoint the bactofilin-interacting region within the PbpC C-terminus, known to interact with bactofilin. They further show that BacA localization is independent of PbpC.</p>
<p>Although the phenotypic effects of an abolished BacA-PbpC interaction are mild, these data significantly advance our understanding of bactofilin membrane binding, polymerization, and function at the molecular level. The major strength of the comprehensive study is the combination of complementary in vivo, in vitro and bioinformatic/simulation approaches, the results of which are consistent.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The investigators undertook detailed characterization of a previously proposed membrane targeting sequence (MTS), a short N-terminal peptide, of the bactofilin BacA in Caulobacter crescentus. Using light microscopy, single molecule tracking, liposome binding assays, and molecular dynamics simulations, they provide data to suggest that this sequence indeed does function in membrane targeting and further conclude that membrane targeting is required for polymerization. While the membrane association data are reasonably convincing, there are no direct assays to assess polymerization and some assays used lack proper controls as detailed below. Since the MTS isn't required for bactofilin polymerization in other bacterial homologues, showing that membrane binding facilitates polymerization would be a significant advance for the field.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that additional experiments were required to consolidate our results and conclusions. Please see below for a description of the new data included in the revised version of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Major concerns</p>
<p>(1) This work claims that the N-termina MTS domain of BacA is required for polymerization, but they do not provide sufficient evidence that the ∆2-8 mutant or any of the other MTS variants actually do not polymerize (or form higher order structures). Bactofilins are known to form filaments, bundles of filaments, and lattice sheets in vitro and bundles of filaments have been observed in cells. Whether puncta or diffuse labeling represents different polymerized states or filaments vs. monomers has not been established. Microscopy shows mis-localization away from the stalk, but resolution is limited. Further experiments using higher resolution microscopy and TEM of purified protein would prove that the MTS is required for polymerization.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We do not propose that the MTS is directly involved in the polymerization process and state this more clearly now in the Results and Discussion sections of the revised manuscript. To address this point, we performed transmission electron microscopy studies comparing the polymerization behavior of wild-type and mutant BacA variants. The results clearly show that the MTS-free BacA variant (∆2-8) forms polymers that are indistinguishable from those formed by the wild-type protein, when purified from an <italic>E. coli</italic> overproduction strain (new Figure 1–figure supplement 1). This finding is consistent with structural work showing that bactofilin polymerization is exclusively mediated by the conserved bactofilin domain (Deng et al, Nat Microbiol, 2019). However, at native expression levels, BacA only accumulates to ~200 molecules per cell (Kühn et al, EMBO J, 2006). Under these conditions, the MTS-mediated increase in the local concentration of BacA at the membrane surface and, potentially, steric constraints imposed by membrane curvature, may facilitate the polymerization process. This hypothesis has now been stated more clearly in the Results and Discussion sections.</p>
<p>For polymer-forming proteins, defined localized signals are typically interpreted as slow-moving or stationary polymeric complexes. A diffuse localization, by contrast, suggests that a protein exists in a monomeric or, at most, (small) oligomeric state in which it diffuses rapidly within the cell and is thus no longer detected as distinct foci by widefield microscopy. Our single-molecule data show that BacA variants that are no longer able to interact with the membrane (as verified by cell fractionation studies and <italic>in vitro</italic> liposome binding assays) have a high diffusion rate, similar to that measured for the non-polymerizing and non-membrane-bound F130R variant. These results demonstrate that a defect in membrane binding strongly reduces the ability of BacA to form polymeric assemblies. To support this hypothesis, we have now repeated all single-particle tracking experiments and included mVenus as a freely diffusible reference protein. Our data confirm that the mobilities of the ∆2-8 and F130R variants are similar and approach those of free mVenus, supporting the idea that the deficiency to interact with the membrane prevents the formation of extended polymeric structures (which should show much lower mobilities). To underscore the relevance of membrane binding for BacA assembly, we have now included a new experiment, in which we used the PbpC membrane anchor (PbpC<sub>1-132</sub>-mcherry) to restore the recruitment of the ∆2-8 variant to the membrane (Figure 9 and Figure 9–figure supplement 1). The results obtained show that the ∆2-8 variant transitions from a diffuse localization to polar foci upon overproduction of PbpC<sub>1-132</sub>-mcherry. The polymerization-impaired F130R variant, by contrast, remains evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm under all conditions. These findings further support the idea that polymerization and membrane-association are mutually interdependent processes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Liposome binding data would be strengthened with TEM images to show BacA binding to liposomes. From this experiment, gross polymerization structures of MTS variants could also be characterized.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We do not have the possibility to perform cryo-electron microscopy studies of liposomes bound to BacA. However, the results of the cell fractionation and liposome sedimentation assays clearly support a critical role of the MTS in membrane binding.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The use of the BacA F130R mutant throughout the study to probe the effect of polymerization on membrane binding is concerning as there is no evidence showing that this variant cannot polymerize. Looking through the papers the authors referenced, there was no evidence of an identical mutation in BacA that was shown to be depolymerized or any discussion in this study of how the F130R mutation might to analogous to polymerization-deficient variants in other bactofilins mentioned in these references.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Residue F130 in the C-terminal polymerization interface of BacA is conserved among bactofilin homologs, although its absolute position in the protein sequence may vary, depending on the length of the N-terminal unstructured tail. The papers cited in our manuscript show that an exchange of this conserved phenylalanine residue abolishes polymer formation. Nevertheless, we agree that it is important to verify the polymerization defect of the F130R variant in the system under study. We have now included size-exclusion chromatography data showing that BacA-F130R forms a low-molecular-weight complex, whereas the wild-type protein largely elutes in the exclusion volume, indicating the formation of large, polymeric species (new Figure 1–figure supplement 1). In addition, we performed transmission electron microscopy analyses of BacA-F130R, which verified the absence of larger oligomers (new Figure 1–figure supplement 2).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Microscopy shows that a BacA variant lacking the native MTS regains the ability to form puncta, albeit mis-localized, in the cell when fused to a heterologous MTS from MreB. While this swap suggests a link between puncta formation and membrane binding the relationship between puncta and polymerization has not been established (see comment 1).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We show that a BacA variant lacking the MTS (∆2-8) regains the ability to form membrane-associated foci when fused to the MTS of MreB. By contrast, a similar variant that additionally carries the F130R exchange (preventing its polymerization) shows a diffuse cytoplasmic localization. In addition, we show that the F130R exchange leads to a loss of membrane binding and to a considerable increase in the mobility of the variants carrying the MTS of <italic>E. coli</italic> MreB. As described above, we now provide additional data demonstrating that elevated levels of the PbpC membrane anchor can reinstate polar localization for the ∆2-8 variant, whereas it fails to do so for the polymerization-deficient F130R variant (Figure 9 and Figure 9–figure supplement 1). Together, these results support the hypothesis that membrane association and polymerization act synergistically to establish localized bactofilin assemblies at the stalked cell pole.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The authors provide no primary data for single molecule tracking. There is no tracking mapped onto microscopy images to show membrane localization or lack of localization in MTS deletion/ variants. A known soluble protein (e.g. unfused mVenus) and a known membrane bound protein would serve as valuable controls to interpret the data presented. It also is unclear why the authors chose to report molecular dynamics as mean squared displacement rather than mean squared displacement per unit time, and the number of localizations is not indicated. Extrapolating from the graph in figure 4 D for example, it looks like WT BacA-mVenus would have a mobility of 0.5 (0.02/0.04) micrometers squared per second which is approaching diffusive behavior. Further justification/details of their analysis method is needed. It's also not clear how one should interpret the finding that several of the double point mutants show higher displacement than deleting the entire MTS. These experiments as they stand don't account for any other cause of molecular behavior change and assume that a decrease in movement is synonymous with membrane binding.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now provide additional information on the single-particle analysis. A new supplemental figure now shows a mapping of single-particle tracks onto the cells in which they were recorded for all proteins analyzed (Figure 2–figure supplement 1). Due to the small size of <italic>C. crescentus</italic>, it is difficult to clearly differentiate between membrane-associated and cytoplasmic protein species. However, overall, slow-diffusing particles tend to be localized to the cell periphery, supporting the idea that membrane-associated particles form larger assemblies (apart from diffusing more slowly due to their membrane association). In addition, we have included a movie that shows the single-particle diffusion dynamics of all proteins in representative cells (Figure 2-video 1). Finally, we have included a table that gives an overview of the number of cells and tracks analyzed for all proteins investigated (Supplementary file 1). Figure 2A and 4D show the mean squared displacement as a function of time, which makes it possible to assess whether the particles observed move by normal, Brownian diffusion (which is the case here). We repeated the entire single-particle tracking analysis to verify the data obtained previously and obtained very similar results. Among the different mutant proteins, only the K4E-K7E variant consistently shows a higher mobility than the MTS-free ∆2-8 variant, with MSD values similar to that of free mVenus. The underlying reason remains unclear. However, we believe that an in-depth analysis of this phenomenon is beyond the scope of this paper. We re-confirmed the integrity of the construct encoding the K4E/K7E variant by DNA sequencing and once again verified the size and stability of the fusion protein by Western blot analysis, excluding artifacts due to errors during cloning and strain construction.</p>
<p>We agree that the single-molecule tracking data alone are certainly not sufficient to draw firm conclusions on the relationship between membrane binding and protein mobility. However, they are consistent with the results of our other <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> analyses, which together indicate a clear correlation between the mobility of BacA and its ability to interact with the membrane and polymerize (processes that promote each other synergistically).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The experiments that map the interaction surface between the N-terminal unstructured region of PbpC and a specific part of the BacA bactofilin domain seem distinct from the main focus of the paper and the data somewhat preliminary. While the PbpC side has been probed by orthogonal approaches (mutation with localization in cells and affinity in vitro), the BacA region side has only been suggested by the deuterium exchange experiment and needs some kind of validation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The results of the HDX analysis <italic>per se</italic> are not preliminary and clearly show a change in the solvent accessibility of backbone amides in the C-terminal region in the bactofilin domain in the presence of the PbpC<sub>1-13</sub> peptide. However, we agree that additional experiments would be required to verify the binding site suggested by these data. We agree that further research is required to precisely map and verify the PbpC binding site. However, as this is not the main focus of the paper, we would like to proceed without conducting further experiments in this area.</p>
<p>We now provide additional data showing that elevated levels of the PbpC membrane anchor are able to recruit the MTS-free BacA variant (∆2-8) to the cytoplasmic membrane and stimulate its assembly at the stalked pole (Figure 9). These results now integrate Figure 8 more effectively into the overall theme of the paper.</p>

<p>Thank you for this positive feedback.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The results are limited to protein localization and interaction, as there is no data on phenotypic effects. Therefore, the cell biological significance remains somewhat underrepresented.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that it is interesting to investigate the phenotypic effects caused by the reduced membrane binding activity of BacA variants with defects in the MTS. We have now included phenotypic analyses that shed light on the role of region C1 in the localization of PbpC and its function in stalk elongation under phosphate-limiting conditions (see below).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>To address the missing estimation of biological relevance, some additional experiments may be carried out.</p>
<p>For example, given that BacA localizes PbpC by direct interaction, one might expect an effect on stalk formation if BacA is unable to bind the membrane or to polymerize. The same applies to PbpC variants lacking the C1 region. As the mutant strains are available, these data are not difficult to obtain but would help to compare the effect of the deletions with previous data (e.g. Kühn et al.) even if the differences are small.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now analyzed the effect of the removal of region C1 on the ability of mVenus-PbpC to promote stalk elongation in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> under phosphate starvation. Interestingly, our results show that the lack of the BacA-interaction motif impairs the recruitment of the fusion protein to the stalked pole, but it does not interfere with its stimulatory effect on stalk biogenesis. Thus, the polar localization of PbpC does not appear to be critical for its function in localized peptidoglycan synthesis at the stalk base. These results are now shown in Figure 8–Figure supplement 4. The results obtained may be explained by residual transient interactions of mVenus-PbpC with proteins other than BacA at the stalked pole. Notably, PbpC has also been implicated in the attachment of the stalk-specific protein StpX to components of the outer membrane at the stalk base. The polar localization of PbpC may therefore be primarily required to ensure proper StpX localization, consistent with previous work by Hughes et al. (Mol Microbiol, 2013) showing that StpX is partially mislocalized in a strain producing an N-terminally truncated PbpC variant that no longer localizes to the stalk base.</p>
<p>We have also attempted to investigate the ability of the Δ2-8 and F130R variants of BacA-mVenus to promote stalk elongation under phosphate starvation. However, the levels of the WT, Δ2-8 and F130R proteins and their stabilities were dramatically different after prolonged incubation of the cells in phosphate-limited medium, so that it was not possible to draw any firm conclusions from the results obtained (not shown).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In addition, the M23-like endopeptidase LdpA is proposed to be a client protein of BacA (in C. crescentus, Billini et al. 2018, and H. neptunium or R. rubrum, Pöhl et al. 2024). In H. neptunium, it is suggested that the interaction is mediated by a cytoplasmic peptide of LmdC reminiscent of PbpC. This should at least be commented on. It would be interesting to see, if LpdA in C. crescentus is also delocalized and if so, this could identify another client protein of BacA.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that it would be interesting to study the role of BacA in LdpA function. However, we have not yet succeeded in generating a stable fluorescent protein fusion to LdpA, which currently makes it impossible to study the interplay between these two proteins <italic>in vivo</italic>. The focus of the present paper is on the mode of interaction between bactofilins and the cytoplasmic membrane and on the mutual interdependence of membrane binding and bactofilin polymerization. Given that PbpC is so far the only verified interaction partner of BacA in <italic>C. crescentus</italic>, we would like to limit our analysis to this client protein.</p>

<p>L258 and Fig. S5: The expression &quot;To account for biases in the coverage of bacterial species&quot; seems somewhat unclear. I suggest rephrasing and adding information from the M+M section here (e.g. from L593, if this is meant).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now state that this step in the analysis pipeline was performed “To avoid biases arising from the over-representation of certain bacterial species in UniProt”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I appreciate the outline of the workflow in panel (a) of Fig. S5. It would be even more useful when some more details about the applied criteria for filtering would be provided (e.g. concerning what is meant with &quot;detailed taxonomic information&quot; or &quot;filter out closely related sequences&quot;. Does the latter mean that only one bactofilin sequence per species was used? (As quite many bacteria have more than one but similar bactofilins.)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We removed sequences from species with unclear phylogeny (e.g. candidate species whose precise taxonomic position has not yet been determined). For many pathogenic species, numerous strains have been sequenced. To account for this bias, only one sequence from clusters of highly similar bactofilin sequences (&gt;90% identity) was retained per species. This information has now been included in the diagram. It is true that many bacteria have more than one bactofilin homolog. However, the sequences of these proteins are typically quite different. For instance, the BacA and BacB from <italic>C. crescentus</italic> only share 52% identity. Therefore, our analysis does not systematically eliminate bactofilin paralogs that coexist in the same species.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>L281: Although likely, I am not sure if membrane binding has ever been shown for a bactofilin from these phyla. (See also L 380.) Is there an example? Otherwise, membrane binding may not be a property of these bactofilins.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To our knowledge, the ability of bactofilins from these clades to interact with membranes has not been investigated to date. We agree that the absence of an MTS-like motif may indicate that they lack membrane binding activity, and we have now stated this possibility in the Results and Discussion.</p>

<p>L285: See comment above concerning the M23-like peptidase LpdA. Although not yet directly shown for C. crescentus, it seems likely that BacACc does also localize this peptidase in addition to PbpC. I suggest rephrasing, e.g. &quot;known&quot; --&gt; &quot;shown&quot;</p>

PbpC), this experiment should be carried out with the polymerization defective BacA version F130R.</p>

<p>L391-400: This idea is tempting but the suggested mechanism then would be restricted to bactofilins of C. crescentus and close relatives. The bactofilin of Rhodomicrobium, for example, was shown to localize dynamically and not to stick to a positively curved membrane.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the vast majority of species investigated so far, bactofilins were found to associate with specifically curved membrane regions and to contribute to the establishment of membrane curvature. Unfortu­nately, the sequences of the three co-polymerizing bactofilin paralogs of <italic>R. vannielii</italic> DSM 166 studied by Richter et al (2023) have not been reported and the genome sequence of this strain is not publicly available. However, in related species with three bactofilin paralogs, only one paralog shows an MTS-like N-terminal peptide and another paralog typically contains an unusual cadherin-like domain of unknown function, as also reported for <italic>R. vannielii</italic> DSM 166. Therefore, the mechanism controlling the localization dynamics of bactofilins may be complex in the <italic>Rhodomicrobium</italic> lineage. Nevertheless, at native expression levels, the major bactofilin (BacA) of <italic>R. vannielii</italic> DSM 166 was shown to localize predominantly to the hyphal tips and the (incipient) bud necks, suggesting that regions of distinct membrane curvature could also play a role in its recruitment. We do not claim that all bactofilins recognize positive membrane curvature, which is clearly not the case. It rather appears as though the curvature preference of bactofilins varies depending on their specific function.</p>

<p>L405-406: I agree that localization of BacA has been shown to be independent of PbpC. However, this does not generally preclude an effect on BacA localization by other &quot;client&quot; or interacting proteins. (See also comment above about the putative BacA interactor LpdA). I suggest either to corroborate or to change this statement from &quot;client binding&quot; to &quot;PbpC binding&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing out the imprecision of this statement. We now conclude that “PbpC binding” is not critical for BacA assembly and positioning.</p>
