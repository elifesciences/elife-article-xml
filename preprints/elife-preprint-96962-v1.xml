<title>Abstract</title><p>Excessive elevation or reduction of soluble uric acid (sUA) levels has been linked to some of pathological states, raising another subject that sUA at physiological levels may be essential for the maintenance of health. Yet, the fundamental physiological functions and molecular targets of sUA remain largely unknown. Using enzyme assays and <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> metabolic assays, we demonstrate that sUA directly inhibits the hydrolase and cyclase activities of CD38 via a reversible non-competitive mechanism, thereby limiting nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) degradation. CD38 inhibition is restricted to sUA in purine metabolism, and a structural comparison using methyl analogs of sUA such as caffeine metabolites shows that 1,3-dihydroimidazol-2-one is the main functional group. Moreover, sUA at physiological levels prevents crude lipopolysaccharide (cLPS)-induced systemic inflammation and monosodium urate (MSU) crystal-induced peritonitis in mice by interacting with CD38. Together, this study unveils an unexpected physiological role for sUA in controlling NAD<sup>+</sup> availability and innate immunity through CD38 inhibition, providing a new perspective on sUA homeostasis and purine metabolism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The evolutionary loss of uricase activity in humans and certain primates completely blocks the degradation of soluble uric acid (sUA), leading to higher physiological levels of sUA than in other mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Owing to renal reabsorption, sUA is strictly maintained in humans rather than being eliminated as a waste. It has been suggested that sUA functions as an abundant antioxidant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) and is crucial to maintain blood pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Although hyperuricemia may promote the precipitation of monosodium urate (MSU) crystal, an activator of the NLRP3 inflammasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>), resulting in diseases such as gout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>) and kidney stone disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>), numerous studies have indicated the protective potential of sUA in neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). In addition, abnormal reduction of sUA levels is clinically associated with the risk of various diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>), including cardiovascular diseases and kidney diseases. Intriguingly, rapid urate reduction in the initiation of therapy even increases gout flares in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Depletion of sUA in uricase-transgenic mice shortens lifespan and promotes sterile inflammation induced by microbial molecules or pro-inflammatory particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Thus, data support that sUA provides physiological defense against excessive inflammation, aging, and certain diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). However, the underlying molecular basis of sUA physiology remains poorly understood.</p>
<p>To gain insight into target-based physiological functions of sUA, our laboratory utilized magnetic bead-conjugated 8-oxoguanine (8-OG, an sUA analog; technically, sUA cannot be directly conjugated to the beads) and proteomic analysis to screen the potential candidates of sUA-binding proteins. We discovered several binding proteins of 8-OG (unpublished data), including CD38 that was verified by enzyme inhibition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), which raised our interest in exploring the role of CD38 in sUA physiology. CD38 is mainly expressed in immune cells and functions as a hydrolase to degrade nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>), an essential cofactor for various metabolic reactions that sustain life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>), thus regulating inflammation, aging, and various diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Its cyclase catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) from NAD<sup>+</sup> to drive calcium mobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>), which is crucial for social behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>) and neutrophil recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>).</p>

<p>Here, we demonstrate that sUA at physiological levels directly inhibits CD38 and consequently limits NAD<sup>+</sup> degradation and excessive inflammation, which defines, for the first time, the physiological functions of sUA via CD38. In addition, we confirm the unique effect of sUA on CD38 in purine metabolism and identify a structural feature for pharmacological inhibition of CD38.</p>

<title>sUA is an endogenous, reversible, and non-competitive inhibitor of CD38</title>
<p>To clarify whether CD38 is a direct target for sUA, we investigated the effect of sUA on CD38 activity. We found that sUA directly inhibited the hydrolase and cyclase activities of human (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1B</xref>) and murine (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>) CD38 as a non-competitive inhibitor (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C, 1D</xref>, and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1A</xref>) with a K<sub>i</sub> in the micromolar range (57.1-93.3 μM), demonstrating its binding to the allosteric sites of CD38. sUA showed comparable inhibitory effects on hydrolase and cyclase, as indicated by similar K<sub>i</sub>. The physiological levels of sUA in humans (about 120-420 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>)) and in several mouse tissues (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1K</xref>) were higher than its K<sub>i</sub>, indicating that human CD38 and murine type III/intracellular CD38 are physiologically inhibited by sUA. The inhibitory effects were reversible (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1F, 1G</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1C</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1D</xref>), suggesting that sUA dynamically modulates CD38 activity. Interference from endogenous sUA was negligible when using tissues as an enzyme source, because the concentrations in the final reaction buffer were below 1 μM (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1J</xref>).</p>

<title>CD38 inhibition is restricted to sUA in purine metabolism</title>
<p>Although the structure of sUA is similar to that of other purines, we confirmed its unique effect on CD38 in the major metabolic pathways of purines (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). sUA precursors (adenosine, guanosine, inosine, hypoxanthine and xanthine) and the uricase-catalyzed metabolite (allantoin) hardly inhibited the hydrolase and cyclase activities of human (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A, 2B</xref>, and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1E</xref>) and murine (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figures S1F</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1G</xref>) CD38. The tested purine concentrations were higher than their physiological levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Thus, CD38 inhibition is restricted to sUA, suggesting a specific functional group in sUA.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="543541v2_fig2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>To identify the functional group for CD38 inhibition, we tested additional xanthine analogs (oxypurinol and caffeine) and the methyl analogs (caffeine metabolites) of sUA including 1-methyluric acid (1-MU), 1,3-dimethyluric acid (1,3-DMU), 1,7-dimethyluric acid (1,7-DMU), and 1,3,7-trimethyluric acid (1,3,7-TMU). The results showed that only sUA analogs inhibited CD38 activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). A structural comparison (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>) indicated that 1,3-dihydroimidazol-2-one (1,3-DHI-2-one) is the main functional group, as all other purines lacking this group failed to inhibit CD38 activity. In addition, the ring-opening of the uracil group after sUA conversion to allantoin abrogated this inhibitory potential. Uracil or 1,3-dihydroimidazol-2-one (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2E</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1H</xref>, and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1I</xref>) alone did not affect CD38 activity. Therefore, the adjacent uracil-like heterocycles are also essential for CD38 inhibition.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>sUA at physiological levels limits NAD<sup>+</sup> degradation by directly inhibiting CD38</title>
<p>Next, we explored the effect of sUA on NAD<sup>+</sup> availability, as CD38 is a key enzyme in degrading NAD<sup>+</sup> and its precursor, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). sUA boosted intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> in A549 and THP-1 cells (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figures S3A</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3B</xref>), then we investigated whether CD38 mediates the effect of sUA on NAD<sup>+</sup> degradation. Short-term and moderate “sUA-supplementation” model was constructed by gavage of inosine and oxonic acid (OA, an uricase inhibitor with a K<sub>i</sub> in the nanomolar range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>)) in mice with “natural hypouricemia” (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3D</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2C</xref>). The plasma sUA levels (around 120 μM) in our models were close to the minimum physiological concentrations in humans but were markedly lower than that in other long-term and hyperuricemia-associated disease models in rodents, which enabled us to evaluate the physiologically inhibitory effect of sUA on CD38 activity. Although OA was a weak inhibitor of CD38 with a IC<sub>50</sub> in the millimolar range (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figures S1L</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1M</xref>), it seemed unlikely to affect CD38 activity in our models because of the incomplete inhibition of uricase, as evidenced by plasma sUA (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1N</xref>). Although short-term administration of OA alone failed to increase plasma sUA levels, we used it as the background for metabolic studies in mice to exclude potential interference.</p>

</fig>
<p>One-day or 3-day moderate sUA supplementation slightly but significantly increased whole blood NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in wild-type (WT) mice but not in CD38 knockout (KO) mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A, 3D</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2C</xref>, and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2D</xref>). Similar results were also observed under inflammatory conditions (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figures S3C, S3D</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5D</xref>, and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5E</xref>). This indicates that CD38 mediates, at least in part, the suppressive effect of sUA on NAD<sup>+</sup> degradation. The suppression of NAD<sup>+</sup> degradation by the sUA-CD38 interaction was validated by a decrease in cADPR production under inflammatory conditions (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3F</xref>) but not under non-inflammatory conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2F</xref>), possibly because of physiological compensation via other cADPR synthases. However, sUA had a minor effect on NMN levels <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3B</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2E</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3E</xref>, and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5F</xref>), likely due to the rapid conversion of NMN to NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Notably, WT and CD38 KO mice showed similar NAD<sup>+</sup> baselines in whole blood, suggesting that the metabolic background has been reprogrammed in CD38 KO mice; for instance, sirtuins with higher activity in CD38 KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>) may consume more NAD<sup>+</sup>. Moreover, sUA release <italic>in vivo</italic> showed that both plasma sUA and whole blood NAD<sup>+</sup> gradually returned to their initial levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), which confirmed the reversible regulation of NAD<sup>+</sup> availability by sUA and excluded potential interference from epigenetic regulation of other bioconversion pathways of NAD<sup>+</sup>. Metabolic assays using recombinant hCD38 further verified that increased NAD<sup>+</sup> availability is mediated by direct CD38-sUA interaction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, the tissue levels of NAD<sup>+</sup> and NMN were not increased in 1-day and 3-day sUA-supplementation models, probably because the tissue uptake of sUA was physiologically saturated before treatment (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figures S2A</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2B</xref>). The NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in the brain and heart appeared to be elevated in 7-day model (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figures S2G-S2I</xref>). Thus, the sUA-CD38 interaction in the circulation may indirectly increase tissue NAD<sup>+</sup> availability. Our models within 7 days did not show pro-inflammatory potential (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7A</xref>), but we did not prolong the treatment time because long-term administration of OA might induce renal damage with concomitant inflammation related to cell death.</p>
<p>Considering the rapid conversion of NMN to NAD<sup>+</sup> <italic>in vivo</italic>, we assessed the effect of sUA on extracellular NMN degradation <italic>in vitro</italic>. sUA directly inhibited NMN degradation by recombinant hCD38 (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A</xref>). Whereas sUA or other CD38 inhibitors failed to boost intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> in primed WT bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) treated with NMN (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4B</xref>). This is likely because another NAD<sup>+</sup>-consuming enzyme, PARP1, is activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>) and the NMN transporter expression is very low in BMDMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Importantly, sUA increased extracellular NMN availability in WT BMDMs but not in CD38 KO BMDMs (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figures S4C</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4D</xref>). The addition of recombinant hCD38 restored the suppressive effect of sUA on extracellular NMN degradation in CD38 KO BMDMs (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4E</xref>). Accordingly, sUA may also increase NAD<sup>+</sup> availability by inhibiting CD38-medaited NMN degradation.</p>

<title>sUA physiologically prevents excessive inflammation by interacting with CD38</title>
<p>NAD<sup>+</sup> is crucial for the activity of sirtuins that limit the NLRP3 inflammasome activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>), and cADPR may regulate calcium signaling to promote cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). Therefore, CD38 plays a key role in inflammation via NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). We confirmed the role of CD38 in the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. CD38 KO reduced IL-1β release driven by several inflammasome activators and the fungal component zymosan in primed BMDMs (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6B</xref>). Pre-incubation with sUA at physiological or higher levels moderately suppressed inflammasome activation in primed THP-1 cells but not in primed WT BMDMs (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figures S6A</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6C</xref>). sUA uptake was very low in primed WT BMDMs (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6E</xref>), suggesting a crucial role of intracellular sUA in regulating inflammasome activation <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, extracellular sUA may inhibit CD38-mediated NMN degradation to increase NAD<sup>+</sup> levels <italic>in vivo</italic>, thus limiting excessive inflammation via sirtuins signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). Additionally, sUA did not induce IL-1β release in primed WT BMDMs and THP-1 cells (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figures S6A</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6D</xref>). These results argue against the pro-inflammatory potential of sUA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>) that has been challenged by the improper preparation of aqueous solution (MSU crystal precipitation) in basic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). In fact, we confirmed that long-term storage at 4 ℃ also promoted crystal precipitation in the stock solutions of sUA (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figure S8</xref>).</p>
<p>To reveal the role of sUA-CD38 interaction in regulating inflammation and innate immunity, at first, we stimulated WT and CD38 KO mice with crude lipopolysaccharide (cLPS) after 1-day sUA supplementation. OA was used as the background in mice to exclude its interference. Plasma sUA at the minimum physiological levels of humans (OA plus inosine groups) suppressed cLPS-induced production of serum IL-1β and IL-18 in WT mice without affecting inflammasome-independent TNF-α levels, and the suppressive effects were abrogated in CD38 KO mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A-4C</xref>), demonstrating that sUA physiologically limits cLPS-induced systemic inflammation via CD38. sUA immunosuppression may be partially mediated by increased NAD<sup>+</sup> levels and decreased cADPR production in whole blood after sUA-CD38 interaction (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figures S3D</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3F</xref>). sUA hardly limited high-dose cLPS-induced systemic inflammation (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figures S5A-S5C</xref>), although plasma sUA and whole blood NAD<sup>+</sup> levels were increased (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figures S5D</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5E</xref>). In addition, high-dose cLPS, with or without sUA supplementation, did not affect cADPR levels (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5G</xref>), suggesting some CD38-independent inflammatory mechanisms.</p>

<p>Recently, crystal-free hyperuricemia has been shown to rapidly inhibit neutrophil migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>), suggesting that some biological targets directly mediate sUA immunosuppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). CD38 is crucial for neutrophil recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), we therefore investigated the effect of sUA on MSU crystal-induced peritonitis via CD38. After 1-day sUA supplementation, plasma sUA at the minimum physiological levels of humans (OA plus inosine groups) inhibited the recruitment of viable cells and neutrophils and reduced the production of IL-1β and IL-6 in WT mice but not in CD38 KO mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4D, 4E, 4G</xref>, and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4H</xref>), which verified the involvement of CD38 in the suppressive effect of sUA on inflammation and innate immunity. CXCL1 production (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>) was not affected by sUA, indicating that the sUA-CD38 interaction may inhibit circulating immune cells in response to chemokines. Moreover, sUA may interfere with the interaction between CD38 and adhesion molecules such as CD31(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>) to suppress immune cell migration. Intriguingly, intact IL-8 signaling has been reported in CD38 KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), and sUA at a high concentration (595 μM) inhibits neutrophils in response to IL-8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). Whereas we did not observe decreased neutrophil recruitment by sUA in CD38 KO mice, likely because plasma sUA levels (around 120 μM) in our models are insufficient to affect IL-8 signaling. In addition, we cannot exclude the possibility that CD38 is essential for the inhibitory effects of sUA on IL-8 signaling and β2-integrin, which requires further investigation in the future.</p>
<p>Inosine, an sUA precursor, may also exhibit anti-inflammatory effect by interacting with adenosine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Scott, et al. reported that after oral administration, serum inosine concentrations slightly increased and then rapidly returned to the initial levels in mice within 2 h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). We stimulated the mice with cLPS or MSU crystals 2 h after the second treatment, suggesting the negligible contribution of inosine. To verify this and exclude the potential contribution of OA, we evaluated the effects of 1-day treatment of inosine or OA on inflammation <italic>in vivo</italic>. The results showed that OA or inosine alone hardly affected cLPS-induced systemic inflammation (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figures S7B-S7D</xref>) and MSU crystal-induced peritonitis (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figures S7E-S7I</xref>), as well as plasma sUA levels and whole blood NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism under inflammatory conditions (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figures S3G-S3J</xref>). Thus, these results suggested that sUA at physiological levels limits innate immunity to avoid excessive inflammation by interacting with CD38.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we unveiled CD38 as a direct physiological target for sUA and thus defined its fundamental physiological functions in the regulation of NAD<sup>+</sup> availability and innate immunity, which promotes understanding of the molecular basis of sUA physiology as well as providing an important clue to explore the potential impact of abnormal sUA levels (independent of MSU crystals) on health and disease.</p>
<p>It has been reported that NAD<sup>+</sup> decline contributes to inflammation, aging-related dysfunction, and multiple diseases, including hearing loss, obesity, diabetes, kidney diseases, and cardiovascular diseases, in murine models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>) and possibly even in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Accordingly, NAD<sup>+</sup> boosting by CD38 inhibitors has been a promising therapeutic strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). We discovered a structural feature for pharmacological inhibition of CD38 based on sUA analogs such as caffeine metabolites, which may facilitate the development of new inhibitors with ideal pharmacokinetic properties because sUA is rarely metabolized and is well distributed in humans, although chemical modification is required to improve inhibitory efficiency and specificity. Indeed, sUA and its analogs have similar functions, such as antioxidant property (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>) and neuroprotective effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>), supporting that they share a functional group, 1,3-dihydroimidazol-2-one, that interacts with the same targets, including but not limited to CD38. Importantly, our results support that sUA at physiological levels limits CD38 activity to maintain NAD<sup>+</sup> availability, providing the molecular basis for sUA preventing NAD<sup>+</sup> decline-associated diseases and senescence. The apparent K<sub>i</sub> values imply that CD38 is completely inhibited by sUA in blood or in some tissues under physiological conditions; however, this might not be the case because other endogenous substance may also regulate CD38 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). In spite of this, altered sUA levels are able to indicate the changes in the activities of CD38 and other molecular targets of sUA, which partially explains the correlation between sUA homeostasis disruption and disease risk. For instance, abnormal reduction of sUA levels such as hypouricemia may result in higher CD38 activity in the circulation due to the reversible inhibitory effect of sUA, thus negatively influencing health as well as increasing the risk of certain diseases. However, it does not mean that higher sUA levels are better, because excessive elevation of sUA levels promotes the precipitation of MSU crystals. In addition, we cannot exclude the possibility that long-term and crystal-free hyperuricemia (&gt; 420 μM) in humans may overly modulate additional unknown targets, especially in CD38-negative cells, thereby partially covering the CD38-mediated physiological functions of sUA. To identify more molecular targets for sUA, drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>) and cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>), which detect the direct responses of binding proteins to their ligands, may serve as alternative strategies.</p>
<p>Another unexpected observation is the restrictive effect of sUA at physiological levels on excessive inflammation, which is complementary to several recent studies regarding the immunosuppressive effect of crystal-free hyperuricemia in the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). Similar to itaconate, an inhibitor of the NLRP3 inflammasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>), sUA production increases in activated macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>). It has been reported that intracellular sUA reduction promotes certain inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>), hence sUA at physiological levels may function as an endogenous regulator of inflammasomes to avoid excessive inflammation by regulating CD38 activity. On the other hand, chemical phase transition (crystal precipitation) is essential for sUA as a danger signal to trigger immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>). We and another laboratory have demonstrated that CD38 activation by MSU crystals promotes gouty inflammation in primed macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>). Importantly, in this study, we showed that CD38 mediates the opposite effects of sUA (even at physiological levels) and MSU crystals on inflammation and innate immunity. Therefore, a sudden and rapid reduction of the circulating sUA levels by high-dose urate-lowering medications may disrupt the immune balance by rapidly releasing CD38 activity before MSU crystal dissolution (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Figure S9</xref>), resulting in the increased gout attacks in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>), a well-known paradox in gout therapy. Several clinical studies even observed that blood sUA levels decrease during gout flares, while the resolution of gouty inflammation is coming with a recovery of sUA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>). Given the distinct effects of sUA and MSU crystals on certain targets, intracellular and/or extracellular microcrystals should be excluded when evaluating the pathological role of sUA at high levels in relevant studies. In addition, our findings also provide biological evidence for the neuroprotection of sUA. It has been reported that CD38 is involved in neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>), thus, sUA in central nervous system (CNS) tissues may directly inhibit CD38 activity to limit neuroinflammation and the progression of such diseases.</p>
<p>Previously, a physiological medium containing sUA was shown to inhibit UMP synthase to reshape cellular metabolism <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>). We identified a unique sUA-CD38 interaction in this study, highlighting the physiologically essential role of sUA as a purine metabolite in sustaining life. Accumulated data suggest a remarkable overlap between the effects of sUA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>) and CD38 inhibition/KO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>) in counteracting inflammation, aging, and certain diseases, which also strongly supports our current findings. It should be noticed that we used an exogenous compound as the background in mice to mimic the deficiency of uricase in humans, and tissue sUA levels were unchanged after sUA supplementation, suggesting some of the limitations in our models when evaluating the physiological relevance. Therefore, it is important to extend these studies to global sUA-depletion models in primates or uricase-transgenic mice. Moreover, the commercial recombinant hCD38 without a transmembrane region was partially used in this study, we cannot exclude the potential interaction between sUA and the transmembrane region of CD38, although comparable K<sub>i</sub> values were obtained in crude enzymes containing full-length CD38. In addition to identification of the allosteric sites of CD38, the crystal structure of the active full-length CD38-sUA complex should be also captured using cryo-electron microscopy to elucidate the inhibitory mechanisms in the future. However, the present study clearly demonstrated that sUA at physiological levels directly inhibits CD38 and consequently limits NAD<sup>+</sup> degradation and excessive inflammation, suggesting that sUA is crucial for the physiological defense in humans against aging and diseases.</p>

<p>BMDMs were prepared and primed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>). In brief, bone marrow cells were isolated from 10- to 12-week-old WT or CD38 KO mice by washing the marrow cavity with sterile PBS. The collected bone marrow cells were filtered by 70-μm strainers and then centrifuged at 1000 rpm, 4℃ for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 2 mL red blood cell (RBC) lysis buffer for 30 s, then 8 mL complete RPMI-1640 medium (10% FBS, 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin and 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol) was added to terminate the lysis. After 5-min centrifugation at 1000 rpm, 4℃, the cells were resuspended in fresh complete RPMI-1640 medium and maintained for 4 h in an incubator. Adherent cells were discarded, whereas non-adherent cells were cultured in complete RPMI-1640 medium containing 20 ng/mL M-CSF. After 3-day differentiation, the medium was replaced with fresh complete RPMI-1640 medium containing 20 ng/mL M-CSF. On the 7<sup>th</sup> day, BMDMs were collected for subsequent experiments. BMDMs were primed with 100 ng/mL ultrapure LPS for 4 h for canonical inflammasome assay. For metabolic assay of NMN, BMDMs were primed with 100 ng/mL ultrapure LPS for 8 h to induce higher protein expression of CD38.</p>

<title>Intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> assay</title>
<p>A549 cells were seeded in 24-well plates for NAD<sup>+</sup> assay. Briefly, when the confluence reached 80%, the culture medium in each well was discarded, and the cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated in RPMI-1640 medium containing 1% FBS in the presence or absence of sUA (from 100 to 500 μM) for 20 h. Then the cells were washed twice with PBS, after the second washing, PBS was completely removed and 100 μL 5% ice-cold PCA was added into each well. The plate was kept on ice for 2 h, then cell samples were collected and centrifuged at 15000 rpm, 4℃ for 10 min. The supernatant was used for subsequent handling and measurement (see LC-MS/MS analysis).</p>
<p>Naïve THP-1 cells were pre-incubated with sUA (0-10 mg/dL) in RPMI-1640 medium containing 1% FBS for 2h, then the cells were washed twice with PBS and stimulated with MSU crystals, cLPS, zymosan or ATP for 6 h. Subsequently, the cells were washed twice with PBS, and then a total of 100 μL 5% ice-cold PCA was used to extract NAD<sup>+</sup> from cells in each well and medium as mentioned above.</p>
<p>WT BMDMs were primed with 100 ng/mL ultrapure LPS for 8 h. Then the cells were washed twice with PBS. Afterward, the cells were incubated in control or 100 μM NMN-supplemented RPMI-1640 medium in the presence of sUA or 78c. After 6-h incubation, the cells were washed twice with PBS.

<title>Metabolic assay of NAD<sup>+</sup></title>
<p>NAD<sup>+</sup> degradation by recombinant hCD38 was detected in hydrolase reaction buffer. At first, sUA (100, 200 and 500 μM) or other ligands at 500 μM in hydrolase reaction buffer (250 mM sucrose, 40 mM Tris) was freshly prepared, then the pH was immediately adjusted to 7.4 by HCl. Recombinant hCD38 was added into the buffer of experimental groups at 20 ng/mL, then the buffer was maintained at 37 ℃. The substrate NAD<sup>+</sup> was dissolved in hydrolase reaction buffer (pH 7.4) at 10 mM, and the pH was further adjusted to 7.4. The reaction was started with the addition of NAD<sup>+</sup> in the buffer for each group (final concentration is 200 μM), including control group (recombinant hCD38 free). All the buffers were incubated at 37 ℃ with constant stirring. After 30 or 60 min, 20 μL reaction buffer was transferred into 180 μL of 5% ice-cold PCA, then vortexed for 30 s before 10-min centrifugation at 15000 rpm, 4 ℃. The supernatant was further handled for NAD<sup>+</sup> measurement within 12 h without freezing and thawing (see LC-MS/MS analysis).</p>

All the samples after handling were immediately analyzed in this study without freezing and thawing.</p>
<p>The LC-MS/MS system consisted of a triple quadrupole LCMS-8050 (Shimadzu) and an LC-30A system (Shimadzu). NAD<sup>+</sup>, NMN and the N-cyclohexyl benzamide (NCB, internal standard, 5 ng/mL) were eluted on Altlantis® HILIC Silica (2.1 × 150 mm, 5 μm) at 40 °C using an isocratic mobile phase containing 60% water with 0.1% formic acid and 40% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid at 0.4 mL/min. The selected transitions of m/z were 664.10 → 136.10 for NAD<sup>+</sup>, 334.95 → 123.15 for NMN, and 204.10 → 122.20 for NCB in positive ion mode. NAD<sup>+</sup> and NMN were measured independently in this study, as their peaks were hardly separated within a short time.</p>
<p>sUA, cADPR and FYU-981 (internal standard, 1 μM, Fuji Yakuhin Co., Ltd.) were eluted on CAPCELL PAK C8 TYPE UG 120 (2 × 150 mm, 5 μm) at 40 °C. sUA and FYU-981 were separated using a gradient mobile phase containing water with 0.1% formic acid (A) and acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid (B) at 0.4 mL/min. The elution was started with 55% A for 0.5 min, A was decreased from 55% to 5% for 1 min, then A was increased from 5% to 55% for 0.5 min, finally 55% A was maintained for 0.5 min. cADPR and FYU-981 were separated using an isocratic mobile phase containing 60% water with 0.1% formic acid and 40% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid at 0.4 mL/min. The selected transitions of m/z were 167.10 → 124.10 for sUA, 539.95 → 272.95 for cADPR, and 355.95 → 159.90 for FYU-981 in negative ion mode.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study provides <bold>solid</bold> evidence, both from biochemical analyses and in vivo mouse models, that soluble uric acid serves as an enzymatic inhibitor of the NADase CD38, thereby impacting inflammatory responses. By shedding light onto the intricate interplay between uric acid and CD38, the authors highlight potential therapeutic avenues for inflammatory and age-related conditions, which may be of interest to medical biologists, biochemists, and cell biologists. Further in vivo and in vitro validation suggested would be helpful to cement the significance and implications of these findings.</p>

<p>This manuscript describes soluble Uric Acid (sUA) as an endogenous inhibitor of CD38, affecting CD38 activity and NAD+ levels both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, the inhibition constants calculated support the claim that sUA inhibits CD38 under physiological conditions. These findings are of extreme importance to understanding the regulation of an enzyme that has been shown to be the main NAD+/NMN-degrading enzyme in mammals, which impacts several metabolic processes and has major implications for understanding aging diseases. The manuscript is well written, the figures are self-explanatory, and in the experiments presented, the data is very solid. The authors discuss the main limitations of the study, especially in regard to the in vivo results. As a whole, I believe that this is a very interesting manuscript that will be appreciated by the scientific community and that opens a lot of new questions in the field of metabolism and aging. I found some issues that I believe constitute a weakness in the manuscript, and although they do not require new experiments, they may be considered by the authors for discussion in the final version of the manuscript.</p>
<p>The authors acknowledge the existence of several previous papers involving pharmacological inhibition of CD38 and their impact on several models of metabolism and aging. However, they only cite reviews. Given the focus of the manuscript, I believe that the seminal original papers should be cited.</p>
<p>Related to the previous comment, the authors show that they have identified the functional group on sUA that inhibits CD38, 1,3-dihydroimidazol-2-one. How does this group relate with previous structures that were shown to inhibit CD38 and do not have this chemical structure? Is sUA inhibiting CD38 in a different site? A crystallographic structure of CD38-78c is available in PDB that could be used to study or model these interactions.</p>
<p>Although the mouse model used to manipulate sUA levels is not ideal, the authors discuss its limitations, and importantly, they have CD38 KO mice as control. However, all the experiments were performed in very young mice, where CD38 expression is low in most tissues (10.1016/j.cmet.2016.05.006). This point should be mentioned in the discussion and maybe put in the context of variations of sUA levels during aging.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This is an interesting work where Wen et al. aimed to shed light on the mechanisms driving the protective role of soluble uric acid (sUA) toward avoiding excessive inflammation. They present biochemical data to support that sUA inhibits the enzymatic activity of CD38 (Figures 1 and 2). In a mouse model of acute response to sUA and using mice deficient in CD38, they find evidence that sUA increases the plasma levels of nicotinamide nucleotides (NAD+ and NMN) (Figure 3) and that sUA reduces the plasma levels of inflammasome-driven cytokines IL-1b and IL-18 in response to endotoxin, both dependent on CD38 (Figure 4). Their work is an important advance in the understanding of the physiological role of sUA, with mechanistic insight that can have important clinical implications.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors present evidence from different approaches to support that sUA inhibits CD38, impacts NAD+ levels, and regulates inflammatory responses through CD38.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors investigate macrophages as the cells impacted by sUA to promote immunoregulation, proposing that inflammasome inhibition occurs through NAD+ accumulation and sirtuin activity due to sUA inhibition of CD38. Unfortunately, the study still lacks data to support this model, as they could not replicate their in vivo findings using murine bone marrow-derived macrophages, a standard model to assess inflammasome activation. Without an alternative approach, the study lacks data to establish in vitro that sUA inhibition of CD38 reduces inflammasome activation in macrophages - consequently, they cannot determine yet if both NAD+ accumulation and sirtuin activity in macrophages is a mechanism leading to sUA role in vivo.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the present manuscript, the authors propose that soluble Uric acid (sUA) is an enzymatic inhibitor of the NADase CD38 and that it controls levels of NAD modulating inflammatory response. Although interesting the studies are at this stage preliminary and validation is needed.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study characterizes the potential relevance of sUA in NAD metabolism.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) A full characterization of the effect of sUA in other NAD-consuming and synthesizing enzymes is needed to validate the statement that the mechanism of regulation of NAD by sUA is mediated by CD38, The CD38 KO may not serve as the ideal control since it may saturate NAD levels already. Analysis of multiple tissues is needed.</p>
<p>(2) The physiological role of sUA as an endogenous inhibitor of CD38 needs stronger validation (sUA deficient model?).</p>
<p>(3) Flux studies would also be necessary to make the conclusion stronger.</p>
