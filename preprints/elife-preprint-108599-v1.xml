<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (smRNA-FISH) is a widely used method for visualizing and quantifying RNA molecules in cells and tissues at high spatial resolution. The technique relies on fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide probes that hybridize to target RNA. Accurate quantification depends on high probe specificity to ensure fluorescent signals reflect target RNA binding rather than off-target interactions. Numerous factors, including genome sequence complexity, secondary probe structure, hybridization conditions, and gene expression variability across cell types and lines, influence smRNA-FISH probe efficacy. Existing smRNA-FISH probe design tools have limitations, including narrow heuristics, incomplete off-target assessment, and reliance on “trial-and-error approaches. To address these challenges, we developed TrueProbes, a probe design software platform that integrates genome-wide BLAST-based binding analysis with thermodynamic modeling to generate high-specificity probe sets. TrueProbes ranks and selects probes based on predicted binding affinity, target specificity, and structural constraints. It also incorporates a thermodynamic-kinetic simulation model to provide predictive design metrics and optimize probe performance under user-defined conditions. We benchmarked TrueProbes against several widely used smRNA-FISH design tools and found that it consistently outperformed alternatives across multiple computational metrics and experimental validation assays. Probes designed with TrueProbes showed enhanced target selectivity and superior experimental performance.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Gene regulation is a fundamental biological process that underpins development and homeostasis, and it is frequently dysregulated in disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Quantification of gene expression has traditionally relied on population-level measurements of RNA or protein, using techniques such as quantitative PCR (qPCR), RNA sequencing, western blotting, and proteomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). As a diagnostic tool, these gene expression measurements can distinguish between healthy and diseased cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>).</p>
<p>For over 25 years, single-cell studies have revealed substantial variability in gene expression, even among cells with identical genotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Recent technological advances now allow for finer resolution of expression differences among cells within the same organ, highlighting the diversity of cell types and transcriptional states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Detailed analysis of single-cell data has shown that this variability can be leveraged to infer gene-regulatory mechanisms that are undetectable in bulk measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>).</p>
<p>Several approaches can be used to quantify RNA at the single-cell resolution, including single-cell RNA-sequencing, live-cell RNA reporters, and single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (smRNA-FISH). Each has limitations: single-cell RNA-seq suffers from technical noise, low sensitivity, and indirect molecule counting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>), whereas live-cell reporters require the engineering of every transcript of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>).</p>
<p>By contrast, smFISH is an imaging method that utilizes multiple oligonucleotide probes either labeled directly with fluorophores or tagged for secondary-probe binding (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) to detect individual RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Ideally, probes display high homology to targets and minimal complementarity to off-target transcripts that contribute to autofluorescence. smRNA-FISH can measure hundreds to thousands of RNA species with high spatial and temporal resolution in single cells and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Accurate quantification requires probe-derived fluorescence to be specific to the intended transcript, as off-target binding can elevate background or create false-positive spots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Traditional smRNA-FISH probe design limits sensitivity and specificity.</title>
<p>Panels A–E illustrate conceptual smRNA-FISH design scenarios affecting signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). (A) Spot SNR is determined by the number of probes bound to on-target RNA (signal, S) relative to probes bound to off targets and cellular autofluorescence (background, B). On-target and off-target localization are assumed to be random. (B) A typical design shows moderate background and submaximal spot intensity due to suboptimal probe number or affinity, resulting in overlapping signal and background distributions and reduced SNR. (C) In low expression conditions, the background remains constant but fewer on-target transcripts yield fewer detectable spots, reducing overall detection sensitivity. (D) In knockout or no-expression cases, background persists while on-target signal is absent, highlighting the contribution of off-target binding and autofluorescence. (E) An optimized design minimizes background and maximizes spot intensity by using many high-affinity probes, resulting in high SNR and improved detection performance.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>Despite its importance, smRNA-FISH probe design is often underappreciated. Probe design has two facets: (i) the <italic>physical</italic> signal amplification strategy design, which constructs labeling strategies to enhance or amplify the fluorescent signals that arise from single-stranded DNA probes binding RNA transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), and (ii) <italic>computational</italic> design, which selects optimal nucleotide sequences for hybridization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). High-fidelity design must consider numerous variables that influence performance, including oligonucleotide thermodynamics, hybridization conditions, genome complexity, probe secondary structure, gene expression variability, and genomic coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>).</p>
<p>Commonly used state-of-the-art software—Stellaris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>), MERFISH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), Oligostan-HT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>), and PaintSHOP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>)—share a similar workflow (Figure S1) but apply different criteria. Common limitations include narrow default windows for melting temperature (T<sub>m</sub>) and GC content, incomplete quantification of multi-probe off-target binding, and—except for MERFISH—little integration of expression data that may modulate off-target signal. Consequently, designs may return too few probes for atypical genes or probes prone to false positives.</p>
<p>These constraints are particularly problematic for short genes ≤ 2kb (insufficient probe numbers), low-abundance transcripts (signal overwhelmed by background), genes with tissue-specific expression (variable performance), sequences with shared motifs (cross-hybridization), and low-complexity or lncRNA targets (excess off-targets).</p>
<p>To overcome the issues observed with other probe-design software, we developed TrueProbes, a design platform that models genome-wide binding affinities to create application-specific, high-specificity probe sets. By evaluating off-target interactions genome-wide, TrueProbes seeks to more accurately minimize off-target mediated background fluorescence (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). In this approach, we conceptualize the number of probes and their on-/off-target binding probabilities to jointly determine on-target spot intensity (dark green) and off-target background (light green); reducing their overlap improves true RNA detection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>TrueProbes operates via the command line in MATLAB or as a standalone application using MATLAB Runtime on macOS, Windows, and Linux and can be tailored to diverse applications: mature-RNA detection, intronic nascent RNA detection, isoform-specific or agnostic designs, cell- or tissue-specific panels, and multi-fluorophore labeling (see TrueProbes manual for instructions on tailoring probe design to specific applications). The software simulates probe performance across probe/salt concentrations, hybridization temperatures, kinetic models, and user-provided expression datasets, and it can refine existing probe sets by removing sequences predicted to impair performance. Collectively, these computational advances translate into probe sets that exceed the experimental performance of current smRNA-FISH tools.</p>

<title>Computational simulation of probe performance demonstrates and highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each software’s algorithms</title>
<p>Target‐gene expression fundamentally shapes smRNA-FISH performance. When a transcript is highly expressed, individual RNA molecules often appear so close together that resolving single spots becomes difficult; at the other extreme, very low expression requires imaging many cells to capture only a few spots. Therefore, any reduction in on-target gene expression lowers the average number of detectable spots per cell, even though the signal-to-noise ratio of each spot remains comparable due to probe-to-target binding kinetics remaining unchanged (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>Probe specificity can be assessed in knockout (KO) cells by monitoring changes in background intensity attributable to off-target binding (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Interpreting KO data, however, can be complicated by compensatory shifts in the expression of the probes’ off-target genes.</p>
<p>TrueProbes aims to approximate the ideal scenario in which probes bind their intended targets strongly and possess only weakly bound off-targets, thereby maximizing signal-to-noise (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>Most existing design programs generate probes sequentially from the 5′ to 3′ end of the transcript instead of ranking candidates globally by experimental utility (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). A common workflow tiles the RNA with all oligos that meet length constraints, then filters them according to each tool’s heuristics (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Stellaris, Oligostan-HT, PaintSHOP, and MERFISH all follow a classic three-step path—filter, evaluate off-targets, and select a non-overlapping set—but they diverge in how they define and score specificity (Figure S1).</p>

<label>Figure 2:</label>
<caption><title>TrueProbes systematically evaluates on- and off-target binding dynamics to generate probe sets optimized for individual experimental contexts.</title>
<p>(A) Traditional smRNA-FISH design tools often select probes sequentially from the 5′ to 3′ end of the target transcript, introducing bias based on probe position rather than optimizing for binding strength or specificity. (B) Most software platforms tile the RNA with candidate probes of defined length, then apply heuristic filters to select probes, without global ranking. (C) In contrast, our approach ranks all candidate probes based on experimentally relevant specificity scores, prioritizing probes with strong on-target binding and minimal off-target interactions. (D) The pipeline begins by tiling the full target RNA sequence and generating all possible probe sequences. Each candidate is screened for off-target binding events of ≥15 nt using BLAST, assessed for RNA secondary structure, and evaluated for thermodynamic stability, including hairpins, cross-dimers, and rRNA interactions. Probes that bind rRNA are excluded. (E) Among probes with no detectable off targets, the software selects those that provide maximum coverage of the target RNA, ranking candidates by corrected on-target binding affinity after accounting for RNA secondary structure. (F) For probes with off targets, with or without incorporating cell-type–specific expression data, the remaining candidates are ranked by their specificity (low off-target binding, strong on-target binding, and minimal self-structure). The final probe set is assembled by iteratively selecting top-ranked probes that do not cross-dimerize with one another.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>Stellaris first removes 17–22-mer candidates outside a narrow GC-content window, then sweeps 5′ to 3′ while applying five masking levels to discard repetitive or non-species–specific sequences; the first oligo that satisfies length, spacing, and T<sub>m</sub> criteria is accepted, yielding a largely “first-pass” design (Figure S1A). MERFISH also filters on GC/T<sub>m</sub>, but hashes each oligo into 15/17-mers and compares them against the transcriptome and rRNA to compute an off-target index; probes are retained only if RNA scores are ≤ 0.7 and rRNA scores are 0, followed by a greedy 5′ to 3′ spacing step (Figure S1B). Oligostan-HT applies GC and low-complexity screens, then calculates Gibbs free energy (ΔG°) for every remaining oligo, ranking each by proximity to a user-defined optimum and selecting the highest scores until the quota is met (Figure S1C). PaintSHOP combines conventional thermodynamic filters with a Bowtie2 alignment stage to eliminate oligos with many genomic matches; a machine-learning (ML) classifier then assigns each candidate the probability of forming deleterious off-target duplexes, and only the top-ranked, non-overlapping probes are kept (Figure S1D). Collectively, these methods span a spectrum from heuristic, position-ordered choices (Stellaris) through energy-based ranking (Oligostan-HT), alignment plus ML triage (PaintSHOP), to hash-based transcriptome screening (MERFISH).</p>
<p>TrueProbes instead ranks all candidates from highest to lowest predicted specificity—defined by minimal expressed off-target binding, strong on-target affinity, weak off-target affinity, low self-hybridization, and minimal cross-dimerization—before assembling the probe set (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). TrueProbes first uses BLAST to enumerate off-targets, removes probes that bind to rRNA, and then calculates on-target and off-target binding energies for every oligo (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Probes with no off-targets are selected first, maximizing coverage while excluding sequences with significant cross-dimerization to those already chosen (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Remaining candidates are ranked by (i) the number of off-targets—optionally weighted by gene-expression data—and (ii) the difference of on-target to off-target plus self-hybridization energies; top-ranked, non-overlapping probes are added iteratively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>).</p>
<p>For every probe set, TrueProbes can simulate expected smRNA-FISH outcomes—including optimal probe, RNA, and salt concentrations—and optionally account for probe secondary structure, hybridization temperature, multiple targets, fluorophore choice, DNA, nascent RNA, and photon-count statistics (Figures S2A–S2B). The model can be used to generate predictions for temperature and cell-line sensitivity, multi-target discrimination, multiple fluorophore colocalization; when provided transcript expression levels and probe/background intensity, it can start to generate predictions for spot intensity, background, signal-to-noise ratio, and false-positive/-negative rates (Figure S2C). Additionally, for smRNA-FISH probe sets, TrueProbes can identify with or without gene expression data which probes contribute the most to i) the total number of off targets or ii) the accumulation of off targets with two or more binding sites bound by probes.</p>
<p>To benchmark performance, we searched genome-wide for transcripts that challenge conventional probe design, including due to certain attributes—short length, low or variable expression, complex isoform architecture, shared sequence motifs, low complexity, or overlapping antisense lncRNAs—and then chose genes meeting multiple criteria (Figures S3A– S3B).</p>
<p>As a representative example, we selected ADP-ribosylation factor 4 (ARF4), a small GTPase implicated in epidermal growth-factor signaling, COPI vesicle formation, recycling-endosome integrity, ciliogenesis, and several disease processes, including cancer progression and cholera-toxin activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). In addition to its biological and medical importance, ARF4 was selected for final experimental validation because it had the highest gene expression (in TPM units) and the fewest isoforms among all candidate genes for the Jurkat cell line.</p>
<p>For ARF4, TrueProbes, Stellaris, Oligostan-HT, PaintSHOP, and MERFISH designed 50, 51, 29, 17, and 18 probes, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). We computationally assessed cumulative off-target probe binding under various assumptions using RNA-seq data expressed in Trimmed Mean of M-values (TMM)-normalized transcripts per million (nTPM) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B–G</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Under the assumption of equal transcript expression across all genes—the current standard for smRNA-FISH probe design—Stellaris exhibited the highest number of probes bound to off-targets (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). In comparison, TrueProbes and Oligostan-HT showed approximately half as much total off-target binding as Stellaris. PaintSHOP and MERFISH exhibited the lowest off-target accumulation, approximately 50–75% lower than that of TrueProbes and Oligostan-HT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>When accounting for gene expression differences using mean average expression levels across cell lines, the total number of off-target probe binding events decreased for all software tools due to many off-targets not being expressed in several cell lines (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Stellaris, Oligostan-HT, and MERFISH had the highest overall off-target binding in this scenario. TrueProbes showed approximately 20% fewer off-target bindings than these three, while PaintSHOP reduced off-target accumulation by ∼40% compared to Stellaris, Oligostan-HT, and MERFISH (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>Using Jurkat cell-specific expression data, Oligostan-HT had the highest total off-target binding, followed by Stellaris and MERFISH (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). TrueProbes and PaintSHOP showed approximately 40% and 60% fewer off-target bindings, respectively, compared to Oligostan-HT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess probe specificity, we normalized off-target binding by the number of probes designed by each software. Under equal transcript expression, Stellaris, Oligostan-HT, PaintSHOP, and MERFISH had comparable off-target accumulation rates per probe (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). In contrast, TrueProbes showed a substantially lower rate of off-target binding per probe designed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>).</p>
<p>When using cell-line-averaged mean expression, TrueProbes and Stellaris both accumulated about 75 and 90 off-targets per on-target binding event, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Oligostan-HT and PaintSHOP exhibited roughly double the number of off-targets per on-target (150, 120) compared to TrueProbes and Stellaris. MERFISH’s performance remained consistent with its performance under the equal-expression scenario, with approximately three to four times more off-targets per probe compared to TrueProbes and Stellaris (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, using a kinetic equilibrium model to estimate the mean number of probes bound on target RNA in Jurkat cells, we calculated probes bound off targets per on-target designed probe. MERFISH had the highest off-target-to-on-target ratio, followed by Oligostan-HT, PaintSHOP, Stellaris, and TrueProbes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). Similar trends were observed when using gene-level expression data instead of transcript isoform-resolved data, with only slight variations in off-target binding (Figure S4A–S4G).</p>

<title>RNA-FISH Experimental Results Demonstrate that Off-Target and Binding Affinity Inclusive Probe Design Improve RNA-FISH Signal Discrimination</title>
<p>To assess the efficacy of RNA-FISH probes in cell culture, the probe for hARF4 coupled to Cy5 from each design tool was imaged in Jurkat cell cultures.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Accurate quantification of single-cell gene expression critically depends on the specificity and sensitivity of probe design in smRNA-FISH experiments. Our results demonstrate that current design platforms vary widely in their ability to minimize off-target binding and maximize true signal, particularly when targeting challenging transcripts such as <italic>ARF4</italic>, a gene with clinical and mechanistic relevance.</p>
<p>Our computational analysis highlights several key trends. First, expression-aware design significantly improves probe specificity. Designs assuming equal transcript abundance—a common simplification—consistently overestimated off-target binding across all tools. By incorporating average or cell-line–specific gene expression, total off-target binding dropped substantially, suggesting that realistic expression models are essential for high-fidelity design. This improvement is particularly important for transcripts expressed in a cell–type–specific or dynamic manner, where misestimated background can compromise detection accuracy.</p>
<p>Among the tested tools, TrueProbes consistently demonstrated the lowest off-target accumulation per probe and the most favorable signal-to-noise predictions across multiple expression scenarios. This advantage stems from its genome-wide modeling of RNA-probe binding kinetics, integration of cell-type-specific transcriptomic data, and a global specificity-based ranking system that accounts for thermodynamic stability, self-dimerization, and cross-hybridization. Notably, TrueProbes computes site-specific binding probabilities and kinetic binding affinities across the transcriptome, enabling precise estimation of both on-target and off-target interactions.</p>
<p>By contrast, MERFISH and PaintSHOP produced probe sets that exhibited relatively poor signal and elevated off-target accumulation. This disconnect highlights the importance of not only assessing potential binding sites but also integrating binding strength, transcript abundance, and cross-reactivity into a unified performance metric.</p>
<p>Despite generating a similar number of probes, Stellaris consistently demonstrated higher off-target interactions and greater background signal compared to TrueProbes. Oligostan-HT, on the other hand, used an affinity-based greedy method that resulted in slightly smaller probe sets than TrueProbes, but still had higher off-target binding and greater background signal. These findings for Stellaris and Oligostan-HT together show that while masking out repetitive sequences and only focusing on probe on-target binding can make it easier to design larger probe sets, it is not enough to fully optimize probe performance to avoid specific off-targets that are non-repetitive in sequence. This further highlights that probe off-target information needs to be included in the probe design process to lower the risk of performance variability when target genes share some amount of sequence homology with others in the target genome.</p>
<p>Experimental validation supported the observed performance trends. Probes grouped into two distinct performance tiers. Group 1—TrueProbes, Stellaris, and Oligostan-HT—showed comparable results across key metrics, including signal intensity, signal-minus-background, signal-to-noise ratio, and spot counts. In contrast, group 2—PaintSHOP and MERFISH—underperformed across all major metrics, exhibiting lower signal intensity, lower spot counts, and reduced SNR. They also showed a higher fraction of cells lacking detectable RNA expression, likely due to limited probe coverage or increased off-target interference from cell-specific expression of off-target sequences.</p>
<p>Probe length is another factor crucial for providing context on how RNA-FISH software probe sets performed. The software’s used a variety of probe length ranges with TrueProbes and Stellaris using short probes (20nt), Oligostan-HT using a mixture of short and long probes (30.1 ± 2.4 nt, range 25 – 34 nt, for <italic>ARF4</italic> from 23 – 38 nt probe tiling), PaintSHOP using longer probes (33.8 ± 3.2 nt, range 30 – 34 nt, for <italic>ARF4</italic> from 30 – 37 nt probe tiling), and MERFISH using longer probes (30nt). Choosing the optimal probe length can be a delicate balance as increasing probe length, i) decreases the likelihood of observing full sequence matches; ii) increases probe binding affinity and the likelihood it will bind targets; iii) increases secondary structure binding affinity and reduces the likelihood it will bind targets; and iv) for short genes decreases the number of probes you can design and lowers spot detection.</p>
<p>Previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>) has given some justification for using longer probes, finding that when assessing reference genomes that short DNA sequences (20 – 25 nt) can have higher frequencies of full repeated sequence matches that can result in lower probe specificity and provided a basis for using k-mer/hash counting methodology in probe design, included in PaintSHOP and MERFISH. This, however, does not show how easy it is to find a subset of short probes with few off-targets. While it is true that increasing probe length does lead to, on average, stronger binding affinity and increased sequence uniqueness lowering chances of full sequence matches, our computational predictions and experimental results show that i) even shorter probes we find can have enough binding affinity to bind on-target with near 100% probability; ii) longer probes subsequence off-target sequence matches that still have enough complementary to bind off targets with near 100% binding probability. These two points together show that with careful off-targets and binding equilibrium, inclusive probe design can create short probes that outperform longer probes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our predictions also provide evidence about the usefulness of avoiding probe secondary structure during RNA-FISH probe design. Our computational modeling also shows that when combining probe secondary structure and probe-target binding into a binding comprehensive equilibrium metric, most probes’ secondary structure is predicted to have minimal impact on probe binding compared to the probe on-/off-target binding affinities, especially as probes are often in far excess of targets. This effect, though, might be underestimated given how software already tries to avoid secondary structure in the probes they design.</p>
<p>Our results also have implications for improving how we design oligonucleotide therapies, where oligos are designed to either degrade RNA or sterically inhibit mRNA translation in disease treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Probe selectivity and specificity are critical to i) improving therapy sensitivity by increasing target binding affinity and knockdown (KD) efficiency; and ii) mitigating off-target effects from KD of probe off-targets by lowering the number of probes off-targets and probe off-target binding affinities.</p>
<p>Another potential application of TrueProbes is in designing antisense oligonucleotides with reduced off-target binding, enabling more specific RNA capture for downstream analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>).</p>
<p>Looking ahead, TrueProbes’ capacity to integrate expression data into the off-target evaluation process provides a strong foundation for designing cell-line and tissue-agnostic probe sets, in which probe performance remains stable across varying expression contexts. This is especially relevant for applications such as multiplex smRNA-FISH and spatial transcriptomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), where probes for multiple genes are used simultaneously. In these cases, the off-target burden may compound across genes, and probes that perform well individually may fail in combination. Our findings emphasize the need for the preselection of minimally overlapping genes to reduce cumulative background in multiplex assays.</p>
<p>Collectively, TrueProbes demonstrates how a first-principles approach—grounded in physical modeling, expression-aware off-target analysis, and comprehensive ranking—can overcome many of the limitations seen in current smRNA-FISH design tools. By improving signal-to-noise and expanding probe accessibility for difficult targets, TrueProbes enables broader and more reliable use of single-cell RNA imaging technologies.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Assumptions and Limitations</title>
<p>The TrueProbes smRNA-FISH probe design software and underlying kinetic model rely on a set of assumptions, driven primarily by the limited availability of quantitative data on factors that can influence smRNA-FISH performance. In cases where these assumptions are not valid, the predictive accuracy of the software may decline. For example, the model assumes that off-target transcripts are uniformly distributed throughout the cell, but RNA subcellular localization can introduce spatial variability in the background signal. Off-target accumulation in specific compartments may lead to localized increases in false-positive spots if multiple off-targets colocalize. The model also focuses exclusively on fully spliced transcripts and does not account for binding to intronic regions, meaning that nascent transcriptional dynamics, including on-target or off-target binding at transcription sites, are not captured. This limits the accuracy of predictions for nuclear-localized RNA signals. RNA secondary and tertiary structures are not included, which may lead to inaccuracies if binding sites are structurally occluded. Similarly, RNA–protein interactions, which can modulate accessibility of the transcript, are not modeled. Probe diffusion kinetics are also not simulated—we assume that sufficient time has passed during the experiment for probes to distribute throughout the cell and reach equilibrium binding states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Additionally, the model does not include toehold-mediated strand displacement (TMSD), a process by which one probe may displace another from the same target RNA, potentially affecting equilibrium probe occupancy and the rate of RNA–oligo hybrid formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Partial binding of overlapping probes is likewise not considered, as we do not model intermediate states of sequential probe binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Formamide concentration, which modulates the thermodynamic stability of probe–RNA interactions and disrupts DNA/RNA duplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>), is also not explicitly included. Additionally, all probe-target binding affinity calculations were made after filtering out sequence mismatches in probe-target paired hybridization sequences, which underestimates off-target binding in cases where mismatches can contribute to binding affinity that rival on-target binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). This may impact predictions of probe binding strength, especially in cases where mismatches form energetically stable interactions that mimic full sequence complementarity. We currently include a mesoscopic model of probe-target mismatch binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>), which is not evaluated by default due to having much longer runtimes than using nearest-neighbor Gibbs free energy models. We have since added a nearest-neighbor model approximation of probe mismatch hybridization Gibbs free energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>) to the models that TrueProbes can use to evaluate probe binding affinities. Our off-target predictions are based on a reference genome and transcriptome, and any discrepancies or incompleteness in these references could affect design outcomes. Moreover, the variability in gene expression between cells, conditions, or cell types presents inherent limitations. In certain single-cell expression contexts, designing a probe set that minimizes off-target binding below a threshold acceptable across all cells may be theoretically impossible. The same challenge applies across experimental conditions, where a probe set optimized for one context may not retain its performance in others. Finally, genes with high sequence similarity or shared motifs may produce smRNA-FISH signals that are experimentally indistinguishable, particularly under noisy conditions, limiting the ability to assign detected spots to a specific transcript confidently.</p>

<p>Cell line TPM gene-level and transcript isoform-level expression data from the Broad Institute Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) Project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>) were analyzed using a methodology adapted from the Human Protein Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>) with protein-coding and non-coding gene TPM trimmed mean of m-value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) (TMM) normalized across CCLE cell lines to generate normalized transcript per million (nTPM) using MATLAB implementations of NOIseq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). From gene-level and transcript-level nTPM matrices in MATLAB, cell-line agnostic equal expression levels and average cell-line expression levels were computed as baselines for quantifying probe off-target binding in individual cell lines. Gene expression data indexed using EMBL ENSTx and ENSGx identification were then cross-identified into RefSeq identification numbers used in BLAST to generate software-specific expression matrices containing transcript expression levels for on and off-target RNA for equal, mean average, and cell-line specific. Gene-level expression data was imputed into on/off-target expression levels by normalizing gene-level nTPM by the maximum number of isoforms for each gene across EMBL-EBI and NCBI RefSeq reference genome annotations.</p>

<title>Steady State Equilibrium Probe Binding Reactions</title>
<p>All reaction energies were determined using software that computes the Gibbs free energy for any two sequences of oligonucleotides binding to each other at all temperatures within a given temperature range. By considering all the distinct ways a probe can self-dimerize, cross-dimerize, or bind targets, reaction Gibbs free energies were used to compute the dissociation constants for self-hybridization (K<sub>d,Self</sub>), cross-dimerization (K<sub>d,Cross</sub>), and target binding (K<sub>d,Target</sub>) potential probe reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>).

<title>TrueProbes smRNA-FISH Probe Selection</title>
<p>Probes to design for smRNA-FISH experiments were prioritized by sequentially sorting probes lowest to highest by their number of off-targets, followed by the estimated difference between on-target binding and the sum of off-target and secondary structure binding affinity, which we denoted as prioritization rank sorting. The default to evaluate probe binding affinity calculations is at 37°C. First, probes with no off targets were selected to design the most probes that cover the target with the highest on-target binding energy corrected for secondary structure binding affinity. For probes without off targets we then performed sequentially the following three-step probe selection process: i) we selected the probe with the highest prioritization rank, ii) all remaining probes that overlap with probes we have chosen already were removed from design consideration, iii) any new probes cross-dimerizing with already selected probes were minimized by updating the prioritization rank of all remaining probes when adding their cross-dimerization affinities to probes already designed to their overall secondary structure binding affinity when evaluating probes prioritization rank. This three-step process was then repeated until no more probes without off-targets could be designed. The remaining probes with off-targets were prioritization rank sorted, and the three-step process was repeated for probes with off-targets based on their number of off-targets, with or without weighting by gene expression levels, until the user-defined maximum number of probes was exceeded or no probes remained to be designed.</p>

<title>smRNA-FISH Cell Segmentation and Spot Detection</title>
<p>smRNA-FISH spots were detected using TrueSpot, an automated smRNA-FISH spot detection software (52, doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.01.10.632467">https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.01.10.632467</ext-link>). Before spots were detected, an updated command line version of CellDissect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>) in TrueSpot was used for cell segmentation in all smRNA-FISH images. CellDissect segments nuclei in 3D and cells in 2D using the TRANS and DAPI channel images. CellDissect uses the DAPI signal of the nucleus to generate automated thresholds to quantify individual non-overlapping nuclei used in determining cell boundaries.</p>
<p>After cell segmentation, for each smRNA-FISH CY5 channel image, the pipeline performed dead pixel removal to reduce false positives, followed by a Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) transformation applied to each slice of the raw 3D image stack and edge detection. TrueSpot then used a range of intensity thresholds to find local intensity maxima, i.e., potential spots, within each filtered image stack at each intensity threshold. For each smRNA-FISH image, TrueSpot constructed a spot detection curve by counting the number of spots detected at each threshold. These curves were log10-transformed and analyzed using two-piece linear regression and the median absolute deviation (MAD) to estimate optimal thresholds and their ranges. A final detection threshold was selected using a weighted combination of the linear regression fit and MAD-based metrics. TrueSpot was run under two settings in our analyses: (i) Image-specific thresholding, where a separate detection threshold was calculated for each 3D image stack. (ii) Global thresholding, where all images used the minimum threshold derived from the individual image analyses.</p>

<sec id="s2c17">
<title>smRNA-FISH Spot Quantification</title>
<p>smRNA-FISH spot and background intensities were quantified using TrueSpot at both the single-cell and single-spot levels. Spot quantification was performed using the minimum image-level threshold across all smFISH images. For each detected spot, TrueSpot fitted a Gaussian to the surrounding voxels around each spot slice-by-slice in the original RNA-FISH image stack, then integrated the signal across z-stacks to generate a 3D punctum. Spot intensity was calculated as the total integrated intensity of all voxels within the 3D region.</p>
<p>TrueSpot then computed the centroid of each spot and applied 2D Gaussian fits across ±2 z-stacks around the centroid to determine spot amplitude, fitted intensity, radius, and a spot mask. Before intensity quantification, all images were corrected for uneven illumination using a reference correction matrix. This matrix was generated by 2D smoothing of the percent maximum pixel intensity at each position across z-stacks in cell-free control images.</p>
<p>For each spot, TrueSpot calculated a set of intensity statistics: minimum, maximum, mean, median, standard deviation, MAD, and intensity histograms. Background was measured locally for each detected spot by computing the mean, median, and maximum intensity of all pixels not associated with any detected spot within ± 5 pixels in the x/y-directions from the spots Gaussian fit x/y full width at half maximum across ±2 z-stack around the centroid of the spot. While both maximum and mean spot intensities were recorded, maximum intensity was primarily used for quantification. TrueSpots then merged nearby local maxima detections—spots within one pixel in the x, y, or z direction—into actual and duplicate candidate smRNA-FISH spots.</p>
<p>For all RNA spot intensity quantifications, software and replica specific spot detection thresholds were used based on TrueSpot automated thresholding. For each software RNA-FISH image, TrueSpot generated eighteen threshold suggestions. For each software in each replica, these suggestions were then aggregated, and their median was applied to detect spots across all fields of view images at each replica. All spots detected at these image level thresholds were then filtered to focus only on non-duplicate spots.</p>
<p>From these values, TrueSpot generated distributions of maximum spot intensities and mean background intensities. Signal-minus-background was calculated as the difference between the two. Finally, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was computed for each spot using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn19">Equation 19</xref>, where μ<sub>signal</sub> is the maximum spot intensity, μ<sub>background</sub> is the mean background intensity, and σ<sub>background</sub> is the background standard deviation. This per-pixel SNR accounts for both the absolute signal level and variability in background, providing a robust measure of contrast in fluorescent microscopy images.

</disp-formula>
After quantifying spot intensity metrics, the distribution of total smRNA-FISH spot counts per cell was computed as detected by TrueSpot for each probe design software. Given the generally low number of spots per cell, our analysis was focused on total spot counts per cell rather than per-spot metrics. To minimize artifacts, several quality filters were applied. Cells with abnormally large volumes—typically resulting from poor segmentation—were excluded. Lysed or damaged cells exhibiting unusually high mean background intensity (greater than 1000 a.u. per pixel) and artifactual spots with radii smaller than half a pixel were removed. The total number of smRNA-FISH spots for each remaining cell was calculated by counting all spots whose dropout threshold met or exceeded the cell’s spot detection threshold.</p>

<title>Statistics and Reproducibility</title>
<p>RNA-FISH experiments were conducted with three separate replicas, each with at least three fields of view per software per replica. All intensity and spot count distributions were analyzed using two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, Kruskal-Wallis tests and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Multiple comparison tests were performed with MATLAB function multcompare with an Alpha value of 0.05 using Bonferroni critical value correction to compare metric distributions for pooled replica data in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> and individual replica data in Figure S5.

<p>The authors describe a new computational pipeline designed to identify smFISH probes with improved RNA detection compared to preexisting approaches. smFISH is a powerful and relatively straightforward technique to detect single RNAs in cells at subcellular resolution, which is critical for understanding gene expression regulation at the RNA level. However, existing methods for designing smFISH oligos suffer from several limitations, including off-target binding that produces high background signals, as well as a restricted number of probes that are sufficiently specific to target shorter-than-average mRNAs. To address these challenges, the authors developed TrueProbes, a computational method that aims to minimize off-target-mediated background fluorescence.</p>
<p>Overall, the study addresses a technically relevant problem. If improved, this would allow researchers to study gene expression regulation more effectively using single-molecule FISH. However, based on the current presentation of data, it is not yet clear that TrueProbes offers significant advantages over preexisting pipelines. In the following section, I describe some concerns, which should be adequately addressed.</p>
<p>Major Comments:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript currently presents only one example in which different pipelines were tested to generate probes (targeting ARF4). While the images suggest that both TrueProbes and Stellaris outperform the other pipelines, the comparison is potentially misleading because the number of probes used differs substantially. I recommend that the authors include at least three independent examples in which an equal number of probes are designed across pipelines, so that signal-to-noise can be assessed in a controlled and comparable way. This would allow the probe number to be held constant while directly evaluating performance.</p>
<p>(2) It is also unclear how many biological replicates were performed for the ARF4 experiments. If only a single replicate was included, it is difficult to conclude that TrueProbes consistently outperforms other pipelines in a robust and reproducible manner. I suggest the authors include data from at least three biological replicates with appropriate statistical analysis, and ideally extend this to additional smFISH targets as outlined in Comment 1.</p>
<p>(3) No controls are presented to demonstrate that the TrueProbes-designed smFISH spots are specifically detecting ARF4. The current experiment primarily measures signal-to-noise, but it remains possible that some detected spots do not correspond to ARF4 mRNAs. Since one of the major criteria used by TrueProbes is to limit cross-hybridization, the authors should perform ARF4 knockdown experiments and demonstrate that nearly all ARF4 smFISH signal is lost. A similar approach should be applied to the additional examples recommended in Comment 1.</p>
<p>(4) In the limitations of the study, the authors note that &quot;RNA secondary and tertiary structures are not included, which may lead to inaccuracies if binding sites are structurally occluded.&quot; However, I am not convinced that this is a true limitation, since formamide in the smFISH protocol should denature secondary structures and allow oligo access to the RNA. I recommend that the authors comment on this point and clarify whether secondary structure poses a practical limitation in smFISH probe design.</p>
<p>(5) The authors also correctly acknowledge in their limitations that &quot;RNA-protein interactions, which can modulate accessibility of the transcript, are not modeled.&quot; I suggest referencing relevant studies on this issue, particularly Buxbaum et al. (2014, Science), which would provide important context.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Hughes et al present a new single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) probe design software, termed &quot;TrueProbes&quot; in this manuscript. They claim that all existing smFISH (and variants) probe design software packages have limitations that ultimately impact experimental performance. The author's claim to address the majority of these limitations in TrueProbes by introducing multiple computational steps to ensure high-quality probe design. The manuscript's goal is clear, and the authors provide some evidence by designing and targeting one gene. Overall, the manuscript lacks rigorous evidence to support the claims, does not demonstrate its suitability for a variety of smFISH-type experiments, and some of the provided quantification data are unclear. While TrueProbes clearly has potential, more data is required, or the authors should tone down the claims.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The problem is well-articulated in the abstract and the introduction.</p>
<p>(2) Figures 3 and 4 follow a consistent color scheme where each probe design method has its own color, which helps the reader visually compare methods.</p>
<p>(3) The authors compared multiple probe design software packages both computationally and experimentally.</p>
<p>(4) TrueProbes does produce visually and quantitatively better results when compared to 2 of the 4 existing smFISH probe design packages (Paintshop and MERFISH panel designer).</p>
<p>(5) The authors introduce a comprehensive steady-state thermodynamic model to help optimally guide probe design.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The abstract describes the problem well and introduces the solution (the TrueProbes software), but fails to provide specific ways in which the TrueProbes software performs better. The authors state that &quot;...[TrueProbes] consistently outperformed alternatives across multiple computational metrics and experimental validation assays&quot;, but specific, quantitative evidence of improved performance would strengthen the statement.</p>
<p>(2) The text claims that TrueProbes outperforms all other probe design software, but Figure 3 indicates that TrueProbes has neither the greatest number of on-target binding nor the lowest number of off-target binding. The data in Figure 3 does not support the claims made in the text. Specifically, the authors claim that &quot;RNA FISH Experimental Results Demonstrate that Off Target and Binding Affinity Inclusive Probe Design Improve RNA FISH Signal Discrimination&quot; (lines 217-218). However, despite their claim that Stellaris and Oligostan-HT produce more off-target probes when evaluated with the TrueProbes framework, the experiment results are nearly identical. The authors should consider modifying their claims or performing new experiments that more clearly demonstrate their claims.</p>
<p>(3) The bar graphs in Figure 3 do not seem to agree with the probability graphs in Figure 4. For example, Figure 3 indicates that Stellaris probes have higher off-target binding than TrueProbes; however, in Figure 4, their probability graphs lie almost on top of each other.</p>
<p>(4) The authors performed validation for only one gene (ARF4), because &quot;...it had the highest gene expression (in TPM units) and the fewest isoforms among all candidate genes for the Jurkat cell line&quot; (lines 176-177). While the results do look good, this is a minimal use case and does not really showcase the power of their method. One experiment that could be helpful would be two-color (or more) smFISH in tissue, where the chances for off-target binding contributing to higher errors are much greater than in an adherent cell line.</p>
<p>(5) A common strategy for both smFISH and highly multiplexed methods is to use secondary DNA oligos with dye molecules instead of direct conjugation. Given that this is a primary design goal of PaintSHOP and the Zhuang lab's MERFISH probe design code, it would be helpful to demonstrate that TrueProbes can design a two-layer probe strategy for high-quality RNA-FISH labeling.</p>
<p>(6) The authors claim, &quot;For every probe set, TrueProbes can simulate expected smRNA FISH outcomes including optimal probe, RNA, and salt concentrations and optionally account for probe secondary structure, hybridization temperature, multiple targets, fluorophore choice, DNA, nascent RNA, and photon count statistics (Figures S2A, S2B). The model can be used to generate predictions for temperature and cell line sensitivity, multi-target discrimination, multiple fluorophore colocalization; when provided transcript expression levels and probe/background intensity, it can start to generate predictions for spot intensity, background, signal to noise ratio, and false negative rates (Figure S2C).&quot; (lines 156-163). Figure S2 is a flow chart and does not provide evidence for any of these items. The authors should provide evidence for these claims, either as a figure or an example script in their software repository. If that is not possible, then it should be removed.</p>
<p>(7) All thermodynamic equations are performed at steady state. The authors do not justify this assumption, and there is no discussion of the potential impacts of either low molecule numbers or violations of the well-mixed assumption. Can the authors please include a discussion on the potential impacts non non-steady state dynamics?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript introduces a new platform termed &quot;TrueProbes&quot; for designing mRNA FISH probes. In comparison to existing design strategies, the authors incorporate a comprehensive thermodynamic and kinetic model to account for probe states that may contribute to nonspecific background. The authors validate their design pipeline using Jurkat cells and provide evidence of improved probe performance.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A notable strength of TrueProbes is the consideration of genome-wide binding affinities, which aims to minimize off-target signals. The work will be of interest to researchers employing mRNA FISH in certain human cell lines.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, in my view, the experimental validation is not sufficient to justify the broad claims of the platform. Given the number of assumptions in the model, additional experimental comparisons across probe design methods, ideally targeting transcripts with different expression levels, would be necessary to establish the general superiority of this approach.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The authors describe a new computational pipeline designed to identify smFISH probes with improved RNA detection compared to preexisting approaches. smFISH is a powerful and relatively straightforward technique to detect single RNAs in cells at subcellular resolution, which is critical for understanding gene expression regulation at the RNA level. However, existing methods for designing smFISH oligos suffer from several limitations, including off-target binding that produces high background signals, as well as a restricted number of probes that are sufficiently specific to target shorter-than-average mRNAs. To address these challenges, the authors developed TrueProbes, a computational method that aims to minimize off-target-mediated background fluorescence.</p>
<p>Overall, the study addresses a technically relevant problem. If improved, this would allow researchers to study gene expression regulation more effectively using single-molecule FISH. However, based on the current presentation of data, it is not yet clear that TrueProbes offers significant advantages over preexisting pipelines. In the following section, I describe some concerns, which should be adequately addressed.</p>
<p>Major Comments:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript currently presents only one example in which different pipelines were tested to generate probes (targeting ARF4). While the images suggest that both TrueProbes and Stellaris outperform the other pipelines, the comparison is potentially misleading because the number of probes used differs substantially. I recommend that the authors include at least three independent examples in which an equal number of probes are designed across pipelines, so that signal-to-noise can be assessed in a controlled and comparable way. This would allow the probe number to be held constant while directly evaluating performance.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an important observation. We have already addressed this issue in Figures 3E-G and Supplementary Figure 4E-G, where we plotted the number of OFF-targets for each ON-target probe. If we select longer genes to ensure an equal number of designed probes with strong signals, we will still end up with the same number of ON-target probes. Consequently, Figures 3B-D and 3E-G would show similar trends, albeit with different values on the y-axis. Additionally, we will conduct an analysis using Stellaris at its highest probe design stringency setting to compare the software under its strictest design conditions. Additional experiments are outside the scope of the current manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) It is also unclear how many biological replicates were performed for the ARF4 experiments. If only a single replicate was included, it is difficult to conclude that TrueProbes consistently outperforms other pipelines in a robust and reproducible manner. I suggest the authors include data from at least three biological replicates with appropriate statistical analysis, and ideally extend this to additional smFISH targets as outlined in Comment 1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Three biological replicates were utilized for the ARF4 experiments. As stated in the original submission, the average data from all three replicates is presented in Figure 4, while the data for each individual replicate can be found in Figure S5. Statistical analyses were conducted for both the pooled data in Figure 4 and the individual data in Figure S5. The results of all statistical calculations are detailed in Supplemental Table 1. We will update the text to clearly indicate the number of biological replicates and the outcomes of the statistical analysis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) No controls are presented to demonstrate that the TrueProbes-designed smFISH spots are specifically detecting ARF4. The current experiment primarily measures signal-to-noise, but it remains possible that some detected spots do not correspond to ARF4 mRNAs. Since one of the major criteria used by TrueProbes is to limit cross-hybridization, the authors should perform ARF4 knockdown experiments and demonstrate that nearly all ARF4 smFISH signal is lost. A similar approach should be applied to the additional examples recommended in Comment 1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. Currently, we lack the expertise in our lab to conduct such experiments, so they are beyond the scope of this manuscript. However, we will create additional supplementary figures to demonstrate that the likelihood of false positives is low, based on the assumption that current publicly available BLAST algorithms, genome annotations, and reference transcription expression data are accurate.</p>
<p>We will include a comparison in our supplementary materials showing the off-target RNA that can bind the highest number of probes simultaneously for each software. Additionally, we will perform a correlation analysis to illustrate the relationship between spot intensity for different software and the number of probes they design. This will help us estimate how the number of probes bound to RNA correlates with expected spot intensity ranges.</p>
<p>Using this information, along with autofluorescence background intensity measurements from no-probe controls, we will estimate the minimum number of probes that need to bind to targets to be detected as single spots. If this minimum is higher than the maximum number of simultaneous off-target probe bindings, we anticipate that the detected spot signal will primarily reflect ARF4 rather than other transcripts.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In the limitations of the study, the authors note that &quot;RNA secondary and tertiary structures are not included, which may lead to inaccuracies if binding sites are structurally occluded.&quot; However, I am not convinced that this is a true limitation, since formamide in the smFISH protocol should denature secondary structures and allow oligo access to the RNA. I recommend that the authors comment on this point and clarify whether secondary structure poses a practical limitation in smFISH probe design.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. We will revise the manuscript to clarify: &quot;We did not include RNA secondary and tertiary structures in the model because the use of formamide in RNA-FISH experiments denatures these structures, allowing oligonucleotides to access the RNA.&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The authors also correctly acknowledge in their limitations that &quot;RNA-protein interactions, which can modulate accessibility of the transcript, are not modeled.&quot; I suggest referencing relevant studies on this issue, particularly Buxbaum et al. (2014, Science), which would provide important context.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for highlighting the literature that supports this limitation. We will include Buxbaum et al. (2014, Science) and additional studies that discuss how RNA-protein interactions can affect RNA-FISH experiments.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Hughes et al present a new single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) probe design software, termed &quot;TrueProbes&quot; in this manuscript. They claim that all existing smFISH (and variants) probe design software packages have limitations that ultimately impact experimental performance. The author's claim to address the majority of these limitations in TrueProbes by introducing multiple computational steps to ensure high-quality probe design. The manuscript's goal is clear, and the authors provide some evidence by designing and targeting one gene. Overall, the manuscript lacks rigorous evidence to support the claims, does not demonstrate its suitability for a variety of smFISH-type experiments, and some of the provided quantification data are unclear. While TrueProbes clearly has potential, more data is required, or the authors should tone down the claims.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s thoughtful feedback. We will revise the text to ensure that all claims are backed by computational or experimental evidence. For claims that do not have supporting results, we will relocate them to the discussion section as potential future extensions. Since our probe design is open access, both we and the community can further develop our codes as needed.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The problem is well-articulated in the abstract and the introduction.</p>
<p>(2) Figures 3 and 4 follow a consistent color scheme where each probe design method has its own color, which helps the reader visually compare methods.</p>
<p>(3) The authors compared multiple probe design software packages both computationally and experimentally.</p>
<p>(4) TrueProbes does produce visually and quantitatively better results when compared to 2 of the 4 existing smFISH probe design packages (Paintshop and MERFISH panel designer).</p>
<p>(5) The authors introduce a comprehensive steady-state thermodynamic model to help optimally guide probe design.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We like to thank the reviewer for pointing out the strength of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The abstract describes the problem well and introduces the solution (the TrueProbes software), but fails to provide specific ways in which the TrueProbes software performs better. The authors state that &quot;...[TrueProbes] consistently outperformed alternatives across multiple computational metrics and experimental validation assays&quot;, but specific, quantitative evidence of improved performance would strengthen the statement.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for acknowledging the clarity of the abstract and introduction. We will revise the abstract to provide more specific details on how TrueProbes outperforms other software. Additionally, we will include specific computational and experimental metrics that demonstrate TrueProbes' improved performance compared to other software.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The text claims that TrueProbes outperforms all other probe design software, but Figure 3 indicates that TrueProbes has neither the greatest number of on-target binding nor the lowest number of off-target binding. The data in Figure 3 does not support the claims made in the text. Specifically, the authors claim that &quot;RNA FISH Experimental Results Demonstrate that Off Target and Binding Affinity Inclusive Probe Design Improve RNA FISH Signal Discrimination&quot; (lines 217-218). However, despite their claim that Stellaris and Oligostan-HT produce more off-target probes when evaluated with the TrueProbes framework, the experiment results are nearly identical. The authors should consider modifying their claims or performing new experiments that more clearly demonstrate their claims.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In Figure 3, we aim to convey two main points.</p>
<p>The first point is to compare the number of ON-target probes designed by each software using their most stringent design criteria (Figure 3A). Currently, we are using a medium strict design criterion for Stellaris (level 3). As shown in the new supplementary figure XX, when we apply the most stringent design criteria for Stellaris (level 5), the number of ON-target probes decreases to XX probes. This clearly indicates that, based on theoretical calculations, TrueProbes can design more probes than any of its competitors.</p>
<p>The second point is to compare the number of OFF-targets produced by each probe design. To illustrate this, we used two different metrics. In Figures 3B-D, we compare the total number of probes bound to OFF-target RNA. However, since each software generates a different number of ON-target probes, the number of OFF-targets may vary simply due to the differences in ON-target probe counts. Therefore, we introduced a second metric to compare OFF-targets. In Figures 3E-G, we present the number of OFF-targets normalized by the number of ON-targets. Using this metric, TrueProbes shows the lowest number of OFF-targets. We will updat the manuscript to clarify this point.</p>
<p>Regarding the experiments and their comparison to theoretical calculations: The theoretical calculations consider only the reference DNA and RNA genomes along with the oligonucleotide sequences for the probes. We then use a thermodynamic model to identify ON- and OFF-targets. Thus, these theoretical calculations represent an upper bound on the maximum possible number of ON-targets and the minimum number of OFF-targets. All other design software evaluated in this manuscript relies on the same or less reference data and makes certain assumptions. None of these methods quantitatively compare their computational designs with experimental results; they simply design probes based on unverified assumptions, conduct experiments, and present spot data to conclude that their probe designs are effective.</p>
<p>We will update the manuscript to clarify the goals of the theoretical model and its relationship to the experiments. Future work will be necessary to enhance our theoretical model to fully account for additional aspects of RNA-FISH experiments (e.g., formaldehyde crosslinking, hybridization conditions, washing steps) to better predict the experimental data shown in Figure 4. We will also adjuste our claims to accurately reflect the current capabilities of our theoretical framework and its relation to experimental outcomes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The bar graphs in Figure 3 do not seem to agree with the probability graphs in Figure 4. For example, Figure 3 indicates that Stellaris probes have higher off-target binding than TrueProbes; however, in Figure 4, their probability graphs lie almost on top of each other.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The predictions in Figure 3 regarding the number of probe off-target binding events, based on reference gene expression data, do not necessarily encompass all the information required to predict RNA-FISH signal intensity. Therefore, these predictions should not be expected to translate directly into the experimental results shown in Figure 4, particularly concerning the background signal.</p>
<p>While our software aims to minimize off-target probe binding, this does not automatically lead to a reduction in off-target background signal. Numerous other factors influence the spot background and overall signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance, beyond just probe-target binding interactions. Although we strive to minimize off-target background through probe binding, this approach is not designed to directly predict the SNR. Extending the computational analysis of probe binding dynamics to RNA-FISH signal intensity dynamics is beyond the scope of this study.</p>
<p>We have revised our text to clearly separate computational results from experimental results into two distinct sections. We will use different terminology to describe the outcomes of computational performance versus experimental performance, reducing potential confusion between these two aspects. Additionally, we will clarify our conceptual overview in Figure 1 regarding traditional probe design limitations related to sensitivity and specificity. We will specify how the signal from the number of probes bound to ON-target RNA, relative to those bound to OFF-targets and cellular autofluorescence, translates—either linearly or non-linearly—into the signal-to-noise ratio.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors performed validation for only one gene (ARF4), because &quot;...it had the highest gene expression (in TPM units) and the fewest isoforms among all candidate genes for the Jurkat cell line&quot; (lines 176-177). While the results do look good, this is a minimal use case and does not really showcase the power of their method. One experiment that could be helpful would be two-color (or more) smFISH in tissue, where the chances for off-target binding contributing to higher errors are much greater than in an adherent cell line.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for highlighting these valuable experiments. Currently, our lab lacks the expertise to generate tissue samples beyond culturing cells. Additionally, implementing a two-color probe design in tissues containing different cell types with unknown expression levels presents further challenges. Due to these limitations, designing and conducting two-color experiments in tissue samples is beyond the scope of the current manuscript, but we plan to pursue this in the future.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) A common strategy for both smFISH and highly multiplexed methods is to use secondary DNA oligos with dye molecules instead of direct conjugation. Given that this is a primary design goal of PaintSHOP and the Zhuang lab's MERFISH probe design code, it would be helpful to demonstrate that TrueProbes can design a two-layer probe strategy for high-quality RNA-FISH labeling.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention. TrueProbes is currently designed and tested specifically for primary smRNA-FISH probes. Our focus is on demonstrating a new approach to designing these probes without the added complexities of secondary probes and multiplexing. Future work will expand on this foundation to incorporate secondary probe detection and transcript multiplexing.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The authors claim, &quot;For every probe set, TrueProbes can simulate expected smRNA FISH outcomes including optimal probe, RNA, and salt concentrations and optionally account for probe secondary structure, hybridization temperature, multiple targets, fluorophore choice, DNA, nascent RNA, and photon count statistics (Figures S2A, S2B). The model can be used to generate predictions for temperature and cell line sensitivity, multi-target discrimination, multiple fluorophore colocalization; when provided transcript expression levels and probe/background intensity, it can start to generate predictions for spot intensity, background, signal to noise ratio, and false negative rates (Figure S2C).&quot; (lines 156-163). Figure S2 is a flow chart and does not provide evidence for any of these items. The authors should provide evidence for these claims, either as a figure or an example script in their software repository. If that is not possible, then it should be removed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The supplemental information of the article will be updated to include figures that illustrate predictions for each capability currently offered by TrueProbes, along with the scripts used to generate these predictions. Any capabilities that do not have corresponding scripts will be removed from this section and instead referred to as potential improvements or future additions to the TrueProbes framework in the discussion section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) All thermodynamic equations are performed at steady state. The authors do not justify this assumption, and there is no discussion of the potential impacts of either low molecule numbers or violations of the well-mixed assumption. Can the authors please include a discussion on the potential impacts non non-steady state dynamics?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thermodynamic equations are calculated at steady state because RNA-FISH hybridization reactions typically last from eight to twenty hours. This duration allows probes adequate time to localize to their targets and reach binding equilibrium, based on current estimates of DNA oligonucleotide association and dissociation rate constants. We will address the potential violation of the well-mixed assumption in the assumptions and limitations section, specifically discussing how RNA localization can affect the spatial distribution of both on-target and off-target probes within cells, which may disrupt the well-mixed condition.</p>
<p>Low molecule numbers are not a significant concern, as probe DNA oligonucleotide concentrations in RNA-FISH protocols are much higher than the number of transcripts present in cells, by several orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>The assumptions and limitations section will be revised to clearly state: “Probe hybridization reactions were computed at steady state because most RNA-FISH protocols utilize probe hybridization incubation steps lasting over eight hours, which should provide sufficient time to reach equilibrium based on current estimates of forward and reverse reaction rate constants. Predictions from the equilibrium model may be less accurate for RNA-FISH experiments with shorter hybridization times, where non-steady state dynamics can result in different transient outcomes depending on the duration of hybridization.”</p>
