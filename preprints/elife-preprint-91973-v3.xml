<title>Abstract</title><p>The vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) is a proton-dependent antiporter responsible for loading monoamine neurotransmitters into synaptic vesicles. Dysregulation of VMAT2 can lead to several neuropsychiatric disorders including Parkinson’s disease and schizophrenia. Furthermore, drugs such as amphetamine and MDMA are known to act on VMAT2, exemplifying its role in the mechanisms of actions for drugs of abuse. Despite VMAT2’s importance, there remains a critical lack of mechanistic understanding, largely driven by a lack of structural information. Here we report a 3.1 Å resolution cryo-EM structure of VMAT2 complexed with tetrabenazine (TBZ), a non-competitive inhibitor used in the treatment of Huntington’s chorea. We find TBZ interacts with residues in a central binding site, locking VMAT2 in an occluded conformation and providing a mechanistic basis for non-competitive inhibition. We further identify residues critical for cytosolic and lumenal gating, including a cluster of hydrophobic residues which are involved in a lumenal gating strategy. Our structure also highlights three distinct polar networks that may determine VMAT2 conformational dynamics and play a role in proton transduction. The structure elucidates mechanisms of VMAT2 inhibition and transport, providing insights into VMAT2 architecture, function, and the design of small-molecule therapeutics.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neuronal signaling by monoaminergic neurotransmitters controls all aspects of human autonomic functions and behavior, and dysregulation of this leads to many neuropsychiatric diseases. Nearly 60 years ago<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, secretory vesicles prepared from adrenal glands were shown to contain an activity that accumulated epinephrine, norepinephrine, and serotonin in an ATP-dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Extensive characterization by many different laboratories of synaptic vesicles (SVs) in neurons showed that monoamine transport activity was also dependent on the proton gradient generated by the V-ATPase, exchanging two protons for one cationic monoamine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Monoamine transport was shown to be inhibited by non-competitive inhibitors such as tetrabenazine (TBZ)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> and competitive inhibitors like reserpine which has been used to treat hypertension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Amphetamines were shown to be monoamine transporter substrates, eventually leading to vesicle deacidification, disruption of dopamine (DA) packaging in the SV, and DA release into the synapse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Cloning of the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) in the 1990’s<sup>1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> revealed two different genes, VMAT1 and VMAT2, that were expressed in the adrenal medulla and brain, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. VMAT2 is expressed in all monoaminergic neurons in the brain, including those for serotonin, norepinephrine, DA, epinephrine, and histamine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, and is essential for loading these neurotransmitters into SVs. VMAT2 is fundamentally required for neurotransmitter recycling and release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> and changes in VMAT1 and VMAT2 activities either through small-molecule agents or mutations are thought to contribute to many human neuropsychiatric disorders including infantile-onset Parkinson’s, schizophrenia, alcoholism, autism, and bipolar depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>VMAT1 and 2 are members of the solute carrier 18 (SLC18) family and are also known as SLC18A1 and SLC18A2. The SLC18 subfamily also includes the vesicular transporters for acetylcholine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> (VAChT, SLC18A3) and polyamines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> (VPAT, SLC18B1). Sequence alignments also show that SLC18 transporters belong to the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of membrane transport proteins which use an alternating access mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> to transport substrate across membranes. SLC18 members are predicted to be comprised of 12 transmembrane (TM) spanning helices (TM1-12), which are arranged in two pseudosymmetric halves each with 6 TM helices containing a primary binding site for neurotransmitters, polyamines, and inhibitors located approximately halfway across the membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Conformational changes driven by the proton electrochemical gradient are thought to alternatively expose the binding site to either side of the membrane allowing for transport of neurotransmitter from the cytoplasm to the lumen of SVs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>VMAT2 and VMAT1 share 62% sequence identity but have distinct substrate specificity and pharmacological properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Small-molecule ligands such as TBZ and reserpine are high-affinity inhibitors of VMAT2, which prevent neurotransmitters from binding, arrest VMAT2 from cycling, and consequently reduce neuronal signaling. VMAT2 exhibits higher affinity for TBZ, monoamines and amphetamines, whereas reserpine binds equally to both VMAT2 and VMAT1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. TBZ is the only drug which is approved for treatment of chorea associated with Huntington’s disease and has shown to be effective in various other hyperkinetic conditions such as tardive dyskinesia, dystonia, tics, and Tourette’s syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. A proposed mechanism for TBZ inhibition of VMAT2 involves two sequential steps, initial low-affinity binding of TBZ to the lumenal-open state of VMAT2 which produces a conformational change, resulting in a high-affinity dead-end TBZ-bound occluded complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Here we report a structure of VMAT2 bound to TBZ at 3.1 Å resolution in an occluded conformation using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), describing the architecture of VMAT2, identifying the high-affinity TBZ binding site, and revealing the mechanisms of drug and neurotransmitter binding, inhibition, and transport.</p>

<title>Cryo-EM imaging of human VMAT2</title>
<p>Since VMAT2 is a small monomeric membrane protein of approximately 55 kDa, cryo-EM structure determination is challenging. To overcome this, we incorporated mVenus and the anti-GFP nanobody into the N- and C-terminus respectively of human VMAT2 to provide mass and molecular features to facilitate the cryo-EM reconstruction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>), this created a hook-like fiducial feature by reconstituting the interaction of these proteins on the cytosolic side of VMAT2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Attachment of both proteins to the termini proved to be ineffective as the unstructured N- and C-terminus of VMAT2 are flexible; to combat this problem, we determined the minimal termini length that would reduce flexibility while maintaining VMAT2 folding. After successive optimizations, our final construct contained mVenus fused to the N-termini at position 17, and the anti-GFP nanobody at position 482 which we denote the VMAT2 chimera (Figure Supplement 1a-e). We investigated the consequences of VMAT2 modification to ensure the chimera maintained functional activity. First, we performed binding experiments with <sup>3</sup>H-labeled dihydrotetrabenazine (DTBZ) and found the chimera bound DTBZ with a similar affinity (K<sub>d</sub> = 26 ± 9 nM) to the wild type control (K<sub>d</sub> = 18 ± 4 nM) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Competition binding of labeled DTBZ with unlabeled reserpine which stabilizes cytoplasmic-open<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, a state which is incompatible with TBZ binding and produced a K<sub>i</sub> of 173 ± 1 nM for reserpine, which was like wild type (161 ± 1 nM). Next, we performed transport experiments using permeabilized cells, initial time course experiments using <sup>3</sup>H-labeled serotonin showed clear accumulation (Figure Supplement 1f), and steady-state experiments using 1 and 10 µM serotonin measured within the linear uptake range showed similar transport activity as wild type VMAT2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). Thus, the functional properties of the chimera are comparable to wild type VMAT2.</p>
<p>To understand the architecture, locate the drug binding site, and assess how TBZ binding influences the conformation of the transporter, we studied the VMAT2 chimera using single-particle cryo-EM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e,f</xref>, Figure Supplement 2). The resulting cryo-EM map was determined to a resolution of 3.1 Å, the densities of the TM helices were well-defined, continuous, and exhibited density features for TBZ in the primary binding site and most of the side chains (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, Figure Supplement 3). This demonstrates the feasibility of our approach and enabled us to build a model of VMAT2.</p>

<title>Architecture of VMAT2</title>
<p>The TBZ bound VMAT2 complex adopts an occluded conformation, with TBZ in a binding site between the central transmembrane helices. The twelve TM helices of the transmembrane domain (TMD) of VMAT2 are arranged in a tight bundle with TM1-6 and TM7-12 each organized into a pseudosymmetrical half (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). The cytosolic facing side of VMAT2 is characterized primarily by the unstructured N- and C-termini along with a 20-residue loop that connects the two halves, extending from TM6 to TM7 before terminating in a short α-helix that runs parallel to the bilayer and connects to TM7 with a short linker. TM5 and 11 both contain proline residues near the lumenal face, which break the helical structure and facilitate connections to TM6 and 12 respectively. TM9 and 12 exhibit significant heterogeneity in our cryo-EM reconstructions; we speculate that this is likely due to a dynamic nature intrinsic to the TMs, an aspect that may offer a glimpse into VMAT2 dynamics.</p>

</fig>
<p>VMAT1 and 2 encode a large lumenal loop (LL) 1 which contains several N-linked glycosylation sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> and a disulfide bridge between LL1 and LL4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. LL1 and 4 also contain intriguing elements of structure: LL1 extends into the lumenal space in an unstructured loop which is mostly not resolved in our structure, before terminating in a short helix which interacts with the lumenal face of the transporter near TM7, 11 and 12; LL4 extends outward from TM7 into the lumen before connecting back to TM8. A striking feature of LL4 is the location of W318 which positions its indole side chain directly into a lumenal cavity near the TBZ site, acting as a plug to completely occlude the lumenal side of the transporter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Together, these loops cinch the lumenal side of the transporter closed, locking VMAT2 in an occluded conformation and preventing ligand egress. The conserved nature of LL4 and W318 suggests this motif is necessary for transport function and is a key player in the transport mechanism (Figure Supplement 1b,g, Figure Supplement 4). The conformation of LL1 and 4 is likely also aided by a disulfide bond between cysteines 117 and 324, which is known to be necessary for transporter function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, our structure was not able to unequivocally place this bond due to the lack of density for residues 48-118 of LL1.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Cytosolic and lumenal gates</title>
<p>The structure of the VMAT2-TBZ complex reveals that both the cytosolic and lumenal gates are closed, which precludes solvent and ligand access from either the cytosolic or lumenal compartments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a-c</xref>). Previous studies have suggested residues R217, M221, Y418 and Y422 make up the cytosolic gate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. We find R217 and Y418 form the outer cytosolic gate with the guanidino group of R217 involved in a cation-π interaction with the aromatic benzyl group of Y418 which seals off cytosolic access to the binding site (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). M221 and Y422 form a second set of cytosolic gating residues ‘above’ the outer cytoplasmic gate through a stable methionine-aromatic interaction which acts to fully seal the cytoplasmic gate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). It is likely that M204 and M403 also contribute to cytosolic gating in this region as their side chains also act to fill this space. On the lumenal side, F135, F334 and W318, form the lumenal gate where they interact with one another to block access to the binding site. W318 acts as ‘cap’ with the indole side chain facing into a tightly packed hydrophobic pocket consisting of residues I44, V131, L134, L315, I317, and I381 which completely prevent access on the lumenal side. W318 is highly conserved in the SLC18 family, suggesting that SLC18 transporters share a common mechanism of lumenal-gate closure (Figure Supplement 4). E127 of LL1 may play a role in stabilizing the tryptophan in this conformation, with the carboxyl group of the side chain orienting itself near the indole nitrogen potentially forming a hydrogen bond pair. We found that mutation of this residue to alanine did not significantly reduce TBZ binding relative to wild type (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2d</xref>).</p>
<p>The inner gate is located just below TBZ and comprises residues Y341, F429, and Y433 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. When probed for their role in inhibitor binding, we found that alanine mutants of F135, Y433, and W318 all greatly reduced DTBZ binding (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). Extensive contacts of TBZ with F135 may function to keep the transporter closed on the lumenal side, which would trap VMAT2 in the occluded conformation. F135 and Y433 form π-stacking interactions with TBZ which coordinate the benzene ring of TBZ. F429A did not reduce DTBZ affinity (K<sub>d</sub> = 7.7 ± 0.6 nM) compared to the wild type control (K<sub>d</sub> = 15 ± 2 nM), showing that while mutation of this residue compromises the inner cytosolic gate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>), it is not directly involved in binding TBZ. Conversely, while W318 in LL4 also does not interact directly with TBZ, W318 is required for stabilizing the occluded conformation, and replacement with alanine prevents TBZ from being trapped inside the transporter by preventing closure of the lumenal gate. Sequence alignment with other members of the SLC18 family reveals broad conservation of W318 except for VAChT which contains a phenylalanine in its place (Figure Supplement 4) and a W318F mutation retained some DTBZ binding (K<sub>d</sub> = 24 ± 16 nM) (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). Alignment of VMAT2 sequences from other species also show a high degree of conservation of W318 with some notable exceptions which substitute W318 for a large positively charged residue such as an arginine or histidine; and upon investigation we found these mutants all greatly diminish DTBZ binding (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>).</p>

<p>To further investigate the functional role of the identified gating residues, we performed serotonin transport experiments. We found that mutation of both E127, and F135 to alanine significantly reduced transport activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). E127A produced a large reduction in transport, resulting in just 34% activity. Replacing F429 with alanine reduced transport as well, but only to about half the level of wild type (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2e</xref>). Interestingly, the Y433A mutation appeared to enhance transport, and while critical for TBZ binding, this mutant does not prevent transporter cycling (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d,e</xref>). Mutation of W318 to alanine greatly reduced transport, paralleling the effect observed with DTBZ binding (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d,e</xref>) while a histidine mutant at this position maintained a significant amount of transport activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d-f</xref>) and the phenylalanine substitution had about half the activity of wild type. The highest activity of the examined W318 mutants was W318R, which fully recapitulated the transport activity of wild type despite being unable to bind DTBZ (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d, e</xref>).</p>

<title>Polar networks</title>
<p>Upon careful inspection of the model, we were able to identify distinct polar networks that we believe may play a role in proton coordination and subsequent transporter conformational change (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). The first and largest of these networks lies between TMs 1, 4 and 11, and consists of residues D33, N34, K138, Q142, R189, Q192, S196, S197, S200 and D426 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. At the center of this network lies D33<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, which makes critical contacts with the side chains of N34, K138, S196, and Q192. Together, the residues comprise a complex hydrogen bond network linking TM 1, 4 and 11. D426<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> lies further toward the cytosol with the side chain carboxyl group facing the bulk of the network, likely forming a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of S200. In the other TMD half there are two distinct groups of interacting polar residues, which bridge between TM 7, 8 and 10 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a,c,d</xref>). The second group is a pair of residues found on the lumenal side, between residues E312 and N388 with the amide group of the N388 side chain pointed towards the carboxyl group of E312, which could act to stabilize TBZ in the binding site (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). The third group is located toward the cytosolic side and consists of N305, Y341, and D399<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, the latter two of which have previously been speculated to form a hydrogen bond pair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>.

<title>Tetrabenazine binding site</title>
<p>The resolution of our map allowed us to unambiguously place TBZ in the central binding site (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a,b</xref>). TBZ adopts a pose which is predominantly perpendicular to the direction of the TM helices in the lumenal half of VMAT2 near the location of the lumenal gating residues. The TBZ binding site exhibits an amphipathic environment, comprised of both polar and non-polar residues where the tertiary amine of TBZ orients itself towards the negatively charged surface of the binding site near TMs 7 and 11, and toward E312 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>, Figure Supplement 5a). We considered that E312 may play an analogous role to the highly conserved aspartate residue present in neurotransmitter sodium symporters such as the serotonin, DA, and norepinephrine transporters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> which utilize a negatively charged residue to directly bind to amine groups (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d,e</xref> Figure Supplement 4). We thus performed radiolabeled binding experiments to assess the effect of mutating residues in the TBZ binding site by measuring binding of <sup>3</sup>H-labeled DTBZ (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). E312 was previously shown to be necessary for substrate transport and inhibitor binding, so we first selected this residue for mutagenesis to probe its importance in TBZ binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. The E312Q mutant did not fully abolish DTBZ binding (Figure Supplement 5b) but did greatly reduce DTBZ affinity. This demonstrates that, while not completely essential, E312 is important for inhibitor binding and likely substrate transport by interacting with the amine of the neurotransmitter (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d,e</xref>). Next, we observed that R189 orients its guanidino group towards the methoxy groups of TBZ likely forming hydrogen-bonding interactions and we found that replacement of R189 with an alanine nearly completely abolished DBTZ binding at all concentrations tested (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>, Figure Supplement 5b). The high degree of conservation of this residue suggests that it plays an important role in transporter function, and even a conservative substitution to a lysine nearly eliminated DTBZ binding (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4f</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). K138 has been previously shown to play an important role in both TBZ binding and serotonin transport and the primary amine side chain is positioned toward the TBZ binding site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d,e</xref>). K138 is positioned between two aspartate residues (D426 and D33) and is part of a hydrogen bond network that has been previously hypothesized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Previous experiments found that mutating K138 to alanine resulted in an approximate 4-fold reduction in TBZ binding affinity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> but did not extinguish TBZ binding and therefore K138 is likely involved in direct interactions with substrate or inducing conformational changes during proton transport and is not directly involved in TBZ binding. N34 is of particular interest since the amide group of its sidechain appears to form a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of TBZ (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4d,e</xref>) and DTBZ binding was not detectable to N34 mutants of either glutamine, threonine or aspartate while substitution to alanine preserved some binding (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, Figure Supplement 5b).</p>

<p>To investigate the functional role of residues in the binding site, we again performed a series of serotonin transport experiments. We found R189A, E312Q, N34T, N34A and K138A mutations all exhibited reduced transport activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g</xref>). R189A and E312Q exhibited the largest change, reducing transport to essentially zero. Substitution of N34 with glutamine had little or no effect on transport activity, opposite of what was noted for DTBZ binding. Replacing N34 with alanine was detrimental, reducing transport to less than half of wild type (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g</xref>). We found N34D and N34T to have opposing effects, with N34D having activity slightly less than wild type and N34T having little to no transport activity at all. R189K greatly affected transport but retained some activity despite lacking measurable DTBZ binding.</p>
<p>Our model of the VMAT2-TBZ complex allowed us to pinpoint two residues which contribute to the specificity of TBZ to VMAT2 over VMAT1. Previous studies have highlighted V232<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, which is a leucine in VMAT1, as being putatively involved in conferring differences in affinity, and our model shows that V232 is positioned closely to the isobutyl of TBZ which is wedged into a small hydrophobic pocket (Figure Supplement 5c). The addition of an extra carbon of the leucine sidechain would produce a steric clash and limit the ability of TBZ to bind (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). The V232L mutant in VMAT2 reduces the affinity of DTBZ to VMAT2, confirming its importance in specificity, but the V232L mutant did not show a complete loss in binding (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>, Figure Supplement 5b). Therefore, we carefully inspected the binding site of VMAT2 and compared it to the predicted structure of VMAT1 to find additional differences in the binding site (Figure Supplement 4), we found that L37 in VMAT2 is a phenylalanine in VMAT1 (Figure Supplement 5c). Given its proximity to TBZ, this substitution would produce a steric clash with the benzene ring (Figure Supplement 5a,c). We found that the L37F mutant resulted in nearly no detectable binding of DTBZ at 60 nM concentration (Figure Supplement 5b). Thus, the combination of these two substitutions likely constitutes the differences in TBZ affinity of VMAT2 <italic>vs.</italic> VMAT1. Interestingly, V232L and L37F both retained some transport activity with L37F producing a more significant reduction in activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4g</xref>).</p>
<p>Our docking simulations suggested that TBZ may sample two different binding poses by small reorientation and movements within the same binding pocket (Figure Supplement 6), both exhibiting similar binding affinities (−9.5 ± 0.2 kcal/mol); the first pose is almost identical to that resolved in our cryo-EM structure (0.4 Å RMSD, Figure Supplement 6e); and the second (3 Å RMSD in TBZ heavy atom coordinates) shows a reorientation of the TBZ methoxy groups toward C430, a residue previously identified to play an important role in binding TBZ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> (Figure Supplement 6f). These two poses were also observed in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations as illustrated in Figure Supplement 6.a-d and Movie Supplement 1-4. The second pose provides insights into the adaptability of TBZ to the conformational dynamics of VMAT2, while it preferentially positions itself into the pocket resolved in our cryo-EM map. TBZ is thought to enter from the lumenal side of VMAT2 by binding to the lumenal-open conformation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. It may interact first with C430 and the other coordinating residues at this pose before R189 moves between the two methoxy groups and allows TBZ to settle into the resolved orientation (Figure Supplement 6f). This result highlights the stepwise events that inhibitors like TBZ may undergo to stably bind to their targets.</p>
<p>The binding stability of TBZ is also influenced by its protonation state. When TBZ is protonated (TBZ<sup>+</sup>), it induces the diffusion of 3-4 times more water molecules within the TBZ binding pocket compared to neutral TBZ (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, Figure Supplement 7). This flux of water results in the dissociation of TBZ from its binding site as illustrated in Movie Supplement 5 and 6. Several titratable residues, including D33, E312, D399, D426, K138, and R189, line the central cavity of VMAT2 and impact TBZ binding stability (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). We found that maintaining an overall neutral charge within the TBZ binding pocket, as observed in system TBZ_1, most effectively preserves the TBZ-bound occluded state of VMAT2. Residues R189 and E312 in particular are within close proximity of TBZ and participate directly in binding.</p>

<title>Neurotransmitter release</title>
<p>To examine the binding propensity of DA to VMAT2 in the occluded conformation, we constructed five simulation systems with varying protonation states for the four acidic residues (D33, E312, D399, and D426) that line the binding pocket (<xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). For all five systems, DA carried a +1 charge and was initially placed with a pose predicted by docking simulations to be the most favorable binding pose (Figure Supplement 8a,b); and for each system, two MD runs of 100 ns were performed, except for the case where all acidic residues were in a protonated state of which one of the runs was extended to 200 ns to visualize the release of DA to the vesicular lumen. The simulations revealed alterations in DA’s binding properties depending on the protonation states of the four acidic residues (Figure Supplement 8c, <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Two notable differences were observed when comparing DA to TBZ binding (system DA_2 <italic>vs.</italic> TBZ_1). First, upon binding TBZ, R189 orients its guanidino group toward the methoxy groups of TBZ and forms hydrogen bonds in both the cryo-EM structure and MD simulations; in the case of DA, hydrogen bond formation of the hydroxyl groups of DA was primarily facilitated by K138, D33 or D426, or N34, rather than R189. This resulted in the exposure of R189, triggering a continuous water pathway near the hydrophobic gate residue F135 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). This water path recurred in multiple runs conducted with DA and was lined by the hydrophilic network composed of Y182, R189, Q192, S137, K138, D33, N34, Q142, N146, S200, and D426 (Figure Supplement 8d).</p>

W318 side chain isomerization plays a critical role in mediating the opening/closure of the hydrophobic gate, accompanied by the reorientation of F135 side chain, permitting a flux of water molecules eventually giving rise to the destabilization and release of DA to the SV lumen by translocating through a hydrated channel.

<p>Second, an additional water wire near the hydrophobic gate residue F334 was observed in DA-bound VMAT2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>), but not in TBZ-bound VMAT2 which, in contrast, was minimally hydrated (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). The second water wire was lined by the backbone polar groups of hydrophobic residues, e.g., F334, together with a hydrophilic network containing K379, N388, S338, E312, Y433, Y341, N305, and D399. We also observed that the amine group of DA acted to facilitate the water influx from the lumenal side.</p>
<p>We hypothesize that those two water paths may be related to proton transfer and be associated with protonating the pocket-lining acidic residues. Likely, lumenal DA release depends on the number of protonated acidic residues (Figure Supplement 8d-h). When at least two acidic residues were protonated, we observed fluctuations in DA position (run DA_2; Movie Supplement 7) and dislocation of DA from its pocket (run DA_3; Movie Supplement 8). In system DA_4 (<xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>), the protonation of E312, D399, D426, and D33 resulted in complete opening of the hydrophobic gates formed by F135, W318, and F334, which led to the release of DA to the vesicle lumen (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>, Movie Supplement 9). DA was observed to migrate toward a cluster of acidic residues, including E127, E120, D121, and D123, before complete dissociation, and the acidic environment within the vesicle lumen should assist in promoting the release of DA.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The VMAT2 – TBZ complex captures the transporter in a fully occluded state with the ligand binding site centrally located between the two repeated substructures TM1-6 and TM7–12. VMAT2 functions by alternating access which involves alternate exposure of the primary binding site to either side of the membrane and isomerization between a cytosolic-open and lumenal-open state in a mechanism known as the rocker-switch (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a,b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Studies have proposed that TBZ first enters VMAT2 from the lumenal side, binding to a lumenal-open conformation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. TBZ makes extensive contact with residues in the primary site, likely in a lower affinity state as the transporter subsequently closes to forming the high-affinity occluded state. The lumenal gates lock the transporter into an occluded state, preventing displacement by other ligands and producing a so-called dead-end complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>).</p>

<p>Comparison of the transmembrane domain with more distantly related MFS transporters in other conformational states such as the outward-open VGLUT2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> and inward-open GLUT4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> models (1.2 Å RMSD) show that the conformational changes involving TM1, 7, 8 and 11 are likely involved in mediating the transport cycle and alternating access (Figure Supplement 10). Comparison with the Alphafold model shows that while the TMD is largely similar (1.1 Å RMSD overall difference in TMD), Alphafold lacks several key features such as the conformations of the LLs and is unable to predict key details that are critical to ligand binding. Hence, computational docking could not identify the TBZ binding site using the Alphafold-predicted model, alluding to the critical importance of our experimental structural data (and simulations based on that structure) for gaining insights into VMAT2 functional mechanisms.</p>
<p>To enable us to solve the structure of VMAT2, we developed an intrinsic fiducial tool consisting of mVenus and the anti-GFP Nb which provides a feature on the cytosolic side of the transporter. GFP and the GFP-Nb are ubiquitous tools used for cell biology, protein biochemistry and structural biology and here we describe another application of this powerful toolkit. In contrast to traditional antibody-based campaigns which may require multiple rounds of screening and take many months or years to discover a suitable binder, our strategy only required us to make between 15-20 constructs to find a suitable chimera (Figure Supplement 1a-c). There are now many other similar methods such as the fusion of the target protein with BRIL and binding of the anti-BRIL Fab<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> and fusions of maltose-binding protein and DARPin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. However, since our strategy directly incorporates fluorescent proteins, this enables FSEC based screening of constructs and monitoring fluorescence throughout purification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. One obvious disadvantage of all intrinsic fiducial strategies is that the fusion may distort the protein structure, but monitoring the functional activity and comparison with the wild type protein should mitigate these problems.</p>
<p>Among human mutations in VMAT2 causing an infantile-onset form of parkinsonism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>, three mutants, P316A, P237H, and P387L, have been shown to extinguish monoamine transport. We find these residues are in LL4 and the lumenal ends of TM5 and 9 respectively (Figure Supplement 9). LL4 is involved in lumenal gating and the P316A variant would likely disrupt the conformation of the loop. In the case of P237H, a histidine would result in not only an insertion of a positively charged residue into the lumenal membrane interface but also in a reduction of the helical bend and would distort the connection of TM5 with TM6. The P387L variant would also disrupt helical connections and the overall architecture of the helix by insertion of a bulky residue into a small hydrophobic cavity. Therefore, we speculate that these SNPs alter the transporter’s ability to sample multiple conformations by suppressing transporter dynamics and perturbing VMAT2 stability and folding. Recently, many additional disease variants have been discovered<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup> many of which are also found in the lumenal or cytoplasmic ends of TM helices, LL1, and the N- and C-termini and our structure will provide insight into the functional and structural consequences of these variants.</p>
<p>Large aromatic side chains of the lumenal gating residues compartmentalize the transporter, likely ensuring directional transport of substrate. MD simulations revealed little variation in the pose of the aromatic gating residues comprising the inner gates (Figure Supplement 6d). It is interesting to note that substitution of Y433 with alanine resulted in enhanced transport while reducing DTBZ binding. Reduced inhibitor binding is likely due to disruption of π-stacking interactions, but the mechanism for enhanced transport remains unclear. The lumenal gates showed more movement in MD simulations of DA, likely owing to its residue composition and lack of strong interactions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Despite this observation, we assert that the tight hydrophobic environment prevents exchange into the lumenal space. These mechanisms of gating are atypical of MFS transporters which more commonly use salt bridges to gate access to the substrate binding site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Of particular interest among gating residues is W318, which acts as a central plug to prevent solvent access to the transporter. Our mutagenesis analysis suggests that while a large residue is required for maintaining some transporter function, lack of charge also appears to be essential for inhibitor binding. Replacement of W318 with residues present in VMAT2 from other species, except for the phenylalanine mutant, failed to recapitulate any DTBZ binding.</p>
<p>Interestingly, of these substitutions, only an arginine was able to fully recapitulate native transport, suggesting lumenal gating activity requires either a large, charged or a large aromatic residue. Our studies also suggest E127 plays a role in lumenal gating by interacting with LL4 as substitution to alanine reduced transport, and we speculate that large, charged groups at position 318 directly interact with E127 to maintain full transporter function. In contrast, DBTZ binding remained unaffected for the E127A mutant, suggesting a role for this residue in a later step of transporter closure of the lumenal compartment. Positively charged residues at position 318 may stabilize the lumenal gate and promote conformational cycling through enhanced interactions with negatively charged residues such as E127 but may prevent TBZ from entering the lumenal pathway of the transporter in any capacity. Conservation of this residue in the SLC18 family suggests that this is a common mechanism for lumenal gating. It is unclear what other structural adaptations are present to enable W318 replacement with large positively charged residues in other VMAT2 sequences, but we suspect that the overall architecture of the lumenal domain remains similar. We also note that the disulfide bond between LL1 and 4 plays a critical role in transport<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, and the disulfide bond may function to restrict the dynamics of this region to allow W318 to occlude the neurotransmitter binding site during transport.</p>
<p>Residues R189 and K138 stand out as critical for drug binding and inhibition and substrate transport. Simulations highlight the role K138 may play in coordinating with the hydroxy group of neurotransmitters and enabling binding at the central site. These results are consistent with previously observed results demonstrating the critical role K138 plays in substrate transport<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Remarkably, even mutation to lysine at position 189 abolishes DTBZ binding while still retaining a small amount of transport activity, highlighting the specificity of the DTBZ binding site.</p>
<p>Our structure also provides important clues for understanding the chemical specificity and selectivity of TBZ binding, suggesting that the enhanced affinity of DTBZ is due to preferential interaction with N34. DTBZ is a metabolite of TBZ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> which differs by only a hydroxyl group <italic>vs.</italic> a double bonded oxygen and binds to VMAT2 with approximately 2-fold higher affinity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Our structure suggests that the amide of N34 acts as a hydrogen bond donor for TBZ, and in the case of DTBZ the hydroxyl of the ligand may act as a hydrogen bond donor for the carbonyl oxygen of N34. We hypothesize that this interaction is more favorable for DTBZ, leading to a higher binding affinity. Valbenazine, a TBZ analogue with a valine attached to the oxygen of the hydroxyl group of DTBZ, binds VMAT2 with a K<sub>d</sub> of 150 nM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. We hypothesize that N34 does not form a favorable hydrogen bond with the oxygen of valbenazine and that addition of this larger moiety causes steric clashes in the binding site. Mutation of N34 nearly eliminated DTBZ binding, highlighting its importance in coordinating inhibitor binding. We found N34 is also important for transport, but its precise role remains unclear. Strikingly, replacement with glutamine had no effect on transport whereas aspartate had only a small effect. This suggests that N34 is likely involved in substrate coordination but may not be entirely essential.</p>
<p>This is confirmed with the N34A substitution which still showed significant transport activity. In contrast a threonine substitution was greatly detrimental, but we believe this is likely due to larger active site perturbations.</p>
<p>Comparison of the residues involved in TBZ binding in VMAT2 <italic>vs.</italic> VMAT1 also provides insight into the selectivity of TBZ by demonstrating that key differences in the ligand binding site are likely responsible for the reduction in TBZ binding affinity observed in VMAT1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. L37 and V232 are highlighted, and mutation to the equivalent residue in VMAT1, phenylalanine and leucine respectively, eliminated DTBZ binding but only reduced substrate transport. Given these results, we suggest these are the primary residues involved in determining TBZ selectivity for VMAT2 <italic>vs.</italic> VMAT1. We suspect VMAT1 exhibits structural differences compared with VMAT2 to accommodate the larger residues and maintain functional activity.</p>
<p>Through MD simulations, we gained insights into the effects of the protonation states of TBZ and E312. Protonation of TBZ at the amine resulted in an unstable complex, and a structure markedly different from the state resolved with electron microscopy. This suggests TBZ remains unprotonated when bound to the occluded state, as the protonated form will not remain in complex with VMAT2. We believe there may be other TBZ bound states such as the lumenal-open state where TBZ may be protonated. However, in the terminal complex, E312 must remain protonated suggesting that E312 acts as a hydrogen bond donor to stabilize TBZ in the binding site. Our binding and transport studies further confirm this as the mutation of E312 to glutamine greatly reduces serotonin transport and DTBZ binding (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4f, g</xref>). Moreover, mutation of E312 to an alanine has long been known to completely negate all TBZ binding and transport activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> again highlighting the requirement of hydrogen bond pairing with TBZ.</p>
<p>We also highlight three key polar networks which may be involved in conformational changes induced by proton binding during the transport cycle and are likely also involved in mediating proton transduction (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). Taken together, we believe these networks play a critical role in mediating the conformation changes taking place in the transporter upon substrate or inhibitor binding. We hypothesize that the protonation of D33, E312, D399 and D426 would significantly perturb these interactions by breaking crucial hydrogen bond pairs and/or salt bridges, leading to opening of the cytosolic gate. This falls in line with previous work highlighting the role these residues play in transport through a variety of mutagenesis and functional experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Given the known transport stoichiometry of two protons per neurotransmitter, we speculate that two protons may dissociate back into the lumen, perhaps driven by the formation of salt bridges between D33 and K138 or R189 and E312 for example in an cytosol-facing state. The asymmetry between these two networks is also striking, with the first network consisting of TM1, 4 and 11 being substantially larger. This may allow for larger conformational changes on this side and an overall asymmetry in the cytosolic-open state of the transporter. To our knowledge, this is also an atypical feature in MFS proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> and would represent an interesting adaptation upon the rocker-switch mechanism.</p>
<p>Our studies lead us to propose a mechanism by which TBZ inhibits VMAT2 by first entering the transporter from the lumenal open state and subsequently trapping it in an occluded state through a two-step mechanism centered around W318, which acts as a central plug to close off the lumenal compartment. This provides a basis for non-competitive inhibition as endogenous neurotransmitter is unable to compete for binding from the closed off cytosolic compartment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6a</xref>). Our results also provide insight into transporter function, and we propose a mechanism for substrate release from the central binding site (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6b</xref>). The bound substrate coordinates in the binding site predominantly through interactions with E312 and K138. R189 is directed towards the lumenal space where it engages with one of two water channels. Water enters through these channels into the transporter, passing F135 and F334 and inducing conformational change. In our simulations, we find intrusion of water to cause W318 to flip out of the central site which enables neurotransmitter to dissociate from the transporter (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, we have developed a new fiducial tool incorporating mVenus and the GFP-Nb into the primary sequence of a previously intractable transport protein of great importance to human health. Cryo-EM of VMAT2 allowed us to pinpoint the lumenal and cytoplasmic gates, polar networks likely involved in conformational change and proton transduction, and the conformation and binding site of inhibitors. Our structure facilitated the discovery and detailed analysis of many residues involved in these key molecular mechanisms and enabled further extension in our understanding of neurotransmitter transport. Thus, by capturing the VMAT2 bound with TBZ along with subsequent mutagenesis, binding, transport, and computational experiments, our work delivers insights into the transporter’s mechanism of function and provides a framework for understanding the structural underpinnings of neurotransmitter release, transport, and inhibition in VMAT2 and other related transport proteins in the MFS family.</p>

<title>Molecular dynamics simulations</title>
<p>The initial MD simulation system was prepared using CHARMM-GUI Membrane Builder module<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. The structure of VMAT2 bound to TBZ was aligned using PPM2.0 webserver<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup> and embedded into 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) membrane lipids. The pKa values of titratable residues of VMAT2 in the presence or absence of TBZ were calculated using PROPKA 3.5.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>; and the computed pKa values for acidic residues and TBZ are listed in <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. Of note, D33 and E312, as well as D399 and D426 (yellow highlights in Figure Supplement 8c and bold in <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) are in proximity to TBZ; thus, their protonation states may impact substantially TBZ binding. Given that D33 may form a salt bridge with its nearby K138, we assumed it to be deprotonated; and E312 and D399 were assumed to be protonated because of their comparatively higher pKa values. To further assess how the protonation states on TBZ and/or D426 affect the binding propensity of TBZ, we constructed four different simulation systems (see <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) with either protonated or deprotonated TBZ and with/without protonation of D426 (in addition to E312 and D399), denoted as systems TBZ_1 – TBZ_4. For each system, TIP3P waters and K<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions corresponding to 0.1 M KCl solution were added to build a simulation box of 92 ×92 ×108 Å<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>.

Briefly, CHARMM36 force fields were adopted for VMAT2, lipids, and water molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>. Force field parameters for both protonated (carried +1 charge) and neutral-charged TBZ were obtained from the CHARMM General Force Field for drug-like molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup>; and proton was added using Open Babel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup>.

Finally, the unconstrained protein was subjected to 100-180 ns NPT simulations. Periodic boundary conditions were employed in all simulations, and the particle mesh Ewald (PME) method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup> was used for long-range electrostatic interactions with the pair list distance of 16.0 Å. The simulation time step was set to 2 fs with the covalent hydrogen bonds constrained with the SHAKE algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>. A force-based switching function was used for Lennard-Jones interactions with switching distance set to 10 Å. Langevin dynamics was applied with a piston period of 50 fs and a piston decay of 25 fs as, well as Langevin temperature coupling with a friction coefficient of 1 ps<sup>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. For each system, 2-3 independent runs of 100-180 ns were performed (see <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Snapshots from trajectories were recorded every 100 ps for statistical analysis interactions and structural changes.</p>
<p>For DA bound to the occluded VMAT2, we constructed five simulation systems with varying protonation states for the four pocket-lining acidic residues (denoted as runs DA_0 to DA_4; see <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). In all systems, the DA carried +1 charge and was initially positioned at the top (lowest energy) docking-predicted binding pose (see Figure Supplement 6a,b); and for each system, two runs of 100 ns were performed, following the same simulation protocols described above for TBZ, except for an extended run of 200 ns conducted to visualize the DA release to the SV lumen, which comprised 170 ns conventional MD simulations, followed by 4 ns of enhanced conformation sampling using the adaptive biasing force method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup>, and subsequent 30 ns conventional MD simulations.</p>

The molecular structures of protonated DA and serotonin were adopted from the previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></sup>. Docking simulations were carried out using a grid with dimensions set to 65 x 65 x 70 Å<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> to encapsulate the entire structure of the transporter. The exhaustiveness of the simulation was set to 50, and the algorithm returned a maximum of 20 ligand binding poses.</p>

<title>Computational data analysis</title>
<p>MD trajectory analysis and visualization were performed using VMD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref></sup>. For each snapshot, the TBZ binding affinity was evaluated using contact-based binding affinity predictor PRODIGY-LIG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref></sup>; and the number of waters within the TBZ binding pocket were assessed by counting the number of oxygen (OH2) atoms within 3.5 Å of TBZ. For RMSD calculations, the C<sup>α</sup> atoms of VMAT2 and the heavy atoms from TBZ were used after alignment of the simulated VAMT2 onto the cryo-EM structure. The binding pockets of VMAT2 were assessed using Essential Site Scanning Analysis (ESSA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref></sup> and Fpocket<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref></sup>, implemented in ProDy 2.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref></sup>. Sequence conservation of VMAT2 was computed using the ConSurf server with default parameters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref></sup>.

The workflow depicts the data processing scheme used to reconstruct VMAT2. Two datasets were collected comprising 7,742 and 17,133 micrographs respectively. Movies were corrected for drift using patch motion correction in cryosparc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup> and resultant micrographs were used to estimate defocus and pick particles. Blob picking followed by template picking was utilized to select approximately 5 million particles from each dataset. 2D classification was used to sort particles and the sorted particles were subjected to ab-initio reconstructions to obtain initial reference. Next, all of the particles picks from each dataset were subjected to multiple rounds of heterogeneous classification/refinement with the ab-initio VMAT2 map and two ‘decoy’ classes (yellow, a spherical blob and red, empty detergent micelle) starting with a box size of 128 pixels, followed by subsequent rounds of classification at box size of 256. This resulted in approximately 212k particles after combining both datasets. Particles were then extracted at full box size 384 before Bayesian polishing in Relion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup> and local CTF refinement in Cryosparc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. The resulting 3.5 Å map was then subjected to Cryosparc 3D classification using a transmembrane domain (TMD) mask<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. The final stack of 65k particles was then subjected to local refinement to produce the final unsharpened map. DeepEMhancer was used to locally sharpen the map for interpretation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>.</p>

Binding and coordination of neutral TBZ (<italic>cyan</italic> van der Waals (vdW) representation observed in a 180 ns MD simulation (<italic>run 1</italic>). Three runs were performed for VMAT2 embedded in a lipid bilayer in the presence of TBZ, where E312 and D399 were protonated. We focus here on the time evolution of TBZ coordination, hence the naming of the runs as TBZ_1 run 1, TBZ_1 run 2, and TBZ_1 run 3. Movie S1 displays TBZ_1 run 1.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study presents fundamental new insights into vesicular monoamine transport and the binding pose of the clinical drug tetrabenazine (TBZ) to the mammalian VMAT2 transporter. Specifically, this study reports the first structure for the mammalian VMAT (SLC18) family of vesicular monoamine transporters. It provides insights into the mechanism by which this inhibitor traps VMAT2 into a 'dead-end' conformation. The structure also provides some evidence for a novel gating mechanism within VMAT2, which may have wider implications for understanding the mechanism of transport in the wider SLC18 family.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The structure is high quality, and the method used to determine the structure via fusing mVenus and the anti-GFP nanobody to the amino and carboxyl termini is novel. The binding and transport data are convincing and provide new insights into the role of conserved side chains within the SLC18 members. The binding position of TBZ is of high value, given its role in treating Huntington's chorea and for being a 'dead-end' inhibitor for VMAT2.</p>

<p>As a report of the first structure of VMAT2, indeed the first structure of any vesicular monoamine transporter, this manuscript represents an important milestone in the field of neurotransmitter transport. VMAT2 belongs to a large family (the major facilitator superfamily, MFS) containing transporters from all living species. There is a wealth of information relating to the way that MFS transporters bind substrates, undergo conformational changes to transport them across the membrane and couple these events to the transmembrane movement of ions. VMAT2 couples the movement of protons out of synaptic vesicles to the vesicular uptake of biogenic amines (serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine) from the cytoplasm. The new structure presented in this manuscript can be expected to contribute to an understanding of this proton/amine antiport process.</p>
<p>The structure contains a molecule of the inhibitor TBZ bound in a central cavity, with no access to either luminal or cytoplasmic compartments. The authors carefully analyze which residues interact with bound TBZ and measure TBZ binding to VMAT2 mutated at some of those residues. These measurements allow well-reasoned conclusions about the differences in inhibitor selectivity between VMAT1 and VMAT2 and differences in affinity between TBZ derivatives.</p>
<p>The structure also reveals polar networks within the protein and hydrophobic residues in positions that may allow them to open and close pathways between the central binding site and the cytoplasm or the vesicle lumen. The authors propose involvement of these networks and hydrophobic residues in coupling of transport to proton translocation and conformational changes.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The vesicular monoamine transporter is a key component in neuronal signaling and is implicated in diseases such as Parkinson's. Understanding of monoamine processing and our ability to target that process therapeutically has been to date provided by structural modeling and extensive biochemical studies. However, structural data is required to establish these findings more firmly.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Dalton et al resolved a structure of VMAT2 in the presence of an important inhibitor, tetrabenazine, with the protein in detergent micelles, using cryo-EM and with the aid of protein domains fused to its N- and C-terminal ends, including one fluorescent protein that facilitated protein screening and purification. The resolution of the maps allows clear assignment of the amino acids in the core of the protein. The structure is in good agreement with a wealth of experimental and structural prediction data, and provides important insights into the binding site for tetrabenazine and selectivity relative to analogous compounds. The authors provide additional biochemical analyses that further support their findings. The comparison with AlphaFold models is enlightening.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study presents fundamental new insights into vesicular monoamine transport and the binding pose of the clinical drug tetrabenazine (TBZ) to the mammalian VMAT2 transporter. Specifically, this study reports the first structure for the mammalian VMAT (SLC18) family of vesicular monoamine transporters. It provides insights into the mechanism by which this inhibitor traps VMAT2 into a 'dead-end' conformation. The structure also provides some evidence for a novel gating mechanism within VMAT2, which may have wider implications for understanding the mechanism of transport in the wider SLC18 family.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The structure is high quality, and the method used to determine the structure via fusing mVenus and the anti-GFP nanobody to the amino and carboxyl termini is novel. The binding and transport data are convincing and provide new insights into the role of conserved side chains within the SLC18 members. The binding position of TBZ is of high value, given its role in treating Huntington's chorea and for being a 'dead-end' inhibitor for VMAT2.</p>

<p>This public review is the same review that was posted earlier and has not been updated in response to our comments or to the revised manuscript. Please see our earlier response to these comments. We thank reviewer #2 for their input and we have incorporated many of these suggestions into our revised manuscript. With regard to the question of ‘how TBZ got there’, we have revised this sentence in the discussion to be more speculative. As pointed out earlier, our interpretation of the structure is based on a wealth of experimental and structural data which support our interpretations. Thus, our conclusions have not been overstated. This has been explained in our earlier public response and these key studies have been cited throughout the manuscript. We also note that reviewer #3 found the AlphaFold comparisons to be quite meaningful.</p>

<p>Overview:</p>
<p>As a report of the first structure of VMAT2, indeed the first structure of any vesicular monoamine transporter, this manuscript represents an important milestone in the field of neurotransmitter transport. VMAT2 belongs to a large family (the major facilitator superfamily, MFS) containing transporters from all living species. There is a wealth of information relating to the way that MFS transporters bind substrates, undergo conformational changes to transport them across the membrane and couple these events to the transmembrane movement of ions. VMAT2 couples the movement of protons out of synaptic vesicles to the vesicular uptake of biogenic amines (serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine) from the cytoplasm. The new structure presented in this manuscript can be expected to contribute to an understanding of this proton/amine antiport process.</p>
<p>The structure contains a molecule of the inhibitor TBZ bound in a central cavity, with no access to either luminal or cytoplasmic compartments. The authors carefully analyze which residues interact with bound TBZ and measure TBZ binding to VMAT2 mutated at some of those residues. These measurements allow well-reasoned conclusions about the differences in inhibitor selectivity between VMAT1 and VMAT2 and differences in affinity between TBZ derivatives.</p>
<p>The structure also reveals polar networks within the protein and hydrophobic residues in positions that may allow them to open and close pathways between the central binding site and the cytoplasm or the vesicle lumen. The authors propose involvement of these networks and hydrophobic residues in coupling of transport to proton translocation and conformational changes. However, these proposals are quite speculative in the absence of supporting structures and experimentation that would test specific mechanistic details.</p>
<p>Critique:</p>
<p>Although the structure presented in this MS is clearly important, I feel that the authors have overstated several of the conclusions that can be drawn from it. I don't agree that the structure clearly indicates why TBZ is a non-competitive inhibitor; the proposal that specific hydrophobic residues function as gates will depend on lumen- and cytoplasm-facing structures for verification; the polar networks could have any number of functions - indeed it would be surprising if they were all involved in proton transport. Several of these issues could be resolved by a clearer illustration of the data, but I believe that a more rigorous description of the conclusions and where they fall between firm findings and speculation would help the reader put the results in perspective.</p>
<p>Non-competitive inhibition occurs when the action of an inhibitor can't be overcome by increasing substrate concentration. The structure shows TBZ sequestered in the central cavity with no access to either cytoplasm or lumen. The explanation of competitive vs non-competitive inhibition depends entirely on how TBZ got there. If it bound from the cytoplasm, cytoplasmic substrate should have been able to compete with TBZ and overcome the inhibition. If it bound from the lumen, or from within the bilayer, cytoplasmic substrate would not be able to compete, and inhibition would be non-competitive. The structure does not tell us how TBZ got there, only that it was eventually occluded from both aqueous compartments and the bilayer.</p>
<p>The issue of how VMAT2 opens access to the central binding site from luminal and cytoplasmic sides is an important and interesting one, and comparison with other MFS structures in cytoplasmic-open or extracellular/luminal-open is a very reasonable approach. However, any conclusions for VMAT2 should be clearly indicated as speculative in the absence of comparable open structures of VMAT2. As a matter of presentation, I found the illustrations in ED Fig. 6 to be less helpful than they could have been. Specifically, illustrations that focus on the proposed gates, comparing that region of the new structure with the corresponding region of either VGLUT or GLUT4 would better help the reader to compare the position of the proposed gate residues with the corresponding region of the open structure. I realize that is the intended purpose of ED Fig. 6b and 6c, but currently, those show the entire protein and a focus on the gate regions might make the proposed gate movements clearer. I also appreciate the difference between the Alphafold prediction and the new structure, but I'm not convinced that ED Fig. 6a adds anything helpful.</p>
<p>The polar networks described in the manuscript provide interesting possibilities for interactions with substrates and protons whose binding to VMAT2 must control conformational change. Aside from the description of these networks, there is little evidence presented to assess the role of these networks in transport. Are the networks conserved in other closely related transporters? How could the interaction of the networks with substrate or protons affect conformational change? Of course, any potential role proposed for the networks would be highly speculative at this point, and any discussion of their role should point out their speculative nature and the need for experimental verification. Some speculation, however, can be useful for focusing the field's attention on future directions. However, statements in the abstract (three distinct polar networks... play a role in proton transduction.) and the discussion (...are likely also involved in mediating proton transduction.) should be clearly presented as speculation until they are validated experimentally.</p>
<p>The strongest aspect of this work (aside from the structure itself) is the analysis of TBZ binding. I will comment on some minor points below, but there is one problematic aspect to this analysis. The discussion on how TBZ stabilizes the occluded conformation of VMAT2 is premature without structures of apo-VMAT2 and possibly structures with other ligands bound. We don't really know at this point whether VMAT2 might be in the same occluded conformation in the absence of TBZ. Any statements regarding the effect of interactions between VMAT2 and TBZ depend on demonstrating that TBZ has a conformational effect. The same applies to the discussion of the role of W318 on conformation and to the loops proposed to &quot;occlude the luminal side of the transporter&quot; (line 131).</p>
<p>The description of VMAT2 mechanism makes many assumptions that are based on studies with other MFS transporters. Rather than stating these assumptions as fact (VMAT2 functions by alternating access...), it would be preferable to explain why a reader should believe these assumptions. In general, this discussion presents conclusions as established facts rather than proposals that need to be tested experimentally.</p>
<p>The MD simulations are not described well enough for a general reader. What is the significance of the different runs? ED Fig. 4d is not high enough resolution to see the details.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The vesicular monoamine transporter is a key component in neuronal signaling and is implicated in diseases such as Parkinson's. Understanding of monoamine processing and our ability to target that process therapeutically has been to date provided by structural modeling and extensive biochemical studies. However, structural data is required to establish these findings more firmly.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Dalton et al resolved a structure of VMAT2 in the presence of an important inhibitor, tetrabenazine, with the protein in detergent micelles, using cryo-EM and with the aid of protein domains fused to its N- and C-terminal ends, including one fluorescent protein that facilitated protein screening and purification. The resolution of the maps allows clear assignment of the amino acids in the core of the protein. The structure is in good agreement with a wealth of experimental and structural prediction data, and provides important insights into the binding site for tetrabenazine and selectivity relative to analogous compounds. The authors provide additional biochemical analyses that further support their findings. The comparison with AlphaFold models is enlightening.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors follow up their structures with molecular dynamics simulations of the tetrabenazine-bound state, and test several protonation states of acidic residues in the binding pocket, but not all possible combinations; thus, it is not clear the extent to which tetrabenazine rearrangements observed in these simulations are meaningful. Additional simulations of the substrate dopamine docked into this structure were also carried out, although it is unclear whether this &quot;dead-end&quot; occluded state is a relevant state for dopamine binding. The authors report release of dopamine during these simulations, but it is notable that this only occurs when all four acidic binding site residues were protonated and when an enhanced sampling approach was applied.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As an occluded neurotransmitter bound structure has yet to be solved experimentally, it is not possible to address whether this state resembles the docked dopamine structure. However, it is reasonable to hypothesize that this is a relevant state for dopamine binding and if so, these simulations would be of great interest. The MD simulations which were performed are logical, based on the calculated pKa of the residues and the known pH of the vesicle lumen (5.5). Note that we have carried out a total of more than 2 microseconds of simulations, which required a significant computing time/memory allocation for the current runs in explicit water and membrane. To investigate all possible combinations, it would require at least 16 independent simulations, to be performed in duplicates, to vary protonation status of the four highlighted acidic residues alone, not including proper experimental replicates. We do not believe this to be a feasible suggestion, nor necessary given that the selected combinations were based on rational evaluation of on-path amino acids that were assessed to be potentially protonated.</p>
