<title>Abstract</title><p>Self-sustained recurrent activity in cortical networks is thought to be important for multiple crucial processes, including circuit development and homeostasis. Yet, the precise relationship between the synaptic input patterns and the spiking output of individual neurons remains largely unresolved. Here, we developed, validated and applied a novel in vitro experimental platform and analytical procedures that provide – for individual neurons – simultaneous excitatory and inhibitory synaptic activity estimates during recurrent network activity. Our approach combines whole-network high-density microelectrode array (HD-MEA) recordings from rat neuronal cultures with patch clamping and enables a comprehensive mapping and characterization of active incoming connections to single postsynaptic neurons. We found that, during network states with excitation(E)-inhibition(I) balance, postsynaptic spiking coincided precisely with the maxima of fast fluctuations in the input E/I ratio. These spike-associated E/I ratio escalations were largely due to a rapid bidirectional change in synaptic inhibition that was modulated by the network-activity level. Our approach also uncovered the underlying circuit architecture and we show that individual neurons received a few key inhibitory connections – often from special hub neurons – that were instrumental in controlling postsynaptic spiking. Balanced network theory predicts dynamical regimes governed by small and rapid input fluctuation and featuring a fast neuronal responsiveness. Our findings – obtained in self-organized neuronal cultures – suggest that the emergence of these favorable regimes and associated network architectures is an inherent property of cortical networks in general.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neurons typically receive a continuous bombardment by orchestrated excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs, which ultimately determines postsynaptic spiking. Such a continuous input activation is a basic operational principle of cortical networks that has been observed in awake animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Destexhe et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Steriade et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Timofeev et al. 2001</xref>), up states recorded during slow-wave sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Steriade et al. 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">2001</xref>) and in brain slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Haider and McCormick 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Sanchez-Vives and McCormick 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Shu et al. 2003</xref>), and periods of heightened network activity in cell cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Liu 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Van Pelt et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wagenaar et al. 2006a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">b</xref>). The observed input barrages can be generated – to a large extent or even completely in the in vitro cases – by spontaneous recurrent network activity. Self-maintained network activity is thought to be important for such diverse processes as synaptic homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bartram et al. 2017</xref>), a mediation of circuit refinements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Pan and Monje 2020</xref>) and working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Seamans et al. 2003</xref>), but the circuit properties and dynamics that give rise to and shape spontaneous activity are poorly understood in biological neural networks.</p>
<p>Numerous studies have shown that the excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) inputs received by individual cortical neurons are approximately balanced through local circuit interactions during both evoked and spontaneous network activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Haider and McCormick 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Isaacson and Scanziani 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Liu 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Shu et al. 2003</xref>). The approximate input balance raises the question of precisely which synaptic activation patterns are actually associated with postsynaptic spiking. The answer to this question would provide insights into the dynamical regimes in which networks operate and has, therefore, important implications for network function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ahmadian and Miller 2021</xref>). Theoretical work suggests that balanced networks can potentially assume multiple different dynamical states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Brunel 2000</xref>). When global spiking is asynchronous and neuronal firing is irregular – as often observed in cortical networks during wakefulness – neural networks may operate in a so-called fluctuation-driven regime. In this dynamical state, the mean neuronal membrane potential is just below the action potential threshold and fast input fluctuations yield brief threshold crossings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ahmadian and Miller 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Amit and Brunel 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Brunel 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Van Vreeswijk and Sompolinsky 1996</xref>). Similarly, in regimes with increased input synchronization and oscillatory dynamics (e.g. in the gamma-frequency range), the neuronal membrane potential is predominantly near the action potential threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Buzsáki and Wang 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hasenstaub et al. 2005</xref>). The described subthreshold regimes have favorable properties: Neurons can respond rapidly and precisely to small and brief input changes, and multiple different combinations of E-I conductance changes can control spiking. Contrasting these spiking mechanisms, action potential firing with relatively short and regular inter-spike intervals in response to a prolonged suprathreshold depolarization has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Petersen and Berg 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Renart et al. 2007</xref>). During such mean-driven spiking, the spike timing is controlled by after-hyperpolarization characteristics rather than rapid input changes.</p>
<p>To better understand and characterize the spiking regimes that are implemented in biological neural networks, our goal was to experimentally identify the synaptic events that determine postsynaptic spiking during spontaneous network activity. For such an investigation, information on <italic>i</italic>) the excitatory and <italic>ii</italic>) inhibitory synaptic input conductances in addition to <italic>iii</italic>) the postsynaptic spike times is needed. However, with existing techniques, it is impractical to perform these three measurements in parallel. While the dynamic clamp technique and computational modelling may be used to investigate the modulation of spike timing by artificial synaptic conductances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hasenstaub et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Piwkowska et al. 2008</xref>), these approaches are limited in their ability to recapitulate the full complexity of the activities generated by biological neural networks.</p>
<p>To address the existing methodological shortcomings, we developed a novel experimental approach and analytical tools that provide – in parallel – a reconstruction of the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input activity during a period of recorded postsynaptic spiking (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref></bold>). The result of this reconstruction is a detailed input-output characterization of individual neurons during multiple hours of recurrent network activity. We combined high-density microelectrode array (HD-MEA) recordings with patch clamping and used a cortical cell culture model that generated a rich repertoire of E-I balanced spontaneous recurrent network activity with similarities to cortical up-down state oscillations of deep sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Barral and Reyes 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Haider and McCormick 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Liu 2004</xref>). This in vitro model, by nature, was free of external inputs, permitted control over the network size, and, crucially, allowed for recording of spiking activity from virtually every neuron in the network. We validated this reconstruction approach and, subsequently, applied it to examine the synaptic basis of recurrent spiking – linking circuit activity and architecture.</p>

<p>Schematic of main concept. Long-term whole-network extracellular recordings of neuronal spiking are performed using a high-density microelectrode array (HD-MEA) platform with 26’400 electrodes and 1024 channels for simultaneous readout. Next, the incoming monosynaptic connections to individual postsynaptic cells are identified using a novel regression approach applied to simultaneous HD-MEA and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. Finally, spike trains (<italic>s<sub>i</sub></italic>) of all identified excitatory (<italic>P re<sub>E</sub></italic>) or inhibitory (<italic>P re<sub>I</sub></italic>) presynaptic cells are convolved with their respective postsynaptic-current estimate (<italic>w<sub>i</sub></italic>) to obtain, for several hours, parallel reconstructions of the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input activities. Crucially, postsynaptic spike times are also available during the reconstruction period. The experimental implementation of this approach is shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>.

<title>Reconstructing synaptic input activity during spontaneous network spiking</title>
<p>The key steps to reconstruct the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input activity of an individual postsynaptic neuron, during a period of recorded postsynaptic spiking, are as follows (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref></bold>): <italic>i)</italic> Acquire long-term whole-network extracellular recordings of spontaneous neuronal spiking. <italic>ii)</italic> Identify the incoming monosynaptic connections onto individual postsynaptic cells, and calculate the mean evoked postsynaptic currents for each connection. <italic>iii)</italic> Identify the postsynaptic and presynaptic neurons in the long-term extracellular recording period to obtain parallel spike trains. With the spike trains of the presynaptic cells and the corresponding estimates of the evoked currents, reconstruct the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input activity experienced by the target cell during postsynaptic spiking. In the first part of this study, we will elaborate on how each of these steps was implemented.</p>
<p>Our experimental pipeline is depicted in <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref></bold>. Primary rat cortical neurons were plated on a HD-MEA chip featuring 26’400 electrodes and 1024 channels for simultaneous readout (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref></bold>). Following network maturation, brief sequential recordings – covering together the entire HD-MEA chip – were performed to identify electrodes that detected neuronal activity. Active electrodes were subsequently selected for long-term recording of network-wide spiking. Extracellular data were acquired for at least 3 h (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref></bold>) and spike sorted to identify individual units (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref></bold>). Next, selected cells were patched, and paired HD-MEA and patch-clamp recordings were obtained (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref></bold>). Postsynaptic spikes were recorded in whole-cell current-clamp or cell-attached mode, and using these spike times to generate the spike-triggered average of each HD-MEA electrode trace revealed the extracellular signature of the patched cell (here referred to as the cell or unit ‘footprint’). This footprint was matched to a unit footprint from the spike-sorted long-term recording that preceded the patch-clamp experiment in order to obtain the long-term spike train of the patched cell.</p>

</fig>
<p>In the final experimental step, we performed a second paired HD-MEA and patch-clamp recording to measure excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in whole-cell voltage-clamp mode in addition to recording simultaneously extracellular network spiking (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref></bold>). We used this second paired recording to estimate the average EPSC that was evoked in the patched cell by each of the extracellularly recorded neurons in the network – which enabled us to identify the neurons that were presynaptic to the patched cell. Note that a high-chloride internal patch-clamp solution was used and this shifted the chloride reversal potential. As a consequence of this shift, one voltage-clamp recordings at −70 mV holding potential was sufficient to simultaneously measure postsynaptic currents that were evoked by both glutamatergic (excitatory) and GABAergic (typically inhibitory) connections. Under such conditions, GABAergic cells also evoke net-inward currents (i.e., EPSCs) in the patched cell. We will later introduce a classification procedure for the connection type.</p>

<title>Connectivity inference and EPSC estimation based on paired HD-MEA and patch-clamp recordings</title>
<p>We used the paired HD-MEA and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from individual postsynaptic cells to identify all presynaptically connected neurons and to obtain an EPSC estimate for each incoming connection. Our method assumes that the patch-clamp current trace <italic>I</italic> at time point <italic>t</italic> is a linear superposition of the EPSCs of all neurons in the network:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="523018v2_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>w<sub>i</sub></italic> is the EPSC waveform estimate (or, simply, EPSC) for the <italic>i</italic><sup>th</sup> neuron in the network, and <italic>s<sub>i</sub></italic>(<italic>t</italic>) represents the corresponding (binary) spike train that indicates if neuron <italic>i</italic> spiked at time point <italic>t</italic>. <italic>N<sub>τ</sub></italic> is the number of sample time points of the EPSC estimates. <italic>N<sub>c</sub></italic> is the number of neurons in the network, which is the number of units resulting from spike sorting the HD-MEA data of the respective paired recording. Since we measured both the current trace (<italic>I</italic>) and the spike trains of the units in the network (<italic>s<sub>i</sub></italic>), we can obtain the EPSC waveform estimates (<italic>w<sub>i</sub></italic>) by linear regression. We adapted a previously published solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Pillow et al. 2013</xref>) to this regression problem (see Methods for details), and upon its application to our paired recording data, a large number of synaptic EPSCs with a characteristic fast rising phase and a slow decay was identified (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref></bold>). In <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref></bold>, the monosynaptic connections and <italic>w<sub>i</sub></italic> estimates are shown for one representative postsynaptic neuron. This example postsynaptic cell had 13 incoming connections with varying synaptic strengths and response onset latencies, while the &gt; 100 remaining neurons/units in the network were putatively unconnected, as evident by their relatively flat EPSC estimate (i.e., these neurons did not show a significant evoked current).</p>

</fig>
<p>To assess the EPSC estimation results, we performed reconstructions of the patch-clamp current trace based on the EPSC estimates and corresponding spike trains. The reconstruction was achieved by applying the right term of equation (<xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref>). Two different reconstructions were generated for each of the patched cells (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref></bold>, same example cell as in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). For the first reconstruction (magenta), we used the <italic>w<sub>i</sub></italic> and <italic>s<sub>i</sub></italic> of all neurons/units in the network. For the second reconstruction (green), we only included the presynaptic cells forming a putative connection with the patched neuron. Note the often remarkable matching of measured (black) and reconstructed current traces. The two current-trace reconstructions were often very similar, indicating that the identified monosynaptic connections accounted for most of the observed currents. Some deviations were observed during periods of heightened activity, where especially slow currents played a role (e.g., see bottom-right traces in <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref></bold>). One possibility is that some of the non-EPSC-like waveforms accounted for other small evoked currents, such as currents associated with an activation of extra-synaptic receptors.</p>
<p>Across a total of 14 patched putatively excitatory cells, 142 incoming connections were identified (mean = 10.1 <italic>±</italic> 5.2 SD; min = 3, max = 20 connections per cell). Excellent reconstruction performance was achieved across experiments (median variance explained = 0.65; <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref></bold>) – especially as some deviation were to be expected, e.g., due to transmission failures in the measured trace. Finally, we validated our regression approach by simulation of ground-truth synaptic inputs (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref></bold>; see Methods for details). The simulation results suggested that our approach would only have failed to identify connections with extremely small-amplitude EPSCs and very low presynaptic spike rates.</p>
<p>In <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref></bold>, we described how the unit that corresponds to the patched cell can be identified in the long-term recording of network spiking that preceded the patch-clamp experiments by footprint matching. In a similar manner, we obtained parallel long-term spike trains of the presynaptic neurons that were identified by our regression method.</p>

<p>The usage of a high-chloride internal patch-clamp solution meant that both glutamatergic and GABAergic presynaptic cells evoked EPSCs in the patched cell, and, hence, a way to distinguish between the connection types was required. Here, we performed a connection-type classification by directly assessing if the respective presynaptic neuron had an inhibitory (i.e., suppressing) or excitatory (i.e., facilitating) effect on network-wide neuronal spiking. Using the &gt; 3 h spike trains that were available for the presynaptic neurons, we computed the pairwise cross-correlograms (CCGs) and subsequently extracted the spike-transmission probability (STP) from each CCG (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref></bold>; see Methods for details). The resulting STP measure is expected to be positive for excitatory connections and negative for inhibitory connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Barthó et al. 2004</xref>). For cell-type classification, we computed a STP matrix based on all units that were recorded in parallel (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref></bold>). A unit was then classified as putatively excitatory or inhibitory, if the mean (outgoing) STP value was positive or negative, respectively.</p>

<p>For 10 out of a total of 15 patched cells, the postsynaptic unit could be identified in the long-term HD-MEA recordings (see <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref></bold>); For the remaining 5, there was either no unit template available, or there was no matching unit found. Consistent with our attempt to target pyramidal cells, 9 out of the 10 cells with postsynaptic unit were classified as excitatory (mean STP &gt; 0; mean spike rate = 1.2 Hz <italic>±</italic> 0.5 Hz SD) and only 1 cell was classified as inhibitory (mean STP &lt; 0; spike rate = 9.6 Hz; cell subsequently excluded).</p>
<p>Following the cell-type classification, EPSC estimates could be attributed to an excitatory (‘excEPSC’) or inhibitory (‘inhEPSC’) connection. In line with known synaptic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Campagnola et al. 2021</xref>), the mean excEPSC across experiments exhibited faster kinetics compared to the mean inhEPSC (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref></bold>). In this work, the term ‘EPSC’ refers to both excEPSCs and inhEPSCs. For a better comparison of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic activity, we also converted currents to conductances – separately for excEPSCs and inhEPSCs – based on the respective driving forces for glutamatergic and GABAergic ion channels. Note that this conversion expresses the effective conductance at the soma (the location of the patch-clamp electrode). In the following sections, we used the conductances for direct comparisons between excitatory and inhibitory inputs, and, otherwise, the exc/inhEPSC amplitudes.</p>
<p>Further supporting the validity of the classification approach, we also found striking differences in the extracellular footprint characteristics of the presynaptic neurons classified as excitatory and inhibitory, respectively (<bold><xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref></bold>). Inhibitory cells exhibited a faster action potential propagation and larger footprint size, while excitatory cells had a more distant axonal projection. These footprint results were in agreement with fluorescence images of putative inhibitory and excitatory cells (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref></bold>). The E/I classification concludes the main methodological part of this study.</p>

<title>Spiking of individual neurons is dominantly controlled by a few strong incoming connections</title>
<p>After performing the analytical steps, detailed in the previous sections, we had identified multiple excitatory and inhibitory monosynaptic connections onto individual postsynaptic cells with corresponding estimates of the evoked postsynaptic currents. Moreover, long-term parallel spike trains of presynaptic and postsynaptic spiking activity were available (see <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref></bold>). We exploited these data sets to investigate how synaptic activity relates to postsynaptic spiking. First, we focused on the role of individual monosynaptic connections, and, in particular, we examined the relationship between connection strength (i.e., EPSC amplitude) and the STP of the respective connection (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref></bold>).</p>

The EPSC onset latency relative to the presynaptic spike time was used to set the start time of the STP quantification window (green), thereby providing a more accurate STP estimate.

<p>While STP has been suggested as a proxy for synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">English et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Mizuseki and Buzsáki 2013</xref>), supporting experimental data is actually scarce. In fact, the influence of an individual connection on postsynaptic spiking is, besides connection strength, also strongly determined by the correlation of its activity with the activation of the other incoming connections. Varying input correlations and also variations in intrinsic neuronal properties could cause differences in the connection strength-STP relationship across different postsynaptic cells. To gain a clearer picture of the spike-facilitating or spike-suppressive effects of monosynaptic connections at postsynaptic-cell level, we calculated pairwise spike-time cross-correlations based on the spike trains of the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. As the time delay between presynaptic spike and postsynaptic exc/inhEPSC onset was known for each connection, we could align the STP quantification window to the response onset and, in this way, extract a further optimized STP estimate (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref></bold>). For a comprehensive analysis that accounts for differences across postsynaptic cells, we used linear mixed-effects (LME) modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Yu et al. 2021</xref>), with the postsynaptic cell as a random effect (see Methods for details). This analysis indicated that, indeed, STP increased with increasing (absolute) ex-cEPSC amplitude of excitatory connections (0.011 per 100 pA <italic>±</italic> 0.012 SE, <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup>(1) = 6.4, <italic>P</italic> = 0.012; likelihood ratio test), and that STP decreased with increasing (absolute) inhEPSC amplitude of inhibitory connections (<italic>−</italic>0.031 per 100 pA <italic>±</italic> 0.010 SE, <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup>(1) = 6.8, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0089; likelihood ratio test). These results were consistent with individual linear regression fits, which were separately calculated based on the connection data of each postsynaptic neuron (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref></bold>). The identified approximately linear relationship between STP and connection strength indicated that the degree of input correlation was typically similar across the connections received by individual postsynaptic cells during spontaneous recurrent activity. Two additional observations are worth pointing out. For one, there were considerable differences in regression-line slopes across the different postsynaptic cells, implying that connections of similar strength can have varying, cell-dependent effects on spiking. Furthermore, many of the (relatively weak) excitatory connections, remarkably, exhibited STP values scattered around zero, while inhibitory inputs had generally a more reliable (suppressive) effect on postsynaptic spiking. The results of this section indicate that the spiking of individual neurons was dominantly controlled by a few strong incoming connections, with a particularly important role for inhibitory inputs.</p>

<title>Networks operate in a fine-tuned dynamical regime with neuronal spiking governed by rapid and brief changes in input excitation and inhibition</title>
<p>To elucidate the synaptic basis of postsynaptic spiking during spontaneous recurrent network activity, it is necessary to consider – in parallel – the combined excitatory and combined inhibitory conductances generated by the incoming connections. We reconstructed the synaptic activity experienced by the postsynaptic (patched) cells during the long-term extracellular recording period that preceded the patch-clamp experiments, as depicted in <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref></bold> (see Methods for details). The observed alternations at the network level between periods of sparse spiking and periods of heightened, self-maintained network activity (see <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B/E</xref></bold>) manifested as alternations between low and high conductance states (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref></bold>).

<p>The parallel reconstructions of the <italic>g<sub>e</sub></italic> and <italic>g<sub>i</sub></italic> traces also allowed us to calculate the E/I ratio during spontaneous network activity; here quantified as <italic>E/</italic>(<italic>E</italic> + <italic>I</italic>) (black trace, right, in <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref></bold>). Remarkably, this trace directly revealed brief spikes in the E/I ratio, during which postsynaptic action potentials preferentially occurred. We also assessed the temporal characteristics of the synaptic inputs in more detail (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref></bold>). This analysis revealed, on average, a brief lag between excitation and inhibition and uncovered, particularly for inhibitory inputs, oscillatory dynamics, as observed in cortical and hippocampal networks in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Atallah and Scanziani 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Buzsáki and Wang 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Okun and Lampl 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Salkoff et al. 2015</xref>). Moreover, quantifying the pairwise spike-train synchrony between all presynaptic cells showed a higher synchronization of inhibitory cells compared to excitatory cells, although overall the degree of pairwise neuronal synchrony was only moderate (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>To examine which synaptic events determine postsynaptic spiking, we subsequently generated the spike-triggered average of the inhibitory (<italic>g<sub>i,ST A</sub></italic>) and excitatory input conductance (<italic>g<sub>e,ST A</sub></italic>) for each postsynaptic cell. This analysis showed that both a rapid decrease in inhibition or a rapid increase in excitation could be the primary trigger of action potential firing (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref></bold>). In addition, postsynaptic spiking consistently coincided with a rapid increase in inhibitory input conductance, thereby constraining the window of opportunity for spike generation. The STA conductances could also be calculated separately for each incoming connection, which revealed a large spectrum of input-specific conductance profiles associated with postsynaptic spiking (<bold><xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref></bold>). The fact that spike timing was often precisely controlled by rapid changes in synaptic input conductances was also reflected in the E/I ratio of the average conductances (black traces in <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref></bold>). For 7 out of 9 postsynaptic neurons, we found a fast increase in the input <italic>E/</italic>(<italic>E</italic> + <italic>I</italic>)<italic><sub>ST A</sub></italic> before postsynaptic spiking (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref></bold>). These findings strongly suggest that the networks and neurons operated, at least partially, in a dynamical regime governed by rapid input changes. A quantification of the contributions of excitation and inhibition to the fast <italic>E/</italic>(<italic>E</italic> + <italic>I</italic>)<italic><sub>ST A</sub></italic> increases (from 30%-70% of the peak amplitude) further showed that, across recordings, both an increase in excitation and a decrease in inhibition contributed significantly (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref></bold>). For 5 out of 7 cells, the contribution of a reduced inhibition exceeded an increase in excitation (however, no significant difference in the contributions was found). Finally, we uncovered the temporal relationship between the input <italic>E/</italic>(<italic>E</italic> + <italic>I</italic>)<italic><sub>ST A</sub></italic> and the intracellular action potential waveform. To this end, we conducted additional paired HD-MEA and IC patch-clamp recordings during spontaneous spiking of the patched cell, which allowed for extracting the temporal relationship between extracellular spike times, as determined by our spike-sorting procedure, and the intracellularly recorded action potential (<bold><xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref></bold>). Subsequently, we could align the mean E/I ratio change from <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref> to the intracellular action potential waveform (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref></bold>). The aligned mean input-output data showed that the peak of the rapid E/I ratio increase coincided precisely with the action potential trigger time point. This observation suggested a fine-tuned network organization, presumably with an important role for feed-forward inhibition.</p>

<title>Coordination of postsynaptic spiking by inhibitory inputs is sharpened during high-activity states</title>
<p>Different network-activity levels presumably provide distinct means for the coordination of neuronal activity, with potential implications for the synaptic mechanisms of spiking. We, therefore, examined if the network state would influence the mean input conductances that were associated with postsynaptic spiking, and we focused on the dominant changes in inhibitory inputs (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref></bold>). Specifically, we calculated the spike-triggered average conductances separately based on postsynaptic spike times that occurred either during high or low input conductance states (high g state, when <italic>g<sub>i</sub></italic> &gt; 3 <italic>×</italic> s.d. of <italic>g<sub>i</sub></italic> trace, otherwise low <italic>g</italic> state; high g periods corresponded to high-activity events, such as the one depicted in <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref></bold>, right). Both low and high <italic>g<sub>i,ST A</sub></italic> traces exhibited the characteristic bidirectional shape with a reduction in inhibition before the postsynaptic action potential, followed by a rapid increase in conductance (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A/B</xref></bold>). However, when comparing the temporal <italic>g<sub>i,ST A</sub></italic> trace characteristics, it became apparent that the high <italic>g<sub>i,ST A</sub></italic> conductance changes occurred considerably faster (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref></bold>), which also manifested as sharpened <italic>E/</italic>(<italic>E</italic> + <italic>I</italic>)<italic><sub>ST A</sub></italic> peaks associated with high g states (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref></bold>). These results, likely a consequence of the temporal coordination of inhibitory cells, suggest an increase in the precision of postsynaptic spike timing during the neuronal high-conductance states associated with heightened network-activity levels.</p>

<p>A fundamental aspect of neural network organization is the fact that the distributions of network properties are often best characterized by a log-normal function, which has been linked to optimal information storage and processing principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barbour et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Buzsáki and Mizuseki 2014</xref>). First, we tested if the methods developed in the previous sections could reveal similar organizational principles in our neuronal culture model. We pooled the connection data from all recordings; and indeed, the distributions of all properties, with the exception of inhibitory onset latency, were well described by a log-normal distribution (left panels in <bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B-D</xref></bold>). Moreover, all properties showed significant differences between excitatory and inhibitory connections. Consistent with typical in vivo findings, inhibitory cells displayed higher spike rates and conductances and lower onset latencies compared to excitatory cells, indicative of a relatively strong and fast action of inhibition. The fast inhibition (i.e., small onset latencies) was likely the result of both a relatively local inhibitory innervation and a fast axonal action potential propagation (<bold><xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>How are the properties of incoming connections organized from the perspective of individual postsynaptic cells? Are distributions skewed, as observed at the network level, or more homogeneous? Even though the nature of these property distributions would provide important insights into neural functioning, experimental single-cell data and corresponding characterizations are scarce. Next, we therefore used our data sets to calculate the skewness <italic>s</italic>, for each postsynaptic cell and each incoming connection property (right panels in <bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B-D</xref></bold>). Synaptic strength and spike rate were typically associated with a positively skewed distribution at the single (postsynaptic)-cell level. These results suggested that individual neurons were particularly strongly influenced by a few key inputs, while the majority of incoming connections played – individually – a relatively small role.</p>
<p>Finally, we examined – at the level of individual postsynaptic cells – the relationships between connection strength (i.e., absolute EPSC amplitude) and either the EPSC onset latency or the presynaptic spike rate. Uncovering these relationships may provide indications of the regulatory processes of synaptic strength that were implemented by the networks. We fitted individual linear regression lines for each postsynaptic cell (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E/F</xref></bold>) and performed a comprehensive analysis across cells using linear mixed-effects (LME) modeling. We found that for most postsynaptic cells, the strength of incoming inhibitory connections decreased with increasing onset latency, and the relationship was well characterized by linear regression fits (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref></bold>; according to LME model: −14.2 pA <italic>±</italic> 2.8 SE per ms, <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup>(1) = 13.1, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; likelihood ratio test). This result provided further evidence that individual postsynaptic cells were dominated by strong local inhibition. Furthermore, the strength of excitatory connections decreased with increasing presynaptic spike rate, and the relationship was well described by an exponential decay (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F</xref></bold>; amplitude values were linearized by log-transformation; according to LME model: −8.4 % <italic>±</italic> 3.2 SE decrease in amplitude per Hz, <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup>(1) = 4.8, <italic>P</italic> = 0.029). This finding indicates a homeostatic synaptic plasticity mechanism so as to achieve a downregulation of synaptic strength for connections that were particularly active.</p>

<title>A few key inhibitory hub cells with high spike rates, strong synapses and fast action potential propagation dominate the network</title>
<p>The results of the previous sections showed that individual neurons were particularly strongly influenced by a few connections with strong synapses (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref></bold>), which translated to strong effects on postsynaptic spiking (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref></bold>). Did the presynaptic neurons that provided these important inputs exhibit characteristic properties or were these inputs of random neuronal origin? To answer this question, we characterized the organizational principles concerning outgoing connections (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref></bold>). We focused on a network, in which multiple paired HD-MEA and patch-clamp recordings were sequentially obtained from different postsynaptic cells (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref></bold>). Following the identification of incoming connections for each paired recording using our regression approach, we found that the same presynaptic cell formed often connections with multiple postsynaptic (patched) cells (see matching footprints in top inset in <bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref></bold>). There was a variety of different outdegrees, with relatively few highly connected presynaptic cells (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B</xref></bold>). Individual presynaptic cells evoked EP-SCs with drastically varying amplitudes in different postsynaptic cells (bottom inset in <bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref></bold>), and the distribution of outgoing connection amplitudes was typically positively skewed (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9C</xref></bold>). Next, we asked whether there was a relationship between the degree of outgoing connectivity and other neuronal properties that determine the cell’s influence on the network. Indeed, for inhibitory – but not excitatory – cells, the spike rate of a neuron correlated with its outdegree (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9D</xref></bold>). Furthermore, the sum of outgoing inhEPSC amplitudes of individual inhibitory cells increased rapidly with the outdegree, while for excitatory cells this increase was slower (left in <bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9E</xref></bold>). To examine if the degree of outgoing connectivity influences the mean connection strength, we first calculated the mean postsynaptic EPSC waveform <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="523018v2_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> for each presynaptic cell.

Finally, the action-potential propagation velocity of inhibitory cells (see Methods for details) also increased with the outdegree (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9F</xref></bold>). In summary, a few key inhibitory cells were in a unique position to coordinate network activity by exerting fast and strong effects through an extensive network of outgoing connections.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We examined the synaptic mechanisms that determine postsynaptic spike timing during spontaneous recurrent network activity – linking functional and organizational circuit characteristics. These investigations were made possible through several methodological innovations including a comprehensive synaptic input mapping in conjunction with long-term extracellular whole-network recordings, which allowed for reconstructing synaptic activity during a period of postsynaptic spiking. For the input-mapping approach, based on simultaneous HD-MEA and patch-clamp recordings, we developed and validated a regression procedure that inferred a large proportion of the (current-evoking) monosynaptic connections onto individual postsynap-tic cells. Compared to even the most advanced multi-channel patch-clamp platforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Campagnola et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Peng et al. 2019</xref>), our approach exceeded the number of testable incoming connections by an order of magnitude.</p>
<p>During sensory stimulation and spontaneous network activity, neurons typically experience a proportional or ‘balanced’ change in excitatory and inhibitory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Haider and McCormick 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Isaacson and Scanziani 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Liu 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Shu et al. 2003</xref>). Theory suggests that multiple dynamical regimes could yield this balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Brunel 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Renart et al. 2007</xref>), and understanding the nature of the implemented regime is crucial for gaining a better understanding of cortical function in general. Theoretical and computational modelling studies further indicate that, during the balanced state, rapid membrane potential fluctuations could be the primary spike trigger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ahmadian and Miller 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Amit and Brunel 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Brunel 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Van Vreeswijk and Sompolinsky 1996</xref>). These studies typically assume randomly connected networks with asynchronous irregular firing. It remains to be seen to what extent these findings hold true in biological networks with structured connectivity and – as often seen during spontaneous cortical activity – more synchronous spiking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ahmadian and Miller 2021</xref>). In addition, other dynamical regimes have been described, including spiking driven by the mean input rather than rapid input fluctuations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Petersen and Berg 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Renart et al. 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we directly tested in biological neural networks if postsynaptic spiking was associated with rapid changes in synaptic inputs. First, we showed that, for individual postsynaptic cells, the strength of excitatory and inhibitory connections correlated with the degree of postsynaptic-spike transmission and suppression, respectively. However, many of the spike-time cross-correlograms associated with excitatory connections did not show clear peaks of excess spiking, which may indicate that these inputs provided more of a ‘basal excitatory tone’ and, hence, did not consistently influence postsynaptic spike timing. On the other hand, the spike-suppressive effect of inhibitory inputs was found to be generally reliable. In line with these results, the reconstruction of synaptic input conductances revealed that postsynaptic spiking often coincided with the peak of E/I ratio fluctuations. These changes in E/I ratio were – depending on the postsynaptic cell – primarily due to either an increase in excitation or decrease in inhibition, while the decrease in inhibition outweighed the increase in excitation in most cells. The observed ability to respond to different combinations of conductance changes is consistent with reports of dynamic-clamp experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Piwkowska et al. 2008</xref>). We also showed that a rapid increase in inhibition typically restricts the spiking window and that the temporal characteristics of inhibition around the postsynaptic spike time is sharpened during periods of heightened network activity. The latter observation could be the result of an increased synchronization of inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Buzsáki and Wang 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Destexhe et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hasenstaub et al. 2005</xref>). In summary, we found that the studied biological networks were equipped with several mechanisms that allowed them to operate, at least partially, in a precise dynamical regime governed by rapid input changes. Interestingly, cortical neurons in vivo typically receive – in response to diverse sensory stimuli – stereotypical excitation-inhibition sequences and, in this scenario, the excitatory inputs presumably determine the initial timing of the depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Monier et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Okun and Lampl 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Wehr and Zador 2003</xref>). To consolidate these findings with the observed role for inhibition in controlling spike timing, it is conceivable that there are two main modes of neuronal spiking: external inputs trigger a depolarization due to an increase in excitation, while spontaneous spiking (e.g., associated with slow-wave sleep or neuronal cell-culture activity) is predominantly driven by local recurrent activity and, in particular, by a reduction in inhibition. It is an intriguing question to ask what the implications of these different spiking modes would be (e.g., for spike-timing dependent plasticity).</p>
<p>Finally, we investigated the circuit architecture that supported the observed spiking regime. Highly connected hub neurons are believed to be important for the coordination of network activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bonifazi et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cossart 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gal et al. 2021</xref>), but electrophysiological characterizations of their connections are scarce. Here, we also identified a minority of cells with high connection outdegrees. Moreover, we found that inhibitory cells that were highly connected were also fast-spiking and featured relatively strong synapses and fast action potential propagation velocities. In addition, when we examined the incoming connections onto individual postsynaptic cells, we found that connection strength and presynaptic spike rate followed approximately a log-normal distribution, implying that a few incoming connections were particularly dominant. Combining these findings on the organization of incoming and outgoing connections with our functional data, a picture emerges in which network-wide neuronal spiking is effectively coordinated by a few key inhibitory hub neurons with windows of spiking opportunity provided by a brief reduction in their postsynaptic effects.</p>
<p>The findings presented in this work provide a detailed characterization of a dynamical regime that is in line with theoretical predictions for neural networks in vivo. Our results were obtained in a cortical cell culture model and we, therefore, propose that a self-organization towards a dynamical regime governed by rapid input changes is an inherent property of cortical networks.</p>

<p>To select the HD-MEA electrodes for long-term recordings, all 26’400 electrodes were initially briefly scanned for activity (1 min per electrode).

To obtain long-term recordings of network spiking, we sequentially recorded from the electrode sets for 15 min each and repeated this every 1 h for a total recording time of at least 3 h for each electrode set.</p>

<title>Patch-clamp electrophysiology</title>
<p>For simultaneous patch-clamp and HD-MEA recordings, cultures were transferred immediately after the long-term network recording period from the incubator to a patch-clamp setup with integrated HD-MEA recording unit. From the the electrode sets that were used for long-term recordings, we then typically selected the electrode set covering the largest chip area with an even cell distribution and targeted pyramidal-shaped neurons towards the center of the electrode set for patching. The patch-clamp setup comprised a MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Axon Instruments) and an Axon Digidata 1440A (Axon Instruments). Data were low-pass filtered at 5 kHz and sampled at 20 kHz, with data acquisition controlled by the sofware WinWCP. Synchronization pulses were generated via the Digidata unit and fed into the HD-MEA system for post-recording data alignment. Cells were perfused with BrainPhys<sup>TM</sup> Neuronal Medium (Stem Cell Technologies) heated to approximately 32-34°C. Cell-attached and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in voltage-clamp mode were obtained with standard borosilicate glass micropipettes (4–5 MΩ) containing the following internal solution (in mM): 85 caesium-gluconate, 60 CsCl, 10 Hepes, 4 Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, 0.3 GTP, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 EGTA, (pH 7.2-7.3; 280–290 mOsmol/l). Alexa Fluor 594 (20 <italic>µ</italic>M) (Sigma-Aldrich) was added for cell morphology assessment. The holding potential was set to −70 mV (without liquid-junction potential [LJP] correction). Only cells with a series resistance smaller than 25 MΩ were included in our study. We chose an internal solution with a relatively high chloride concentration, which causes a polarity reversal of GABA-A receptor-associated currents due to a more positive reversal potential (similar to early developmental periods). This approach allowed us to simultaneously record postsynaptic currents evoked by both GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses. We calculated the chloride reversal potential to be approximately −20 mV using the Nernst equation. Therefore, we used driving forces of 60 mV (inhibition) and 80 mV (excitation) to convert the synaptic currents to conductances according to Ohm’s law (with a −10 mV LJP correction). The fact that both GABAergic and glutamatergic presynaptic neurons evoked EPSCs in the patched cells meant that a way to distinguish between the connection types was required. Typical excitatory-inhibitory classification strategies for 3D tissue, based on unit extracellular signatures and spiking behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Barthó et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Csicsvari et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Senzai and Buzsáki 2017</xref>), appear to be not always sufficient for 2D preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Weir et al. 2015</xref>). We, therefore, performed a connection-type classification by assessing if a given neuron’s activity is typically associated with spike transmission or suppression.</p>
<p>For paired IC patch-clamp and HD-MEA recordings to examine the relationship between extracellular and intracellular action potentials and for dye loading to image neurites at high-resolution, the following internal solution was used (in mM): 110 potassium-gluconate, 10 KCl, 10 Hepes, 4 MgATP, 0.3 GTP, 10 phosphocreatine, (pH 7.2-7.3; 280–290 mOsmol/l).

<title>Processing of extracellular data</title>
<p>The extracellular data from the long-term recording period and from the paired HD-MEA and whole-cell patch-clamp recording were spike sorted with SpyKING Circus (version=0.8.4; parameters: spatial radius considered=210 <italic>µ</italic>m, width of templates=3 ms, spike threshold=6, cut-off frequencies for band-pass Butter-worth filter=300 Hz/9500 Hz). For long-term data, the 15 min recording chunks from each electrode set were concatenated (yielding a total recording time of at least 3 h) and separately spike sorted. The HD-MEA data of the paired recordings for synaptic input estimation, were separately spike sorted, followed by manual curation with the SpyKING Circus curation interface (using template similarity and spike time cross-correlogram characteristics as merging criteria). This procedure typically yielded clean units, based on which the synaptic input waveform estimation was performed. It was a robust approach, because even if some noise units with random spiking were retained, these units would likely be removed as there was no correlated postsynaptic activity. Moreover, if – in rare cases – two units had not been correctly merged, this would be revealed by input waveform estimates with very similar characteristics. Finally, the (presynaptic) units that were found to form a connections to the patched cell and the postsynaptic unit had to be identified in the long-term recording data. The HD-MEA footprint of the postsynaptic cell was generated by spike-triggered averaging (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). For each of the presynaptic footprints and the postsynaptic footprint, we identified the corresponding best-matching footprints in the spike sorted long-term recording data (by using the maximum of the normalized cross-correlation between footprints). For almost all footprints, a clear match was found, and the unit was curated as above; only for very few individual footprints there was no match, and the respective connection was then excluded. An additional indication of the quality and validity of the spike sorting and footprint-matching procedures is given by the paired HD-MEA and IC whole-cell patch-clamp experiments (see <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>). The extracellularly detected spike times of the identified postsynaptic unit matched the intracellularly recorded action potentials well, which held even true for high-activity periods with some variations in action-potential shapes.</p>

<title>Regression approach for the estimation of synaptic input waveforms based on paired HD-MEA and patch-clamp recordings</title>
<p>We estimated synaptic input waveforms (e.g., EPSCs) by least squares linear regression of the whole-cell patch-clamp trace on simultaneously recorded unit spike trains according to <xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">equation 1</xref> (see results section). Before running this estimation procedure, a preprocessing step to detrend the patch-clamp trace was applied. This was necessary as slow fluctuations appear as baseline shifts when short windows of the length of a single EPSC are concerned. These baseline shifts hinder the proper estimation of the waveforms. Briefly, the patch-clamp current trace was first down-sampled to 5 kHz and subsequently detrended. Detrending involved two steps. In the first step, very slow fluctuations in the current trace were determined using a sampling stride of 100 and applying a 20k-order median filter. The filtered trace captured very slow baseline drifts and was subsequently subtracted from the current trace. We call the modified current trace after this first detrending step <italic>S<sub>det</sub></italic><sub>1</sub>. For the second detrending step, periods of high synaptic activity in <italic>S<sub>det</sub></italic><sub>1</sub> were first detected (current deviations &gt; 3 <italic>×</italic> s.d. of <italic>S<sub>det</sub></italic><sub>1</sub>) and replaced by the median value of the entire <italic>S<sub>det</sub></italic><sub>1</sub> trace. The remaining slow fluctuations were then determined by applying a 3k-order median filter to this modified <italic>S<sub>det</sub></italic><sub>1</sub> trace. The resulting baseline trace was subtracted from <italic>S<sub>det</sub></italic><sub>1</sub>, which yielded the fully detrended current trace. The advantage of this two-step detrending procedure is that slow baseline fluctuations can be determined, even though the current trace features periods of high synaptic activity (e.g., due to network bursting). The prepossessing steps were applied to all VC whole-cell current traces shown here.</p>
<p>To verify that the preprocessing modifications to the current trace did not introduce major alterations in the EPSC waveform estimates, we developed an alternative approach for EPSC estimation based on spike-triggered averaging (STA) of isolated events (see <bold><xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref></bold> and methods section below). The STA method identified drastically fewer connections, but did not require a modification of the current trace. The EPSC estimates of connections that were identified by both the regression and STA method matched well (<bold><xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6C</xref></bold>), suggesting that the effects of the preprocessing steps on waveform estimation were negligible.</p>
<p>A decisive advantage of our regression approach is that overlapping postsynaptic responses can be included in the EPSC waveform estimation. However, there are potential reasons (e.g., computational costs and non-linear interactions) to not include the most active periods of network spiking, which are associated with large postsynaptic currents. We evaluated the effect of different current thresholds, that determined which parts of the patch-clamp recordings were included in the regression analysis, and found 30 <italic>×</italic> s.d. of the current trace to be a good compromise, which was therefore used for all recordings (<bold><xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>In the final step to estimate EPSCs, the spike trains of all units in the network with at least 10 spikes were encoded in a sparse binary u-by-t matrix (u: number of units; t: number of sampling points in the down-sampled current trace). Based on this spike time matrix and the preprocessed patch-clamp current trace, synaptic input waveforms were estimated with the <italic>estimWaveforms</italic> function of <italic>Pillow et al. 2013</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/pillowlab/BinaryPursuitSpikeSorting">https://github.com/pillowlab/BinaryPursuitSpikeSorting</ext-link>). The waveform estimates included a 50 ms baseline period before the presynaptic spike occurred. Units were accepted to form a monosynaptic connection with the patched cell when the absolute EPSC amplitude &gt; 10 <italic>×</italic> s.d. of the baseline. Virtually all of these waveforms exhibited a typical EPSC shape (fast rising and slow decay phase; very few individual traces that clearly deviated from this shape were removed).</p>
<p>We chose here voltage-clamp recordings of synaptic currents as the basis for the synaptic input estimation in order to minimize effects of non-linear interactions and due to the fast EPSC kinetics. The input estimation, however, can also be performed based on current-clamp recordings of postsynaptic potentials (<bold><xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8</xref></bold>). For the estimation of EPSP waveforms, the procedure was the same as for EPSCs estimation except that only the first detrending step was performed (due to the relatively slow kinetics of synaptic potentials). Moreover, all recording periods with a voltage deviation up to 20 mV from baseline were included in the regression analysis, which excluded periods with postsynaptic action potential firing and strong synaptic activity.</p>

<p>To simulate ground-truth synaptic inputs, we generated artificial presynaptic spike trains and accordingly added a defined EPSC waveform to our measured patch-clamp current traces. The defined EPSC was the mean waveform of the (onset-aligned) EPSCs from all monosynaptic connections that were identified for the given postsynaptic (patched) cell. The entire EPSC waveform was scaled to achieve a desired EPSC amplitude. The EPSC estimation performance is likely to be influenced by the time periods (e.g., periods of heightened vs. low network activity) during which the EPSCs occurred. Therefore, trains of simulated presynaptic spike times were generated in a semi-random manner as follows: First, for each paired HD-MEA and patch-clamp recording, the measured spike times from all units in the network were combined and binned (100 ms bin size). Each bin count was then divided by the total number of network-wide spikes, resulting in probabilities that a spike occurred in the respective bin. For each simulation of a spike time, one of these bins would then be semi-randomly selected according to the respective probabilities determined in the previous step. The precise simulated spike time was then a random time point within the selected bin. This procedure ensured that simulated spike trains followed the general profile of network-wide spiking activity.</p>
<p>For each paired HD-MEA and patch-clamp recording with artificially added ground-truth synaptic input, EPSCs were again estimated with our regression approach. The error between ground-truth EPSC and EPSC estimate was quantified as the mean deviation in percent. Specifically, ground-truth EPSC and EPSC estimate were first normalized by the respective amplitude of the simulated ground-truth EPSC. The mean deviation between these two waveforms within a 30 ms window starting at ground-truth EPSC onset specified the error. The mean error across all experiments (n=14) was eventually calculated for each parameter combination (number of simulated synaptic events and amplitude of simulated EPSC).</p>
<p>The <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> score was calculated as follows:
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="523018v2_eqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
The number of true positives (TP) and false negatives (FN) was the number of accepted and excluded ground-truth connections, respectively (see previous section regarding acceptance criteria). To calculate the number of false positives (FP), we proceeded as follows: we added again artificial units with simulated spike times to all our paired HD-MEA and patch-clamp recordings as before, but this time simulated EPSCs were not added to the patch trace. The artificial unit had therefore no correlated activity in the patch trace. If the EPSC estimate of this simulated unit was nevertheless accepted by our regression approach, then it was counted as a false positive. The mean <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> score across all experiments was eventually calculated for each parameter combination.</p>
<p>With increasing EPSC amplitude and increasing number of synaptic events, the error between ground-truth and EPSC estimate quickly became marginal, and the F1 score reached values near its optimum of 1 (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref> in results section). In purely experimental data, the number of synaptic events is dependent on the recording duration and the presynaptic spike rates. Our data set of paired recordings had a mean recording duration of 11.7 min <italic>±</italic> 7.0 min SD, which – together with our simulation results – suggested that our approach would only have failed to identify connections with extremely small-amplitude EPSCs and very low presynaptic spike rates.</p>

<title>STA approach for the estimation of synaptic input waveforms</title>
<p>Our alternative approach to estimate synaptic input waveforms, based on paired HD-MEA and patch-clamp recordings, relied on spike-triggered averaging of the patch-clamp current trace using only isolated presynaptic spikes (and the corresponding postsynaptic responses). By ‘isolated’ we mean presynaptic spike times around which (20 ms before, 10 ms after) none of the other potentially connected units spiked. To obtain a sufficient number of events (<italic>≥</italic> 5) for averaging, unconnected units had to be identified and removed first: we iteratively calculated the STA EPSC for each unit (initially tolerating 256/128 spikes in the before/after window and then successively halving the number) and then removed the units that were within the spike tolerance when the absolute EPSC peak amplitude (<italic>Amp<sub>E</sub></italic>) was smaller than 3 <italic>×</italic> s.d. of the pre-spike baseline and smaller than 5 pA. We repeated this procedure until no more units could be removed. Finally, STA EPSCs were calculated using only the isolated events. The remaining units were accepted as being connected to the patched cell when <italic>Amp<sub>E</sub> ≥</italic> 3 <italic>×</italic> s.d. of the baseline and <italic>Amp<sub>E</sub> ≥</italic> 5 <italic>pA</italic>.</p>

<title>Reconstruction of synaptic conductance traces</title>
<p>In the main text, we described how the measured whole-cell current trace of the paired patch-clamp and HD-MEA and recording was reconstructed based on the EPSC estimates and corresponding presynaptic unit spike trains by applying the right term of <xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">equation 1</xref>. We can reconstruct the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances experienced by a postsynaptic cell during the long-term HD-MEA recording of network-wide spiking – which preceded the patch-clamp experiments – in a similar way:

<title>Selection of high-conductance events</title>

<title>Spike-transmission probability</title>
<p>The spike-transmission probability (STP) between two cells was always based on the long-term unit spike trains (&gt; 3 h). For STP estimation, the cross-correlation between the spike trains of the two cells was calculated first (0.5 ms binning). The slow CCG ‘baseline’ was determined by convolving the CCG with a partially hollow Gaussian kernel (standard deviaton=10 ms, hollow fraction=60%), as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">English et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Stark and Abeles 2009</xref>). Subsequently, this baseline was subtracted from the CCG. The baseline-subtracted CCG was then normalized with respect to the number of presynaptic spikes, and the STP estimate was the sum of bins during a certain window of positive lags. When the STP was extracted for the purpose of cell-type classification, a 4 ms window starting at the 1.5 ms positive lag was used. To analyze the relationship between STP and connection strength, the exc/inhEPSC onset latency was used to determine the initial offset of the quantification window. Specifically, to account for differences in the response characteristics, a 4 ms window starting 0.5 ms before excEPSC onset latency was used for excitatory connections, and a 10 ms window starting 1 ms after the inhEPSC onset latency was used for inhibitory connections.</p>

<title>Single-cell level data analysis of incoming connection properties</title>
<p>Several monosynaptic connection properties were determined. The spike rate of the presynaptic unit was the mean of the long-term recording period. The amplitude of the EPSC waveform estimate is the absolute difference between the EPSC peak and the waveform baseline. The EPSC onset latency was defined as the time difference between the time point at which the EPSC waveform reached a value below −5 <italic>×</italic> s.d. of the baseline and the presynaptic spike time.</p>

<title>Extracellular unit footprint analysis</title>
<p>To characterize the extracellular electrical unit footprint of a neuron, i.e., the distribution of extracellular electrical potentials across the array electrodes, we generated the spike-triggered average for each of the simultaneously recorded traces (up to 1024; filtered at 0.3–9.5 kHz; spike cutout before/after was 5/10 ms) using the last 1500 spikes of the unit spike train from the long-term HD-MEA recording period. Such a number of spikes was recorded even from the neurons featuring the lowest spike rates. For each average electrode trace, we tested for negative peaks: we detected the first time point (<italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub>), after spike time, at which the trace reached &lt; −4 <italic>×</italic> s.d. of the trace baseline (first 2.5 ms); the peak was then the minimum value between <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub>+1 ms. Occasionally, especially for some excitatory cells, there were multiple negative peaks in the average electrode trace; possibly because the axonal signal was followed by the extracellular signal of an excited postsynaptic unit, or because the electrode recorded from multiple axonal branches. Our peak detection procedure ensured that only the first extracellular signal peak was used. An electrode trace was excluded if no peak was detected, and if there was no directly adjacent electrode with a detected signal. The signal latency was defined as the time difference between the signal peak of the respective electrode trace and the peak of the electrode trace with the largest (absolute) amplitude within the footprint, which typically was near the axon initial segment (AIS) and soma of the neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bakkum et al. 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>AP propagation velocity was quantified based on the unit footprint as follows: for each electrode trace, we calculated the AP velocity at the given electrode position using the respective AP signal latency and using the distance – assuming a straight line – between the respective electrode and the cell soma (approximated by the electrode with the largest signal). We used the mean of these individual AP velocity measures to approximate the AP velocity of the neuron. Note that this AP velocity measure will be slightly larger than the true AP velocity, since we assume a straight axonal path between electrode and soma, while the true path will likely deviate from a line. Given this notion, our measure can be interpreted as capturing both AP propagation and how direct the axonal path is.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>Analyses are based on data from 142 identified connections of 14 patched (excitatory) cells (1 inhibitory cell was excluded) from 5 culture preparations and animals. Statistical analyses were performed in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">R Core Team 2021</xref>) and MATLAB (MathWorks). Non-parametric, two-tailed tests were conducted using the Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon signed rank test. Normality was assessed with a Shapiro-Wilk test. Correlations were examined using Pearson’s R. The alpha level to determine significance was adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Holm correction when appropriate. No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes. To probe the relationship of connection properties from the perspective of individual postsynaptic cells, we performed linear mixed-effects modeling using the R package <italic>lme4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bates et al. 2015</xref>). Models contained spike rate and onset latency as as fixed effects with random slopes and intercepts, while postsynaptic cell ID was the random effect. A similar analysis was performed to examine the STP - EPSC amplitude relationship. Significance was assessed using a likelihood ratio test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Yu et al. 2021</xref>).</p>

<p>The spike-triggered-average conductance, <italic>g<sub>e/i,ST A</sub></italic>, was calculated separately for the conductance trace of each incoming connection to an example postsynaptic cell (9 inhibitory and 11 excitatory inputs). There appeared to be a few key inputs that had a particularly strong role in controlling postsynaptic spiking. Moreover, there was a subset of excitatory inputs with a sharp increase in conductance near postsynaptic spiking, while others only contributed through slow conductance changes. Interestingly, postsynaptic spiking typically occurred during the early rising phase of the rapid increases in excitatory conductance. As expected, the contribution of each connection to the total STA conductance depended on the respective synaptic strength and presynaptic spike rate: the mean <italic>g<sub>e/i,ST A</sub></italic> (from −2 s to +2 s) for each input correlated well with the respective product of input amplitude and presynaptic spike rate, for both excitation (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.77; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; n = 11) and inhibition (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.96; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; n = 9).</p></caption>

Moreover, the current threshold values were well above the maximum EPSC amplitudes as confirmed in (D). We chose a threshold of 30 s.d. of the current trace, which resulted in a median current threshold of approximately 200 pA, with sufficient distance to the maximum EPSC amplitude, while also keeping computational costs within a feasible range.</p></caption>

<p>In this study the authors develop methods to interrogate cultured neuronal networks to learn about the contributions of multiple simultaneously active input neurons to postsynaptic activity. They then use these methods to ask how excitatory and inhibitory inputs combine to result in postsynaptic neuronal firing in a network context.</p>
<p>The study uses a compelling combination of high-density multi-electrode array recordings with patch recordings. They make ingenious use of physiology tricks such as shifting the reversal potential of inhibitory inputs, and identifying inhibitory vs. excitatory neurons through their influence on other neurons, to tease apart the key parameters of synaptic connections. The method doesn't have complete coverage of all neurons in the culture, and it appears to work on rather low-density cultures so the size of the networks in the current study is in the low tens.</p>
<p>1. It would be valuable to see the caveats associated with the small size of the networks examined here.</p>
<p>
2. It would be also helpful if there were a section to discuss how this approach might scale up, and how better network coverage might be achieved.</p>
<p>The authors obtain a number of findings on the conditions in which the dynamics of excitatory and inhibitory inputs permit spiking, and the statistics of connectivity that result in this. This is of considerable interest, and clearly one would like to see how these findings map to larger networks, to non-cortical networks, and ideally to networks in-vivo. The suite of approaches discussed here could potentially serve as a basis for such further development.</p>
<p>3. It would be useful for the authors to suggest such approaches.</p>
<p>
4. The authors report a range of synaptic conductance waveforms in time. Not surprisingly, E and I look broadly different. Could the authors comment on the implications of differences in time-course of conductance profiles even within E (or I) synapses? Is this functional or is it an outcome of analysis uncertainty?</p>
<p>One of the challenges in doing such studies in a dish is that the network is simply ticking away without any neural or sensory context to work on, nor any clear idea of what its outputs might mean. Nevertheless, at a single-neuron level one expects that this system might provide a reasonable subset of the kinds of activity an individual cell might have to work on.</p>
<p>5. Could the authors comment on what subsets of network activity is, and is not, likely to be seen in the culture?</p>
<p>
6. Could they indicate what this would mean for the conclusions about E-I summation, if the in-vivo activity follows different dynamics?</p>

<p>The authors had two aims in this study. First, to develop a tool that lets them quantify the synaptic strength and sign of upstream neurons in a large network of cultured neurons. Second, they aimed at disentangling the contributions of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to spike generation.</p>
<p>For the quantification of synaptic currents, their methods allows them to quantify excitatory and inhibitory currents simultaneously, as the sign of the current is determined by the neuron identity in the high-density extracellular recording. They further made sure that their method works for nonstationary firing rates, and they did a simulation to characterize what kind of connections their analysis does not capture. They did not include the possibility of (dendritic) nonlinearities or gap junctions or any kind of homeostatic processes. I see a clear weakness in the way that they quantify their goodness of fit, as they only report the explained variance, while their data are quite nonstationary. It could help to partition the explained variance into frequency bands, to at least separate the effects of a bias in baseline, the (around 100 Hz) band of synaptic frequencies and whatever high-frequency observation noise there may be. Another weak point is their explanation of unexplained variance by potential activation of extrasynaptic receptors without providing evidence. Given that these cultures are not a tissue and diffusion should be really high, this idea could easily be tested by adding a tiny amount of glutamate to the culture media.</p>
<p>For the contributions of excitation and inhibition to neuronal spiking, the authors found a clear reduction of inhibitory inputs and increase of excitation associated with spiking when averaging across many spikes. And interestingly, the inhibition shows a reversal right after a spike and the timescale is faster during higher network activity. While these findings are great and provide further support that their method is working, they stop at this exciting point where I would really have liked to see more detail. A concern, of course is that the network bursts in cultures are quite stereotypical, and that might cause averages across many bursts to show strange behaviour. So what I am missing here is a reference or baseline or null hypothesis. How does it look when using inputs from neurons that are not connected? And then, it looks like the E/(E+I) curve has lots of peaks of similar amplitude (that could be quantified...), so why does the neuron spike where it does? If I would compare to the peak (of similar amplitude) right before or right after (as a reference) are there some systematic changes? Is maybe the inhibition merely defining some general scaffold where spikes can happen and the excitation causes the spike as spiking is more irregular?</p>
<p>
The averaged trace reveals a different timescale for high and low activity states. But does that reflect a superposition of EPSCs in a single trial or rather a different jittering of a single EPSC across trials? For answering this question, it would be good to know the variance (and whether/ how much it changes over time). Maybe not all spikes are preceded by a decrease in inhibition. Could you quantitify (correlate, scatterplot?) how exactly excitation and inhibition contributions relate for single postsynaptic spikes (or single postsynaptic non-spikes)? After all, this would be the kind of detail that requires the large amount of data that this study provides.</p>
<p>For the first part, the authors achieved their goal in developing a tool to study synaptic inputs driving subthreshold activity at the soma, and characterizing such connections. For the second part, they found an effect of EPSCs on firing, but they barely did any quantification of its relevance due to the lack of a reference.</p>
<p>With the availability of Neuropixels probes, there is certainly use for their tool in in vivo applications, and their statistical analysis provides a reference for future studies.</p>
<p>
The relevance of excitatory and inhibitory currents on spiking remains to be seen in an updated version of the manuscript.</p>
<p>I feel that specifically Figures 6 and 7 lack relevant detail and a consistent representation that would allow the reader to establish links between the different panels. The analysis shows very detailed examples, but then jumps into analyses that show population averages over averaged responses, losing or ignoring the variability across trials. In addition, while their results themselves pass a statistical test, it is crucial to establish some measure of how relevant these results are. For that, I would really want to know how much spiking would actually be restricted by the constraints that would be posed by these results, i.e. would this be reflected in tiny changes in spiking probabilities, or are there times when spiking probabilities are necessarily high, or do we see times when we would almost certainly get a spike, but neurons can fire during other times as well.</p>
<p>
I would agree that a detailed, quantitative analysis of this question is beyond the scope of this paper, but a qualitative analysis is feasible and should be done. In the following, I am detailing what I would consider necessary to be done about these two Figures:</p>
<p>Figure 6C is indeed great, though I don't see why the authors would characterize synchrony as low. When comparing with Figure 4B, I'd think that some of these values are quite high. And it wouldn't help me to imagine error bars in panel 6D.</p>
<p>
Figure 6B is useful, but could be done better: The autocovariance of a shotnoise process is a convolution of the autocovariance of underlying point process and the autocovariance of the EPSC kernel. So one would want to separate those to obtain a better temporal resolution. But a shotnoise process has well defined peaks, and the time of these local maxima can be estimated quite precisely. Now if I would do a peak triggered average instead of the full convolution, I would do half of the deconvolution and obtain a temporally asymmetric curve of what is expected to happen around an EPSC. Importantly, one could directly see expected excitation after inhibition or expected inhibition after excitation, and this visualization could be much better and more intuitively compared to panel 6E.</p>
<p>
Panel D needs some variability estimate (i.e. standard deviation or interquartile range or even a probability density) for those traces.</p>
<p>
Figure 6E: Please use more visible colors. A sensitivity analysis to see traces for 2E/(2E+I) and E/(E+2I) would be great.</p>
<p>
Figure 6F: with an updated panel B, we should be able to have a slope for average inhibition after excitation for each of these cells. A second panel / third column showing those slopes would be of interest. It would serve as a reference for what could be expected from E-I interactions alone.</p>
<p>
Figure 6G: Could the authors provide an interquartile range here?</p>
<p>Figure 7A: it may be hard to squeeze in variability estimates here, but the information on whether and how much variance might be explained is essential. Maybe add another panel to provide a variability estimate? The variability estimate in panel 7B and 7D only reflect variability across connections, and it would be useful to add panels for the timecourses of the variability of g (or E/(E+I) respectively).</p>
<p>As a suggestion for further analysis, though I am well aware that this is likely beyond the scope of this manuscript, I'd suggest the following analysis:</p>
<p>
I would split the data into the high and low activity states. Then I would compute the average of E/(E+I) values for spikes. Assuming that spikes tend to happen for local maxima of E/(E+I) I would find local maxima for periods without spike such that their average is equal to the value for actual spikes. Finally, I would test for a systematic difference in either excitation or inhibition.</p>
<p>
If there is no difference, you can make the claim that synaptic input does not guarantee a spike, and compare to a global average of E/(E+I).</p>
