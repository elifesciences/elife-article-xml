<title>Abstract</title><p>Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease, the pathophysiology and genetic basis of which are incompletely understood. Non-receptor tyrosine kinases (NRTKs) regulate activation, migration, and proliferation of immune cells. We report compound heterozygous deleterious variants in the kinase domains of the non-receptor tyrosine kinases (NRTK) TNK2/ACK1 in one multiplex family and PTK6/BRK in another. Experimental blockade of mouse ACK1 or BRK increases glomerular IgG deposits and circulating autoantibodies in an <italic>in vivo</italic> SLE model. In addition, we found that the patients’ ACK and BRK variants impair efferocytosis, the MERTK-mediated anti-inflammatory response to apoptotic cells, in human induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (hiPSC)-derived macrophages. Overall, our data suggest that ACK1 and BRK deficiencies are associated with human SLE and impair efferocytosis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune rheumatic disease, characterized by the presence of circulating autoantibodies against nuclear antigens. Clinical manifestations vary among affected individuals and can involve many organs and systems, including the skin, joints, kidneys, heart, lungs, nervous system, and hematopoietic system <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. The prevalence of SLE ranges from 0.4 to 2 /1,000, and varies with sex, age, and ancestry, being more common in women of childbearing age and individuals of African, Asian, and Hispanic ancestry <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Sex, hormones, and environmental factors, including drugs and chemical exposures, viral infections, and sunlight, contribute to disease. At present specific therapies for SLE are few and far between <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, and clinical manifestations such as lupus nephritis, one of the most common and serious manifestations of SLE, remain a major risk factor for morbidity and mortality <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. The contribution of genetics to SLE is supported by epidemiological data showing familial aggregation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> and higher concordance rates between monozygotic than dizygotic twins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, the association of autosomal recessive deficiency in PKCdelta or DNAse1L3 with familial SLE, and similar phenotypes in the corresponding mouse models <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. In addition, genome wide association studies in large populations of patients have implicated a number of genes associated with immune system function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, and an SLE-like disease is observed in a proportion of patients with immunodeficiency due to autosomal recessive or X-linked C1q, C1r/s, C2, C4, and NADPH-Oxidase deficiencies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, with Rasopathies due to autosomal dominant gain-of-function mutations in the RAS pathway <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, and a proportion of patients presenting with interferonopathies with bi-allelic or mono-allelic mutations in genes coding for nucleic acid sensors such as TREX1, STING, SAMHD1, ADAR, and IFIH1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Here, we performed a forward genetic screen in multiplex SLE families with a well-defined phenotype, lupus nephritis, to identify new SLE causing genes and molecular pathways involved in SLE. We report the characterization of novel and rare deleterious variant alleles of two genes encoding the non-receptor tyrosine kinases (NRTK) Tyrosine Kinase Non-Receptor 2 / Activated CDC42 kinase 1 (TNK2/ACK1) and Protein Tyrosine Kinase 6 / Breast Tumor Kinase (PTK6/BRK) in two multiplex families. The variant alleles strongly decrease ACK1 and BRK kinase activity. BRK and ACK1 were shown to control B-cell and T-cell proliferation, survival, and activation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Although ACK1-and BRK-genetic deficiency <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> or their pharmacological inhibition does not result in spontaneous lupus development in mice, we show that ACK1 or BRK inhibitors aggravate IgG glomerular deposition in the kidneys of BALB/cByJ mice treated with pristane to induce a lupus-like disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> and increases serum autoantibody levels. NRTKs mediate phosphorylation of downstream effectors, including RAC1, AKT, and STAT1/3, which are involved in immune cells homeostasis, and their deficiency can cause autoimmunity through different mechanisms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. NRTKs such as ACK1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, Src <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, and PTK2/FAK <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> are also targets of MERTK, which mediates efferocytosis, the recognition of phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) on apoptotic cells for their anti-inflammatory engulfment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. MERTK deficiency is a cause of SLE-like disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. We found that the patients’ ACK1 and BRK variants are kinase dead in response to MERTK activation and fail to phosphorylate AKT and STAT3, and to activate RAC1. Human iPSC-derived macrophages from patients and isogenic variants presented with defective AKT/STAT3 driven anti-inflammatory response and control of TNF and IL1b production in response to apoptotic cells and had a modest decrease in uptake of apoptotic cells, in comparison to familial and isogenic controls. In contrast, ACK and BRK kinase activity are dispensable for the phagocytosis of polystyrene beads, opsonized cells, and microbes. These results altogether suggest that ACK1 and BRK deficiencies underlie SLE in the two families, and that a defective efferocytic response to apoptotic cells may contribute to the auto-immune phenotype of the patients.</p>

<title>NRTK compound heterozygous missense variants in two multiplex families with SLE</title>
<p>We recruited 10 multiplex SLE families, each with 2 or 3 individuals diagnosed with biopsy confirmed lupus nephritis, classified according to the SLICC criteria <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> for whom we obtained genomic DNA (blood) in the Louise Coote Lupus Clinic at Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospitals, London. We collected peripheral blood from a total of 22 patients and 17 relatives. Thirty five percent (%) of patients were male, and the same proportion were diagnosed before the age of 18 years. Genomic DNA was submitted to whole exome sequencing.

We analyzed each kindred independently, under X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, or autosomal recessive models of inheritance, and this analysis identified candidate genes in two kindreds.</p>
<p>In Family 1, we identified compound heterozygous missense variants in the non-receptor tyrosine kinase (NRTK) ACK1, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref rid="figs1a" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1</xref></bold>). The 2 patients were males and developed a class IV lupus nephritis between age 10-15. The K161Q allele was inherited from one parent and A156T from the other (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>). Principal components analysis (PCA) based on the whole-exome sequencing to analyze population structure, parental inbreeding, and familial linkage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> reveals South Asian ancestry, the closest 1,000 Genomes Project individuals being those from North India (India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, see Methods). The ACK1 mutant alleles, A156T and K161Q (transcript ENST00000333602, <bold><xref rid="figs1a" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1</xref></bold>), have not been reported in South Asian (31,442 alleles) or other populations from public database (gnomAD, 1,000 genomes project) or our own in-house databases of &gt;10,000 exomes of patients with infectious phenotypes. Finally, these variants were not found in DNA from 100 individuals from the small south eastern island from which they originated (see Methods). Altogether, ACK1 mutant alleles, A156T and K161Q are private to this family and their segregation is compatible with an autosomal recessive trait with complete penetrance.</p>

<p>In Family 2, we identified compound heterozygous missense variants in another NRTK, BRK in three siblings (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref rid="figs1a" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1</xref></bold>). Two patients developed lupus nephritis, and the third patient developed a severe panniculitis, between the ages of 20 and 30 year-old. Two patients were female and one male. One parent, who was not genotyped, probably transmitted the G321R to their children, and the 2 other parents (who are also siblings) transmitted the G257A allele (only one parent was available for genotyping) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref rid="figs1b" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2</xref></bold>). An unaffected sibling (2.III.2) carries the G321R allele but not the G257A allele (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref rid="figs1b" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2</xref></bold>). PCA analysis showed that individuals from family 2 have Sub-Saharan African ancestry, with the closest populations of 1,000 genomes project being African Caribbean in Barbados and African Ancestry in Southwest US and Luhya in Webuye in Kenya (see Methods). These 2 BRK mutant alleles, G257A and G321R are reported with a maximum MAF of ∼ 8×10<sup>-5</sup> and 5×10<sup>-3</sup> respectively in Sub-Saharan African subpopulations (<bold><xref rid="figs1a" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1</xref></bold>), predicting a homozygosity frequency of ∼ 10<sup>-8</sup> and 10<sup>-6</sup> respectively. These alleles are extremely rare outside Africa in the non-African gnomAD populations. These results are fully consistent under a recessive model with the overall prevalence of SLE (40 to 200 per 100,000 individuals). Genes that may cause SLE with high or low penetrance in accordance with their inheritance mode (<bold><xref rid="figs1c" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 3</xref></bold>) were not candidates in these kindreds.</p>

<p>ACK1 and BRK sequences are highly conserved in human populations, when compared with other species (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>). Apart from the alleles we report here, only 90 and 35 predicted loss of function (LOF) alleles are reported in gnomAD for ACK1 or BRK respectively, with MAFs ≤ 10<sup>-4</sup>, and none of them reported in homozygosity. Conversely, we examined the <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase activity of ACK1 mutants with a MAF≥0.005 and reported as homozygous in gnomAD (n=4). <italic>In vitro</italic> kinase activity of these variants was normal (<bold><xref rid="figs2b" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 2</xref></bold>). There was no BRK mutant with MAF≥0.005 reported as homozygous in gnomAD. Thus, autosomal recessive deficiency for either protein, whether complete or partial, is expected to be well below 1/100,000 in the general population, which is compatible with autosomal recessive ACK1 and BRK deficiencies underlying SLE in patients from these two kindreds.</p>

MERTK-deficient mice are susceptible to LPS-induced endotoxic shock <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref></sup>, and MERTK-dependent anti-inflammatory program elicited by apoptotic cells on macrophages is best evidenced by the reduction of LPS-mediated production of inflammatory mediators such as TNF or IL-1b <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref></sup>. We thus tested the decrease of LPS-induced production of TNF and IL1b by apoptotic cells. For this purpose, we generated isogenic variants and control hiPSCs and hiPSCs-derived macrophages from the same donor (<bold><xref rid="figs3a" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1</xref></bold>). Both isogenic variants and control macrophages produced similar amounts of TNF in response to LPS (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref></bold>). However, exposure to apoptotic cells inhibited TNF production in isogenic macrophages by 50% but did not inhibit TNF production in ACK1 and BRK-deficient macrophages (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref></bold>). Similarly, isogenic variants and control macrophages produced similar amounts of IL1b in response to LPS (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref></bold>), but apoptotic cells only decreased IL1b production by isogenic macrophages and not by mutant macrophages (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref></bold>). These data altogether indicate that ACK1 and BRK kinase activities contribute to the macrophage anti-inflammatory response during efferocytosis and are required for the decrease of TNF and IL1b production induced by LPS in response to apoptotic cells, a hallmark of their anti-inflammatory effect on macrophages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup>.</p>

We assessed actin-ring formation by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy in frustrated apoptotic engulfment assays on PtdSer-coated glass slides. Wild-type iPSC-derived macrophages formed a typical actin-ring, however isogenic ACK1 and BRK mutant macrophages presented with an altered actin-ring (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold>), and a reduced actin clearance factor (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>), indicating an impairment of actin remodeling following binding to PtdSer. The actin-ring was also altered and actin clearance factor was decreased in WT macrophages treated with ACK1 and BRK inhibitors in comparison to controls (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C,D</xref></bold>).

<p>We therefore investigated whether this defect translated to a reduced uptake of apoptotic cells by macrophages. We found that engulfment of apoptotic thymocytes labeled with the pH sensitive probe pHrodo <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref></sup> was only moderately reduced, by 10 to 20% in ACK1 and BRK isogenic mutant macrophages (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>)</bold>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we combined whole exome sequencing and forward genetic analysis in multiplex SLE families, with a biochemical analysis of genetic variants, murine studies, and functional approaches in human iPSC-derived macrophages to identify novel genes the mutations of which may underlie SLE. In two unrelated families, we identified compound heterozygous loss-of-function or hypomorph variants in the kinase domains of two non-receptors tyrosine kinases, TNK2/ACK1 and PTK6/BRK. Patients from the two families were children or young adults and presented with a severe clinical form of SLE, lupus nephritis. However, we analyzed 27 GWAS studies of SLE (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gwascentral.org/">https://www.gwascentral.org/</ext-link>), and none of them reported a common variant in the close vicinity of the TNK2/ACK1 or PTK6/BRK genes with a p-value lower than 5×10<sup>-8</sup>, a statistical threshold of genome-wide significance for GWAS. ACK1 and BRK deficiency are thus likely to only account for the genetic basis of SLE in a minority of patients. Nevertheless, ACK1 and BRK kinase inhibitors aggravate autoimmunity and IgG glomerular deposits in pristane-treated BALB/cByJ mice. Altogether, the present data indicate that autosomal recessive TNK2/ACK1 and PTK6/BRK kinase deficiency probably underlie the development of SLE in a small proportion of children and young adults, depending on genetic and environmental context.</p>
<p>Defective efferocytosis has been shown to contribute to autoimmunity in mice and is relevant to the pathogenesis of SLE <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup>. Our results also suggest that TNK2/ACK1 and PTK6/BRK kinase deficiencies, in addition to dysregulating B and T cell survival and activation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, also impairs the MERTK-dependent anti-inflammatory response of the patients’ macrophages to apoptotic cells during efferocytosis, and to a lesser extent the engulfment of the apoptotic cells. Mertk-dependent engulfment of apoptotic cells and anti-inflammatory response were shown to be distinct and separable <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref></sup>. The NRTK PTK2/FAK and Src are important for the former <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">105</xref></sup>, while PTK2/FAK is dispensable for the latter <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Our experiments suggest that in contrast, TNK2/ACK1 and PTK6/BRK are more important for the control of TNF and IL1b production than for engulfment itself. Altogether, our observations identify a rare Mendelian cause of severe SLE and a role for the NRTK TNK2/ACK1 and PTK6/BRK in efferocytosis, thereby contributing to a molecular and cellular dissection of SLE.</p>

<p>The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of St Thomas’ Hospital; Guy’s hospital; the King’s College London University and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. All subject samples were obtained after written informed consent from patients and their families according to the Helsinki convention (Ethics approval: 11/LO/1433). Ten multiplex families with lupus have been enrolled from Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Hospital in London, UK from July 2010 to January 2012, following stringent criteria: a severe phenotype (lupus nephritis for at least 1 patient in each family), and a familial disease (≥2 family members affected in first degree). A total of 24 patients and 17 healthy controls from different ethnic origins (5 African ancestry, 4 Asian ancestry and 1 European ancestry) were selected. The patients each met the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) classification criteria for SLE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Lupus nephritis was confirmed by a kidney biopsy classified per the 2004 ISN/RPS (International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society) classification and verified independently by 2 renal histopathologists.</p>
<p>One hundred Mauritian participants were enrolled under the Ethical Clearance provided by the University of Mauritius Research Ethics Committee. Written consent with due signatures was recorded from all participants prior to partaking in the study.

<title>Genetic analysis</title>
<p>Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) of the 10 multiplex families (patients and familial healthy controls) was performed at the New York Genomics Centre on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing machine. Genomic DNA extracted from the patients and familial healthy control’s peripheral blood cells were sheared with a Covaris S2 Ultrasonicator. An adapter-ligated library was prepared with the Paired-End Sample Prep kit V1 (Illumina). Exome capture was performed with the SureSelect Human All Exon kit (Agilent Technologies). Paired-end sequencing was performed on a HiSeq 2000, generating 100-base reads. For sequence alignment, variant calling and annotation, we used BWA aligner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">106</xref></sup> to align sequences with the human genome reference sequence (hg19 build). Downstream processing was performed with the Genome analysis toolkit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">107</xref></sup>, SAMtools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">108</xref></sup>, and Picard Tools. Substitution and indel calls were identified with a GATK Unified Genotyper and a GATK Indel GenotyperV2, respectively. All calls with a read coverage ≤2x and a Phred-scaled SNP quality of ≤20 were filtered out. All the variants were annotated with the GATK Genomic Annotator. Variants were annotated following their minor allele frequency (MAF) in Exome Variant Server, 1,000 Genomes Project, and Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), including the MAF in each ethnic subpopulation from gnomAD.</p>
<p>First, the variants have been prioritized at the gene level. We used the gene damage index (<italic>GDI</italic>) which provides the accumulated mutational damage of each human gene in healthy human population, based on the 1,000 Genomes Project database (Phase 3) gene variations of healthy individuals and of the CADD score for calculating impact<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">109</xref></sup>. GDI is very effective to filter out variants harbored in highly damaged (high GDI) genes that are unlikely to be disease-causing.</p>
<p>We used a cut-off of 13.84, the recommended GDI value above which a gene is unlikely to be disease-causing which is the 95% CI upper boundary value, removing 5% of the genes in our analysis.</p>
<p>Secondly, we prioritized variants at the allele level. We excluded variants that were too frequent in our in-house database to explain the disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">110</xref></sup>. We then filtered out variants based on the predicted damaging impacts. The deleteriousness of each variant was assessed using in silico algorithms: CADD (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cadd.gs.washington.edu/score">http://cadd.gs.washington.edu/score</ext-link>) and Mutation Significance Cutoff browser (MSC, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pec630.rockefeller.edu/MSC/">http://pec630.rockefeller.edu/MSC/</ext-link>). MSC scores were generated using 99% confidence interval based on the CADD 1.3 scores of all disease causing-mutations in Human Gene Mutation Database for any given gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. We kept only the variants with a CADD/MSC higher than 1.</p>
<p>We thus analyzed our WES with the remaining variants by keeping all non-synonymous coding variants and essential splice site variants with a MAF according to the genetic model: 1) heterozygous variations with MAF &lt;10<sup>-4</sup> in all ethnic subpopulations under an autosomal dominant (AD) model; 2) homozygous or compound heterozygous variants with MAF &lt;10<sup>-2</sup> in all ethnic subpopulations) under an autosomal recessive (AR) model; and 3) hemizygous (male) or homozygous (female) variations with MAF &lt;10<sup>-4</sup> in all ethnic subpopulations under X-linked genetic models.</p>

<title>Differentiation of iPSCs-derived macrophages</title>
<p>The hiPSCs to macrophage differentiation method was adapted from a previously published protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Briefly, newly passaged iPSCs were maintained from day 0 to day 3 in ESC media (see human iPSCs culture) with 10 ng/ml bFGF and from day 3 to day 7 in ESC media without bFGF. At day 7, iPSCs colonies were detached in clusters using collagenase type IV (250 UI/ml final concentration) (ThermoFisher Scientific; 17104019) and transferred to 6 well suspension plates in ESC media supplemented with 10 μM ROCK Inhibitor (Sigma; Y0503), on an orbital shaker at 100 rpm. The cell clusters were cultivated under these conditions from day 7 to day 13 to induce embryoid body (EB) formation. At day 13, well formed 200-500 μm EBs were manually picked under a microscope and transferred onto adherent tissue culture plates (∼2.5 EBs/cm<sup>2</sup>) for cultivation in APEL 2 medium (Stem Cell Tech; 05270) supplemented with 5% protein free hybridoma (ThermoFisher Scientific; 12040077), 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (ThermoFisher Scientific; 15140-122), 25 ng/ml human IL-3 (Peprotech; 200-03) and 50 ng/ml human M-CSF (Peprotech, 300-25).

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors report compound heterozygous deleterious variants in the kinase domains of the non-receptor tyrosine kinases (NRTK) TNK2/ACK1 in familial SLE. They suggest that ACK1 and BRK deficiencies are associated with human SLE and impair efferocytosis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The identification of similar mutations in non-receptor tyrosine kinases (NRTKs) in two different families with familial SLE is a significant finding in human disease. Furthermore, the paper provides a detailed analysis of the molecular mechanisms behind the impairment of efferocytosis caused by mutations in ACK1 and BRK.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A critical point in this paper is whether the loss of function of ACK1 or BRK contributes to the onset of familial SLE. The authors emphasize that inhibitors of ACK1/BRK worsened IgG deposition in the kidneys in a pristane-induced SLE model, which contributes not to the onset but to the exacerbation of SLE, thus only partially supporting their claim.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors revealed that genetic deficiencies of ACK1 and BRK are associated with human SLE. First, the authors found that compound heterozygous deleterious variants in the kinase domains of the non-receptor tyrosine kinases (NRTK) TNK2/ACK1 in one multiplex family and PTK6/BRK in another family. Then, by an experimental blockade of ACK1 or BRK in a mouse SLE model, they found an increase in glomerular IgG deposits and circulating autoantibodies. Furthermore, they reported that ACK and BRK variants from the SLE patients impaired the MERTK-mediated anti-inflammatory response to apoptotic cells in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC)-derived macrophages. This work identified new SLE-associated ACK and BRK variants and a role for the NRTK TNK2/ACK1 and PTK6/BRK in efferocytosis, providing a new molecular and cellular mechanism of SLE pathogenesis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work identified new SLE-associated ACK and BRK variants and a role for the NRTK TNK2/ACK1 and PTK6/BRK in efferocytosis, providing a new molecular and cellular mechanism of SLE pathogenesis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although the manuscript is well-organized and clearly stated, there are some points below that should be considered:</p>
<p>* In this study, the authors used forward genetic analyses to identify novel gene mutations that may cause SLE, combined with GWAS studies of SLE. To further explore the importance of these variants, haplotype analysis of two candidate genes could be performed, to observe the evolution and selection relationship of candidate genes in the population (UK 1000 biobank, for example).</p>
<p>* Although the authors focused on SLE and macrophage efferocytosis in their studies, direct evidence of how macrophage efferocytosis significantly affects SLE is lacking. This point should at least be explicitly introduced and discussed by citing appropriate literature.</p>
<p>* It is still not clear how the target molecules identified in this paper may influence macrophage efferocytosis. More direct evidence should be established.</p>
<p>* For some transcriptional repressors mentioned in their studies, the authors should check whether there is clear experimental evidence. If not, it is recommended to supplement the experimental verifications for clarity.</p>
<p>* In Figures 4C and 4D, it is seen that the usage of inhibitors causes cytoskeletal changes, however this reviewer would not have expected such large change. Did the authors check whether the cells die after heavy treatment by the inhibitors?</p>
